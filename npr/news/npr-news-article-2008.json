No matter how carefully you put these things away, when you take them out again they're hopelessly knotted up. So this week on Science Out of the Box, we investigate the hows and whys of knots. (Soundbite of music) SEABROOK: Douglas Smith is a psychics professor at the University of California in San Diego, and he's just published a paper on this thorny, or should I say, knotty problem. Hi there, Douglas Smith. Professor DOUGLAS SMITH (Physics, University of California, San Diego): Hi. SEABROOK: So why does my jewelry knot itself up whenever I put it away? Prof. SMITH: Well, you might call it a kind of an example of Murphy's Law. But we, you know, we have done kind of specific scientific studies to try to answer this question. We got interested in this because - actually one of my students was interested in mathematical field of knot theory. So mathematicians have kind of been thinking about knots for a very long time, for over a hundred years, but it kind of occurred to us that, you know, knots in the real world and the physics of how knots actually come to form - so annoyingly often, you know, in life - hadn't really been well studied. SEABROOK: So what did you find? Prof. SMITH: Well, we basically did experiments, and we found that just a little bit of kind of random jostling motion would very quickly tend to get a piece of string knotted. And - then, there are also many, many different kinds of knots that can form increasingly complex. We put a length of string in a box and we kind of spun the box the way the drum of your clothes dryer would spin and tumble your socks. We tumbled a piece of string and we kind of watched it and asked how long does it take to become knotted, how does that depend on, you know, how many times you rotate the box and the length of the string and the flexibility of the string and this. So we did - we tried to very carefully control the experiment to understand the phenomena. SEABROOK: And you're not just playing around here with knots? These are not - this is not sort of a Boy Scout endeavor. You're actually trying to understand, as I gather, something about more organic things - DNA, proteins. Prof. SMITH: Well, that's right. On the one hand, you can think of it as a kind of a fun, little physics project that a sort of nerdy physicist would like to do that's how\u2026 SEABROOK: Nerdy physicist. No. Prof. SMITH: Oh, yes. That's - you know, we definitely are. But on the other hand, there are real life situations where you have this. And so, one of the things that we were interested in is the tendency of DNA molecules, which are essentially also strings, just very tiny strings inside your body to get tangled and knotted and sometimes that has serious consequences, like when a cell copies its DNA and is going to try to divide into two cells. If the two copies of the DNA get themselves tangled or knotted, then those two sells can't divide. And we could try to jump to studying DNA but it's difficult. So we thought to ourselves, well, there's nobody really even understands how a common piece of string ends up getting in a knot, we better try to understand that first and then move on, you know, potentially later to look at DNA. SEABROOK: Not so really a basic human problem. They're really kind of universal. Prof. SMITH: People seem to have fascination with them, believe it or not. (Soundbite of laughter) SEABROOK: Douglas Smith is an assistant professor of physics at the University of California in San Diego. He and his student, Dorian Raymer, published this paper called \"Spontaneous Knotting of an Agitated String. \" Thanks so much for talking with us. Prof. SMITH: Thank you.

It literally looks like a bomb went off. And cars are completely demolished on top of each other. And just, I can't really explain it. Like it really looks like a bomb went off. CHADWICK: Well, tell me what you did last night when this tornado was coming on. Ms. SMITH: Well, I live in the top dorm, and they sent us down to the dorm below us. And we were all messing around 'cause we didn't think it would really hit. And so the windows started shaking, and we were like oh no. And this girl opens the door to the bottom dorm and said, y'all, it sounds like a train's coming for us. So we ran in the bathroom, and we all got in the bathroom, crouching down. And as the door was closing the tornado took off the wall to the bottom dorm. It was unbelievable, but we just prayed. And we knew God was sovereign, and he was going to take care of us and what was going to happen is his sovereign will. And we trusted in that. CHADWICK: Well, it's great that you had faith and prayer, but are you saying that the wall of the building peeled away while you were there in the bathroom? Ms. SMITH: Yes, sir. CHADWICK: Did you see it happen? Ms. SMITH: I saw a glimpse of it. I saw the window smash out and I saw some of the wall leaving as we were shutting the bathroom door. 'Cause like I said, we were just messing around. We didn't think anything was gonna really happen until we heard the train, 'cause that's what it sounds like, a train. CHADWICK: Well, it still sounds windy there. Tell me, what happened after this wall was peeled away. What did you do? Ms. SMITH: We just got out and kind of surveyed the damage and tried to figure out what happened. CHADWICK: Was anyone hurt? Ms. SMITH: I mean nothing serious. We heard people were trapped under stuff, but I mean we got 'em out and we all went to the Penick Academic Building and stood there. CHADWICK: How many students were around you? Ms. SMITH: Oh, it was most of the student body, most of the people in the dorms. They got us out pretty quick, unless they were trapped, and took us into Penick Academic Building. CHADWICK: So that's 1200 people or so at the school? Ms. SMITH: Yes, sir. CHADWICK: And you're all huddled together there at one building. Ms. SMITH: Yes, sir. CHADWICK: That's still standing. And what happened then? Ms. SMITH: We just sat there and waited. We all got in classrooms. All the guys moved the desks out of the classroom. And we sat and waited until faculty came and picked some students up. I had some friends pick me up. CHADWICK: And where did you go for the night? Your dorm is destroyed, I guess. Ms. SMITH: Yes. I stayed at my - with my youth minister and his family. CHADWICK: Well, now today, what's the situation? What are you all doing there today? Ms. SMITH: We're at Union right now trying to figure out if they'll let us in or not. And I don't think they're going to let us in the dorm rooms. They said they were, but someone told us to clear out. So when I get done, I'll have to figure out whether they're letting us in or not. See if I can get any of my stuff and if my car's okay. CHADWICK: Does your room even still exist in that dorm, and what are you going to look for there? Ms. SMITH: I'm going to look for the Winnie the Pooh that I sleep with, 'cause that's really the only thing that's irreplaceable. Everything else, my laptop and car keys and everything can be replaced. And that is the only thing that I really care about. I mean we're just all lucky we're alive.

I'm Melissa Block. MICHELE NORRIS, Host: And I'm Michele Norris. One year ago this week, the U. S. launched the surge in Iraq. The goal was to crack down on a growing insurgency and to create enough breathing space for Iraq's fledging government to advance. There's much debate over that surge has worked, and what lessons the U. S. military should take form the experience. John Nagl has spent a lot of time thinking about the U. S. should deal with insurgence. Nagl is an Army lieutenant colonel and an expert on counterinsurgency. He's now retiring from the Army and moving to Washington, D. C. to work with a think tank called the Center for a New American Security. He spent time in Iraq in Anbar province. And back home, he's been training soldiers to teach and support Afghan and Iraqi forces. Nagl says winning a war against an insurgency is possible, but it takes an unconventional war strategy. JOHN NAGL: The key to success is protecting the population. You cannot kill or capture your way to victory in a counterinsurgency campaign, whatever underlying social concerns led to an insurgency developing will reemerge unless you find a way to solve those base problems. So you conduct some combat operations against identified insurgents certainly, but you also train and develop host nation security forces, which is what I'm doing now here are Fort Riley. You establishment a government that can meet the needs of all the people. You provide essential services to the population, and you do that all wrapped up in a tight information operations campaign that tries win the support of the people and show that, ultimately, your side is going to win and your side has the best interest of the population at heart. NORRIS: People will be studying these words for years to come in trying to figure out the lessons. But from your vantage point right now as you prepare to retire, move back to D. C. , work for a think tank, what do you take with you? What are the key lessons for you in this conflict? NAGL: The United States unfortunately did not remember the lessons that were learned in Vietnam. It turned away from insurgency. We decided that we weren't going to fight counterinsurgency campaigns anymore. But unfortunately, the enemy has a vote, and our very conventional military superiority has driven our enemies both in Iraq and in Afghanistan to fight as insurgents. I think, perhaps, the primary lesson of those two wars is that this is the way our enemies are going to fight us for the foreseeable future. Until we demonstrate that we're just as good at counterinsurgency as we are at conventional warfare, our enemies are going to go where we're comparatively weak. NORRIS: You know, as you're talking about the U. S. now confronting counterinsurgencies from this point forward, that this becomes sort of a standard pro - standard combat protocol instead of unconventional combat, what is the U. S. need to brace itself for? Because we're talking about wars that are long and protracted and drawn out and very, very difficult - a very, very difficult kind of engagement. NAGL: You know, that's exactly right, Michele. The average counterinsurgency campaign takes about a decade. So these are long, hard, slow wars. They require sustained popular support, and they need a real appreciation from the American people of - first of the chances for success. Historically, only about 4o percent of insurgencies have been successful. About 60 percent of the time, insurgencies fail, counterinsurgence win. So it is not impossible to win this kind of war, but it does take sustained public support and public opinion. NORRIS: I heard you say that a typical battle against an insurgency is usually drawn out over a decade. What does that mean for our current involvement in Iraq? NAGL: Well, we're about six years into a counterinsurgency campaign in Afghanistan, we're about five years in in Iraq. So history suggests that we're approaching the halfway point in both campaigns. NORRIS: Now, I got to stop you there because you're talking about a halfway point. And listening to what the candidates are talking about in the campaign, at least on one side, they're talking about pulling people home immediately or within the next year. There are proposals to reduce the number of forces we have committed to the campaign in Iraq, and conceivably to send more forces to the counterinsurgency campaign in Afghanistan. And people advocating those modes include - in my understanding - the Joint Staff and Secretary Gates has publicly said that - the secretary of defense has publicly said that he would like to reduce the number of forces in Iraq below the number that's currently planned after the surge will be down to 15 brigades, about 130,000 troops. And many people in the administration would like to pull that down to about 100,000 if the situation on the ground allows. And I'm hopeful that it will. As, again, as we continue to implement a more effective counterinsurgency campaign. NORRIS: You know what, what I was asking - if I can interrupt, sir, and I'm sorry doing it. . . NAGL: Sure. No. NORRIS: . . . but when you talk about being halfway through what could be a ten-year battle against the insurgency, when we hear candidates here in the U. S. talk about a very quick withdrawal of troops from Iraq, is that realistic based on the lessons that you're talking about? And. . . NAGL: Some candidates are speaking about more rapid withdrawal than others. All agree, I think, that we need to reduce our commitment of forces to Iraq partly to provide more forces to serve in Afghanistan, partly to reduce the strain on the force. And certainly, the Army is feeling the strain of its deployment in Afghanistan, Afghanistan and Iraq as are the Marines. But I think anyone who understands the history of counterinsurgency campaigns and who understands where we are in the campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan - particularly in Iraq -understands that we have some momentum there that we are slowly building a government that can stand on its own, that can provide security for the people of Iraq and can be ultimately, hopefully, a security provider rather than a net importer of security. And the second and third order of facts of two precipitate in American withdrawal of forces from Iraq would be catastrophic in my eyes. So any withdrawal of troops I think has to be based on conditions on the ground. And I see an ability to do that with an increasing focus on advisory efforts, which is traditionally how counterinsurgency campaigns are won. Counterinsurgencies campaigns are won by local forces, enabled by advisers - embedded advisers. And I think that's the direction we're going to go over the next several years. A still substantial tens of thousands, possibly, for several more years, number of advisers, but the frontlines of fighting will be done by the Iraqis. NORRIS: Why did you decide to retire at this time? NAGL: Mm-hmm. Absolutely the hardest decision I've ever made, Michele. I love being an Army officer. But the hardest job in the Army isn't being a soldier; it's being married to one. And for the past 16 years, my wife who's a student of our history and language and literature, and she's been following me around. And, really, we put her life on hold. And I'm at a point in my life now where I can give her some of the things that she's wanted and give my family some of the things that I feel they deserve. I'm coming to terms with that. I'm staring to feel pretty good about it. And I'm starting to think about what I'm going to do when I have to chose what clothes I'm going to put on every morning. NORRIS: Well, all the best to you and your family. And good luck in this next chapter of your career. NAGL: Well, Michele, thanks very much. It's a pleasure talking with you again. NORRIS: Lt. Col. John Nagl is retiring from the Army to work at the Center for a New American Security. BLOCK: This is NPR, National Public Radio. MELISSA BLOCK, Host:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Melissa Block. MICHELE NORRIS, Host:  And I'm Michele Norris. One year ago this week, the U. S. launched the surge in Iraq. The goal was to crack down on a growing insurgency and to create enough breathing space for Iraq's fledging government to advance. There's much debate over that surge has worked, and what lessons the U. S. military should take form the experience. John Nagl has spent a lot of time thinking about the U. S. should deal with insurgence. Nagl is an Army lieutenant colonel and an expert on counterinsurgency. He's now retiring from the Army and moving to Washington, D. C. to work with a think tank called the Center for a New American Security. He spent time in Iraq in Anbar province. And back home, he's been training soldiers to teach and support Afghan and Iraqi forces. Nagl says winning a war against an insurgency is possible, but it takes an unconventional war strategy. JOHN NAGL: The key to success is protecting the population. You cannot kill or capture your way to victory in a counterinsurgency campaign, whatever underlying social concerns led to an insurgency developing will reemerge unless you find a way to solve those base problems. So you conduct some combat operations against identified insurgents certainly, but you also train and develop host nation security forces, which is what I'm doing now here are Fort Riley. You establishment a government that can meet the needs of all the people. You provide essential services to the population, and you do that all wrapped up in a tight information operations campaign that tries win the support of the people and show that, ultimately, your side is going to win and your side has the best interest of the population at heart. NORRIS: People will be studying these words for years to come in trying to figure out the lessons. But from your vantage point right now as you prepare to retire, move back to D. C. , work for a think tank, what do you take with you? What are the key lessons for you in this conflict? NAGL: The United States unfortunately did not remember the lessons that were learned in Vietnam. It turned away from insurgency. We decided that we weren't going to fight counterinsurgency campaigns anymore. But unfortunately, the enemy has a vote, and our very conventional military superiority has driven our enemies both in Iraq and in Afghanistan to fight as insurgents. I think, perhaps, the primary lesson of those two wars is that this is the way our enemies are going to fight us for the foreseeable future. Until we demonstrate that we're just as good at counterinsurgency as we are at conventional warfare, our enemies are going to go where we're comparatively weak. NORRIS: You know, as you're talking about the U. S. now confronting counterinsurgencies from this point forward, that this becomes sort of a standard pro - standard combat protocol instead of unconventional combat, what is the U. S. need to brace itself for? Because we're talking about wars that are long and protracted and drawn out and very, very difficult - a very, very difficult kind of engagement. NAGL: You know, that's exactly right, Michele. The average counterinsurgency campaign takes about a decade. So these are long, hard, slow wars. They require sustained popular support, and they need a real appreciation from the American people of - first of the chances for success. Historically, only about 4o percent of insurgencies have been successful. About 60 percent of the time, insurgencies fail, counterinsurgence win. So it is not impossible to win this kind of war, but it does take sustained public support and public opinion. NORRIS: I heard you say that a typical battle against an insurgency is usually drawn out over a decade. What does that mean for our current involvement in Iraq? NAGL: Well, we're about six years into a counterinsurgency campaign in Afghanistan, we're about five years in in Iraq. So history suggests that we're approaching the halfway point in both campaigns. NORRIS: Now, I got to stop you there because you're talking about a halfway point.

I'm Michele Norris. MELISSA BLOCK, host: And I'm Melissa Block. Attorney General Michael Mukasey landed in Iraq this morning for an unannounced visit. NPR's Ari Shapiro spoke with Mukasey on that flight, an extended conversation about Mukasey's first three months on the job. ARI SHAPIRO: When Michael Mukasey was nominated to be attorney general, it was hard to find anyone who would criticize his work as a federal judge in New York. Today, as Mukasey acknowledges, critics are more abundant. Mr. MICHAEL MUKASEY (U. S. Attorney General, Justice Department): I was told early on in this process there will be editorials and I sometimes violate that. I read them. In some ways, it seems almost that they've been written for some other person. SHAPIRO: Those editorials have slammed Mukasey for is stance on waterboarding more than any other issue. He says CIA interrogators don't use the practice of controlled drowning now. And if the CIA wants to do it in a future, Mukasey and others will have to decide whether it's legal. But today, he won't reach that conclusion. Mukasey says he doesn't know why this one issue has become such a singular focus for the country. Mr. MUKASEY: But in a way it's not surprising that having been told repeatedly after September 11 you go back to leading your life, the country has gone back to leading its life. And one thing that concerns people - and should concern them - is the propriety or lack of it of what that government does. SHAPIRO: Mukasey has said he finds waterboarding personally repugnant, and that he might consider torture if done to him. But on the same flight to Baghdad he told me that would me that would not affect his consideration of whether it is a legal interrogation technique. Because in the context of a CIA interrogation, he said it would be used on very different in very different circumstances. Mukasey quoted CIA director Michael Hayden's statement that out of a large number of terrorism detainees, 100 were subjected to coerced interrogation techniques. Mr. MUKASEY: And of those three were waterboarding. So these are people who self select their ability to resist the technique. SHAPIRO: Congress has passed laws in the last few years that Mukasey says could relate specifically to waterboarding - the Military Commissions Act and Detainee Treatment Act, for example. But I pointed out the president has asserted the right to ignore laws past by Congress using his commander in chief powers under Article 2 of the Constitution. Mukasey said he doesn't think that's a serious threat. Mr. MUKASEY: The question of conflict between the president's Article 2 powers and statute is one that I think to a large extent is overblown. SHAPIRO: Plus, he said, if the president decides to ignore a law that appears to outlaw waterboarding and authorize the technique, there are other problems. Mr. MUKASEY: Okay. Let's assume that the president wants, despite a finding of illegality under law, to have waterboarding done, who is it precisely that is going to get to do it? He would virtually have to do it himself. SHAPIRO: Mukasey said the people who would ordinarily do the waterboarding - CIA interrogators - just wouldn't do it under those circumstances. The attorney general said he's tenure so far has been a series of fish out of water experiences starting from the very beginning. Mr. MUKASEY: The point when the cameras when I walked out with the president to announce the nomination. This is something that happened to other people. SHAPIRO: Now, Mukasey begins his workday each morning with a briefing on the state of the terrorist threat. He thought he'd be comfortable with that experience after handling terrorism trials as a judge. He says, he's not and he doesn't expect to get used to it any time soon. Mr. MUKASEY: The diversity of it and the persistence of it and the constancy of it is something that's driven me day after day, you don't get used to it. I don't get used to it. SHAPIRO: Mukasey has less than a year ahead running the Justice Department. And, he says, I'm not looking to make a mark, I'm looking to it unscathed. Ari Shapiro, NPR News, Baghdad.

S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs. Welcome to the program. Under Secretary NICHOLAS BURNS (U. S. Departmentof State for Political Affairs): Thank you very much. LYDEN: Secretary Burns, the Serbian government sponsored a huge rally on Thursday to protest Kosovo's independence. Now, the vast majority of the demonstrators were peaceful, as we've heard, but does the U. S. believe the Serbian government somehow incited or fomented the rioting and attack on the U. S. embassy and the other embassies? Under Sec. BURNS: Well, put it this way. The Serb government did fail to protect our embassy. There were police around the embassy. They disappeared and melted into the crowd as the mob attacked our embassy. We had 14 people inside. The mob set fire to the ground floor of the embassy. They tried to break further into the embassy. It was a very dangerous situation. And I called the prime minister of Serbia, Prime Minister Kostunica, and I said we hold him and his government to be personally responsible for what happened. Unfortunately, there have been all sorts of provocative statements, incendiary language by the Serb ministers in the days leading up to the demonstration, and unfortunately, I think we're seeing a return of the darker side of Serb nationalism and the ugly face of Serbia (unintelligible) that produced this very, very unfortunate and disagreeable episode the other day. LYDEN: What sort of rhetorical suasion do you think you have with the Serb government? Have they given you any assurances that this won't happen again? Under Sec. BURNS: Well, the prime minister and the foreign minister personally gave me assurances that our embassy would be secured. We're going to hold them to that. The Serb government, unfortunately, is whipping up sentiment in his own country in opposition to what the European Union and the United States have done in recognizing Kosovo, and I think what we're seeing is we're seeing the last act in the disintegration of Yugoslavia. And unfortunately, the Serb leadership seems to be facing backwards, not forwards, and we would urge them to think in more modern terms, recognize Kosovo, get along with the people there and put all of these historic enmities and animosities behind them. LYDEN: Did anyone give you an explanation for why the government didn't deploy enough riot police? Under Sec. BURNS: There was no valid explanation. I asked why the police did not stay, why they weren't there in the first place in adequate numbers, and the prime minister and the foreign minister could not give me an explanation for what happened, and it is one of the fundamental responsibilities of host country to protect foreign embassies in conflict. And in a country that is quite anti-America, in a country that is opposed to American policy in Kosovo, they should have anticipated that that huge crowd on Thursday night, some of those people would have turned violent, as they certainly did. LYDEN: Now, we just heard from our correspondent in Belgrade, Sylvia Poggioli, that even the pro-Western groups in Serbia, people that the U. S. would term Democrats, are feeling betrayed because the United States recognized Kosovo without the United Nations passing a new resolution on its independence. What do you say, Secretary Burns, to those people who are feeling betrayed? Under Sec. BURNS: Well frankly, I find that quite hard to believe, and I find that a, historical - let's remember the history here. The Serbs started four wars in the 1990s, and they were bloody wars, the Bosnian War for instance, 250,000 people killed and two million homeless. That's when NATO went in. We saved those people. We stopped the war. We've kept the peace for nine years, and the United Nations took Kosovo away from Serbia in June of 1999, and the province has been under U. N. administration since. The independence of Kosovo was recommended by the United Nations by special envoy Martti Ahtisaari. The great majority of countries in Europe have recognized Kosovo as independent, so for the - for Serb nationalists or the Serb government to say somehow this took them by surprise, it is just beyond belief that they would hold that opinion.

I'm Scott Simon. U. S. embassies are on alert this weekend throughout the former Yugoslavia. The State Department warns Americans in Serbia to exercise extreme caution as angry protests continue over Kosovo's declaration of independence. All but a few essential diplomats have been ordered to leave Serbia after rioters marauded at the U. S. embassy in Belgrade on Thursday. The U. S. is seen as a main supporter of Kosovo's status as an independent state. Kosovo has been run by the United Nations since 1999, when NATO air strikes halted a Serbian crackdown on ethnic Albanians, who make up about 90 percent of the population. Soren Jessen-Petersen was the special representative of the Secretary General and U. N. administrator of Kosovo from 2004 until 2006. He joins us in the studios. Thanks so much for being with us. Mr. SOREN JESSEN-PETERSEN (Former U. N. Administrator for Kosovo): Pleasure. SIMON: I have to ask you, there was this huge state-sponsored rally against independence, and Prime Minister Kostunica told the crowd, as long as we live Kosovo is Serbia. Are Serbian leaders in any way trying to stir things up? Mr. JESSEN-PETERSEN: Well, one should always be careful if you have no strong evidence here to sort of suggest that they're doing that. But what I can say is that they are certainly not very careful with their statements. Many of the statements have been inflammatory. There was one of the ministers the other day when he referred to the burning of some border posts two, three days ago. He is quoted in the media to have said, it may not be nice but it's legitimate. I don't think it's very legitimate to burn down the border posts. So I think that their statements would suggest that this is, if not organized, it's certainly condoned. And I think they are literally playing with fire. And what worries me most is that they don't know - they don't seem to care about the many Kosovo Serbs who live outside the northern part and who risk to be, sort of, further isolated. You are basically jeopardizing the safety of the Kosovo Serbs. And I think that is completely irresponsible on behalf of Belgrade. SIMON: You spent two years administering Kosovo. Is it ready for independence? Mr. JESSEN-PETERSEN: Well, what I can say is that if we had waited another five years with an interim administration, it would not have been ready for independence. The very problem was that Kosovo had been under interim administration for nine years. And because of the resolution, a Security Council mandate, adopted in '99, there was in that mandate a limit to how much we could transfer of responsibilities or competencies to the local authorities, because we were not allowed to transfer any responsibility which could be seen as an attribute of sovereignty. So, if you could not really make the local authorities responsible and accountable, they will never be ready. But I think they are as ready as they can be in the circumstances. SIMON: Over the past 48 hours, there have been a few provocative comments. Russia's envoy to NATO, Dmitry Rogozin, said that Moscow might, quote, \"have to use brute military force\" if NATO retains a presence there and supports independence. Is this just rhetoric? Mr. JESSEN-PETERSEN: Well, I hope it's just rhetoric because it's completely irresponsible. I don't think any responsible politicians in Moscow would consider using force. Force has also been ruled out by Belgrade, and I think that's important. I think it is the responsible position to take, and it would also be very silly, because by sort of launching a military response, they would be taking on the 17,000 NATO troops. SIMON: Soren Jessen-Petersen, who was the special representative and U. N. administrator of Kosovo, thank you very much. Mr. JESSEN-PETERSEN: It's a pleasure.  SCOTT SIMON, host:  This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. I'm Scott Simon.  U. S. embassies are on alert this weekend throughout the former Yugoslavia. The State Department warns Americans in Serbia to exercise extreme caution as angry protests continue over Kosovo's declaration of independence. All but a few essential diplomats have been ordered to leave Serbia after rioters marauded at the U. S. embassy in Belgrade on Thursday. The U. S. is seen as a main supporter of Kosovo's status as an independent state.  Kosovo has been run by the United Nations since 1999, when NATO air strikes halted a Serbian crackdown on ethnic Albanians, who make up about 90 percent of the population.  Soren Jessen-Petersen was the special representative of the Secretary General and U. N. administrator of Kosovo from 2004 until 2006. He joins us in the studios.  Thanks so much for being with us.  Mr. SOREN JESSEN-PETERSEN (Former U. N. Administrator for Kosovo): Pleasure.  SIMON: I have to ask you, there was this huge state-sponsored rally against independence, and Prime Minister Kostunica told the crowd, as long as we live Kosovo is Serbia. Are Serbian leaders in any way trying to stir things up?  Mr. JESSEN-PETERSEN: Well, one should always be careful if you have no strong evidence here to sort of suggest that they're doing that. But what I can say is that they are certainly not very careful with their statements. Many of the statements have been inflammatory. There was one of the ministers the other day when he referred to the burning of some border posts two, three days ago. He is quoted in the media to have said, it may not be nice but it's legitimate.  I don't think it's very legitimate to burn down the border posts. So I think that their statements would suggest that this is, if not organized, it's certainly condoned. And I think they are literally playing with fire. And what worries me most is that they don't know - they don't seem to care about the many Kosovo Serbs who live outside the northern part and who risk to be, sort of, further isolated.  You are basically jeopardizing the safety of the Kosovo Serbs. And I think that is completely irresponsible on behalf of Belgrade.  SIMON: You spent two years administering Kosovo. Is it ready for independence?  Mr. JESSEN-PETERSEN: Well, what I can say is that if we had waited another five years with an interim administration, it would not have been ready for independence. The very problem was that Kosovo had been under interim administration for nine years. And because of the resolution, a Security Council mandate, adopted in '99, there was in that mandate a limit to how much we could transfer of responsibilities or competencies to the local authorities, because we were not allowed to transfer any responsibility which could be seen as an attribute of sovereignty.

Among them, an 18-inch-tall puppet crafted in Poland. Peter from \"Peter and the Wolf,\" which won for best animated short film. The film's producer, Hugh Welchman, carried Peter the Puppet onstage with him when he got his Oscar. Mr. HUGH WELCHMAN (Film Producer): Now, this really is a fairy tale ending for us, but hopefully it's only the beginning for Peter. And this amazing award will help keep (unintelligible) \"Peter and Wolf\" in the hearts and minds of children all over the world. BLOCK: The stop-motion animation film is both funny and very dark. And Hugh Welchman joins us to tell us how it came about, and Mr. Welchman, you've just told me that you have Peter there with you in the studio, is that right? Mr. WELCHMAN: I certainly do. I've got him under close wraps. He is the star of our film \"Peter and the Wolf. \" So he is the one who caught the wolf, and I like to keep him center stage. BLOCK: Well, let's describe the look of this film, because it's really something. And it seems to be quite clearly set in Russia. And Peter is poor and thin and freezing; he's bullied. Tell me about the look of the film and how you wanted it to seem. Mr. WELCHMAN: Well, very much what we wanted to do is to base the film in reality. Actually, I sent Suzie and the co-writer over to Russia to do research. And they visited (unintelligible), and they interviewed children, and they spent two weeks in a wolf sanctuary, they went to the vast forest of the North. And Suzie actually managed to get herself arrested by the KGB. BLOCK: You're talking about the director of the film, Suzie Templeton. Mr. WELCHMAN: Correct. BLOCK: How did she get arrested? Mr. WELCHMAN: She was taking a photograph of a power station, and they mistook her for an ecoterrorist. And when she protested that she was actually doing research for a children's classic animation film, they had a hard time believing her. But eventually, they let her go but they did wi - pull all photographs. BLOCK: They did, huh, no kidding? Mr. WELCHMAN: Yes, but thankfully Mary Nella(ph) and Suzie managed to take another 7,000 photographs, so we had enough. BLOCK: And she was living with wolves for a while? Mr. WELCHMAN: Yes, it was very important to Suzie to represent the wolf in a very natural and wild setting. And so she spent two weeks living with wolves, sketching them, finding out about their psychology. So we did a lot of research into representations of the wolf in the psyche of humans. BLOCK: Really? And this, wolf, to me, looks sort of scrawny, very scary but pretty thin and almost mangy, maybe. Mr. WELCHMAN: He's hungry. Well, it's a she, actually. In the film, it's set in winter. There's snow on the ground. So she's very glad of a meal if she can get it, which she does. (Soundbite of music) BLOCK: We hear in the film the original Prokofiev score written back in 1936, but we don't hear the narration that sets out the story, that's in most versions of this over the years, that introduces which instruments stand for which characters, that the oboe is the duck and the clarinet is the cat. Why not include that? Mr. WELCHMAN: Well, because the original - you had a narrator, and if you take all the narration together, it's three minutes of spoken word. And you can tell so much more story in 32 minutes of rich, visual storytelling that we found that the narration became redundant when you have the visual storytelling of the film. And this way, people could really focus on the music. BLOCK: You know, for those who aren't in this business, animation is such a mystery. Can you help me understand how this movie was filmed? Mr. WELCHMAN: Well, we created a kind of magical wonderland. It's the only way to describe it. We built a set which was 80 feet long that had 1,700 trees that were each 6 foot high. So you walked into this forest, and it felt like a real forest. And what we do is we have the puppets attached to the set by spikes and different rigging, and they're just moved 2 millimeters at a time, and then we take a picture of it, move it 2 millimeters, take a picture of it, and we do that 24 times for every second that's in the film. And it can take up to half a day to do just one second. BLOCK: You have been screening \"Peter and the Wolf,\" without the recorded soundtrack. You've been doing it with live orchestras. And I can't imagine how that works because so much of the score is tied so tightly with very specific moments in the action, in the animation. Mr. WELCHMAN: Well, basically, the conductor has to learn all the synch points, and so when that when he's conducting orchestra, he can keep them in synch with the film as it plays. I've had quite a few of the conductors who've done it say it's the toughest thing that they've ever done in their professional career. BLOCK: You were talking about synch points. That means that if the orchestra and the film are not quite matched up, there are points at which they can sort of rejoin, take a deep breath and rejoin? Mr. WELCHMAN: Yeah, because that we intentionally put in gaps in the music partly for story purposes. But also, you know, to give breathing spaces for the orchestra so that if they get slightly out, then when the music starts up again, they're banging on their cues. BLOCK: And how is Peter the Puppet enjoying his post-Oscar ride? Mr. WELCHMAN: He's getting a bit battered, so I think I need to take him back to Poland for some R&R. And I think in Poland, they'll be pretty glad of that, because they're going to see the Oscar in person, so I want to go and visit 120 people who worked on it there, and let them all have their moment with the Oscar. BLOCK: Well, Hugh Welchman, congratulations to you and Peter on your Oscar. Mr. WELCHMAN: Thank you very much. BLOCK: Hugh Welchman is the producer of the film \"Peter and the Wolf. \" It won the Oscar last night for best animated short film.

Eric Weiner wrote an article about this for npr. org and he's with us here now. Eric, foreclosure usually seen as a last resort; here, it's being presented as a choice and a good thing. ERIC WEINER: Right. And this is a radically different approach to foreclosure. As you say, it's been seen as something that people stress about and are ashamed of, and would do anything to avoid. And this company, as you mentioned, is saying, hey, you should consider foreclosure as a choice, it might actually be good for you and your family. BLOCK: This a new company, just started up last month? WEINER: It did. Shortly after the New Year. And it was started by two businessmen and attorneys in Southern California. And they clearly saw an opportunity amid all of the foreclosure debris. There are nearly a million Americans right now who are somewhere in the foreclosure process and many more who may soon be going that path. And this company essentially will walk you through the foreclosure process. They don't buy your home or anything like that, they merely provide you with information. They'll send a letter, for instance, to the bank that's coming after you and say that you shouldn't call these people. They'll give you time with an attorney and with an accountant.

They are providing information, information that is readily available out there or you could hire your own accountant, or hire your own attorney. I've talked to a number of consumer watchdog groups, though, and they are concerned about this company. And what they're concerned about is that it's sending the wrong message, that it is essentially discouraging distressed homeowners from pursuing all other options before going into foreclosure. And also, that they are essentially playing down the aftereffects of foreclosure. On their Web site, they use language to the effect of, this will all be behind you soon and you can make a fresh start. Well, you might be able to, but it might take as long as 10 years. That's how long a foreclosure will remain as a huge black mark on your credit rating. BLOCK: They do say on their Web site that people can typically buy a house four years after foreclosure, maybe two years with government loan agencies doing the lending. Is that true? WEINER: I think that's optimistic. From my discussions with consumer watchdog agencies, they say that it will typically be longer than that, somewhere between five and 10 years, and it really varies from state to state.

Yesterday, Senator McCain was forced to repudiate a speaker at one of his campaign rallies in Ohio. The speaker was Bill Cunningham. He hosts the \"Big Show with Bill Cunningham,\" a conservative talk show that's taped in Cincinnati and syndicated nationally. Warming up the crowd before McCain arrived at the event, Cunningham referred three times to Barack Obama using his middle name, calling him Barack Hussein Obama. Mr. BILL CUNNINGHAM (Host, \"Big Show with Bill Cunningham\"): At some point, the media will quit taking sides in this thing and maybe start covering Barack Hussein Obama the same way they cover Bush, the same way they cover Cheney and the same way they cover every Republican. SIEGEL: Bill Cunningham joins us now from Cincinnati. Welcome to the program. Mr. CUNNINGHAM: Thank you, Mr. Siegel. Thank you. SIEGEL: And first, why did you call Senator Obama, Barack Hussein Obama a few times in your remarks yesterday? Mr. CUNNINGHAM: Well, number one, Robert, it's his name, the name given to him by his mother and by his father. And going back into American history - I'm a bit of an historian - you might recall Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Dwight David Eisenhower and John Fitzgerald Kennedy, William Jefferson Clinton. A man who would be president, normally, the middle name is employed in order to give the man more dignity and more respect. And my goal was simply to state the fellow's name much like I often say John Sydney McCain III. SIEGEL: But to many ears, what you're doing is emphasizing, this man's middle name bespeaks foreignness and implies Islam, something which the Obama campaign and others have been at pains to point out is simply not true, that he is not a Muslim. Nothing\u2026 Mr. CUNNINGHAM: No\u2026 SIEGEL: \u2026like that at all? Mr. CUNNINGHAM: Nothing at all. For those who hear that that way, I think they have a problem, because if you assume the mere expression of a man's legal name is bigoted, then you must have difficulty with the name Hussein. And I do not. And actually, Barack and Obama are somewhat ethnic in themselves, which I think would be a great thing if an African-American was able to be elected president. I think it would break down certain walls in this nation, and that would be a good thing. I think this is the wrong African-American. I would like to have seen a Condoleezza Rice, for example, or a Thomas Sowell or a Walter Williams, but nonetheless, if he gets elected, Robert, I would say he's my president. I wish him well, I'll say a prayer for him, and I want him to succeed. SIEGEL: But you acknowledged on Hannity & Colmes yesterday, on their show, that you've also, on occasion or at least once, referred to him on your program as Barack Hussein Mohammed Obama. That's not consistent with the same things that you're saying right now. Mr. CUNNINGHAM: Well, Robert, I would say this on that point. I'm right about 98. 6 percent of the time. I made a mistake in reading somewhere that his name was Barack Mohammed Hussein Obama, and I quickly corrected that because Mohammed is, again, is the great prophet, and Hussein is a great name in Islam. I meant no offense by that. And when I found out that the Internet site that I had gleaned that information from was incorrect, I quickly corrected it. And he's proud of his name, and I'm proud of his name. And if someone does not want his name being used, I would talk to Franklin Delano Roosevelt and John Fitzgerald Kennedy. That's his name. SIEGEL: Well, what do you make then of Senator McCain saying yesterday that -well, it seems like you're unwelcome. You've said that you were asked by his campaign to make remarks like these, or what were you asked to do? Mr. CUNNINGHAM: Well, Robert, I met with Senator Mike DeWine, who I think is his campaign chairman in the state of Ohio, and Joe Deters, who is a local county prosecutor about a week before the event in order to appear to throw some red meat to the assembled conservatives. You know, we conservatives are not too happy with John Sydney McCain III. We think he's a awfully liberal guy. I'm thinking about McCain-Feingold, McCain-Lieberman, McCain-Kennedy. But after the New York Times attacked him so viciously and so wrongly, I softened up a little bit and I said I would lend the weight of my presence to John McCain to kind of kick-start his campaign in Ohio. And they said, great. Get the crowd on their feet. Get them applauding. Get them laughing, create energy in that room. That's what we want. SIEGEL: Well, who used the phrase red meat, give them some raw meat or whatever it was? Your - is that your characterization, or did Mike DeWine said it? Mr. CUNNINGHAM: No, that's Senator Mike DeWine. But you see this at political rallies, which I don't do a lot anymore. But you want to get the crowd fired up, and so all I did was speak about his background in Chicago, but the media treats Obama - this is my problem, Robert. The media treats Obama a lot like he was a deity. Let's just put him in the presidency. Let's coronate him. Let's not have a bare-knuckled election. And it's a sad commentary on the media today that you can't cover Obama the way you cover Clinton or the way you cover Kerry or Bush or anyone. SIEGEL: But in fairness here, your problem today isn't with the media. It's with Senator McCain. I mean, he's the one who\u2026 Mr. CUNNINGHAM: Well, that's true. That's true. SIEGEL: \u2026objected to what you said. What do you make of Senator McCain now? Mr. CUNNINGHAM: Sad. It is very sad for a gentleman who did not hear what I said, who has met me several times but has forgotten about it. He might have Alzheimer's. The guy is getting a bit old. It is sad when he forgets meeting me. And then having not heard me, he criticizes words that I didn't say, that he didn't hear, and then throws me under the straight talk express. That was kind of embarrassing. SIEGEL: You're no longer a McCain supporter. Mr. CUNNINGHAM: Well, I was lukewarm before. I was a Huckabee man, a Romney man. I like Thompson. But now, after John McCain has shown his true colors, he's come after me on false information. I smeared nobody. I said nothing that was false. SIEGEL: Are you going to support Hillary Clinton now? Mr. CUNNINGHAM: Well, you know, I got an inquiry about an hour or so ago from a Hillary Clinton supporter. And she has indicated that she'd like to come on my radio talk show later this week or the first of next week before the Ohio primary. And I think Hillary Clinton has got a better shot at defending the nation's borders and being an institutionalist in the White House than either McCain or Obama, who's to the left of Senator Bernie Sanders. So I would go to sleep every night as an American feeling better with Hillary Clinton in the White House and Bubba upstairs. So, yes, I may endorse soon Hillary Clinton. SIEGEL: Well, Bill Cunningham, thank you very much for talking with us. Mr. CUNNINGHAM: Robert, you're a great American. (Soundbite of laughter) SIEGEL: That's Cincinnati radio talk show host Bill Cunningham, speaking to us from the studios of WLW in Cincinnati.  ROBERT SIEGEL, host:  But there is some political speech that is apparently beyond the pale. Yesterday, Senator McCain was forced to repudiate a speaker at one of his campaign rallies in Ohio. The speaker was Bill Cunningham. He hosts the \"Big Show with Bill Cunningham,\" a conservative talk show that's taped in Cincinnati and syndicated nationally.  Warming up the crowd before McCain arrived at the event, Cunningham referred three times to Barack Obama using his middle name, calling him Barack Hussein Obama.  Mr. BILL CUNNINGHAM (Host, \"Big Show with Bill Cunningham\"): At some point, the media will quit taking sides in this thing and maybe start covering Barack Hussein Obama the same way they cover Bush, the same way they cover Cheney and the same way they cover every Republican.  SIEGEL: Bill Cunningham joins us now from Cincinnati. Welcome to the program.  Mr. CUNNINGHAM: Thank you, Mr. Siegel. Thank you.  SIEGEL: And first, why did you call Senator Obama, Barack Hussein Obama a few times in your remarks yesterday?  Mr. CUNNINGHAM: Well, number one, Robert, it's his name, the name given to him by his mother and by his father. And going back into American history - I'm a bit of an historian - you might recall Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Dwight David Eisenhower and John Fitzgerald Kennedy, William Jefferson Clinton. A man who would be president, normally, the middle name is employed in order to give the man more dignity and more respect. And my goal was simply to state the fellow's name much like I often say John Sydney McCain III.  SIEGEL: But to many ears, what you're doing is emphasizing, this man's middle name bespeaks foreignness and implies Islam, something which the Obama campaign and others have been at pains to point out is simply not true, that he is not a Muslim. Nothing\u2026  Mr. CUNNINGHAM: No\u2026  SIEGEL: \u2026like that at all?  Mr. CUNNINGHAM: Nothing at all. For those who hear that that way, I think they have a problem, because if you assume the mere expression of a man's legal name is bigoted, then you must have difficulty with the name Hussein. And I do not. And actually, Barack and Obama are somewhat ethnic in themselves, which I think would be a great thing if an African-American was able to be elected president. I think it would break down certain walls in this nation, and that would be a good thing. I think this is the wrong African-American. I would like to have seen a Condoleezza Rice, for example, or a Thomas Sowell or a Walter Williams, but nonetheless, if he gets elected, Robert, I would say he's my president. I wish him well, I'll say a prayer for him, and I want him to succeed.  SIEGEL: But you acknowledged on Hannity & Colmes yesterday, on their show, that you've also, on occasion or at least once, referred to him on your program as Barack Hussein Mohammed Obama. That's not consistent with the same things that you're saying right now.  Mr. CUNNINGHAM: Well, Robert, I would say this on that point. I'm right about 98. 6 percent of the time. I made a mistake in reading somewhere that his name was Barack Mohammed Hussein Obama, and I quickly corrected that because Mohammed is, again, is the great prophet, and Hussein is a great name in Islam. I meant no offense by that. And when I found out that the Internet site that I had gleaned that information from was incorrect, I quickly corrected it. And he's proud of his name, and I'm proud of his name. And if someone does not want his name being used, I would talk to Franklin Delano Roosevelt and John Fitzgerald Kennedy. That's his name.  SIEGEL: Well, what do you make then of Senator McCain saying yesterday that -well, it seems like you're unwelcome. You've said that you were asked by his campaign to make remarks like these, or what were you asked to do?  Mr. CUNNINGHAM: Well, Robert, I met with Senator Mike DeWine, who I think is his campaign chairman in the state of Ohio, and Joe Deters, who is a local county prosecutor about a week before the event in order to appear to throw some red meat to the assembled conservatives.  You know, we conservatives are not too happy with John Sydney McCain III. We think he's a awfully liberal guy. I'm thinking about McCain-Feingold, McCain-Lieberman, McCain-Kennedy. But after the New York Times attacked him so viciously and so wrongly, I softened up a little bit and I said I would lend the weight of my presence to John McCain to kind of kick-start his campaign in Ohio.

He's working on a biography of William F. Buckley. Welcome to the program, Sam. Mr. SAM TANENHAUS (Editor, The New York Times Book Review and Weekend Review Section): It's good to be here. SIEGEL: So many of us knew William F. Buckley from his public persona. My first question is, was his private informal persona radically different from what we saw? Mr. TANENHAUS: I wouldn't say radically different. As soon as you heard the famous voice, it was the famous voice you'd heard on television in \"Firing Line,\" or on the radio or the many interviews he gave. His manner was more informal. He dressed very casually for one thing. He dressed in a kind of Ivy League-preppy style of the early '50s, late '40s, when he'd been there. The most interesting thing about him was that if you spend time privately with him at his home or with friends, he never talked about politics. He was bored by it. Politics was something he was very good at talking about, and writing about, and especially arguing about, but he didn't find it fundamentally interesting. So, he talked about books, he talked about journalism, he talked about music, he talked about sailing, about his dogs. He loved King Cavalier Spaniels, but he seldom talked about politics. And he once said to me, I only talk about politics when someone pays me to do it. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. TANENHAUS: And they paid him a lot. . . SIEGEL: Yes. This would explain also how he managed, I gather, a great many, close friendships with a lot of people who disagreed profoundly with him about politics. Mr. TANENHAUS: Well, one of those great friends who disagreed profoundly with him, the great journalist, Murray Kempton, said, Bill Buckley has a genius for friendship. Of the great people one meets in the course of one's life, I never met one who is just so much fun to be with and there was a kind of antic quality to everything he said, he just lived his life in a very entertaining way. He entertained himself and the people around him, and he wanted to be entertained in turn, which isn't to say that he ever put one on the spot, but he wanted to have interesting people around him, who told him things he didn't know. SIEGEL: William F. Buckley played such a pivotal role in the development of post-war conservatism in America, including - we should add here - his opposition to desegregation in the American South, in National Review, which is not a warm and fuzzy position by any means. What was it that made him this conservative thinker? Mr. TANENHAUS: Well, the first thing to say, by the way, because you've raised the desegregation point, which comes up a lot, and there are few things to say about that, first is, those who use changed quite dramatically over time. As of the earlier views, Bill Buckley was the son of Deep Southern parents. His father came from southern Texas; his mother from New Orleans. The views he grew up with - in the '30s and early '40s were essentially those of progressive white Southerners of that period. What happened was he, like, so many others was overtaken by the drama of the Civil Rights Movement and was indeed slow to catch on. Although, very early on, he supported boycotts, for instance, the Montgomery bus boycott because that was a protest that actually used the power of the economy to change politics. What he opposed was, what he and many other classical conservative types saw as statism, the imposition of political change from above. Now, that view of civil rights was one that was linked to this broader notion I've hinted at which is that a Buckley style conservatism was very much about the individual. In its early days, it was called individualism. We now think of it as libertarianism. Conservatives emerged as defenders of individual rights, of entrepreneurship - and these are values that ultimately were embraced by the broader political communities. So in a sense, what Buckley did was to take an old style of conservatism and modernized it, and actually make the country a little bit less liberal as it began to embrace these ideals. SIEGEL: Sam Tanenhaus, thanks a lot for talking with us. Mr. TANENHAUS: Thank you. SIEGEL: Sam Tanenhaus, editor of the New Times Book Review and Weekend Review sections speaking to us about William F. Buckley Jr. He's writing a biography of him. Mr. Buckley died today at age 82.

I'm Melissa Block. ROBERT SIEGEL, host: And I'm Robert Siegel. There is no greater value added than the creativity of a great artist. Take the price of paint, canvas and brushes and call that the value of a painting, and to then assume that the brushes, paint and canvas were brought together by Monet. Suddenly, ingredients worthy of a modest shopping list turned into something that collectors will bid millions for and cat burglars would even risk their lives for it. Well, this rumination on the financial multiplier effect of art is occasioned by a tax bill. It was introduced in the U. S. Senate; it's called an Artist's Fair-Market Value Deduction Bill. It changes the way an artist can claim a tax deduction for making a charitable gift of his or her own creative work. One of the lead sponsors is Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont. Welcome to the program once again, Senator Leahy. Senator PATRICK LEAHY (Democrat, Vermont): Thank you. It's good to be with you. SIEGEL: And let's start with the way that the IRS currently treats a donated artwork. It could be, I gather, an author's manuscript, but let's take a painted wood carving, I've made one, I'm the artist, I give it to a local museum. Sen. LEAHY: And if you did, you could deduct the cost of the wood and the painting. And you could deduct $5, $10, $20, whatever. SIEGEL: But to clarify this - if I, as the artist in my hypothetical wood carving - if I sold that to a collector for $100,000 and the collector then donated it to the museum\u2026 Sen. LEAHY: Oh, the collector - he could deduct $100,000, I mean, that's the irony of the whole thing. If you made a piece of art that cost you $20 in material, you donate it to museum. You get the $20. You sold it for $100,000 to somebody, they in turn or their estate gives it to the museum, they deduct the $100,000. It just doesn't seem to make a great deal of sense. We had back a few years ago that Igor Stravinsky wanted to donate all of his papers to the Library of Congress. He could take the cost of whatever, that amount in paper would have cost and says he sold it in Switzerland, Americans never got that chance to have that. SIEGEL: You mean, the IRS\u2026 Sen. LEAHY: There are so many\u2026 SIEGEL: The IRS says its literally worth the paper that it's written on with the ink thrown in. Sen. LEAHY: That's about it. SIEGEL: But let me ask you a couple of questions about this. First, let's assume that I'm a painter and when I do sell paintings, they sell for $15,000 typically. But, I don't always sell paintings, I have others that don't move, I donate a painting not to the Met or the Smithsonian or the National Gallery but I donated it to the local Pottersville Museum of Art. Who says, who determines whether that, say, piece of art worth the deduction of $15,000 or whether it's one of my dogs that doesn't - that doesn't sell and I don't deserve any of deduction for it? (Soundbite of laughter) Sen. LEAHY: We have very, very strong standards about what can be taken, what cannot. In fact, you have to provide for appraisals by qualified appraisers. In fact, if there is a question, it can go to review. The Internal Revenue Service actually has an art advisory panel. Now, these are people who are not about to give away the shop. SIEGEL: Now, when the current or when the 1969 tax law took effect and changed the rule governing donations, President Richard Nixon famously and criminally had a deed of the gift of his papers backdated to take advantage of the old law. Politicians had taken advantage of the tax deduction for the gift of their papers as estimated by an independent appraiser. Is it conceivable that any of the people who might vote on this provision, in either the Senate or the House, by virtue of books that they've written or just their status might someday take advantage of this very provision? Sen. LEAHY: Well, a number of the things that members of Congress own now have value. They could sell and they could donate them anyway. But it is not intended for that - this is intended for artists. I don't think you're going to find any benefit going to a member of Congress that they would not have available to them anyway. Certainly, if you have a bestselling author in the Congress, they're going to make a lot of money but I must point out that there've been darn few bestselling authors and\u2026 SIEGEL: I think, two of them are running for president right now. (Soundbite of laughter) Sen. LEAHY: Two of them are running for president, of course, we're all jealous of them. They've all done - actually three. All three senators who are running for\u2026 SIEGEL: Yes, that's right. All three senators are running. Yes. Sen. LEAHY: \u2026Senator McCain, Senator Clinton and Senator Obama - they've all been bestselling authors, they've all made a lot of money. And they've also -all three of them given a lot of that money to charity. SIEGEL: Well, are they artists, as far as the bill is concerned because they've written books? Sen. LEAHY: Yeah, they are artists. But I think what you're going to see in a case like that - if somebody wants to give proceeds of a book, they're not going to need this. SIEGEL: Well, as a sponsor of this bill, for you, who is the kind of artist you have most in mind whose situation would be greatly altered by the ability to deduct the fair-market value of the work of art if the artist donates it? Sen. LEAHY: Well, I can see people in my own state, who have, do a very good job and their paintings, their artwork. We have a lot of contemporary artists in this country who have this artwork, and ultimately the public wins. The public gets to see artwork they might not have seen otherwise, unless they were visiting somebody who's a private collector. SIEGEL: Well, Senator Leahy. Thank you very much for talking with us about this. Sen. LEAHY: It's always good to be with you, Robert. Thank you very, very much. SIEGEL: Yeah.

And they've also -all three of them given a lot of that money to charity.  SIEGEL: Well, are they artists, as far as the bill is concerned because they've written books?  Sen. LEAHY: Yeah, they are artists. But I think what you're going to see in a case like that - if somebody wants to give proceeds of a book, they're not going to need this.  SIEGEL: Well, as a sponsor of this bill, for you, who is the kind of artist you have most in mind whose situation would be greatly altered by the ability to deduct the fair-market value of the work of art if the artist donates it?  Sen. LEAHY: Well, I can see people in my own state, who have, do a very good job and their paintings, their artwork. We have a lot of contemporary artists in this country who have this artwork, and ultimately the public wins. The public gets to see artwork they might not have seen otherwise, unless they were visiting somebody who's a private collector.  SIEGEL: Well, Senator Leahy. Thank you very much for talking with us about this.  Sen. LEAHY: It's always good to be with you, Robert. Thank you very, very much.  SIEGEL: Yeah. That's Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and one of the sponsors of the Artist's Fair-Market Value Deduction Bill in the U. S. Senate.

I'm Robert Siegel. MELISSA BLOCK, host: And I'm Melissa Block. Bombs are once again raining down on Darfur, Sudan, and Arab militias known as Janjaweed are again raiding and burning villages. It's a return to the style of attacks that began the violence in Darfur more than five years ago. The only thing protecting the civilians caught between government forces and countless rebel factions is an exhausted and ill-equipped group of African Union peacekeepers. That may change soon, though, perhaps not soon enough. Last summer, the United Nations gave the go-ahead to a new joint peacekeeping force that would triple the number of troops in Darfur, but the government of Sudan has actively tried to slow and even block its deployment. Michael Gaouette is the leader of the U. N. team responsible for those peacekeepers. He says they're moving as fast as they can, but there's another obstacle in his way: Darfur itself. Mr. MICHAEL GAOUETTE (Leader, United Nations-African Union Peacekeeping Force in Darfur): I was just there. And you go to these broad patches of scrub and desert, and you know that in a matter of months, we're going to have to have all the accommodation for thousands of troops in place. It's a very difficult thing to do in a spot that is more or less smack in the middle of Africa with minimal infrastructure. BLOCK: Has the government of Sudan been insisting that all of the troops be from African countries as opposed to predominantly from African countries, which was the agreement? Mr. GAOUETTE: Well, their position is the one that was expressed in the Security Council resolution, which says that the force has to be predominantly African. They have gone public to say that all efforts should be made to deploy African troops first and then non-Africans will be considered. And we're doing our best to work with that. And, in fact, the next set of troops that are in the pipeline, the major injection will come from Egypt and Ethiopia. So we hope and expect that that will go some way to addressing the government's concerns. BLOCK: And after that, if they were troops coming from another country, say, Thailand, would the government of Sudan let them in? Mr. GAOUETTE: They've told us that if the Africans are deployed first, then there shouldn't be any problem. BLOCK: And you believe them? Mr. GAOUETTE: The proof of the pudding will also be in the tasting. BLOCK: Once these troops get to Darfur - if they get to Darfur - what is their mandate? What are they allowed to do? Mr. GAOUETTE: You know, it's interesting, and it doesn't get discussed much, but the mandate of this joint African Union-United Nations operation is tremendously expansive. We've been tasked to look into the human rights situation. We've been tasked to help with building systems for the rule of law. We've been tasked to help in an area they call child protection. But the marquee issue in the mandate is \"protection of civilians. \" BLOCK: Does that mean that if there were to be an attack by, say, Sudanese army troops, Janjaweed militia against civilians, that the U. N. troops are authorized to use deadly force to stop that attack? Mr. GAOUETTE: There's one thing we have to clarify: that a peacekeeping operation is just that. It is deployed and it is equipped and capable of operating in an environment where two sides have agreed to a peace. It's not deployed to enforce a peace. And I think if there's one piece of red-hot bad news coming out of Darfur right now, it's that the war is back on in the west. And the government is taking it to rebels that - and these are rebels that have openly said they want to unseat the government, so there's a conflict there. And our concern, of course, is that there are civilians who are suffering in the mix. BLOCK: What did you see on this last trip to Darfur that made you so concerned about what's going on right now? Mr. GAOUETTE: You know, we traveled out to the west, to al-Janina(ph), and it was right in the middle of a major government offensive. They were attacking rebel-held positions. And so while we were there, reports were coming in of villages being burned and people being displaced. That's of enormous concern for all sorts of reasons. The first and foremost is the human suffering one. And it's our obligation to do everything we can to stop the suffering. The second concern is that there may be this expectation that the force, as it is, will be able to somehow magically step between two warring parties and stop the war. We're not equipped to do so. So in this case, it means going to the highest level of the Sudanese government and imploring them to stop. It means going public and making sure that those who are in a position to decide to launch these attacks know that we're watching what happens to civilians. BLOCK: How confident are you that there's the international will to send the troops that are needed, the numbers of troops that are needed to Darfur? Mr. GAOUETTE: You know, when we solicited for these troops, there were a lot of offers. But if you scratch down a layer or two, we have a few problems we have to solve, one of which is that some of these countries that have volunteered troops will require some help in equipping them and training the troops on the equipment and then making sure that once they're out in Darfur, they'll be able to sustain themselves. This process is not an overnight process, and we're in a situation where we need an overnight process. So there's still a bit of a disconnect in terms of what will be required to get these troops ready and how fast do we need them. BLOCK: What else do you need besides troops on the ground? Mr. GAOUETTE: Well, we need a few simple mechanical things. We still haven't received offers of the attack helicopters that we see as fundamental requirement for this force to be effective. Darfur is huge. Everybody knows the tagline is the size of France, there are no roads, and so on and so forth. So if you have a flashpoint hundreds of kilometers away and the force commander needs to get there or send people there, you can only do it through air. Likewise, you need military aviation that just moves troops, and we're short 18 transport helicopters in the military side. We also need what they call a medium-transport unit, which is basically an assemblage of military trucks that can likewise move into difficult areas. So there are some basic, basic requirements for this force that we haven't received, and, you know, our knuckles are bloody from banging on doors. BLOCK: Just to be clear, what would those attack helicopters be authorized to do under the U. N. mandate? Mr. GAOUETTE: Move troops and protect civilians, as per the resolution. BLOCK: Protect civilians, meaning they can fire on troops attacking them? Mr. GAOUETTE: If you read the resolution, there is a line in there that makes it clear that if civilians are under duress, that the mission can take appropriate action to defend them. As I said, the headline of this mission is to end the suffering, and that means that when you see a civilian in trouble, you do something to help them out. BLOCK: Mr. Gaouette, you've been going to Darfur many, many times over the last three years. Have you seen any signs that things are better now for the people in Darfur than they were when you first went? Mr. GAOUETTE: I think you asked me the question at a bad moment. It's - these are dark days in west Darfur. From the perspective of the peacekeeping operation, there's some good news, as I said, because we've injected some senior leadership, we've injected some systems, and there is a kind of inexorability to the deployment. It doesn't happen as fast as we want, but it does happen. Once the oil tanker has the coordinates punched in, it pushes off the dock and heads for the high seas. The issue is it's not happening fast enough. And the other issue, of course, is that even fully deployed, it will not solve the problem. It's politics that will solve the problem.

For jumping the gun in the primary schedule, they were zeroed out of the Democratic National Convention. And now, the Democrats are trying to figure out how to get two big states represented in Denver this summer while retaining their concern for fairness and for the party's rules. Joining us now is Florida Democratic Senator Bill Nelson, who writes in support of a revote in today's Wall Street Journal. Welcome. Senator BILL NELSON (Democrat, Florida): Thank you so much. SIEGEL: You have written about the possibility not of a full-dress primary, but of a mail-in primary. And first of all, I'd just like to know your sense of the practicality of this. How soon would Florida have to get working on a mail-in primary to have one in time to be counted? Sen. NELSON: Immediately. And I spoke last evening with the state party chairman, suggested that she start the process, because they first have to go to the Democratic National Committee to get approval. Under their rules, there's a 30-day comment period, and then the DNC would approve. So that has to start immediately if you're going to make this all end up by the first week in June. SIEGEL: Well, first, is there any actual discussion right now between the Florida party and the Democratic National Committee on this? Sen. NELSON: Well, there is. And of course, I've had those discussions with Chairman Dean as well. I've had the discussions with our governor - Governor Crist, he has offered to help. The technicality is that there actually has to be a change in the law because the mail-in ballot that is part of Florida law is for issues only. So this has to be changed. The Florida legislature is in session; if Governor Crist is persuasive upon them, then they will change the law. Otherwise, he's looking at a possibility of an executive order. SIEGEL: If, in fact, there were a mail-in primary in Florida, would Florida have to do it for both parties even though it's completely moot? And on the Republican side, will you have to do that in order to have a proper state election? Sen. NELSON: No, we register by party. And under Florida law, the primary is only, in this case, for Democrats. So a mail-out would be to every registered Democrat in the state, including you'd have to have enough lead time to get those ballots to folks overseas. And so you're talking about an election that would be run by the apparatus of the Florida government. It would be paid for by the Florida Democratic Party. And particularly, the part that's critical is the confirming of the signatures on the envelopes when the ballots are returned that would have to be done by the supervisors of election in each of Florida's 67 counties. SIEGEL: Now, Senator Nelson, I just want to ask you, and you said that this would not be paid for by the state. Have you figured out a price tag on a mail-in primary, and are you confident that money can be raised by Democrats? Sen. NELSON: We are estimating between $4 and $6 million. And the Florida Democratic Party would have to raise that. There have been a number of people that have come forth and have said that they would be willing to help. One suggestion was that they could also do it by the Internet so there wouldn't be any one, big sugar daddy that would be contributing. But all of this has got to be done now. The enemy is time because if we run out of time, we don't get the redo. SIEGEL: So you say get started right away, is your message. Sen. NELSON: Yes, sir.

It's time for Wisdom Watch. Our conversation with leaders who've gone before us, those with experience, and knowledge. Not just smart, but wise. Our guest today, former Secretary of the Army, Clifford Alexander. He spent his career attempting to ensure equal opportunity for women and people of color, particularly in the work place. His resume is a long list of firsts, including being the first African-American Secretary of the army. So, Mr. Secretary, thank you so much for coming.  Mr. CLIFFORD ALEXANDER (Former Secretary of the Army): Thank you so much, Michel.  MARTIN: You spent most of your life fighting inequality. We want to talk a lot about that, but today marks the fifth anniversary of the beginning of the Iraq War. And early on, you took a strong position against the war, far earlier than many people in your peer group people, particularly with military experience, and just, I'd like to ask you why?  Mr. ALEXANDER: When I saw the facts, I saw nothing that would provoke something unique in the American society. That is, that without being attacked, that the United States, on some very, very flimsy evidence would go into another country, particularly a country with no overt threat to our society right here. There was a great deal of flag waving at the time, and there was a great deal of trying to, I think, change the subject, for a relatively inactive president, at the time, who's spending his time somewhere after 9/11 down at the ranch.  Before 9/11, not looking at the evidence related to that, and now you had a country coming together because we had been attacked by a group of disorganized hateful people that really were not in Iraq.  MARTIN: Do you feel, though, that the president deliberately distorted available facts in order to arrive at the conclusion that he arrived at, or do you believe that he simply made a mistake?  Mr. ALEXANDER: I think almost the worst thing about this president is his lack of depth in anything. This is a man who seems to just react, and he is one of these people that -we used to call them punks on the playground in Harlem. What they would do, they would be all big and bad before the game started but once the game was started, they would often shy away because they didn't have the skills.  This man has not had the skills in any particular area that I can see, and to commit men and women in uniform and their lives, was a singularly irresponsible act.  MARTIN: So no secret here, but you're a Democrat.  Mr. ALEXANDER: I am a Democrat, but when I sort of list the things that I am, it's way down on list. But I am a Democrat and I tried to, I hope with some success, as the Secretary of the Army, not be a, quote, unquote, \"Democrat\", because I think the issues are far more important than Democrat or Republican.  MARTIN: Do you think it's important to point out that you are a supporter of Senator Barack Obama's candidacy for the presidency? That would be accurate, right?  Mr. ALEXANDER: It would be more than accurate. I am, and my son is the policy director of his campaign, and I've known him for over a dozen years. And Michel, I think a great deal of him and of him substantively. And I certainly don't hide my praise of him.  MARTIN: But you also know the Clintons too. And having been around for sort of quite a long time, having worked on these issues for quite a long time, I would just like to know why you think he's the best candidate for this position? And also, in contrast to Senator McCain who, obviously, is someone you would know.  Mr. ALEXANDER: Let me start first with the attributes that I believe makes him more than competent to do the job. He has a sense of reason about him. He is thoughtful. He has shown his capacity to execute, particularly during this campaign. He's run a fascinating campaign, which you have to put together. I ran for office, unsuccessfully, once myself in the District of Columbia. That this, on a nationwide scale, raising more money than anybody else, having more volunteers than anybody else, winning, I think, it's 29 out of - and his opponent, Mrs. Clinton has won only 14 Caucuses and primaries. That is extraordinary.  There is this business that Mrs. Clinton often talks about. Fe hasn't passed the test for Commander in Chief. Well, she wrote the test, so I don't think your opponent writes the test for Commander in Chief. The real test for Commander in Chief is the test of whether someone is capable of seeing other human beings, their strengths and weaknesses, seeing the world on a much larger stage than I think either of the other two candidates do.  MARTIN: Just wondered how your earlier experiences have kind of informed how you saw your job in Washington, what you thought you were here to do.  Mr. ALEXANDER: Very - it's an excellent question. It's been so long, but let me see if I can recreate that sort of, at least two or three parts to it. One part would be when I came to work for President Kennedy. There, I was working on the National Security Council staff with the late Michael Forrestal, the son of the former head of the Defense Department James Forrestal, who is a delightful human being and a very smart one. My interest, however, was domestic policies, and my interests always have and will be until the day I die, better opportunities for women and minorities in this country and for everybody else. But they're the ones who need, if you will, the most attention and discussion in this country.  So I was lucky enough to work with a man named Louis Martin. Louis Martin was better than great. He was from your profession and also a politician. He was an owner and writer for the SingStat Publications, and he also was a man who did a great deal to get black people into the Kennedy and Johnson administration. When I worked for President Johnson, I was one of his three counsels. That took a different kind of skill. And in working for him, it was a particular kind of skill, and I handled the interactions with governors and with mayors. I handled presidential pardons and most importantly, I handled civil rights.  And I interacted on his behalf with Martin Luther King, Dorothy Height, Roy Wilkins, Whitney Young, John Lewis - the heads of the leadership of the civil rights movement.  MARTIN: What was he like? What was Lynden Johnson like?  Mr. ALEXANDER: Well, the best thing about him to me was that he treated me, as a black aide, the same way he treated his white aides. He was loving in ten seconds, and right in your face at another point. At one point, we were all working on the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and we were asked to go brief various members of the press, and I was briefing Carl Rowen over in a restaurant. In those days, you had cars that would pick up aides, and so I was put in a car and told the president wants to see you in his office.  I went in the office, and this was the brief Carl that the Voting Rights Act was going to be sent up that afternoon. And I walked into the president's office, the Oval Office, and he showed me this huge headline in the Washington Star that said, president to send up Voting Rights Act. So he for about 45 minutes or a half hour, seemed like about 10 hours, proceeded to diminish me for putting this headline through Carl Rowen and having it. . .  MARTIN: You messed up basically. In other words, you messed up.  Mr. ALEXANDER: I messed up. And he said we're not going to have the Voting Rights Act. Your people will not benefit. So there I was. Now I was about two inches tall. That very same night, I was part of a briefing in the White House with several members of Congress, and President Johnson pointed at me and said that's one of my great and splendid aides, Clifford Alexander. So he did all that in one day.  But when you look at his record, I once did a memo for him on his first one hundred days, and they were far greater than Roosevelt's 100 days because he did and caused to pass legislation in civil rights. He had the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He had health matters. He had education matters settled, and he understood the legislative branch better than any president before or since.  MARTIN: If you're just joining us, I'm having a Wisdom Watch conversation with Clifford Alexander, former Secretary of the Army.  You were chairman of the EEOC from 1967 to 1969. You held two historic public hearings on the workplace conditions for women and minorities, and I know it was a long time ago, but I just wondered if you remember any of the testimony from that time and how people reacted to it.  Mr. ALEXANDER: Oh, I do! I remember those very, very well. The first was 1967 and the second was in 1969. In '67, it was New York City. In 1969, it was in Los Angeles. What I did in the hearings in New York was - one part of it had to do with talking to the media and talking to the New York Times, to ABC, CBS, and NBC, executives. And because of their paucity of hiring, particularly of, we used to call ourselves Negroes at the time, and also Hispanics and Latinos, and women as well. We also talked to the advertising industry, which even until today is doing a very bad job of including minorities, in particular in their hiring.  And I remember a particular one with the person from the New York Times was telling me about the great editorial positions on inclusion and seeing to it that people had greater opportunities. And I remember saying to him at the end of the testimony, why don't you practice what you preach? Because indeed at the New York Times, they weren't doing a darn thing about giving black people or Puerto Ricans in New York City an opportunity to be reporters. Well, the answer was nonexistent because there was not a good answer. They did not practice what they preached.  And unfortunately until this very day, we see in most areas of the media, and radio, and television, and the written, in particular in the newspaper world, that the inclusiveness, and I like to call it inclusiveness, not diversity, the inclusiveness is not their top priority, nor is it a place where they see how important it is for them to be able to hear views - conservative, Republican, from Latino, Asian, black, male, female, and they don't get it yet. They still think that if they have a good symbolic job of doing something, they've done something. But it's much, much more than that, and it was at least the beginning - I remember particularly with. . .  MARTIN: I think what I hear you saying is that you think the media is actually behind other business entities, is that right? Is that what you're saying?  Mr. ALEXANDER: I think the word would be, way beyond. I'm sorry to make it that profound, but it's exactly what it is.  MARTIN: Why do you think that is?  Mr. ALEXANDER: I think part of it is that the media becomes quite self-serving. It talks about itself in grandiose terms but does not like the criticism of itself. And so in order to understand why you should be inclusive, you're going to have to understand and discuss honestly that you have a problem, and the media in this country doesn't do that. Then, groups from within the media are sent off. Black people are sent off. Latinos are sent off. Women are sent off to their own specific conferences to talk about their own specific problems, but the people who can do something about it aren't really that interested in it, nor are they included in those conferences.  And I think if you sort of simplify these matters, it helps a good deal. When I was Secretary of the Army, when the issue of women in the Army came up, I would say women in the Army are soldiers in the Army. Just think of it that way. And they would say, oh well let me see. If they're in the army, will they have to take care of their children? So we did a little study of that. And we found out that males who had to take care of their children were less responsible about their posts than females.  If you're in the Army, you have to get to your post. There's no question about that. So if you're a female, you arrange to do it. If you're a male, you arrange to do it, if you have children. So the stereotypical thinking has to get out of the heads of people, and I do think that we have to in this society start to, the old term is peel back the onion, but it is we must think more thoroughly about issues of inclusion.  MARTIN: I wanted to ask you, though, given that your time, you know, in government service at the Department of the Army, at the EEOC, you were so much involved with both gender equality and racial equality. I remember hearing you tell stories about how some of the ridiculous objections there were to placing women even in civilian jobs in the Army, like in the General Counsel's office. Given that you've spent so much time on both issues of gender and race, how do you react to the way those issues are playing out in this presidential race? Being mindful of the fact that you do have a candidate that you particularly like.  Mr. ALEXANDER: Well, I like that candidate, but your question I think was the broader one about how it's played out. . .  MARTIN: Yes.  Mr. ALEXANDER: And it's almost comical how simplistic the discussion of it is. The issue of inclusion of people, men and women, is an issue of how do you overcome stereotypical behavior on the part of all of us? When the newspapers, and radio, and television train us that women act a certain way, do a certain thing. That obviously affects the mind of the employer.  So there is a presumption that a woman, if she's going to a law firm, may end up getting pregnant and therefore may end up not being able to be a good partner for us. Or that a woman in a law firm, as she travels with a male colleague, will somehow get involved in an affair and that the male colleague's wife should worry about that. Those are actual issues that I have heard raised within the last decade, and are raised today.  So we have to get over our stereotypical behavior about what a woman can and cannot do, and start to say, which we should, that there's any job that a woman should do, we should put them in that job. When I was Secretary of the Army, we had the restriction that still exists with the army alone on keeping women out of combat. I don't find a woman's blood any more precious than a male blood, so I don't see why they shouldn't be in combat as long as they can do those jobs.  That's a major discussion and argument in the society today.  MARTIN: Wanted to ask you, just as a final thought - having spent so much of your career talking about issues, of trying to address issues of sort of inequality and inclusion. Given that this issue is so much in the news right now, how would you like to see the country go forward in talking about these things?  Mr. ALEXANDER: I would love to see this country talk about those issues as it talks about other issues - with completeness but not exclusivity. The problem now is that we're going to have too much concentration on the issue of race because you have a black man running for president. Too much reaction to anybody saying anything that interrelates to his race, because he is what he is. The discussion really is not about him.  The discussion is what is it that people who are similarly situated or look the same, what is it they face? The discussion ought to be, by Hillary Clinton, and those around her, and those who are talking about her, not that she is a woman, which is pretty obvious, but the most important thing is what is it that women face and do? Women in cities face one thing, and women in rural America face something else. Do women in the services face one thing and something else in corporations? Do black women find there are different issues, or Latino issues that they face when they are women and Latinos?  That is, at least the beginning of how one needs to talk about it. And one need not create more discussion about differences than is necessary. What I often talk about in my business - I talk about inclusion, not diversity. Because if the job for me is to move A to B, it's no different for a woman than it is for a man. It's no different for a Latino than it is for an Asian. So we have to understand that when we're talking about the workplace or we're talking about getting educated, the requirements are about the same.  The differences may be in the background of a person, or from whence they came, or what they're hearing in their life, and one ought to see how that richness might help us all. I find Black History Month to be something where what happens on Mach 1st, I don't quite know, since February is Black History Month. . .  MARTIN: Women's History Month.  Mr. ALEXANDER: Well, that's right. I forgot that. But I think we all - you know, I'd like to see more people not of color come to the lectures during Black History Month and frankly, I'd like to see it back to a week or a few days. But beyond that, let's be substantive about these issues and not just talk about them and move away from them during months other than February, March. But lets' think about them, work on them, and have a better country by acting on them.  MARTIN: Clifford Alexander, former Secretary of the Army, former chairman of the EEOC. He's now president of a consulting firm, Clifford Alexander and Associates. He was kind enough to join me here in our Washington studio. Thank you so much for coming in.  Mr. ALEXANDER: Oh, thank you, Michel Martin. It was a pleasure.  MARTIN: And that's our program for today. I'm Michel Martin, and this is Tell Me More from NPR News. Let's talk more tomorrow.   MICHEL MARTIN, host:   I'm Michel Martin, and this is Tell Me More from NPR News.   It's time for Wisdom Watch. Our conversation with leaders who've gone before us, those with experience, and knowledge. Not just smart, but wise. Our guest today, former Secretary of the Army, Clifford Alexander. He spent his career attempting to ensure equal opportunity for women and people of color, particularly in the work place. His resume is a long list of firsts, including being the first African-American Secretary of the army. So, Mr. Secretary, thank you so much for coming.   Mr. CLIFFORD ALEXANDER (Former Secretary of the Army): Thank you so much, Michel.   MARTIN: You spent most of your life fighting inequality. We want to talk a lot about that, but today marks the fifth anniversary of the beginning of the Iraq War. And early on, you took a strong position against the war, far earlier than many people in your peer group people, particularly with military experience, and just, I'd like to ask you why?   Mr. ALEXANDER: When I saw the facts, I saw nothing that would provoke something unique in the American society. That is, that without being attacked, that the United States, on some very, very flimsy evidence would go into another country, particularly a country with no overt threat to our society right here. There was a great deal of flag waving at the time, and there was a great deal of trying to, I think, change the subject, for a relatively inactive president, at the time, who's spending his time somewhere after 9/11 down at the ranch.   Before 9/11, not looking at the evidence related to that, and now you had a country coming together because we had been attacked by a group of disorganized hateful people that really were not in Iraq.   MARTIN: Do you feel, though, that the president deliberately distorted available facts in order to arrive at the conclusion that he arrived at, or do you believe that he simply made a mistake?   Mr. ALEXANDER: I think almost the worst thing about this president is his lack of depth in anything. This is a man who seems to just react, and he is one of these people that -we used to call them punks on the playground in Harlem. What they would do, they would be all big and bad before the game started but once the game was started, they would often shy away because they didn't have the skills.   This man has not had the skills in any particular area that I can see, and to commit men and women in uniform and their lives, was a singularly irresponsible act.   MARTIN: So no secret here, but you're a Democrat.   Mr. ALEXANDER: I am a Democrat, but when I sort of list the things that I am, it's way down on list. But I am a Democrat and I tried to, I hope with some success, as the Secretary of the Army, not be a, quote, unquote, \"Democrat\", because I think the issues are far more important than Democrat or Republican.   MARTIN: Do you think it's important to point out that you are a supporter of Senator Barack Obama's candidacy for the presidency? That would be accurate, right?   Mr. ALEXANDER: It would be more than accurate. I am, and my son is the policy director of his campaign, and I've known him for over a dozen years. And Michel, I think a great deal of him and of him substantively. And I certainly don't hide my praise of him.   MARTIN: But you also know the Clintons too. And having been around for sort of quite a long time, having worked on these issues for quite a long time, I would just like to know why you think he's the best candidate for this position? And also, in contrast to Senator McCain who, obviously, is someone you would know.   Mr. ALEXANDER: Let me start first with the attributes that I believe makes him more than competent to do the job. He has a sense of reason about him. He is thoughtful. He has shown his capacity to execute, particularly during this campaign. He's run a fascinating campaign, which you have to put together. I ran for office, unsuccessfully, once myself in the District of Columbia. That this, on a nationwide scale, raising more money than anybody else, having more volunteers than anybody else, winning, I think, it's 29 out of - and his opponent, Mrs. Clinton has won only 14 Caucuses and primaries. That is extraordinary.   There is this business that Mrs. Clinton often talks about. Fe hasn't passed the test for Commander in Chief. Well, she wrote the test, so I don't think your opponent writes the test for Commander in Chief. The real test for Commander in Chief is the test of whether someone is capable of seeing other human beings, their strengths and weaknesses, seeing the world on a much larger stage than I think either of the other two candidates do.   MARTIN: Just wondered how your earlier experiences have kind of informed how you saw your job in Washington, what you thought you were here to do.   Mr. ALEXANDER: Very - it's an excellent question. It's been so long, but let me see if I can recreate that sort of, at least two or three parts to it. One part would be when I came to work for President Kennedy. There, I was working on the National Security Council staff with the late Michael Forrestal, the son of the former head of the Defense Department James Forrestal, who is a delightful human being and a very smart one. My interest, however, was domestic policies, and my interests always have and will be until the day I die, better opportunities for women and minorities in this country and for everybody else. But they're the ones who need, if you will, the most attention and discussion in this country.   So I was lucky enough to work with a man named Louis Martin. Louis Martin was better than great. He was from your profession and also a politician. He was an owner and writer for the SingStat Publications, and he also was a man who did a great deal to get black people into the Kennedy and Johnson administration.

And I interacted on his behalf with Martin Luther King, Dorothy Height, Roy Wilkins, Whitney Young, John Lewis - the heads of the leadership of the civil rights movement.   MARTIN: What was he like?

Joining us in the studio is Undersecretary of the Treasury Robert Steel. Welcome. Good day. Undersecretary Robert Steel (U. S. Department of Treasury): Good afternoon. Thank you. SIEGEL: As we've heard, this is a long-term project that was begun a while ago and will take some time to approve. But, is there anything in the treasury a blueprint that you think had it been part of existing law and regulation might have averted any of the problem as the mortgages, mortgages back security that we're now focus on so much. Undersec. STEEL: Well, let me step back, Robert, and first of all, thank you for inviting me. And to the question, I think the primary focus at Treasury has been working through the challenges that are representing themselves. We began to discuss these issues last August with the president and his specifically tasked Secretary Paulson to basically focus on these issues, which were related to homeowners and keeping homeowners in their home. And they were also related to making recommendations about what we've learned specifically from the situation. About two weeks ago, we issued a present working group report that focus on the shorter-term issues of lesson to learn. The blueprint today is really have a longer-term nature that I think is less for a specificity about the issues of the day, but more the long-term construct for I had think about things. SIEGEL: But, I did read in part of the blueprint offers en example of exempting the Federal Reserve might be able to do with some new market stabilization function would be given; that it could evaluate risk management; that it could inform people of the risks of certain kinds of securities. Is that realistic? I mean everyone on Wall Street could have looked at securities that are being issued and evaluated the risk could another few dozen people the Federal Reserve have done that much better that anyone else did. Undersec. STEEL: Well, I think the key issue maybe is of a broader nature with this description of someone who has responsibility for overall risk in the system or systemic risk, and that responsibility is awarded to the Federal Reserve on the longer-term model that we outlined. Any idea is that someone should be looking at things overall, not to provide the specific regulation about its certain type of institution of the safety and sound [\u2026] institution, but taking a broader look over everything. And those institutions that might not have a prudential regulator such as hedge funds private equity that the Federal Reserve in this role as the overall's reviewer of systemic risk, would have line of sight and be a responsible for looking at those institutions in addition to the others. SIEGEL: But you, like Secretary Paulson, you're a Goldman Sachs (unintelligible). I while ago, I understand but do you think that on Wall Street you would have welcome to the fed as the arbiter of risk, and that's appropriate risk in such noble as securities? Undersec. STEEL: Well, I think its - hopefully we're moving past our roles that we might have in the past and we're now thinking from a policy perspective. And I think the idea - we really try to outlined three specific blanks(ph) for the longer-term perspective here. One is the overall idea of someone who's responsible for looking out for the overall risk of the system. Two, a second layer of regulator who's responsible for how individual organizations that have a federal guarantee operate. And the third is the new idea, which is someone who's specifically responsible and their dedicated goal is consumer protection. And so, this third peeler is really a new focused area, whereas those responsibilities today are in several different institutions. This is bringing you together which we think, actually brings more focus to that issue. SIEGEL: In the couple of areas, insurance and mortgage brokers, the Treasury's outline seems to offer new federal roles, that at least compete with a bit of subsume state authority. Is federalism one of the inefficiencies that holds back the American financial services factor? And it would be easier to simply have one set of regulations? Undersec. STEEL: Well, I think that you're poking in a very important issue, when I think the right issue here is balance. For example, in insurance, we proposed an optional federal charger, where people can choose between the two. And with regards to mortgage origination, we talked about a new idea - a mortgage origination commission. And one of the seated members of that commission is specifically described as someone from the states. And the goal is the key SIEGEL: But we have federal commission, though? Undersec. STEEL: Yes, sir. But the states would still have the same responsibilities, and hopefully, the federal commission would set a guideline as to what is the proper process and the process procedures and the proper regulation, registration, etc, which is we view as good but, there's also be -the commission would provide a perspective on each state, so that if you wanted to invest in mortgage securities, you could see of this package of securities, how many come from what state and things like that? SIEGEL: Well, Undersecretary of the Treasury Robert Steel. Thank you very much for talking with us. Undersec. STEEL: Thank you.  ROBERT SIEGEL, host:  Well, now more on the financial blueprint that was released today. Joining us in the studio is Undersecretary of the Treasury Robert Steel. Welcome. Good day.  Undersecretary Robert Steel (U. S. Department of Treasury): Good afternoon. Thank you.  SIEGEL: As we've heard, this is a long-term project that was begun a while ago and will take some time to approve. But, is there anything in the treasury a blueprint that you think had it been part of existing law and regulation might have averted any of the problem as the mortgages, mortgages back security that we're now focus on so much.  Undersec. STEEL: Well, let me step back, Robert, and first of all, thank you for inviting me. And to the question, I think the primary focus at Treasury has been working through the challenges that are representing themselves. We began to discuss these issues last August with the president and his specifically tasked Secretary Paulson to basically focus on these issues, which were related to homeowners and keeping homeowners in their home. And they were also related to making recommendations about what we've learned specifically from the situation.  About two weeks ago, we issued a present working group report that focus on the shorter-term issues of lesson to learn. The blueprint today is really have a longer-term nature that I think is less for a specificity about the issues of the day, but more the long-term construct for I had think about things.  SIEGEL: But, I did read in part of the blueprint offers en example of exempting the Federal Reserve might be able to do with some new market stabilization function would be given; that it could evaluate risk management; that it could inform people of the risks of certain kinds of securities. Is that realistic? I mean everyone on Wall Street could have looked at securities that are being issued and evaluated the risk could another few dozen people the Federal Reserve have done that much better that anyone else did.  Undersec. STEEL: Well, I think the key issue maybe is of a broader nature with this description of someone who has responsibility for overall risk in the system or systemic risk, and that responsibility is awarded to the Federal Reserve on the longer-term model that we outlined.  Any idea is that someone should be looking at things overall, not to provide the specific regulation about its certain type of institution of the safety and sound [\u2026] institution, but taking a broader look over everything.  And those institutions that might not have a prudential regulator such as hedge funds private equity that the Federal Reserve in this role as the overall's reviewer of systemic risk, would have line of sight and be a responsible for looking at those institutions in addition to the others.  SIEGEL: But you, like Secretary Paulson, you're a Goldman Sachs (unintelligible). I while ago, I understand but do you think that on Wall Street you would have welcome to the fed as the arbiter of risk, and that's appropriate risk in such noble as securities?  Undersec. STEEL: Well, I think its - hopefully we're moving past our roles that we might have in the past and we're now thinking from a policy perspective. And I think the idea - we really try to outlined three specific blanks(ph) for the longer-term perspective here.  One is the overall idea of someone who's responsible for looking out for the overall risk of the system. Two, a second layer of regulator who's responsible for how individual organizations that have a federal guarantee operate.

Kurt Schmoke became Baltimore's first elected African-American mayor in 1988. He served three terms. Today, he is dean of Howard University's School of Law. He joins us by phone from his office here in Washington. Thank you so much for speaking with us. Dean KURT SCHMOKE (Dean, Howard University's School of Law; Former Baltimore Mayor): Thank you very much for having me. MARTIN: Now, Dean Schmoke, we've been asking our listeners and other guests on the program to tell us where they were, and how they heard that Martin Luther King Jr. had been killed. I'd like to ask you that question. Dean SCHMOKE: Well, I was away at college at the time, I was - actually, just as an aside, I was listening to Mayor D'Alesandro. He was mayor when I was in high school, and I agree with him. I thought that he was a very sensitive person, understood the problems in the community, and spoke at my high school often, so he was a real inspiration to me. But I was away at college in April of 1968. And that's when I heard the news and decided that I would come home when a riot broke out in Baltimore. And I came on the bus - and I got to the bus station in Baltimore early in the morning, and they wouldn't let any of us out. It was a - things were locked down. So by the time I got to Baltimore, we had, you know, troops in the streets, tanks rolling around. It was quite a surreal scene and only later that morning did they let us out, so that we could go to our homes.  MARTIN: Do you remember what affect that had on you? Dean SCHMOKE: Oh, it was quite a shock. I mean, it looked like something from, you know, a movie. It was just totally unreal. Although, I had seen scenes of that nature in other cities, you know, in previous years. They had the, you know, riots in Los Angeles, riots in Detroit, New York in '64. I mean, there were a number of places that you watched on the news, but, you know, I never thought it could happen in our city.  MARTIN: I was going to ask you that, because people often see scenes like this happening in other places, and they think to themselves, not here. I wanted to ask, did you feel that way? This. . . Dean SCHMOKE: Well, you know. . . MARTIN: This couldn't happen in my city. Dean SCHMOKE: You know, although we're 40 miles below the Mason-Dixon line, you know, Baltimore is often referred to as an up-south rather than down-south city. There's kind of a sense of civility and everybody trying to get along. Even though we were incredibly segregated city, at least residentially, but for example, in our high schools, Baltimore immediately integrated its schools right after the Brown decision in 1955 - didn't wait, didn't drag its feet. So there was a sense we were kind of making progress, even though, as Mayor D'Alesandro described, people weren't interacting except in the schools on a kind of day-to-day basis. But - so that's why it came as a shock. There had been no evidence in the early '60s, late '50s, of this kind of potentiality in Baltimore.  MARTIN: Part of the rage that sparked the riots was, I think, many people would agree, the lack of opportunity for African -Americans to fully participate in the life of the city. When you were elected, do you think that people invested a very great deal in that moment? In a way, do you feel that there was pressure for you that you could never really fulfill? Dean SCHMOKE: Well, the city, because of the riots in '68, had been scarred. I'd like to say it had been scarred, both physically and psychologically, and we were - by 1988, you know, when I was in my first year in office, we were recovering in many ways. Both the physical side, with the birth of - the rebirth of the downtown area, and Harbor Place and things of that nature. And so, that the physical side was looking better. The psychological side was still a work in progress, and so there was kind of a yearning from people for a new leadership that was going to deliver a new opportunity. So in some parts of the African-American community, the expectations were over-inflated. Others simply had reasonable expectations but definitely wanted me to deliver some opportunities that they had seen foreclosed in the past.  MARTIN: We took a tour of some of the affected areas of Baltimore last weekend. Drove around for hours, and saw just blocks and blocks of homes. . . Dean SCHMOKE: Yeah.  MARTIN: That were boarded up. Sometimes, maybe only one or two houses on the street. . . Dean SCHMOKE: Yeah.  MARTIN: Occupied. Why is that? That so many years later, it's still that way? Dean SCHMOKE: There - some of it is related to the 1968 and some related to another modern day menace, and that's lead paint poisoning in older homes. But the - going back to '68, one of the psychological scars was a fear, in a real sense of fear between whites and blacks. And '68, 1968, led to an amazing flight of whites out of the city, and then followed by middle class African-Americans. And so, although Baltimore had been losing population between 1950 and 1968, this flight became dramatic. And the years, about '68 to1980, somewhere in there - I mean, it was very significant and thus, you had a lot of abandonment of property. So people would - private people would hold on to it, wouldn't fix it up. It just kept deteriorating. Then, people would try to move into it and find lead paint problems. And you'd have to get people out of there. So most of those homes that are in the blocks that you're talking about are owned by private owners. They own three or four, not whole blocks, you know? You don't have major slumlords owning hundreds of hundreds of properties, but it's people holding on to property, waiting for the city to come and buy it up. The city has, though, you can see in Baltimore, kind of a tale of two cities. If you go to the downtown and around the stadiums, walk four or five blocks, you see some of the best in urban America. You walk another five or six blocks, away from that area, you see some of the worst in urban America. And that's been the challenge for mayors over the last few decades. MARTIN: Briefly, Dean Schmoke, and you've been very generous with your time, what do you think needs to happen now to address fully the legacy of the '68 riots? To really help the cities like Baltimore recover? Is there anything that can be done? Dean SCHMOKE: The most important thing - the single most important thing that could happen would be an excellence in public education. If we had - if excellence was the rule in all of our schools and not the exception, you would see more families interacting together. You'd see residential integration rather then segregation. You'd see an investment in the city by middle class as well as, you know, what currently occupies our school system, which is two-thirds very poor people. So excellent public education, more than anything else, would be the catalyst for major development in that city.  MARTIN: And very briefly, how is that to be achieved, since you are already struggling to hold onto your taxes? Dean SCHMOKE: Well, that - it would require a combination of investment by local, state, and federal government. I mean, forget about the testing people for No Child Left Behind, you've got to invest in folks in early childhood education. But that would be the key. One thing that could be done is for the three levels of government to invest in public education, and that would bring about a real turnaround.  MARTIN: Kurt Schmoke served as the mayor of Baltimore city for 12 years, from 1987-1999. He is now dean of Howard University's School of Law. He was kind enough to join us by phone from his office in Washington. Dean Schmoke, thank you so much speaking with us.  Dean SCHMOKE: Thank you.  MARTIN: I'm Michel Martin.

The war in eastern Congo has been going on for more than a decade. Millions of people are dead. And then there are the victims of widespread sexual brutality, women like these. Unidentified Woman: (Speaking in foreign language) (Soundbite of laughter) SIEGEL: And as odd as it may seem, given all the good cheer in the  room at that moment, Lisa Jackson, what all of these women have in common is that they've been terribly victimized by the war in Congo. Ms. LISA JACKSON (Filmmaker, \"The Greatest Silence\"): Exactly. Every single one of them had been raped. And they all came - there were some of the lucky minority that actually made it to this NGO called Women for Women International that gave them shelter and was kind of giving them training skills. But they had all come together to talk to me about their experiences. SIEGEL: Do we have any idea how many women have been raped in the war in the Congo? Ms. JACKSON: These statistics are so hard to track. There is NGOs who'll give you numbers like 42,000 in the last year in this certain province or a hospital, say, 6,000 women sought care in the last eight months. But for every one of those, there are 10, 20, 30 that either can't make it to the hospital, aren't counted in these dreadful censuses. But you hear figures of upwards of a quarter of a million women and girls. SIEGEL: More than a quarter of a million women and girls who have been sexually assaulted either by militias, foreign militias, Congolese troops, whoever is fighting in the war. Ms. JACKSON: They face victimization from so many different fronts, from militias that have crossed the border from Burundi, from Uganda, from Hutu genociders(ph) who fled justice in Rwanda and have been living in the mountains of eastern Congo for the last 10, 12 years. And they also face assault by the very army and police forces that are supposed to protect them. And United Nation's peacekeepers have also been implicated in rape and sexual abuse. So, they're getting it from every quarter. SIEGEL: Someone who becomes a character in this movie is your interpreter, fixer Bernard, who I assume is Congolese, and I just want to play part of something that he says in English at one point near the end of the film. (Soundbite of movie \"The Greatest Silence\") Mr. BERNARD KALUME (Congolese Translator): Once the old woman talked about how she was raped by seven guys, really I went mad. And that thing that - I won't forget that woman. Her picture, her image will stay just in front of me all my life. SIEGEL: It's at least implicit in what Bernard Kalume says there that not every one in Congo has confronted what's happened to all of these women - but for this project, say, that you've done and other work that people have done. Ms. JACKSON: I think it's fair to say that there's not a huge debate in Congo itself about the fate of its women and girls. You have to remember, first, that Congo is a country really without infrastructure. There are no roads, there's a minimal communication system, and there are different languages that are spoken on the eastern border and in the west. And in the west is Kinshasa, where the capital is, where they speak Lingala and live in pretty much isolation from the horrific realities in the east, where this conflict has been raging for the last 10 years. SIEGEL: One of the most extraordinary things that you do in \"The Greatest Silence\" is you go twice to interview groups of soldiers, armed men, who seemed to be living in the bush for many years, who've committed many rapes. This is what one man says when you ask him about rapes that he has committed. Unidentified Man: (Lingala spoken) SIEGEL: In the subtitles, you translate that as, if she says no, I must take her by force. If she's strong, I'll call some friends to help me. Yes, she's a human being, but when I feel I want a woman and she is there and my wife is not there, I must do it. Ms. JACKSON: Pretty extraordinary that they would say this to me without remorse, without guilt, without shame, and without any fear of reprisal. You really can say that there's a culture of impunity in the Congo, where none of these men will face arrest for what they've confessed to me on videotape. And after the interview, one of the most chilling moments in my long career, they just melted back into the bush, and I couldn't help but wonder who will be their next victims. SIEGEL: You tried to put it to a group of these rapists, these soldiers. What if your sister, what if your mother were raped by people? How would you feel about that? Well, that was not on. I mean, they would kill for that. But somebody had mentioned that if it were for the good of the country somehow, that would be justified. Ms. JACKSON: That soldier was a member of the Mai-Mai militia. The Congolese army is a pretty dysfunctional, motley assortment of militias that were absorbed in an attempt to make a coherent force. And the Mai-Mai are very superstitious and actually believe that rape enhances their prowess in battle. So, yes, that one man, when we pressed him, what if you would walk in on your wife being raped? Well, it depends. If she was being raped to save the Congo, I would not interfere. SIEGEL: Yeah. The crime of rape is - the offense is multiplied because first is the actual assault and very often, an assault that leaves a woman terribly injured as a result and disabled as a result. But then, there's the rejection by her husband, which is quite common, you say. Ms. JACKSON: They're rejected. I met so many women, especially in this small village where I spent a lot of time, who had four, five, six children. Their husband had moved to another village, had taken another wife. They were cast off their land, out of the village, with no visible means of support. The kids then become pickings for the militias to become conscripted as child soldiers. They end up working in the illegal mineral mines. And you can see firsthand how rape affects one woman then affects the family, then affects the culture. It's a femicide that is breaking down traditional villages and a way of life. SIEGEL: The personal experience that you brought to this project was that you as a young woman in Washington, D. C. - you're the victim of a gang rape some years ago. Ms. JACKSON: It's true. I'd knew going to eastern Congo as a white woman alone in the bush with a video camera that I might - as well have landed from a spaceship. So, I came with photographs of my family, postcards of New York to show them where I lived. And I was also - talked very freely about my own victimization, which left them in a state of disbelief. They wanted all the details. Who were the men? How is it that they were not captured? And was there a war in your country? SIEGEL: Yeah, was there a war? That was the question that rape signified for them. Ms. JACKSON: Was there a war? Exactly, and that a white woman could be victimized in a country that was at peace took a lot of explaining. SIEGEL: Was there a therapeutic dimension for you in doing the film? Ms. JACKSON: I think it was very validating for the women themselves. And to be sort of a channel or a medium for them was therapy for me. They would talk for 10, 20 minutes at a time, just pouring it all out. A lot of it in native languages that I didn't understand, I didn't really know what they were saying until I got back and worked with translators here. But the passion and the anguish really required no translation. SIEGEL: In Congo, this war has been going on for - depending on how you count, I guess - at least for 10 years, involving several countries and several different factions. As you say, a generation of child soldiers has been pressed into service already. There's a minute law-enforcement effort to try to deal with sexual violence. And there are some NGOs offering shelter to women.  Beyond those modest solutions, the overall picture seems terribly bleak. It just seems as though there's no reason why this won't go on for another 10 years.  Ms. JACKSON: It's a little stupefying to me why this war has received so little coverage. The last estimates by the International Rescue Committee, that 5. 4 million civilians have died, is stunning. I mean, that's 10 times the number of casualties in Darfur. It's Africa's world war, and it's been the deadliest conflict since World War II. SIEGEL: Lisa Jackson, thank you very much for talking with us. Ms. JACKSON: Thank you. SIEGEL: Lisa Jackson's documentary, \"The Greatest Silence: Rape in the Congo,\" premiers tonight on HBO. NORRIS: You're listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  ROBERT SIEGEL, host:  Filmmaker Lisa Jackson went to the Democratic Republic of Congo - the country that used to be called Zaire - to document one dimension of the horrific war there: rape. The war in eastern Congo has been going on for more than a decade. Millions of people are dead. And then there are the victims of widespread sexual brutality, women like these.  Unidentified Woman: (Speaking in foreign language)  (Soundbite of laughter)  SIEGEL: And as odd as it may seem, given all the good cheer in the  room at that moment, Lisa Jackson, what all of these women have in common is that they've been terribly victimized by the war in Congo.  Ms. LISA JACKSON (Filmmaker, \"The Greatest Silence\"): Exactly. Every single one of them had been raped. And they all came - there were some of the lucky minority that actually made it to this NGO called Women for Women International that gave them shelter and was kind of giving them training skills. But they had all come together to talk to me about their experiences.  SIEGEL: Do we have any idea how many women have been raped in the war in the Congo?  Ms. JACKSON: These statistics are so hard to track. There is NGOs who'll give you numbers like 42,000 in the last year in this certain province or a hospital, say, 6,000 women sought care in the last eight months. But for every one of those, there are 10, 20, 30 that either can't make it to the hospital, aren't counted in these dreadful censuses. But you hear figures of upwards of a quarter of a million women and girls.  SIEGEL: More than a quarter of a million women and girls who have been sexually assaulted either by militias, foreign militias, Congolese troops, whoever is fighting in the war.  Ms. JACKSON: They face victimization from so many different fronts, from militias that have crossed the border from Burundi, from Uganda, from Hutu genociders(ph) who fled justice in Rwanda and have been living in the mountains of eastern Congo for the last 10, 12 years. And they also face assault by the very army and police forces that are supposed to protect them. And United Nation's peacekeepers have also been implicated in rape and sexual abuse. So, they're getting it from every quarter.  SIEGEL: Someone who becomes a character in this movie is your interpreter, fixer Bernard, who I assume is Congolese, and I just want to play part of something that he says in English at one point near the end of the film.  (Soundbite of movie \"The Greatest Silence\")  Mr. BERNARD KALUME (Congolese Translator): Once the old woman talked about how she was raped by seven guys, really I went mad. And that thing that - I won't forget that woman. Her picture, her image will stay just in front of me all my life.  SIEGEL: It's at least implicit in what Bernard Kalume says there that not every one in Congo has confronted what's happened to all of these women - but for this project, say, that you've done and other work that people have done.  Ms. JACKSON: I think it's fair to say that there's not a huge debate in Congo itself about the fate of its women and girls. You have to remember, first, that Congo is a country really without infrastructure. There are no roads, there's a minimal communication system, and there are different languages that are spoken on the eastern border and in the west. And in the west is Kinshasa, where the capital is, where they speak Lingala and live in pretty much isolation from the horrific realities in the east, where this conflict has been raging for the last 10 years.  SIEGEL: One of the most extraordinary things that you do in \"The Greatest Silence\" is you go twice to interview groups of soldiers, armed men, who seemed to be living in the bush for many years, who've committed many rapes. This is what one man says when you ask him about rapes that he has committed.  Unidentified Man: (Lingala spoken)  SIEGEL: In the subtitles, you translate that as, if she says no, I must take her by force. If she's strong, I'll call some friends to help me. Yes, she's a human being, but when I feel I want a woman and she is there and my wife is not there, I must do it.  Ms. JACKSON: Pretty extraordinary that they would say this to me without remorse, without guilt, without shame, and without any fear of reprisal. You really can say that there's a culture of impunity in the Congo, where none of these men will face arrest for what they've confessed to me on videotape. And after the interview, one of the most chilling moments in my long career, they just melted back into the bush, and I couldn't help but wonder who will be their next victims.  SIEGEL: You tried to put it to a group of these rapists, these soldiers. What if your sister, what if your mother were raped by people? How would you feel about that? Well, that was not on. I mean, they would kill for that. But somebody had mentioned that if it were for the good of the country somehow, that would be justified.  Ms. JACKSON: That soldier was a member of the Mai-Mai militia. The Congolese army is a pretty dysfunctional, motley assortment of militias that were absorbed in an attempt to make a coherent force. And the Mai-Mai are very superstitious and actually believe that rape enhances their prowess in battle. So, yes, that one man, when we pressed him, what if you would walk in on your wife being raped? Well, it depends. If she was being raped to save the Congo, I would not interfere.  SIEGEL: Yeah. The crime of rape is - the offense is multiplied because first is the actual assault and very often, an assault that leaves a woman terribly injured as a result and disabled as a result. But then, there's the rejection by her husband, which is quite common, you say.  Ms. JACKSON: They're rejected. I met so many women, especially in this small village where I spent a lot of time, who had four, five, six children. Their husband had moved to another village, had taken another wife. They were cast off their land, out of the village, with no visible means of support. The kids then become pickings for the militias to become conscripted as child soldiers. They end up working in the illegal mineral mines. And you can see firsthand how rape affects one woman then affects the family, then affects the culture. It's a femicide that is breaking down traditional villages and a way of life.  SIEGEL: The personal experience that you brought to this project was that you as a young woman in Washington, D. C. - you're the victim of a gang rape some years ago.  Ms. JACKSON: It's true. I'd knew going to eastern Congo as a white woman alone in the bush with a video camera that I might - as well have landed from a spaceship. So, I came with photographs of my family, postcards of New York to show them where I lived. And I was also - talked very freely about my own victimization, which left them in a state of disbelief. They wanted all the details. Who were the men? How is it that they were not captured? And was there a war in your country?  SIEGEL: Yeah, was there a war? That was the question that rape signified for them.  Ms. JACKSON: Was there a war? Exactly, and that a white woman could be victimized in a country that was at peace took a lot of explaining.  SIEGEL: Was there a therapeutic dimension for you in doing the film?  Ms. JACKSON: I think it was very validating for the women themselves. And to be sort of a channel or a medium for them was therapy for me. They would talk for 10, 20 minutes at a time, just pouring it all out. A lot of it in native languages that I didn't understand, I didn't really know what they were saying until I got back and worked with translators here. But the passion and the anguish really required no translation.  SIEGEL: In Congo, this war has been going on for - depending on how you count, I guess - at least for 10 years, involving several countries and several different factions. As you say, a generation of child soldiers has been pressed into service already. There's a minute law-enforcement effort to try to deal with sexual violence. And there are some NGOs offering shelter to women.  Beyond those modest solutions, the overall picture seems terribly bleak. It just seems as though there's no reason why this won't go on for another 10 years.   Ms. JACKSON: It's a little stupefying to me why this war has received so little coverage. The last estimates by the International Rescue Committee, that 5. 4 million civilians have died, is stunning. I mean, that's 10 times the number of casualties in Darfur.

I'm Robert Siegel. Three New York City police officers have been cleared of all charges in the fatal shooting of Sean Bell. Bell was the unarmed man who was shot with a hail of 50 bullets on his wedding day. Two of his friends were injured in the shooting. The case has been an emotional one in New York, raising questions about the use of force and fire power by the NYPD. As NPR's Robert Smith reports the not guilty verdict for the officers only heightened tensions over the incident. ROBERT SMITH: Sean Bell's mother cried when the verdict was read. The woman Bell was to marry walked out of the courtroom. One of Bell's friends shot by the officers that night bolted out the front door of the Queens Courthouse.

SMITH: For two months, New York City has been following the trial of the three undercover detectives: Michael Oliver, Gescard Isnora and Marc Cooper. There were the dramatic facts of the case - how Sean Bell and his friends had left the bachelor party at the Queens nightclub, how the officers thought there was a gun, how Bell had tried to drive away but ended up hitting an officer, the 50 bullets. The three young men were black, as were two of the officers who fired the shots, but outside the courthouse Leroy Gadsen of the NAACP argued that there was no justice for people of color. Mr. LEROY GADSDEN (President, Jamaica NAACP): In this courthouse for the past eight weeks, we have not heard one testimony. Not one testimony of any threat these young men posed to the police but anybody else. We haven't heard of any of these men having a gun, yet still we hear a verdict of not guilty.

I'm Melissa Block. ROBERT SIEGEL, host: And I'm Robert Siegel. For more than a quarter century, Justice Antonin Scalia has carried the conservative banner in the U. S. Supreme Court. His most controversial views have often failed to persuade his colleagues. But many analysts believe he has changed the terms of the debate on the court. With the addition of two new Bush appointees, Scalia finds himself in the majority on more and more cases. Well, now, he has written a book not about the law per se, but about legal advocacy. It's called \"Making Your Case: The Art of Persuading Judges. \" In an interview with NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg, Scalia explained his view of the U. S. Constitution. NINA TOTENBERG: Justice Scalia is blunt about his view of the Constitution. Here's how he put it in one speech. Justice ANTONIN SCALIA (U. S. Supreme Court): The Constitution that I interpret and apply is not living, but dead. TOTENBERG: The Constitution, he believes, is not flexible and its meaning cannot change over time. It was meant, he says, to impose rigid rules that cannot be changed, except by the difficult process of constitutional amendment. Justice SCALIA: Now, if you somehow adopt the philosophy that the Constitution itself is not static, but rather it morphs from age to age to say whatever it ought to say, which is probably whatever the people would want it to say, you eliminate the whole purpose of a constitution. And that's essentially what the so-called living constitution leaves you with. TOTENBERG: Scalia's critics contend he applies this view conveniently, that he ignores the original intent of the Framers when it suits him. For example, the writers of the Fourteenth Amendment, which guarantees equal protection of the law, also enacted some racial preferences. The debate at that time after the Civil War mirrored today's debate over affirmative action and racial preferences for former slaves and black soldiers prevailed. The argument made by Scalia's critics is that the men who wrote Fourteenth Amendment clearly intended and did, in fact, allow racial preferences to give black citizens a leg up in achieving their rightful place in society. And that, the argument goes, was the original intent of the Fourteenth Amendment. Justice SCALIA: I deny that. I don't think they were race specific; I think they were based upon the previous condition of servitude. When you've had a text that says you cannot discriminate on the basis of race, it means you cannot discriminate on the basis of race. TOTENBERG: Scalia's constitutional view has come to be called originalist. And at one point in his life, the justice conceded, he was a faint-hearted originalist, that's because, originally, the Constitution's Bill of Rights did not apply to the states and that would mean that state governments could discriminate on the basis of race or sex, that they could censor speech and almost certainly could establish official churches or engage in practices like compulsive sterilization. It would mean that practices like notching the ears of prisoners, which was accepted in 1791, would not be considered cruel and unusual punishment in modern times. Justice SCALIA: Well, I said I thought I might be a faint-hearted - I mean, I've decided that I'm not, though I'm a hard-headed originalist. TOTENBERG: Not that he wants to undo all the decisions of the past that he disagrees with. Justice SCALIA: You can't reinvent the wheel. You got to accept the vast majority of prior decisions, and I do that. When I argue for a return to originalism, I do not argue that all of the mistakes made in the name of the so-called living constitution be ripped out. I just say, you know, hey, you know, let's cut it out. Go back to the good, old dead constitution. TOTENBERG: In other words, he says, let bygones be bygones. That puts Scalia in a decidedly different camp than fellow conservative Justice Clarence Thomas, who Scalia concedes is far more willing to reverse past precedent. Justice CLARENCE THOMAS (U. S. Supreme Court): I'm a textualist. I'm an originalist. I am not a nut. And the mistakes that have been made, just let them lie, but let's cut out this living-constitution approach because it really places no restraints upon your judges. TOTENBERG: To illustrate his view, he points to the question of assisted suicide. Scalia and all of his fellow justices in 1997 upheld state bans on physician-assisted suicide for terminally-ill patients. But Scalia observes that decision means only that there's no constitutional right to physician-assisted suicide. States are free to ban the practice or legalize it and he pointed to Oregon, which has legalized it. Justice SCALIA: I have no problem with Oregon doing what it has done - legitimizing assisted suicide. TOTENBERG: Didn't you dissent when the court - when that case came here? Justice SCALIA: What? What\u2026 TOTENBERG: Didn't you say that the assisted suicide law violated a federal narcotics law? Justice SCALIA: Not the Oregon law that I'm talking about. I think Oregon, if it wishes to legitimize suicide, can do so. TOTENBERG: In fact, though, in the Oregon case, Scalia dissented on grounds other the Constitution when the court upheld the assisted suicide law. He would have invalidated it as a violation of the federal narcotics law. Scalia's critics accuse of him of judicial activism noting that the more conservative court of recent years has invalidated far more federal laws than the more liberal court of years gone by. Scalia says that's nonsense. Justice SCALIA: Just as there is such a thing as an activist court, there is assuredly such a thing as an activist Congress, which pushes the envelope with statutes that do things that had never been attempted before. And where that happens, you should expect a greater proportion of those congressional enactments to be invalidated. TOTENBERG: And not just congressional actions. Indeed, Scalia has surprised some critics by taking the most hard line view of what he sees as the excesses of the Bush administration in at least one area - the imprisonment without charge of U. S. citizens accused of being enemy combatants. Justice SCALIA: They couldn't hold them indefinitely. As with anybody arrested, you bring them to trial or you let them go. TOTENBERG: If in all this, Scalia sounds like a tough guy; his friends say he has a heart of mush. An only child, he and his wife, Maureen, have raised nine children to adulthood, including one in the military and one in the priesthood. Justice SCALIA: I take very little credit for the children. I was home for dinner and that was about it. TOTENBERG: She takes very good care of you, too. Justice SCALIA: She does that too. She says she has 10 children. TOTENBERG: Justice Antonin Scalia. His book, written with co-author Bryan Garner, is entitled \"Making Your Case: The Art of Persuading Judges. \" Nina Totenberg, NPR News, Washington. SIEGEL: And to hear more of Nina's interview with Justice Scalia, you can go to our Web site npr. org.  MELISSA BLOCK, host:  This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Melissa Block.  ROBERT SIEGEL, host:  And I'm Robert Siegel.  For more than a quarter century, Justice Antonin Scalia has carried the conservative banner in the U. S. Supreme Court. His most controversial views have often failed to persuade his colleagues. But many analysts believe he has changed the terms of the debate on the court. With the addition of two new Bush appointees, Scalia finds himself in the majority on more and more cases.  Well, now, he has written a book not about the law per se, but about legal advocacy. It's called \"Making Your Case: The Art of Persuading Judges. \"  In an interview with NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg, Scalia explained his view of the U. S. Constitution.  NINA TOTENBERG: Justice Scalia is blunt about his view of the Constitution. Here's how he put it in one speech.  Justice ANTONIN SCALIA (U. S. Supreme Court): The Constitution that I interpret and apply is not living, but dead.  TOTENBERG: The Constitution, he believes, is not flexible and its meaning cannot change over time. It was meant, he says, to impose rigid rules that cannot be changed, except by the difficult process of constitutional amendment.  Justice SCALIA: Now, if you somehow adopt the philosophy that the Constitution itself is not static, but rather it morphs from age to age to say whatever it ought to say, which is probably whatever the people would want it to say, you eliminate the whole purpose of a constitution. And that's essentially what the so-called living constitution leaves you with.  TOTENBERG: Scalia's critics contend he applies this view conveniently, that he ignores the original intent of the Framers when it suits him. For example, the writers of the Fourteenth Amendment, which guarantees equal protection of the law, also enacted some racial preferences.  The debate at that time after the Civil War mirrored today's debate over affirmative action and racial preferences for former slaves and black soldiers prevailed. The argument made by Scalia's critics is that the men who wrote Fourteenth Amendment clearly intended and did, in fact, allow racial preferences to give black citizens a leg up in achieving their rightful place in society. And that, the argument goes, was the original intent of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Justice SCALIA: I deny that. I don't think they were race specific; I think they were based upon the previous condition of servitude. When you've had a text that says you cannot discriminate on the basis of race, it means you cannot discriminate on the basis of race.  TOTENBERG: Scalia's constitutional view has come to be called originalist. And at one point in his life, the justice conceded, he was a faint-hearted originalist, that's because, originally, the Constitution's Bill of Rights did not apply to the states and that would mean that state governments could discriminate on the basis of race or sex, that they could censor speech and almost certainly could establish official churches or engage in practices like compulsive sterilization. It would mean that practices like notching the ears of prisoners, which was accepted in 1791, would not be considered cruel and unusual punishment in modern times.  Justice SCALIA: Well, I said I thought I might be a faint-hearted - I mean, I've decided that I'm not, though I'm a hard-headed originalist.  TOTENBERG: Not that he wants to undo all the decisions of the past that he disagrees with.  Justice SCALIA: You can't reinvent the wheel. You got to accept the vast majority of prior decisions, and I do that. When I argue for a return to originalism, I do not argue that all of the mistakes made in the name of the so-called living constitution be ripped out. I just say, you know, hey, you know, let's cut it out. Go back to the good, old dead constitution.  TOTENBERG: In other words, he says, let bygones be bygones. That puts Scalia in a decidedly different camp than fellow conservative Justice Clarence Thomas, who Scalia concedes is far more willing to reverse past precedent.  Justice CLARENCE THOMAS (U. S. Supreme Court): I'm a textualist. I'm an originalist. I am not a nut. And the mistakes that have been made, just let them lie, but let's cut out this living-constitution approach because it really places no restraints upon your judges.  TOTENBERG: To illustrate his view, he points to the question of assisted suicide. Scalia and all of his fellow justices in 1997 upheld state bans on physician-assisted suicide for terminally-ill patients. But Scalia observes that decision means only that there's no constitutional right to physician-assisted suicide. States are free to ban the practice or legalize it and he pointed to Oregon, which has legalized it.  Justice SCALIA: I have no problem with Oregon doing what it has done - legitimizing assisted suicide.  TOTENBERG: Didn't you dissent when the court - when that case came here?  Justice SCALIA: What? What\u2026  TOTENBERG: Didn't you say that the assisted suicide law violated a federal narcotics law?  Justice SCALIA: Not the Oregon law that I'm talking about. I think Oregon, if it wishes to legitimize suicide, can do so.  TOTENBERG: In fact, though, in the Oregon case, Scalia dissented on grounds other the Constitution when the court upheld the assisted suicide law.

What should you do if you get stopped by the police?  Maybe you've made an illegal U-turn, or you've broken a more serious law, or maybe you were minding your own business and don't know why you were stopped.  No matter what the case, there's a set of spoken and unspoken rules, that govern how we interact with law enforcement.   That's the topic of today's installment of our month-long series on criminal justice.  With us, Catherine Lhamon, Racial Justice Director at the ACLU of Southern California, and Jonathan Turley, professor of public interest law at George Washington University.  Hi folks. Professor JONATHAN TURLEY (Public Interest Law, George Washington University):  Hi. Ms. CATHERINE LHAMON (Racial Justice Director, ACLU of Southern California):  Thank you so much for having us on. CHIDEYA:  So, Catherine, let me start with you, and let me start with an example.  Say that you're in a car with your friend, who had been drinking at a bar.  You've had a drink or two yourself.  And you guys also have liquor in the car.  Suddenly, the red light start flashing, and your friend nervously pulls over.  So, what should you do?  Run out of the car, refuse to get out of the car when asked to, or start talking about what you've been up to that night, or none of the above?  What do you think? Ms. LHAMON:  I love these multiple choice questions.  (Soundbite of laughter) Ms. LHAMON:  It's like back to law school.  In general, my approach and the approach that I advise other people to take, is to be as deferential as possible with the police, and try to diffuse any tensions that a police officer might bring to the situation.  And in that situation, I would certainly not run from the car.  I always advise people not to run from the police, because the running - some courts have said that running give the officers probable cause to go after you.   So, you would like to not do that in general.  In that situation, I think I would politely ask the officer why I've been stopped.  I would give the officer my name, and the license and registration information for the car if I were the driver.  And then I would wait for the officer to ask any further questions. CHIDEYA:  If the officer asked to breathalyze you, can you say no? Ms. LHAMON: You can say no, and I would advise that people do say no. It may mean that you will end up at the station, and that you will have a longer interaction with the police, than if you agreed to the breathalyzer in the moment, but you don't have to do it if you are right there on the street. . CHIDEYA:  Jonathan, you know, this is not a conversation about drunk driving per se, but more about how you, you know, interact.  So, if you are a passenger in a car where someone has been drinking, or if you were with someone who you think has committed a crime, and you're stopped together. In general, what kind of liability, or responsibility might you bear as someone who is more of a bystander? Professor TURLEY:  Well, it depends on what the alleged crime is. I mean, obviously drinking and driving is an offense related to the driver.  It is something that would not be imputed, or vicariously imposed upon the passengers. However, having open containers in a car, is something that passengers could conceivably be charged with in some cases.  And there are collaterally-related crimes that they could bring as well.  I think that the important thing is not to be confrontational, to be cooperative.  Remember that if the police see conduct or behavior, that is furtive or aggressive, they can use that as reasonable suspicion, or even in some cases probable cause, for more intrusive actions, possibly even putting someone under arrest.  The important thing to remember as a passenger, you're not immediately guilty of anything.  And so, for example, being - having a breathalyzer demand, that from a passenger is a very odd thing for police to do, and there's no reason why a passenger needs to go through such a test. CHIDEYA:  Catherine, what about more serious crimes?  I'm thinking about - there have been several cases recently, where it can be either partner, but specifically women, wives or girlfriends have been sent to jail for not reporting the drug-dealing activities of their partner, or for doing things like laundering money.  In the case where you are with someone that you know is committing a criminal act, and it is of that magnitude, what kind of risk do you face, and what kind of issues are on the table? Ms. LHAMON:  So, it's a question, what kind of risk do you face when the police are in front of you, and have stopped you, or have come to your home? Or is the question. . . CHIDEYA:  Or just in general, I mean, in this case not when you're stopped, but if you are partnered or involved with someone who is committing a crime, and you don't think that you are committing a crime, are there ever cases were you are liable? Ms. LHAMON:  Well, there are, in the kinds of cases that you have just talked about.  And I think, you know, we normally think of guilt by association, as something that is not really part of our criminal law.  But there are instances in which you can be seen as part of the conspiracy, or as part of a drug ring for example.   And there is some danger in continuing to associate with somebody, whom you know to be engaged in criminal activity.  Likewise, there are, I am sure many listeners know, a number of gang injunctions in effect around the country, and most of the people who are subject to those gang injunctions are not active gang members, like other people who are gang associates, or hangers-on, which really means that they are residents in a neighborhood were there is an active gang.   So there are a number of ways in which one can get swept up into potential criminal liability without engaging in what most of us consider particularly (unintelligible) activity. CHIDEYA:  You are the Racial Justice director at the ACLU Southern California. Do you think there is ever bias, or misapplication of the laws that govern association with known criminals, when it comes to race? Ms. LHAMON:  Sure, I am deeply upset about the existence of gang injunctions around the country. I think that they shouldn't be in use, I think that typically, the police officers who are then enforcing those gang injunctions are over reaching.  Most of the people who are subject to those injunctions, are residents who live in low-income communities, and they tend to be all people of color, and they all are considered to be gang members by the officers who are working those beats, not necessarily because they are in fact active gang members.   I have a number of clients, and have litigated a number of cases that involved racial profiling.  I hear stories about racial profiling nearly everyday in my work, and I am deeply disturbed by the statistics I see in my local jurisdiction. I am in Los Angeles among the LAPD in the sheriff's department.  I continue to see very serious instances of racial profiling, that I find enormously upsetting. CHIDEYA:  Jonathan, along the same lines, how do you think the issue of racial profiling plays out on a practical level?  I mean, there is the whole concept of driving while black, and it's come up in cases involving the Maryland highway patrol, and many other places.  If you feel that you've been pulled over without cause, what rights do you have? Professor TURLEY:  Well, I think once again, you have to be careful not to take actions that would give the police reasonable suspicion, or probable cause to take more aggressive action.  And indeed I know a plenty of cases, I am a criminal defense attorney on the side, and I know plenty of cases where police have indeed tried to get people to act that way.  I mean it is pretty clear that they're looking for something to ratchet up in the encounter.   People also need to recognize that the Supreme Court has made it easier for these types of stops to occur, and actually a case out of Washington DC, called Whren versus the United States, this was a 1996 case.  The court actually upheld the right of police to use a pretext to stop someone, if that I - it has long been viewed that the police had to have a legitimate reason to stop a car.  But what the court said was even though these group of detective didn't - wasn't supposed to stop cars for traffic violations in minor issues, that they could in fact do that as a pretext.   So it was perfectly clear in Whren, that these were officers who were just using a minor traffic issue, in order to stop a car, and from that encounter then ratchet up the matter, and ultimately leading to a full arrest.  So you do have a much more difficult situation now, because of the Supreme Courts ruling.  The court has also said that profiling is OK, while suggesting that pure racial profiling, based entirely on race, is not.  But that doesn't help much, because the court has said that police officers can use profiles, in order to get reasonable suspicion, or in some cases even probable cause. CHIDEYA:  Well, Jonathan, give me an example of what a profile might consist of in that case? Professor TURLEY:  Well you know, I sort of teach in the area, I always have fun with my students, because I give them profiles that we've seen in other cases, where, for example at airports the police would say that the reason they stopped someone, is because they were getting off the plane first, and wanted to know, \"What's your hurry? \" And in another case they said the person held back, and was last off the plane, and why was he holding back?   And so all these profiles can be pretty arbitrary and transparent, but there are plenty of standard profiles that they look to, you know, they involve everything from having your lights off on a car at night, to repeatedly passing by a location as if you're scoping out, or looking for possible criminal activity.  There are literally dozens of different things that the officers have cited.  And these are all an effort to get away from race.   It is very rare that an officer will honestly say, I stopped that guy because he was Hispanic, or an African-American.  The other thing that - as I wanted to mention with the earlier hypothetical of being stop, or held, when someone is busted in an apartment. Once again, you need to be careful.  The officers are allowed to detain everyone in the house, while the arrest or search is going on.  So the important. . . CHIDEYA:  And that would be true in cases where there would be marijuana or other drugs, as well as presumably other crimes that may have been alleged. . . Professor TURLEY:  Yeah. The important thing is to keep a steady head.  I don't - you have to recognize that they have this authority.  They also have the authority to pat down for their safety, and so you are going to have expect that.  But that doesn't mean you are without your rights.  It's just that, if you get aggressive, the officers are going to quickly ratchet up the encounter, and you are going to end up under arrest. CHIDEYA:  Catherine, lets go through you.  You mentioned in general that it's good to be differential.  But let's run through, you know, some tips, just generally two or three tips, when it comes to being approached by the law. Ms. LHAMON:  Well, my number one tip is, do not consent to a search of your person or your home. You know, that - unless the officers have a warrant, or probable cause, or reasonable suspicion, they cannot search you, and they cannot search your home unless you consent.  And I am dismayed by the number of people, who find themselves intimidated by the police into giving consent.   Having said that my number one caution is, do not give consent, I think that there are circumstances under which one might elect to give consent.  So let me say what those are, if you are positive that you are the only person who has been in your car, and might have put anything in your car, and the only person whose using your apartment, and you are positive that there - that you have nothing illegal, and that you are not engaged in any illegal activity.  And you have reason to trust the officer who is in front of you, or that apartment that you are subject to, then you can make things speedier by consenting.   But I think that those circumstances are rare.  And the more common course of prudence, would be not to consent.  It can be scary not to consent. Often officers - it's speedier for the officers if you do consent, so often officers try to intimidate people into getting consent, but it is generally the course of prudence not to do it.  You also should know that you don't need to answer officers' question, unless you are in fact under arrest.   And so as an officer stopped you on the street, and begin to ask questions, you can ask if you are free to go and if the officer said yes, then walk away and you can say I don't want to talk right now.  I think in general, it's a good idea to protect yourself, and to be very cautious about what information you share with an officer. CHIDEYA:  Let me get Jonathan in here.  I want to ask you specifically, Jonathan, about Miranda rights.  I know there have been some recent rulings, that I believe may diminish the grounds that you have to have the, you know, \"You have the right to remain silent,\" speech delivered.  What are the changes that have happened in Miranda rights? Professor TURLEY:  Well you know, there was a quite a - there was a considerable surprise from many of us when the Supreme Court under the Chief Justice Rehnquist, ruled that Miranda was constitutionally based, because until very recently there was a great debate, as to whether it was even a constitutional doctrine.  But you know, when they did ultimately say, \"All right, it is constitutionally based,\" they had already made so many exceptions to Miranda, that there were more holes, than cheese in the doctrine.   And so, first of all, Miranda protects you from having statements being used at court.  It's not a get-out-of-jail free card.  And so, even when you have a Miranda violation, it does not mean necessarily that you are going to see the case drop.  Second, Miranda is something that can be easily waived, and you have to be very careful.  Officers know that people don't like to invoke their right to remain silent, because it makes them look like they are guilty.   But people also to need to recognize that there are great perils, even when you are innocent, if you are the suspect of a crime.  And so it is always better, if you are suspect of a crime, to speak with an attorney.  By the time people realize that, it's often too late.  And we can't make this catwalk backwards, because you have already waived your Miranda rights.  So they will state Miranda to you, and they will ask you expressly whether you waive the right to remain silent and to seek counsel. . . CHIDEYA:  Well Jonathan, we have to wrap it up there, but Jonathan and Catherine, I want to thank you for your time. Ms. LHAMON:  Thanks so much. Professor TURLEY:  Great pleasure.

The court actually upheld the right of police to use a pretext to stop someone, if that I - it has long been viewed that the police had to have a legitimate reason to stop a car.  But what the court said was even though these group of detective didn't - wasn't supposed to stop cars for traffic violations in minor issues, that they could in fact do that as a pretext.    So it was perfectly clear in Whren, that these were officers who were just using a minor traffic issue, in order to stop a car, and from that encounter then ratchet up the matter, and ultimately leading to a full arrest.  So you do have a much more difficult situation now, because of the Supreme Courts ruling.  The court has also said that profiling is OK, while suggesting that pure racial profiling, based entirely on race, is not.  But that doesn't help much, because the court has said that police officers can use profiles, in order to get reasonable suspicion, or in some cases even probable cause.  CHIDEYA:  Well, Jonathan, give me an example of what a profile might consist of in that case?  Professor TURLEY:  Well you know, I sort of teach in the area, I always have fun with my students, because I give them profiles that we've seen in other cases, where, for example at airports the police would say that the reason they stopped someone, is because they were getting off the plane first, and wanted to know, \"What's your hurry? \" And in another case they said the person held back, and was last off the plane, and why was he holding back?    And so all these profiles can be pretty arbitrary and transparent, but there are plenty of standard profiles that they look to, you know, they involve everything from having your lights off on a car at night, to repeatedly passing by a location as if you're scoping out, or looking for possible criminal activity.  There are literally dozens of different things that the officers have cited.  And these are all an effort to get away from race.    It is very rare that an officer will honestly say, I stopped that guy because he was Hispanic, or an African-American.  The other thing that - as I wanted to mention with the earlier hypothetical of being stop, or held, when someone is busted in an apartment. Once again, you need to be careful.  The officers are allowed to detain everyone in the house, while the arrest or search is going on.  So the important. . .  CHIDEYA:  And that would be true in cases where there would be marijuana or other drugs, as well as presumably other crimes that may have been alleged. . .  Professor TURLEY:  Yeah. The important thing is to keep a steady head.  I don't - you have to recognize that they have this authority.  They also have the authority to pat down for their safety, and so you are going to have expect that.  But that doesn't mean you are without your rights.  It's just that, if you get aggressive, the officers are going to quickly ratchet up the encounter, and you are going to end up under arrest.  CHIDEYA:  Catherine, lets go through you.  You mentioned in general that it's good to be differential.  But let's run through, you know, some tips, just generally two or three tips, when it comes to being approached by the law.  Ms. LHAMON:  Well, my number one tip is, do not consent to a search of your person or your home. You know, that - unless the officers have a warrant, or probable cause, or reasonable suspicion, they cannot search you, and they cannot search your home unless you consent.  And I am dismayed by the number of people, who find themselves intimidated by the police into giving consent.    Having said that my number one caution is, do not give consent, I think that there are circumstances under which one might elect to give consent.  So let me say what those are, if you are positive that you are the only person who has been in your car, and might have put anything in your car, and the only person whose using your apartment, and you are positive that there - that you have nothing illegal, and that you are not engaged in any illegal activity.  And you have reason to trust the officer who is in front of you, or that apartment that you are subject to, then you can make things speedier by consenting.    But I think that those circumstances are rare.  And the more common course of prudence, would be not to consent.  It can be scary not to consent. Often officers - it's speedier for the officers if you do consent, so often officers try to intimidate people into getting consent, but it is generally the course of prudence not to do it.  You also should know that you don't need to answer officers' question, unless you are in fact under arrest.    And so as an officer stopped you on the street, and begin to ask questions, you can ask if you are free to go and if the officer said yes, then walk away and you can say I don't want to talk right now.  I think in general, it's a good idea to protect yourself, and to be very cautious about what information you share with an officer.  CHIDEYA:  Let me get Jonathan in here.  I want to ask you specifically, Jonathan, about Miranda rights.  I know there have been some recent rulings, that I believe may diminish the grounds that you have to have the, you know, \"You have the right to remain silent,\" speech delivered.  What are the changes that have happened in Miranda rights?  Professor TURLEY:  Well you know, there was a quite a - there was a considerable surprise from many of us when the Supreme Court under the Chief Justice Rehnquist, ruled that Miranda was constitutionally based, because until very recently there was a great debate, as to whether it was even a constitutional doctrine.  But you know, when they did ultimately say, \"All right, it is constitutionally based,\" they had already made so many exceptions to Miranda, that there were more holes, than cheese in the doctrine.    And so, first of all, Miranda protects you from having statements being used at court.  It's not a get-out-of-jail free card.  And so, even when you have a Miranda violation, it does not mean necessarily that you are going to see the case drop.  Second, Miranda is something that can be easily waived, and you have to be very careful.  Officers know that people don't like to invoke their right to remain silent, because it makes them look like they are guilty.    But people also to need to recognize that there are great perils, even when you are innocent, if you are the suspect of a crime.  And so it is always better, if you are suspect of a crime, to speak with an attorney.  By the time people realize that, it's often too late.  And we can't make this catwalk backwards, because you have already waived your Miranda rights.  So they will state Miranda to you, and they will ask you expressly whether you waive the right to remain silent and to seek counsel. . .  CHIDEYA:  Well Jonathan, we have to wrap it up there, but Jonathan and Catherine, I want to thank you for your time.  Ms. LHAMON:  Thanks so much.  Professor TURLEY:  Great pleasure.  CHIDEYA:  Jonathan is a professor of public interest law at George Washington University, and Catherine is the Racial Justice director of the ACLU of Southern California. And that is News & Notes.

Today, the U. N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he was immensely frustrated, and called Myanmar's distribution of aid unacceptably slow. International experts say the death toll from the cyclone more than a week ago could reach higher than 100,000. Now survivors face the threat of illness due to water contaminated by the bodies of victims, not to mention what could happen to them living without food or shelter. The United States' top diplomat, Shari Villarosa, was standing in the runway as the first American cargo plane arrived. I spoke with her earlier today. Ms. SHARI VILLAROSA (U. S. Diplomat): It landed on the runway. It unloaded the cargo. There was reception committee of senior Burmese officials. We had a ceremony turning over the goods to the deputy minister of social welfare, who's sort of responsible for coordinating relief. We met with Burmese officials for about an hour. They took us by where they unloaded the relief supplies that we had just donated and had put them into helicopters to take them out to the Irrawaddy Delta. NORRIS: What was actually onboard on that plane, and are you confident that the supplies there will actually get where it's needed? Ms. VILLAROSA: It was water, blankets, and mosquito nets. We're very hopeful. It's a little bit complicated to verify it, but we also informed the U. N. They have people throughout the delta, and they can track if these goods are being received. NORRIS: And the other aid that might be flown in from other countries, or rather relief organizations, what's expected in the next 24 to 36 hours? Ms. VILLAROSA: Well, today, one of the Burmese officials said basically they're averaging about 10 flights a day. The United States will send in two flights tomorrow. NORRIS: Can you share with us what actually transpired in that meeting? Did you get any other commitments from the government in Myanmar to open up and allow not just aid but also aid workers to enter the country? Ms. VILLAROSA: They've made it pretty clear that they welcome assistance, relief supplies, but at this time they're not permitting aid workers to enter. NORRIS: When you actually meet with Burmese officials, do you have any power or any influence over them to try to encourage them to open up the country to aid and to aid workers? Ms. VILLAROSA: Most of them, they don't have the decision-making authority; this is the problem. I mean, they're always very polite, but they can't make that decision. NORRIS: Who does have the authority to make these decisions? If the outside forces or the U. S. wants to put some sort of pressure on the government, where do they bring pressure to bear? Ms. VILLAROSA: On the senior-generals who are in Naypyidaw, the capital that's about 250 miles north of here. It was not hit by the storm. NORRIS: So what is your role in this now, if you're not able to persuade the government there to accept help? What do you do? Ms. VILLAROSA: You just can't give up, and I continue to hope that there will be a realization that the international community has genuine good intentions to help the people of this country recover from this terrible disaster, and that they will open up.

I'm Michele Norris. The world's largest charitable foundation has found a new leader. Today, the Bill and Gates Foundation announced that Microsoft veteran Jeff Raikes will be the philanthropy's new CEO. Mr. and Mrs. Gates sat down with me today for an exclusive interview to talk about the new CEO and new challenges at their foundation. We'll hear from them in just a moment. First, a bit about Jeff Raikes and the foundation. In early September, Raikes will replace Patty Stonesifer, who's retiring. Raikes was the head of Microsoft's business division. The Gates Foundation began in a small office over a pizza parlor back in 1994 and has since grown into a philanthropic giant with a $37 billion endowment. Today, given the recent challenges in getting international aid to Myanmar, I asked Bill Gates if the foundation has a role to play in disaster relief efforts there. Mr. BILL GATES (Founder, Microsoft Corporation): Yes. Emergency disaster relief is one of the things we get involved in. We immediately gave three million to three of the organizations in Myanmar. But we also fund them in advance so that they have the supplies and trained personnel for disasters, no matter where they may show up in the future. NORRIS: Bill Gates, has it been personally frustrating, though, watching what's going on in Myanmar? You have money to offer, perhaps assistance to give, but it's been so difficult to get any kind of aid or relief into the country. Mr. GATES: Well, I'm not really an expert on what's going on there. It's certainly disappointing if the resources aren't immediately getting where they're needed. NORRIS: I want to turn now to new leadership in the foundation. Could you tell us a little bit more about Jeff Raikes? I understand that he's someone that you've known for some time, and he's a native Nebraskan. Ms. MELINDA GATES (Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation): Well, we've known Jeff for over 20 years. And Bill and I have been fortunate enough to know Jeff and his wife Tricia and to travel quite extensively with them. And I think his leadership around the United Way in 2006, 2007 - he took on the Pacific Northwest campaign and ran one of the most successful campaigns United Way has ever had. But it was not just the leadership that he gave to that type of campaign, while he had a full job at Microsoft. It was the fact that Jeff went out at night on the homeless count to see what it means to sleep, you know, at 3:00 a. m. on the streets of Seattle, and then start to think about the larger issue of how would an organization like United Way, what were they already doing to tackle that issue? But really it also comes to down to a shared passion for the same values that we have in this 500-person organization that we have - and are committed to these issues of the developing world and the United States, and that's what we saw in Jeff. NORRIS: Some people are concerned that the Gates Foundation has so much money that they - have more money than, for instance, the World Health Organization, and that the foundation has become almost like an entity to itself that one is up to determining health policy and without always consulting all the people who have the best or the long-term experience in dealing with things like malaria or tuberculosis, or the control of HIV or HIV prevention. Is there a danger that the foundation can undermine the World Health Organization on the global level? Mr. GATES: Well, the foundation has supported the WHO a lot. We've given literally over billion dollars in grants to them, and they are the policy-making organizations. So having them work well is very, very important. They do not have in their budget money for drug research. Hardly anything was being spent on malaria research, hardly anything was being sent on tuberculosis, and that's the unique role we've come in, is to really highlight that more needs to be spent on these things, and then working together with the organizations that were already there. NORRIS: But Mr. Gates, the chief of the World Health Organization Malaria Program, for instance, has complained that the growing dominance of malaria research done by your organization lines up stifling a diversity of use among scientists. Mr. GATES: Well, if you look at the variety of our grants, the scientists don't all agree. But the previous situation, where nothing was being spent, that wasn't driving much discussion either. It was a completely neglected situation. NORRIS: Melinda? Ms. GATES: Well, I think one of the things that we've done in the last year to have people realize how much we really are listening to outside voices, is we've set up these advisory panels for all three areas that we're in. Three of the people that sit on our global health advisory panel, one is a former health minister from Botswana, one was involved in the redevelopment, recreation in South Africa, and another was from the ministry in India. So those strong outside voices are people that we are listening to. They're helping us gather real feedback from grantees on the ground. We want good criticism and good feedback so that we're doing better as an organization. We take that very, very seriously. NORRIS: When did the two of you decide to create this kind of foundation? And why tackle so many things - tuberculosis, malaria, AIDS? Why not just focus on one thing. Bill? Mr. GATES: We're focused on the diseases that were ignored, and these are the diseases of the poor. So that the market is not giving the signal that this work should be done. And so in the rich world, problems like baldness get funded with billions, whereas the things that really kill lots of people, like malaria and TB, used to get basically nothing. And once you improve health in a country, it really changes everything, because parents don't need to have this many children to be sure that someone will support them in their old age. And so population growth goes down, you can feed, you can educate, you can provide jobs. And the virtuous cycle that we've seen, fortunately, in most places in the world can be extended to these other countries. NORRIS: You talk about, Mr. Gates, the virtuous cycle. You know, you're not just doing this from Washington State, you've been traveling the world. I wonder if there's been, in terms of a personal cycle for you and something -the things that you've experienced on the ground in your travels; how have you changed through the course of this work? Mr. GATES: Well, Melinda and I take several trips every year. We like doing that together, where we can go into the slums and go, wow, you know, we, you know, this is so important to improve this. You know, it touches your heart and makes you rededicated to this when you actually see the people who need help. NORRIS: Melinda? Ms. GATES: Well, for me, particularly when I travel in the slums talking to the women about what is life really like for them and for their children, those are the experiences I carry back to the foundation. And when I walk through the door of the foundation and we're approving grants and we're talking about the business of the foundation, I really constantly try to go back to those women, what I say on the other side of the mat, because often you sit with them on one side mat and they're on the other. And I often try to say to myself, what would it be like for me and my children if we were on the other side of the mat? What would I need? What would I want from the world? And then I bring myself back to my side of the mat and say, okay what voice can I give to these women? That's what I carry with me. NORRIS: Bill and Melinda Gates, thank you very much for speaking with us. Ms. GATES: Thank you very much. Mr. GATES: Thank you. NORRIS: That was Bill and Melinda Gates speaking to us this morning from Medina, Washington. And we should note that NPR receives support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

But if we have small supplies like a ton-and-a-half truck, it's a lot easier to look into and see that's flour or oil for food and that kind of stuff. ADAMS: And what else are you taking in? ADAMS: Water, water tankers - to hospitals, mainly. We also take medicine, medical supplies. And we're coordinating with the Iraq government, in case we get massive displaced people from there. . . ADAMS: Mm-hmm. ADAMS: . . . if the fighting re-erupts again. ADAMS: In a larger sense, I know that you've been working on a program called the Neighborhood Reconstruction Program, which is designed to bring displaced people into the neighborhoods in Baghdad, to settle them in stable areas. How is that working out, and what is your intention there? ADAMS: We need to avoid the problem that happened in Sadr City. Sadr City, the people are very, very poor. They live on day-to-day basis. Their children barely get educated. They don't have enough supplies of electricity or water or medicine. They're desperate people. They have nothing to lose. So they become a wonderful media for - an excellent media for those who want to come and more or less recruit those group of people into doing things. And. . . ADAMS: Militias, you're talking about. ADAMS: Yes. If we can house those people, get them jobs, get them schooling, get them medication, the likelihood they'd become recruited gets less and less and less. ADAMS: So people coming back in, either who have left the country or have been displaced elsewhere in Iraq, coming in into Baghdad, let's say, where would they live? ADAMS: We build, and we are working with the - also the government of Iraq to build some housing units - 5,000 housing, and we hope to start before the end of this summer here, this summer 2008. ADAMS: Let's try to imagine a family here that's been, let's say, in Syria, has been encouraged to come back. What would be your sort of ideal scenario for that family coming back into Baghdad and finding a place to be a part of the neighborhood reconstruction program? ADAMS: The neighborhood reconstruction program is for those people who are already inside the country. Once outside sees that the ones inside has become more attractive, then that's the incentive for them to come back. I don't think we should encourage anyone to go back, saying, we will give them promises. Let them see on the ground what happens, and then they will find ways in to get, if there are jobs, if there is incentive that - true incentive, they will come back. ADAMS: Do you think they will settle? Do you think this idea is going to work? ADAMS: Well, in my judgment, that this is better than what they - what we have now. There's nothing there at the moment. And if there's nothing there, that's the solution we have. If you have a different solution, let me look at it and see if I can apply it on the ground. ADAMS: Dr. Said Hakki is president of the Iraqi Red Crescent Organization. Thank you for your time. ADAMS: Thank you, sir. NOAH ADAMS, Host:  Dr. Said Hakki is the president of the Iraqi Red Crescent Organization. He came to our studio earlier. I asked him about the group's efforts to deliver aid to the people of Sadr City. ADAMS: Getting the supplies has been difficult for the past three or four weeks. But we have sort of found out ways of getting the supplies through pushcarts or mules or small cars. Large convoys doesn't work there because of - the security situation is fragile there. So we try to avoid that. ADAMS: You are, in fact, sneaking supplies into Sadr City? ADAMS: No, we're not sneaking supplies. We have to get approval, but getting the supplies in as we need to get it in small batches rather than convoys.

ALEX CHADWICK, host:  I'm Alex Chadwick. Coming up, rising oil prices means good times for Texas. BRAND: First, though, to Guantanamo Bay. Charges against the September 11th 20th hijacker have been dropped. Mohammed al-Qahtani was one of six men charged with murder and war crimes in the 9/11 attacks. And here to tell us more is Dahlia Lithwick. She's Day to Day's regular legal analyst. She's also the legal analyst for Slate. com. And Dahlia, tell us more about Mohammed al-Qahtani, the 20th hijacker. DAHLIA LITHWICK: Right. The new 20th hijacker. You might remember, Madeleine, there was a long time that Zacarias Moussaoui, who went on trail and was sent to jail, was the 20th hijacker. So we've had a couple of those. Qahtani is known as Gitmo detainee number 063. The reason there's a pretty compelling case against him as the real 20th hijacker is that he tried to enter the U. S. in August of 2001, right before the September attacks.  Apparently Mohamed Atta, who was the leader of the whole team that landed up attacking the twin towers, was waiting outside for him at the Florida airport, and apparently, a vigilant immigration guard was bothered by the fact that he had no return ticket, 2800 dollars in cash in his pocket and couldn't identify the friend who was picking him up at the airport. So he was turned away, deported, and later picked up in Afghanistan, and then he's been held at Guantanamo ever since.  BRAND: Right. And he's one of the six charged, the so-called worst of the worst. One of those six is also Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged mastermind. So why were the charges dropped? LITHWICK: Well, we've been hearing reports from as long ago as 2006 that the charges were almost going to have to be dropped against al-Qahtani because of the way he'd been treated. Apparently, he was subject to all sorts of abusive if not torture interrogation, including being forced to urinate on himself, being subject to stress positions, sleep deprivation, extreme temperature differentials, inappropriate and harassing touching by female guards, forced to wear women's underwear.  So he recanted his own confession in 2006, saying he'd confessed only under those kinds of conditions. It's been very, very unclear ever since then that based on that kind of evidence whether they could in fact make a case against him.  BRAND: Did prosecutors say why they dropped the charges? Or is this conjecturing on the part of the defense? LITHWICK: They haven't said why they haven't dropped charges, and in fact, this was done without prejudice, as it's said, so they can certainly bring charges against him again. But certainly, something must have happened to make them believe that they could not go to trial against al-Qahtani.  BRAND: Meanwhile, there's another case going on, involving Osama bin Laden's former driver, Salim Hamdan. And there's a development in this case which is interesting. A top Pentagon official, actually the legal advisor to the office of military commissions, Brigadier General Thomas Hartmann, has been found to have exerted improper influence over this case. What's going on over there?  LITHWICK: That's right, Madeleine. On Friday, military judge at Guantanamo Captain Keith Allred issued a ruling that said, in effect, that Hartmann so blurred the roles of prosecution, defense, and judges that he could no longer be involved in Hamdan's case. In effect, the judge said that Hartmann's oversight over what's known as the \"convening authority\" had just pushed too far on small details.  The judge called it \"nano-management\" of the case, pushing the prosecutors to bring cases that were, quote, \"sexy,\" rather than cases that could win on their merits. And also, the implication is, I think, that he was pressing prosecutors to use evidence that they'd already deemed unreliable. Hartmann had tried to steamroll over that. And the judge just had a problem with it, and said Hartmann can no longer be involved in Hamdan's case.  BRAND: So, Dahlia, taking both of these developments, and they both seem to point to the fact that using coercive techniques or torture really is a problem in terms of prosecuting these cases. What does this mean for the general prosecution of these prisoners? LITHWICK: I think it really highlights a problem that we've talked about on and off for a couple of years, which is the government needed to make a decision immediately after 9/11 about whether it wanted to extract information, whether this was, in fact, a ticking-time-bomb situation, and the most critical thing was to torture people if you needed to but get information from them, or if they wanted to really highlight how the rule of law and due process worked in the West.  They made a decision to try to both, and it's coming clear that you cannot do both. If you're going to try to get information out of people, you can't turn around and try them using that information. And the most interesting thing I think it signals is that this is almost a rebellion that is happening from the ground up. Individual prosecutors from individual judges, from people who are saying, look, I'm a military person. I believe that these people are guilty. I believe in these tribunals, but I still can't go forward under these circumstances. This is not real evidence. BRAND: Thank you, Dahlia. LITHWICK: My pleasure, Madeleine.

This afternoon the Senate began debating the last war funding bill of the Bush administration. It will provide another $100 billion this fiscal year for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and billions more to be used by the next administration. But something is very different this time around. Some senators who voted repeatedly for earlier war funding bills are balking at doing it again. Some of them, one of them is the Senate's number two Democrat, Dick Durbin, as NPR's David Welna now reports. DAVID WELNA: A year ago this week the Senate faced another key war funding decision. President Bush had just vetoed a funding bill due to its timeline for withdrawing troops from Iraq. When Congress removed that timeline from the bill, the unfettered funding was opposed by only 14 senators. Illinois Democrat Dick Durbin was not one of them, even though he was against the Iraq war from the start. The reason he voted to fund the war, Durbin told his colleagues at the time, was simple. Senator DICK DURBIN (Democrat, Illinois): I will not take my feelings out on the troops that are in the field. I will continue to provide the resources they need to be trained and equipped and rested and ready to go into battle and to come home safely. The debate will continue over this policy, but our soldiers should never be bargaining chips in this political debate. And that's why I will vote this evening for this bill. WELNA: But last month at a hearing on the current war funding bill, Durbin clearly had changed his mind. He said he'd once concluded that voting to fund the war was the right thing to do for the troops. Sen. DURBIN: And now I've reached the definite conclusion. Sending a blank check to this president for this war is going to prolong the killing, prolong the deaths, the injuries that will return, and this president wants to hand of the ball on January 20, 2009 and walk away. WELNA: The following day, I asked Durbin what it was that changed his mind about voting to fund the war. Sen. DURBIN: Certainly when you are celebrating the first anniversary of a temporary surge with no end of sight, it's an indication to me that there was never good faith on the part of the administration to wind this war down. The president just doesn't want to face what could be a chaotic ending, but we may have to face under any circumstances. WELNA: And what about people who might say that Senator Durbin is not funding our troops who are in harm's way? Sen. DURBIN: Our troops will have the resources they need. I'm confident of that. WELNA: Because the war funding is considered must-pass legislation, it's become a kind of train for loading on all kinds of other funding requests, everything from a new G. I. bill to extending unemployment benefits. Durbin himself held a news conference late last month asking that $200 million be added to the bill for world hunger relief. Did that mean he'd vote for the war funding after all, if that money was added to it? Sen. DURBIN: Many times you find yourself faced with the dilemma of trying to achieve that goal at the expense of something else that's very important to you. I hope it doesn't come down to that. That's the best I could say at this moment. WELNA: Today, Durbin reaffirmed his intention not to vote for a war funding bill with no timeline for troop withdrawals. Sen. DURBIN: Unless there are conditions that start bringing the troops home, I will not give this president another blank check. WELNA: Durbin's main job in the Senate is to count how his fellow Democrats will vote. He says he's certain there are others who will also, for the first time, refuse to vote for war funding with no strings attached. Majority Leader Harry Reid noted that shift this morning on the Senate floor. Senator HARRY REID (Democrat, Nevada): In the past, war funding has been, after a lot of arm twisting and cajoling, there has been enough votes to get that. I don't know if the votes are here this time. WELNA: Last week the votes were not there in the House. Members at that time said they hope the Senate would approve the war funding.

It's the apparent cause of the seizure that he suffered on Saturday. With us from Boston, NPR health correspondent Richard Knox. Richard, what kind of brain tumor is this? RICHARD KNOX: It's called a glioma, and it was found in the left parietal lobe of Senator Kennedy's brain. That's at the top of the head, towards the back. There's a - it makes - it's one of the most common - it is, probably, the most common brain tumor of adults. There're about 9,000 a year, which doesn't make it a very common cancer, and we're told that it was found by biopsy, which is - means that they drilled a hole in the head to take a sample of the tissue. CHADWICK: Which means it's pretty conclusive a diagnosis. How is this tumor treated normally? KNOX: It's treated with radiation and chemotherapy. The radiation is directed towards the side of the tumor to try to shrink it, and then the chemotherapy is given over a period of months, presumably, to try to get as many of the cells as they can. The doctors say that the particular course of treatment that Senator Kennedy will have is yet to be determined. They need to do more tests. So that's why he's staying in the hospital. CHADWICK: So he is in the hospital. How is he doing there, do we know? KNOX: Well, we're told by various accounts that he's got energy and high spirits and is comfortable and has been talking and joking and watching movies and fielding phone calls from people, and well-wishers. You know, I don't think he is suffering any discomfort, from what they say. Also importantly, they say that he has not suffered any further seizures since the one on Saturday morning that brought him to the hospital in the first place. CHADWICK: Is there any more information on what did happen on Saturday? KNOX: Yes. His father-in-law provided a little bit more information recently. He said that he'd been playing with his dogs, in a sunny morning on Cape Cod, batting a ball around with his retrievers and felt odd, and he felt that he might fall, so he sat down. He'd been feeling, apparently, perfectly normal and healthy and energetic before that, and people thought it was a stroke because the symptoms of seizures sometimes can mimic those of stroke, and so rushed him to the Cape Cod hospital, and then they put him on a helicopter pretty fast and got him up to Boston where he normally gets his care, at the Mass General. CHADWICK: So, Richard, tell me, what is the, if there is a general prognosis, for a patient with glioma? KNOX: I think we have to be very careful at this point because first of all, we don't know too much about what kind of glioma that he's suffering from, and there are a number of different types and they carry different prognoses. The most aggressive kind, people can die within a year, but there's every reason to think that this may have been discovered early since he hadn't been suffering symptoms before, and he might have a good number of years left with good therapy. I'm sure he'll get good therapy. CHADWICK: And lots of people live beyond their projected prognosis times, so - NPR's Richard Knox, reporting from Boston. Richard, thank you. KNOX: You're welcome.

I'm Michele Norris. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton both campaigned in Florida today. A big question mark hangs over the Sunshine State. As you probably heard by now, Florida and Michigan were stripped of their delegates, a penalty imposed by the Democratic National Committee for holding their primary contests too early. Clinton won in both states but neither candidate campaigned in Florida and Obama was not on the ballot in Michigan. Getting those primaries to count is one final strategy for Hillary Clinton. Despite her big win in Kentucky yesterday, she still trails Obama in the delegate count. Today, Senator Clinton pressed again for the DNC to seat Florida's delegates. Barack Obama's primary win in Oregon yesterday gave him a majority of pledged delegates, and his visit to Florida is intended to underscore that state's importance in the general election. Earlier today, I spoke with David Axelrod, the chief strategist for the Obama campaign. I asked him, what would be an acceptable deal regarding those delegates from Florida and Michigan? Mr. DAVID AXELROD (Obama Strategist): We are committed to the seating of Florida and Michigan. We're absolutely resolute that that's going to happen. There's a rules committee meeting of the party at the end of the month at which this is going to be discussed. And we are open to compromise. We are willing to go more than halfway. We're willing to work to make sure that we can achieve a compromise. And I guess the question is, is Senator Clinton's campaign willing to do the same? NORRIS: You said you're willing to go more than halfway. What did you mean by that? Mr. AXELROD: Well, I mean, I think we're willing to make some sacrifices in order to accommodate these delegations. And again, Michele, I am absolutely convinced and committed, and Senator Obama feels strongly about this, that Florida and Michigan will be fully represented at the convention. NORRIS: You said you're willing to make sacrifices; what kind of sacrifices? What are you willing to put on the table? Mr. AXELROD: Well, obviously, any compromise is going to involve some give. And that means if there's something on the table, we're willing to consider it. That may include us yielding more delegates than perhaps we would have simply on the basis of the rules. NORRIS: If Barack Obama does emerge as the nominee in the general election, what is the campaign's plan for reaching out to blue-collar voters who say they will not vote for Barack Obama? And in answering this question just consider this number: 42 percent of Clinton voters in the Kentucky exit poll said they would vote for McCain over Obama in November and another 23 percent said they wouldn't vote at all. Mr. AXELROD: Well, look, there were exit polls in 2000 in which McCain voters in much larger numbers said they wouldn't vote for George W. Bush and he ended up winning that election. In the spring of 1992 there were a series of exit polls from campaigns after Bill Clinton had effectively secured the nomination in which a majority of voters said they wished they had a different nominee. I think it's very hard to judge these things when you are in the middle of a nominating fight.  I believe we're going to coalesce as a party. Even in the national polls today, you see very little difference between how Hillary Clinton is running versus McCain among these working class white voters and how Barack Obama's doing, because they know we need change. They know we can't take four more years of the Bush economic policies. NORRIS: Can Barack Obama win over those voters? Mr. AXELROD: Oh, I absolute - as I say, first of all, understand that we did very well with those voters in Oregon yesterday, voters, non-college-educated voters, voters making less than $50,000 a year. And we've done well with them in places all over the country. But I think the big thing is nobody knows better the failures of these Bush economic policies than working Americans who are struggling to pay their bills, struggling to send their kids to school, struggling to live the American dream, and they know we need change. I think they're going to come to our banner. NORRIS: This kind of long campaign, there are moments where someone's character is often revealed. I'm wondering in terms of character, what was been the most revealing moment that you've seen for Barack Obama? Mr. AXELROD: That's a great question. And you know, what comes to mind - and I could give you many examples - but the day after the Ohio and Texas primaries, which were obviously a setback for us, he arrived unannounced at the campaign headquarters in Chicago, went around to the desks of all the young kids who work there, told them all to keep their chins up, that we were going to be fine, sat down then with the senior staff, had a long list of questions that he had about - and ideas about moving forward.  But it was all in the spirit of - we all could have done better here, what we learned from it, how we're going to move forward. And as he walked out the door, he turned around and said, You know, I'm not yelling at anybody here. He said, I could, he said, after spending $20 million and losing two primaries. He said, But I'm not. And he laughed and walked out the door. It was a textbook case of good management. I thought, this guy is going to be a heck of a president. NORRIS: That's an interesting way of saying I'm disappointed in you. Mr. AXELROD: Exactly. But you know, it was never - whenever we have a setback, he always takes his share of the responsibility and he never points a finger of blame so much as says, we made mistakes here; how do we correct those moving forward? What did we learn from those? It's an incredibly positive way of leading. NORRIS: David Axelrod is the chief strategist for the Barack Obama campaign. David, thank you so much for speaking with us.

BRAND: But first, Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy gave a thumbs up and waved to a throng of well wishers as he left the hospital today. Senator Kennedy has been diagnosed as having a malignant brain tumor.  CHADWICK: Two weeks ago Senator Kennedy joined with Texas Senator Kay Bailey Hutchinson to conduct hearings on the state of cancer treatment in this country. The two promised to work together to renew the war on cancer, and now this. Senator Hutchinson joins us. Senator Hutchinson what are you and Senator Kennedy attempting to do with new cancer legislation? Senator KAY BAILEY HUTCHINSON (Republican, Texas): We think it's time to assess where the treatments are, and what we can do to improve the survivability, really, of cancer. We need more prevention. We need more early detection, and there are some areas where I think we can improve the coordination of research to get even farther down the road. And really making it more survivable, and also more rare.  CHADWICK: This news about Senator Kennedy, it doesn't change your premise or what you're doing politically, the two of you, but it does make it what? More poignant? More personal? Senator HUTCHINSON: It's more poignant. It's more personal, and our commitment will be renewed. I think everyone in the Senate has a good feeling about Senator Kennedy, whether you are on the Republican side and you disagree with him on, perhaps philosophical issues.  You know that he is a good person, and he's a force. And what I said on the Senate floor about him is that I can't think of anyone I would rather be in a fight with than him, on my side, not on the other side.  CHADWICK: Of course he also a very smart and experienced and wily political strategist. He would know that the voice of Senator Kennedy right now, on this legislation that you and he are proposing would be all the more powerful. Have you heard from his staff, we should go ahead with this. Senator HUTCHINSON: Well, I talked to his chief of staff this morning, and there is no question that we will go forward with this. And we have some areas that really, I think, could be quite productive, for instance, one of the key things the cancer treatment and clinical trials where you have the experimental drugs, and there are so many barriers to clinical trials. It is very expensive. Insurance companies don't cover people in clinical trials, but they are, perhaps, the only hope for many people. And then there are access issues. There are disparities in cancer treatment because many people in underserved communities don't have early detection because they don't have access to the early detection signs, the education, and the tests.  CHADWICK: Well, here you are, a very notable Republican senator, teamed with this most notable Democratic senator, and I'm thinking of a piece I read today in the Washington Post by David Browder, the Dean of the Washington Press Corps, saying there really is no one else like Senator Kennedy, especially when it comes to working with Republicans. He says the person who might miss his voice most of all would be Senator McCain if he becomes President McCain? Senator HUTCHINSON: I saw that article. It was interesting as well because Senator McCain and Senator Kennedy do work together, and they know how to work together. They know how to bridge the gaps between the two caucuses, the Republicans and the Democrats, and come to conclusions. And you know, I've worked with Senator Kennedy on issues before, and he will sit down, and he knows the subject matter that he's on at the time, so well that he can do the negotiating.  Sometimes I have dealt with senators that really have the staff do the negotiations, but when you get down to it with Senator Kennedy, he's negotiating. He knows what can be done. He knows what's already been done, and he knows where you can bring people together. So, I think that a Republican, or Democratic president, will miss Senator Kennedy's presence in the senate if in fact he's not here. But that that's not a bet I'd make, I think he will be here.  CHADWICK:   A political question, if I may, senator, people keep talking about you as a vice presidential candidate to run with Senator McCain? What about that? Senator HUTCHINSON: I'm not talking about that at all. That is not something that I seek. It's just not on my mind at all.

I'm Noah Adams. New York's Governor David Paterson is walking a political tightrope. Paterson, on the job for little more than two months, says his state must recognize gay marriages performed where they are legal, such as California, Massachusetts or Canada. This even though New York State itself has not legalized same sex marriage. Paterson issued a sweeping order to all state agencies to review their policies and ensure they allow equal rights to married gay couples. Paterson used the executive order after former Governor Eliot Spitzer did not succeed through the legislative route. Last year Spitzer introduced a bill that would legalize gay marriage. New York's Republican-controlled Senate has yet to call it up for a vote. And for more, I'm joined by Governor David Paterson. Welcome, sir. Governor DAVID PATERSON (Democrat, New York): Good afternoon. How are you? ADAMS: I'm fine. Tell us, Governor Paterson, what difference this would make to couples - gay couples who live in New York State? What would it allow them to do, and why now? Gov. PATERSON: Well, Noah, New York has had a long tradition of recognizing marriages that have been executed out of state or witnessed outside the country in a government that permitted it. All we are doing today is making sure that we extend that same right, which is a constitutional federal right, to those individuals who have out of state marriage licenses who are coming to New York. Marriage equality is an issue that is still being debated in New York. But on the issue of whether or not we would accept the marriages from out of state, I did not see it in conflict with any court decisions, all of which have been that we have to respect those rights. ADAMS: Now, do you expect to see a lot of people, let's say, going to California? Canada would be a possibility. Do you think it'll happen? Gov. PATERSON: Well, Noah, I think that's certainly a possibility, but we are not trying to change the law in New York other than through the legislative process. We're just trying to respect the laws of other states and other governments as we always have. ADAMS: Governor, you were in the State Senate for two decades there, in Albany. In that time, what would you have thought if a governor - let's say it was a Republican governor - had issued an order like this, a sweeping order on a topic that you didn't agree with? Gov. PATERSON: I would have thought that the order should be measured by its compliance with the law rather than whether or not I agreed with the law or didn't. For instance, we had a death penalty statute and the governor of our state a few years ago called for the death penalty in a case where an individual went into a Wendy's and shot seven employees, killing, I believe, almost all of them. At that time, when the governor felt that the individual convicted should receive the death penalty, I didn't disagree with him, even though I have never been for the death penalty. And the reason is because that was the highest count that our law permitted at that time, and almost everyone in New York was so horrified by this shooting of these teenagers in this Wendy's, felt that the individual should receive the highest punishment under the law. It didn't mean that you were for the death penalty. It just meant that you understood the law of the state as it existed, and that's all I'm asking people to understand right now. ADAMS: Well, we'll step over to the other side of the aisle for just a minute. Does the legislature have any recourse? Can you argue it that way to block this order? Gov. PATERSON: Well, in many states around the union, they have passed defensive of marriage acts, which would not allow a governor to take that action at this point. And if this legislature passed it, I would be bound by it. But we don't have that type of restriction in New York. Therefore the action I took is following the same rights that we've extended in the case of other marriages that have been conducted in other parts of the country and got respected in our state. There are over 1,100 types of regulations and remedies that are not available to domestic partners, but are to people who are married. Certainly at a time in our society when only 50 percent of the marriages that are conducted are actually working, I thought this might actually increase the success rate a little bit. ADAMS: A year from now, would you be making a move to make gay marriage legal in New York State? Gov. PATERSON: Well, I've already advocated for it. That is my belief, that marriage equality should be extended to same sex couples. However, it doesn't have anything to do with the decision we made a few weeks ago when we asked our agencies to be in compliance with what we feel is our own law. And for that reason, regardless of a person's individual beliefs, I think that they should respect that the executive branch of this state is trying to follow the law and not to discriminate against people who choose to be married in other states and then come back to New York, whether they are common law marriages or same sex marriages. ADAMS: David Paterson, governor of the State of New York. Thank you, governor. Gov. PATERSON: Thank you, Noah.  NOAH ADAMS, host:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Noah Adams.  New York's Governor David Paterson is walking a political tightrope. Paterson, on the job for little more than two months, says his state must recognize gay marriages performed where they are legal, such as California, Massachusetts or Canada. This even though New York State itself has not legalized same sex marriage.  Paterson issued a sweeping order to all state agencies to review their policies and ensure they allow equal rights to married gay couples. Paterson used the executive order after former Governor Eliot Spitzer did not succeed through the legislative route. Last year Spitzer introduced a bill that would legalize gay marriage. New York's Republican-controlled Senate has yet to call it up for a vote.  And for more, I'm joined by Governor David Paterson. Welcome, sir.  Governor DAVID PATERSON (Democrat, New York): Good afternoon. How are you?  ADAMS: I'm fine. Tell us, Governor Paterson, what difference this would make to couples - gay couples who live in New York State? What would it allow them to do, and why now?  Gov. PATERSON: Well, Noah, New York has had a long tradition of recognizing marriages that have been executed out of state or witnessed outside the country in a government that permitted it. All we are doing today is making sure that we extend that same right, which is a constitutional federal right, to those individuals who have out of state marriage licenses who are coming to New York.  Marriage equality is an issue that is still being debated in New York. But on the issue of whether or not we would accept the marriages from out of state, I did not see it in conflict with any court decisions, all of which have been that we have to respect those rights.  ADAMS: Now, do you expect to see a lot of people, let's say, going to California? Canada would be a possibility. Do you think it'll happen?  Gov. PATERSON: Well, Noah, I think that's certainly a possibility, but we are not trying to change the law in New York other than through the legislative process. We're just trying to respect the laws of other states and other governments as we always have.  ADAMS: Governor, you were in the State Senate for two decades there, in Albany. In that time, what would you have thought if a governor - let's say it was a Republican governor - had issued an order like this, a sweeping order on a topic that you didn't agree with?  Gov. PATERSON: I would have thought that the order should be measured by its compliance with the law rather than whether or not I agreed with the law or didn't.

I'm Guy Raz in for Andrea Seabrook. The political playing field is slightly re-jiggered today. The Democratic Party agreed to seat the disputed delegates from Michigan and Florida at this summer's party convention except at only half strength. The deal gives Hillary Clinton a net gain of 24 delegates, but that still puts her far behind rival Barack Obama. The Clinton camp is angry over the party's decision to award Obama delegates from Michigan even though the senator wasn't on the ballot. Now, yesterday's meeting was supposed to resolve the dispute, but the bare-knuckled brawl between the two campaigns continues, and one of those brawlers is Harold Ickes. He's a senior advisor to Senator Clinton, and he joins us now. Welcome, sir. HAROLD ICKES: Hi, good to be there. RAZ: Now you don't like these decisions made by the party. Why not? ICKES: I like some of them. I like the ones that seated the delegates, preferred to have full votes rather than half votes. So for the voters of those states, it was a good day yesterday, and they will be represented at our convention. Where we disagree very profoundly is that one of the decisions by the Rules and Bylaws Committee, of which I'm a member, literally took four delegates, stole four delegates from Hillary Clinton that she had won fair and square in Michigan and gave them to Barack Obama. In addition, they took 55 delegates from the uncommitted preference, which is a recognized status under our rules and gave them to Barack Obama. So he ended up with 59 delegates that he, in our view, did not win. RAZ: Mr. Ickes, you say that Senator Obama's campaign stole four delegates from the Clinton camp, but Senator Obama voluntarily removed himself from the Michigan ballot, abiding by the party's own bylaws. ICKES: The bylaws did not require any candidate to remove themselves from the Michigan ballot. Senator Obama and Edwards did this for strategic and tactical reasons: one, they didn't think they were going to win Michigan. Number two is they wanted to curry favor with the Iowa voters. The pledge that was signed by the five states and the eight presidential candidates did not require removal of any names from the ballot. He removed his name. RAZ: Mr. Ickes, I want to play some tape for you from your own party leaders. They were speaking earlier this week. We'll hear from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and then Senate Leader Harry Reid. NANCY PELOSI: I will step in because we cannot take this fight to the convention. It must be over before then. I believe it will be over in two weeks. HARRY REID: We all are going to urge our folks next week to make a decision very quickly. RAZ: Mr. Ickes, your own party leaders want to wrap this up. They want to get behind one candidate very soon. Is the Clinton campaign prepared to heed their wishes? ICKES: Mrs. Clinton has reserved her right to appeal this very adverse decision to the Credentials Committee. RAZ: So you. . . ICKES: There's plenty of time. You know, there's five months left. There's June, July, August, September, October, five months to go before the general election. That's a lot of time to. . . RAZ: So you're prepared to take this all the way to the Democratic convention? ICKES: No, I didn't say that. This will be Mrs. Clinton's decision. She's reserved her right to take it to the Credentials Committee and, ultimately, to the national convention. She has not made that decision yet. There's a series of states that we need to win to round out 270 electoral votes that she is stronger in against McCain than Obama, and that is our case. We're about winning the White House. RAZ: Harold Ickes, do you believe Senator Clinton has earned a place on a possible Obama ticket as his running mate? ICKES: That is something that we don't discuss at this point because we still think, although it's a steep hill, that she has a reasonable shot at the nomination. She has women, Hispanics, Catholics, families under $75,000, elderly and rural voters. Those are big constituencies that are needed to win a general election, and we think she has a bigger reach than he does. RAZ: If she doesn't win the nomination, could she help Senator Obama win. . . ? ICKES: Oh, I think she could be of enormous help, starting with women and Hispanics. John McCain will have a big call on Hispanics because of his position on the immigration bill. Hillary Clinton has demonstrated now in primary after primary her depth and reach with Hispanics, and if you have to win the likes of New Mexico, Colorado, Nevada and Florida, Hispanic vote will be critically important, and Obama will not have the appeal to Hispanics against McCain that Hillary Clinton will. RAZ: So if she is on the ticket, she can help him win? ICKES: There's no question in my view. I think she will be on the ticket at the head of the ticket. RAZ: Harold Ickes is a senior advisor to the Clinton campaign. Mr. Ickes, thanks for being with us. ICKES: Okay, terrific. GUY RAZ, Host:  From NPR News, it's ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.

Emanuel served in the Clinton White House and like Obama is a member of the Illinois congressional delegation, and he joins us now from Capitol Hill. Welcome back to the program. RAHM EMANUEL: (Democrat, Illinois) Thank you, Robert. SIEGEL: You said not long ago on NPR that you're hiding under your desk from Clinton and Obama supporters. We're glad to know that you're out in the open. EMANUEL: I didn't know it was even spring. I thought it was still winter. SIEGEL: Now that you've opened your eyes again and you're out in the open, did you speak to Senator Clinton yourself or to Senator Obama for that matter? EMANUEL: Oh, sure. I talked to Hillary a couple times yesterday, I talked to her over the weekend. I was with Barack today. I talked to him a number of times in the last week. SIEGEL: And Senator Clinton's reaction to your endorsement of Senator Obama? EMANUEL: Well, you know, actually I said to her, you know, Barack's - or the campaign's invited me to be with him at AIPAC. She said you should go and support his effort. He's going to need the help. So there I went. SIEGEL: We'll come back to AIPAC in a moment. In the next phase for the Democratic campaign, whose move is it? Does Senator Clinton - is she obliged now to drop out and endorse Barack Obama? Does he have to approach her? What happens? EMANUEL: Well, there's - first of all, he's the nominee. The most important thing we can do is get ready for November. I mean, I'm slightly in a different place than other people. Hillary said she's interested in the vice presidency. If she's interested in the vice presidency, she's acknowledged he's the nominee and that process has ended. Barack has indicated to her both in phone conversation as well as when he said it publicly, she should take the time she needs. Nobody expects you, after the effort that was put in, so close of a race that, you know, tomorrow you're done. So she gets the time and I think that's an appropriate human gesture accepted by her. I don't want to say offered or proffered by Barack, but acknowledged. And I think nobody expects last night - I mean I don't think anybody expects us to go on endlessly, and there's an appropriate time and we'll all know it when it hits. SIEGEL: Is Barack Obama obliged to offer her the vice presidency right now? EMANUEL: I think Hillary, having been in the White House, having been at the side of her president, of her husband rather, in the decisions he had to make both in the White House and prior, obviously respects the magnitude or the weight of this decision, and I don't think she would expect him or anybody who's the nominee ever be rushed in any way on a momentous decision like this, given that you actually have time. SIEGEL: Is the fact that she was the First Lady and if she were vice president or the running mate, that the vice president's spouse would be a little higher profile than Tipper Gore or Lynn Cheney - Bill Clinton - does that complicate matters and make it all the more difficult to have a vice presidential running mate, Hillary Clinton? EMANUEL: You noticed, huh? SIEGEL: Yeah, I've heard - I heard a rumor that he was a former occupant of the bigger building. EMANUEL: Yeah, well, I mean, this election, Robert, is filled with new things. In our primary you had an African-American and a woman as the major two candidates. You have John McCain, who - although that's - you know he is a hero of (unintelligible) so there's a lot of newness. And then you have on top of that a former First Lady who is a senator, who is the wife of a former president. So it's one more layer of something totally new. SIEGEL: You accompanied Senator Obama, as you said, to the AIPAC Conference today, the big pro-Israel group. Does he have a problem, some work to do with the Jewish voters, Jewish Democrats? EMANUEL: Well, I think that, first of all, Senator Durbin was there from Illinois, Congresswoman (inaudible), Robert Wexler, others where there. the only thing different was those people have been with him through the primary. I decided at the end of the process to come out and this was where I wanted to support him. He has, you know, it's not - if you look at his record, no, and if you look at how he won in Illinois for the U. S. Senate, the answer is no. SIEGEL: No problem, you're saying. EMANUEL: No. I do think, you know, without a doubt there was a lot of expectations to today's speech, and I thought he gave a very, very powerful speech. I said and Senator Durbin in his own words also said when we both spoke to the executive board with Barack, you know, what is a friend? Somebody who you implicitly trust for their loyalty and you expect their honesty. If Barack was elected president, Israel would have a friend because he will be - implicitly you can trust him as it relates to Israel's security and our commitment to it, and you can expect honesty. and I think that's what you want out of a friendship. SIEGEL: Rahm Emanuel, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, member from Illinois, and now Obama's supporter. Thanks a lot for talking with us. EMANUEL: Thanks, Robert.

S. diplomats was detained there. The group was subsequently released. They were evidently trying to investigate allegations of violence against the political opposition. Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, lost the first round of presidential elections and he faces a runoff later this month. In May, a similar U. S. convoy was blocked and U. S. diplomats threatened. Ambassador James McGee was present for that confrontation but not for the one today, and he joins us now from the Zimbabwean capital, Harare. Ambassador McGee, first, what happened today? Ambassador JAMES McGEE (U. S. Ambassador to Zimbabwe): Robert, we had three vehicles, two U. S. vehicles, diplomatic plates, and one from our colleagues, the British embassy, that were out in the countryside trying to get an idea, gauge the climate of what's happening out there with the violence and also the run-up to the runoff election at the end of this month. Our vehicles were stopped and detained for over five hours by Zimbabwean security forces, police, military, and so-called war veterans. Those are the scary folks who threatened to burn our people alive in their vehicles if we did not get out and accompany police to a nearby police station. SIEGEL: They threatened to burn alive the people in the vehicles? Ambassador McGEE: That's correct. Our people were very cool under this pressure. We again invoked the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations, saying that, no, we would not go with them to a police station, and that, no, they could not search our vehicles. SIEGEL: This appears to be the most extreme incident involving Zimbabwean security forces and U. S. diplomats. How would you place it in the context of what's happened in Zimbabwe over the past month? Ambassador McGEE: This is more intimidation by the government, Robert. Right now Zimbabwe is a lawless country. The government of Zimbabwe's not following their own laws, and they're definitely not following any international laws. You mentioned a trip about a month ago that I was on with the British ambassador, and they stopped us also. Today became much more serious. One of our local employees, a Zimbabwean, was actually drug from his car and beaten and thrown into a ditch. Fortunately his injuries were very minor, and he's in good shape now. SIEGEL: And. . . Ambassador McGEE: This is spinning out of control. SIEGEL: The people who beat that man, were they serving uniformed forces or were they the war veterans? Ambassador McGEE: These were the war veterans. And again, the police were standing right there, the military were standing right there, and nobody made any attempt to stop these folks. SIEGEL: And we should say that in Zimbabwe the war veterans are known very much as partisans of President Mugabe's movement and people who at times had been the beneficiaries of his policies that have been to the detriment of others. Ambassador McGEE: That's absolutely correct, Robert, very much correct. SIEGEL: Morgan Tsvangirai, the opposition candidate for president, he says President Mugabe is prepared to steal the runoff election. Is he right about that? Ambassador McGEE: I think he very well may be. We've seen massive levels of violence, intimidation in the countryside. People are being burned out of their homes. We have 50 - at least 50 people confirmed murdered in the countryside and anywhere from 25 to 30,000 people who have been displaced from their homes. Now, that's a very key issue because in Zimbabwe you can only vote in the ward where you're registered and people, of course, register in the ward where they live. If they're displaced from their homes, then they cannot vote. SIEGEL: Well, at what point do you and the British ambassador, and obviously the foreign ministry and the foreign office in London and the State Department here, at what point do you say this is not an election campaign? This is a spate of political violence verging on civil conflict, so therefore we're not paying any attention to June 27th? Ambassador McGEE: Well, I think we have to pay attention. This government is trying to find some legitimacy. And if there isn't the election, I think they will just go ahead and try to whitewash this into saying, we have received the massive amount of votes in our country and we are legitimate. I don't know that anyone will stand up and say anything against that. And the voices of the people of Zimbabwe need to be heard, and I think that's one of the key jobs that we're trying to do here - is to ensure that the people of Zimbabwe have an opportunity to express their will through the ballot box. SIEGEL: Well, U. S. Ambassador to Zimbabwe James McGee, thank you very much for talking with us from Harare today. Ambassador McGEE: My pleasure, Robert, good day.  ROBERT SIEGEL, host:  The White House today demanded an explanation from the government of Zimbabwe for why a group of U. S. diplomats was detained there. The group was subsequently released. They were evidently trying to investigate allegations of violence against the political opposition. Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, lost the first round of presidential elections and he faces a runoff later this month. In May, a similar U. S. convoy was blocked and U. S. diplomats threatened. Ambassador James McGee was present for that confrontation but not for the one today, and he joins us now from the Zimbabwean capital, Harare.  Ambassador McGee, first, what happened today?  Ambassador JAMES McGEE (U. S. Ambassador to Zimbabwe): Robert, we had three vehicles, two U. S. vehicles, diplomatic plates, and one from our colleagues, the British embassy, that were out in the countryside trying to get an idea, gauge the climate of what's happening out there with the violence and also the run-up to the runoff election at the end of this month. Our vehicles were stopped and detained for over five hours by Zimbabwean security forces, police, military, and so-called war veterans.

Turkish jets attacked positions of the PKK yesterday, that's the Kurdish Workers Party. It's an armed movement of Turkish Kurds who have bases in Iraqi Kurdistan. As it happens, the foreign minister of Turkey, Ali Babacan, is in Washington and the Kurdish conflict is one of several interesting developments in Turkish policy and politics. And Mr. Babacan joins us now, welcome to the program. Mr. ALI BABACAN (Foreign Minister, Turkey): Thank you. SIEGEL: First question, the commander of Turkish land forces said today that Turkey and Iran are cooperating in sharing information and coordinating strikes on Kurdish targets in Northern Iraq. Does Turkey welcome Iranian assistance, and what does the state department have to say about that partnership? Mr. BABACAN: PKK is listed as a terrorist organization by the United States, by NATO, by the European Union, and also by many individual countries. And what we are doing is giving a fight against this organization. They are penetrating our borders. They are killing civilians and non-civilians, and running back into north of Iraq. The United States and Turkey is cooperating strongly, very closely, against this terrorist organization. Then we do our military attacks. These are coordinated by the American armed forces in Iraq. And when these operations are close to the Iranian border, the communication happens between Turkish armed forces and also Iranian armed forces, because these terrorists are existent in places which is very close to the Iranian-Iraqi border. SIEGEL: And does the U. S. object to those kinds of dealings between Turkey and Iran or do they accept that as necessary? Mr. BABACAN: The United States is giving us a strong support against our endeavors. SIEGEL: I want to ask you also about next week, Turkey is expected to host a resumed indirect peace talks that your government's been mediating between Israel and Syria. First, how soon might those talks become direct face-to-face Israeli-Syrian talks? Mr. BABACAN: The talks were announced just two weeks ago, and it has been a good start. The indirect talks will continue until there is substantial progress. And when both of the sides think that it is time, then direct talks will start. There's no time frame as of now. But reasonable progress in indirect talks is a prerequisite for direct talks. SIEGEL: From what Turkish mediators have heard, are the two sides talking about the same kind of peace and the same - the same piece of land? Mr. BABACAN: Both of the sides are quite eager that these talks will continue in a quite a discreet way until there's an agreement. SIEGEL: And it's going to remain - it's going to remain discreet until that time, you're telling me. Mr. BABACAN: That is - that is the will of the both sides. We are playing the role of a facilitator for those talks. SIEGEL: I want to ask you about an entirely Turkish matter. The party of the Turkish government, your party, the AK Party, is facing a court challenge in Turkey that claims it is anti-secular. And your party is often described as being - having roots in Islamist politics or being a moderate Islamist party. Today, Turkey's constitutional court overturned a law that had allowed woman students to wear headscarves, and let me ask you: If that's an omen of what's to come in the other lawsuit, is the AK Party in danger of being shut down and its leaders banned from politics? Mr. BABACAN: Turkey has been doing a lot of reforms - political reforms, economic reforms. There has been a huge transformation in the country, in many aspects. And Turkey is a country where we are trying to prove more and more that Islam, democracy and secularism can coexist. And my party is a conservative democrat party. We are sensitive about traditions, ethics, family, morality, religion, and we are vocal about this. But we also support a truly democratic system in Turkey. We also support a secular system in Turkey, which means a distinct separation between religion and the state. And we also believe that secularism is about religious freedoms. And now, the constitutional court is being asked to judge if the actions of our party has been in line with the concept of secularism or not, although our constitution does not have any explicit description of what secularism is. And constitutional court has the final word on it. Whether we like the outcome or not, it is going to be a final decision, and it will be implemented. SIEGEL: You mean, if the final decision were that the governing party has to be banned, then the party would comply with that. It would not protest or take to the streets or anything of that sort? Mr. BABACAN: As the party, ruling party, and also as the government, we have to move - and we are moving - on a very strong basis of legitimacy. We have to conform with the rule of law. We have to also be very careful about separation of powers in Turkey, about independence of judiciary. Also, we have to protect the reliability of our courts. But on other hand, Turkey is now a very open county, a very open society. Free debate is continuing. And as long as this free debate takes place, one way or another, we believe that Turkey should be able to come over with these difficulties. Last year, we had some difficulties. Last July elections, our democracy emerged as a stronger democracy. Our democracy passed a very important test. It seems that this year, our democracy will go through some more tests, but as I said, as long as Turkey continues to be an open country, our democracy should be successful. SIEGEL: Ali Babacan, foreign minister of Turkey, thank you very much for talking with us today. Mr. BABACAN: Thank you very much.

I'm Andrea Seabrook. America's black mayors wrap up their annual meeting today in New Orleans. It began the day after Barack Obama sealed the Democratic nomination for president. The National Conference of Black Mayors won't be endorsing anyone in the race though. That would endanger the group's nonprofit tax status. But one of the mayors did say it would be very easy for you to guess who they'll be backing. The meeting wasn't about politics anyway; it was about the issues that affect the cities the black mayors run. Ray Nagin is the mayor of New Orleans; he hosted the meeting there. And welcome to the program, Ray Nagin. Mr. RAY NAGIN (Mayor, New Orleans): Andrea, it's good to talk to you and good to talk to America. SEABROOK: Thank you. So, what are those issues that you're talking about in the conference? Mr. NAGIN: Well, you know, the conference is focused on the things that, you know, all mayors are concerned about in their various communities, whether it be housing, taxes, the high price of gas. And then we have some interesting sessions where we're talking about greening initiatives - to take advantage of solar power and all those renewable energy sources that we desperately need to move toward. SEABROOK: Mayor Nagin, your city has gone through so much over the last three years. As mayor of New Orleans, what do you learn from a conference that is generally about cities? Mr. NAGIN: I talk to mayors from around the country and particularly at the National Conference of Black Mayors about how they deal with crime issues, making sure there is affordable housing, what are their health care challenges. And I take all of that in and I try to educate my fellow mayors about the challenges that we have with FEMA and the fact that money flows from the federal government to the state, and some of the things to look out for just in case they get in this kind of predicament that we're in. SEABROOK: What does it mean for New Orleans to host this event. Mr. NAGIN: For us, at this point in our recovery, every convention that comes here means a lot economically. It also sends a signal around the country that we're open for business. And it exposes people, you know, mayors in particular about what's really happening in New Orleans so they can go tell our story for us. So, it's very important. SEABROOK: In a moment I'll be speaking with a woman who's been helping Hurricane Katrina victims transition from trailers to permanent homes. What's been the biggest obstacle for New Orleans when it comes to bringing people back to the city? Mr. NAGIN: Well, it's all about housing. We have over 134,000 homes that were damaged after Katrina. Some severely and some totally demolished. And the second thing that has been a big challenge for us is the federal grants, the state coined it as the Road Home Program\u2026 SEABROOK: Um-hum. Mr. NAGIN: \u2026that grant process was very slow. And as a matter of fact, I think right now they've only distributed about 60 or 65 percent of the checks that should go to homeowners. So, that slowed down the recovery also. SEABROOK: And, Mayor Nagin, I have to ask a political question. Let's talk about Barack Obama for just a moment. I know the conference can't endorse the candidate but what's the buzz been like there? Mr. NAGIN: The buzz has been incredible. I mean, it's black mayors, it's African-Americans. So, obviously, we are all very proud of what Senator Obama has done. And I gave a little talk to basically kind of encourage people and say, look, this is the best opportunity for a person of color to potentially be in the White House and we need to get energized and hopefully push the turnout in each one of our cities to the highest levels there have been ever, and I think that would give the senator a great chance of being in the White House.

Strickland Says He Won't Accept VP Slot : NPR", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2008/06/10/91360615/ohio-gov-strickland-says-he-wont-accept-vp-slot", "author": "No author found", "published_date": "2008-06-10", "content": "MICHELE NORRIS, host: Barack Obama is also courting Clinton surrogates, the elected officials and other high-profile supporters who campaigned for his one-time rival. Governor Ted Strickland of Ohio is one of them. He was an early and passionate Clinton supporter, and he helped her score a big win in Ohio. Now the question is, can Strickland help Obama win his battleground state in a match-up with John McCain? Governor Strickland, who's been mentioned as a vice presidential prospect, spoke with us today from the State House in Columbus. On a scale of one to 10, he says the level of difficulty Obama will face in trying to win Ohio is about a five. Governor TED STRICKLAND: (Democrat, Ohio): Well, it's difficult for any candidate to win Ohio, Republican or Democratic candidate. Ohio is one of those swing states and in order to win Ohio, you've got to appeal to a very diverse state. We have a little bit of everything in Ohio that is found in the larger country. And I do believe, though, that the candidate that wins Ohio will be the candidate that talks specifically and convincingly about the economic circumstances facing our state and our nation. NORRIS: You know, it seems like Barack Obama has an uphill climb there. He carried only five of the state's 88 counties. Gov. STRICKLAND: He carried the larger metropolitan areas of Ohio, our larger cities. But it is true that in order to carry Ohio, you have to appeal to all of Ohio. And I think he can be successful, because I think he's going to have an economic message that will have appeal to the people of Ohio who are facing very difficult economic circumstances. Whichever candidate has the most compelling economic message, I believe, will be the candidate that carries Ohio in November. NORRIS: Governor, it's interesting to listen to you talk about Barack Obama's economic message. When you announced your endorsement, you issued a statement that said Ohioans have suffered as a result of the failed policies of the Bush administration. You said that Ohioans desperately want real, meaningful change, and you said that I believe Barack Obama will bring that change. And it's interesting because all throughout the primary season, you were saying just the opposite thing. You were saying that he did not have the right prescription for the economy. Gov. STRICKLAND: Well, I was a very strong supporter of Senator Clinton. I think she - I think she won Ohio because she did talk convincingly about what needed to be done. And Senator Obama, as you know, has started this general election campaign by talking first and most convincingly about the economy of our nation. He is going to address these economic problems. And I think when he does that, Ohio will respond, and the support that went to Senator Clinton in the primary will be magnified on November the 4th. And I think Ohio will vote for Obama and Obama, consequently, will be the next president. NORRIS: Now, you said Barack Obama needs to campaign all throughout the state; that means going into the Appalachian Crescent, the area that you actually hail from in the state. Gov. STRICKLAND: Absolutely. NORRIS: There's strong evidence that Barack Obama has had real difficulties winning over working-class voters all throughout Appalachia, in Ohio and Kentucky and West Virginia, parts of Pennsylvania. Why, in your estimation, is there such strong resistance to Obama in these pockets? Gov. STRICKLAND: Well, I have been asked if there may be a racial element to this, and let me be just real candid about that. I think race involves everything that happens in this country, wherever it occurs - large cities, small town, or any region of our country. But I can also tell you that there are two ways to run statewide in Ohio. You can use the John Kerry approach, or you can use the Ted Strickland approach. And I have suggested to Senator Obama's campaign leadership that they need to use the Ted Strickland approach. Now, what is that approach? That approach is recognizing that Ohio is big and diverse, that there are different economies in Ohio, and that it is important to reach out to all of Ohio. And I believe Barack Obama can and will carry Ohio because I think he's going to understand that you can't just appeal to the large, metropolitan areas and ignore or neglect the rest of the state. NORRIS: If you're out campaigning with Barack Obama with the fervor that you've just described in the course of this interview, should we see that as a bit of an audition for you? Gov. STRICKLAND: Absolutely not. (Soundbite of laughter) Gov. STRICKLAND: If drafted, I will not run - nominated, I will not accept. And if elected, I will not serve. So, I don't know how more crystal clear I can be. NORRIS: Don't they all say that, though? Gov. STRICKLAND: No. I don't think they all say that. I've heard people say, you know, if I was asked, it would certainly be something I would have to consider. That does not mean that, you know, that I am any less committed to helping Barack Obama become the next president. NORRIS: Governor Strickland, it's been a pleasure to talk to you. Thanks so much. Gov. STRICKLAND: Well, I've enjoyed talking with you. You have a good day. NORRIS: You too, sir. That was Governor Ted Strickland of Ohio. He's a Democrat.  MICHELE NORRIS, host:  Barack Obama is also courting Clinton surrogates, the elected officials and other high-profile supporters who campaigned for his one-time rival. Governor Ted Strickland of Ohio is one of them. He was an early and passionate Clinton supporter, and he helped her score a big win in Ohio. Now the question is, can Strickland help Obama win his battleground state in a match-up with John McCain? Governor Strickland, who's been mentioned as a vice presidential prospect, spoke with us today from the State House in Columbus. On a scale of one to 10, he says the level of difficulty Obama will face in trying to win Ohio is about a five.  Governor TED STRICKLAND: (Democrat, Ohio): Well, it's difficult for any candidate to win Ohio, Republican or Democratic candidate. Ohio is one of those swing states and in order to win Ohio, you've got to appeal to a very diverse state. We have a little bit of everything in Ohio that is found in the larger country. And I do believe, though, that the candidate that wins Ohio will be the candidate that talks specifically and convincingly about the economic circumstances facing our state and our nation.  NORRIS: You know, it seems like Barack Obama has an uphill climb there. He carried only five of the state's 88 counties.  Gov. STRICKLAND: He carried the larger metropolitan areas of Ohio, our larger cities. But it is true that in order to carry Ohio, you have to appeal to all of Ohio. And I think he can be successful, because I think he's going to have an economic message that will have appeal to the people of Ohio who are facing very difficult economic circumstances. Whichever candidate has the most compelling economic message, I believe, will be the candidate that carries Ohio in November.  NORRIS: Governor, it's interesting to listen to you talk about Barack Obama's economic message. When you announced your endorsement, you issued a statement that said Ohioans have suffered as a result of the failed policies of the Bush administration. You said that Ohioans desperately want real, meaningful change, and you said that I believe Barack Obama will bring that change. And it's interesting because all throughout the primary season, you were saying just the opposite thing. You were saying that he did not have the right prescription for the economy.  Gov. STRICKLAND: Well, I was a very strong supporter of Senator Clinton. I think she - I think she won Ohio because she did talk convincingly about what needed to be done. And Senator Obama, as you know, has started this general election campaign by talking first and most convincingly about the economy of our nation. He is going to address these economic problems. And I think when he does that, Ohio will respond, and the support that went to Senator Clinton in the primary will be magnified on November the 4th. And I think Ohio will vote for Obama and Obama, consequently, will be the next president.  NORRIS: Now, you said Barack Obama needs to campaign all throughout the state; that means going into the Appalachian Crescent, the area that you actually hail from in the state.  Gov. STRICKLAND: Absolutely.  NORRIS: There's strong evidence that Barack Obama has had real difficulties winning over working-class voters all throughout Appalachia, in Ohio and Kentucky and West Virginia, parts of Pennsylvania. Why, in your estimation, is there such strong resistance to Obama in these pockets?  Gov. STRICKLAND: Well, I have been asked if there may be a racial element to this, and let me be just real candid about that. I think race involves everything that happens in this country, wherever it occurs - large cities, small town, or any region of our country.

I'm Guy Raz. Plunging property values and skyrocketing gas prices have cast a shadow of doom and gloom over this year's conference of mayors. City chiefs from across the country are in Miami where together they're commiserating over the depressing economic outlook. One of those mayors joins me now on the line from Miami. It's Tom Leppert, mayor of Dallas. Sir, welcome. Mr. TOM LEPPERT (Mayor, Dallas): Guy, it's great to be with you. RAZ: Now, first of all, this city of Dallas must own hundreds of cars. So, what does four-and-a-half dollars a gallon for gas mean for your budget? Mr. LEPPERT: Well, it means millions and millions of dollars. But, Guy, I think we're fortunate because we anticipated some of the changes that have taken place over time and made some long-term decisions that I think have put us in better position. For instance, we've got about 4,700 vehicles and 25 percent of those operate on alternative fuel. They're hybrid of CNG. And then about a quarter of our heavy vehicles run on biodiesel. So, I think we're in a better position because some of those long-term decisions have positioned us better in today's environment. RAZ: So, you have almost 5,000 vehicles owned by the city, and most of them still used traditional gasoline. Mr. LEPPERT: Most are traditional but as you can imagine when you've got a quarter of your fleet that's using an alternative fuel, that clearly cushions some of the increases that we're seeing in the cost of oil and the cost of gasoline. But with that said, it's still a big increase. We'll see about a 20 percent increase, which as I said reflects on millions and millions of dollars' impact on the budget. RAZ: So, as you say, a 20 percent increase in cost of fuel. What kind of relief can you look for? I mean, do you look to the state? Do you look to the federal government? Mr. LEPPERT: Well, first of all, we try to look at actions that we can take that are going to reduce that. And those range from when we have fire vehicles that are in staging on a multiple alarm fire to turn those off. Those sorts of things we've looked at. Even going to GPS systems and installing those on our sanitation vehicles so that we minimize the amount of use and they become more efficient in their use. RAZ: Have you heard any ideas from other mayors at the conference that you might want to steal and take back with you to Dallas? Mr. LEPPERT: I think there's a couple of them that are very interesting. Miami has used towards using solar panels and really pushing hard on that to try to offset energy costs at City Hall and other public buildings. I think that's an interesting one. You've got that all the way to the range of a smaller city in Indiana that's moved away from traditional traffic lights and moved to roundabouts, which you see in Europe. When you go around and make left-hand turns by circling around or right-hand turns by peeling off as ways to reduce the amount of energy that's used, just gasoline that's used in their communities. And they are having some good successes on that. So, I think that's the benefit of a meeting like this, is hopefully there is a good sharing of ideas. I tell you that the mayors, there's a very congenial spirit, there's really a desire to share as many ideas, understanding that we're all in it together. RAZ: And, I mean, has the cost of gas really sort of accelerated this process of making changes in big cities? Mr. LEPPERT: It certainly has. And I don't think that's any different from families all across the nation looking at ways to minimize the impact and businesses all across the country. Cities are in the same position, having to deal with the increases and try to find ways to offset it. RAZ: That's Tom Leppert. He is the mayor of Dallas, and he's attending this weekend's conference of mayors in Miami. Mayor Leppert, thanks for being with us. Mr. LEPPERT: It's terrific being with you. I appreciate the time.

This week, the United Nation Security Council adopted a U. S. -sponsored resolution that says that sexual attacks in conflict zones may be considered war crimes.  Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice appeared at the U. N. on Thursday to introduce the resolution.  She joins us by phone.  Secretary Rice, thank you so much for being with us. Secretary CONDOLEEZZA RICE (Secretary of State):  It's very good to be with you, too. SIMON:  And, explain to us, please, some of the language of this resolution and what exactly it accomplishes or obligates the U. N. to do. Secretary RICE:  Well, the U. N. Security Council adopted Resolution 1325 some time ago about essentially this issue. But I formed a women's foreign policy network about two years ago made up largely of women foreign ministers and other ministers, and we felt there needed to be more action on the issue of sexual violence against women, and particularly the use of sexual violence against women as a tool of warfare. We did another resolution that now puts in place a mechanism for reporting on these crimes, that encourages strong follow-up on these crimes and then to try to do something about the impunity that sometimes accompanies them. I myself really was very much moved by an experience that I had in 2005 of going to a refugee camp in Darfur and sitting with a group of women, all of whom had experienced being raped by soldiers or by rebels as they just tried to go and do simple things like gather firewood or water, and so I felt very strongly about this. And we were able in the Security Council to bring some important attention to the issue and to get the secretary-general to agree that he's going to develop a mechanism to deal with it. SIMON:  At some point last year I guess, China, Russia, South Africa, Vietnam had all expressed reservations on this, saying that, admirable as some of these sentiments might be, they are already covered in other stipulations. What changed their mind? Secretary RICE:  Well, I think that we've had some experiences - even including, for instance, some very bad experiences with peacekeeping forces - I have to say, people have followed up and people have been punished but. . . SIMON:  These are U. N. peacekeeping forces. Secretary RICE:  Yeah.  These were U. N. peacekeeping forces, and we've had some problems with that. And we've also, of course, continued to watch the horrors of Darfur. We've seen sexual violence against women in conflicts in the DROC, in Somalia. And I think there was finally a sense that the U. N. Security Council, which deals with threats to international peace and security, had to consider this a threat to international peace and security. SIMON:  I have to ask you, Secretary Rice, the New York Times reported on Friday that U. S. officials believe an Israeli military exercise that was conducted earlier this month was some kind of rehearsal for what could be the process of an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities, a way of alerting Iran they had this in place. You're in a position to know a lot. Is that true? Secretary RICE:  Look, I'm not going to comment on someone's comment anonymously on what they may have seen in military exercises. We are in constant discussion with the Israeli government, as well as many other governments, about the threat and the problem of Iran, how to deal with the prospect of Iranian technology that could lead to a nuclear weapon. We are committed to a diplomatic course, and that's what we're dealing with. SIMON:  We also note the Council on Thursday condemned violence in Zimbabwe in advance of next week's presidential runoff. Secretary RICE: Yes.  SIMON:  Is that going to be an honest election? Secretary RICE:  You know, elections don't start on Election Day. They start in the run-up.  Can people campaign? Are activists and opponents of the regime free from intimidation? And I think you'd have to say that when you have the president of Zimbabwe saying that he'll never accept an outcome in which the other side wins, or when you have the so-called war veterans intimidating people and accusing opposition leaders of treason, it's kind of hard to see how that's going to be a free and fair election. This is a very serious matter, and the United States does intend to put it on the agenda of the Security Council next week. SIMON:  There have been a lot of resolutions. Is anybody prepared to do anything other than pass another resolution? Secretary RICE:  Well, sometimes one has to admit that the international community as a whole is slow to act. You know, the United States has often been accused of too much unilateralism. But I'll tell you, what we've tried to do is to be leaders, and to be leaders of multilateral institutions that can act. But we believe that unless the Security Council acts, it does stand to lose credibility. SIMON:  US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.  Thank you so much.   Secretary RICE:  Thank you.  It was good to talk to you.  SCOTT SIMON, host:  In many parts of the world, the horror of sexual violence is becoming common among the horrors of war.

I'm Guy Raz in for Andrea Seabrook. Zimbabwe's opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai has withdrawn from his country's presidential runoff election set to be held this Friday. That decision leaves the field open to one man, Zimbabwe's long-time president Robert Mugabe. He's held power since 1980. Tsvangirai accuses Mugabe's party, ZANU-PF, of fomenting violence against supporters of his political party, the Movement for Democratic Change. Mr. MORGAN TSVANGIRAI (Movement for Democratic Change): We will no longer participate in this violent, illegitimate sham of an election process. RAZ: Now back in March, Tsvangirai won the highest number of votes in the first round of voting, but enough to win outright. Still, human rights groups critical of Robert Mugabe believe this Friday's runoff election was the best chance Zimbabwe's opposition had to oust Mugabe. Earlier, we asked Nelson Chamisa, a spokesman for Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change why the party has opted out of the runoff. Mr. NELSON CHAMISA (Spokesman, Movement for Democratic Change): It's not possible for an election to be held in this country. So we don't want to just go in that process as a ritual. We want a process that going to create any disposition for Zimbabweans. The situation has completely changed from the way it was in March when we held the first election. Now, even if we were to win, Mugabe has declared that he will not respect the outcome of the people so why then go into that? RAZ: Mr. Chamisa, you say it would've been a sham of an election but there are literally hundreds of monitors, election monitors in Zimbabwe now. Wouldn't this have been a fair election? Mr. CHAMISA: Well, certainly not. It's just impossible for an election to be held. This is about war, you know, people are armed, guns are being used. The bullet has taken over. So the politics is no longer important. And we are people won't believe in the violence so this is not our game. RAZ: So where does the opposition in Zimbabwe go now? I mean you're essentially withdrawing from your best chance of gaining political power, what do you do now? Mr. CHAMISA: Certainly not. We are going to announce our best way forward and our vision in two days time and that is what the president indicated. RAZ: But if there is an election happening on Friday and you're withdrawing, I mean, many people are putting their hopes in your party, in your movement to change Zimbabwe. Mr. CHAMISA: You see, it's not possible to change this regime through a sham of an election. It's almost like, you know, playing football without a soccer ball. RAZ: Nelson Chamisa, thanks for joining us. Mr. CHAMISA: Thank you very much. RAZ: That was Nelson Chamisa, a spokesman for Zimbabwe's opposition party; Movement for Democratic Change speaking with us from Harare. The group's leader, Morgan Tsvangirai announced today that he's withdrawing from his country's presidential runoff. We turn now to our own Ofeibea Quist-Arcton who's following developments in Zimbabwe from neighboring South Africa. Ofeibea, we just heard Nelson Chamisa say that the opposition will announce their next steps in the coming days. Now that they've essentially ceded the election to President Robert Mugabe, what are their options? OFEIBEA QUIST-ARCTON: I think they're waiting to see what the international reaction is to what was, after all, a pretty difficult decision to pull out of the election. But as you heard Nelson Chamisa say and the opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, the whole thing was a farce. And they have been saying this for a very long time. They also said, are they going to wait until Robert Mugabe steals the election, their word, for world leaders to react to the situation in Zimbabwe? They said it was untenable. Also that a number of supporters they have lost. They're saying more than 60, 70 people dead, thousands chased from their home, thousands brutally beaten on all over their body, their hands, their feet, their buttocks are - it's too high a price to pay to run in this election. But they're now going to have to see whether they have support outside. RAZ: Ofeibea, what kind of options does the international community have, particularly the African Union? Can they apply pressure to the current Zimbabwean government? QUIST-ARCTON: That's exactly what Morgan Tsvangirai and the opposition is hoping for. And that's probably why they have taken this move because they feel that regional leaders in Southern Africa and more widely on the continent have not done enough to stop the violence that has after all lasted what? Two months almost since the first round of the presidential vote back in March. So I think this is a real challenge to Africa, to the African Union, and (inaudible) to friendly western and other governments to say what is happening in Zimbabwe is wrong and must stop. RAZ: And all of that violence coming from the ruling ZANU-PF party? QUIST-ARCTON: Well, that's what not only the opposition says, but human rights organizations, western diplomats, other diplomats, and increasingly African leaders who had initially been reluctant to criticize Robert Mugabe, or to criticize the situation in Zimbabwe. But over the past ten days or so they have saying that violence must stop. From the government side they say the opposition is responsible for the attacks. RAZ: Ofeibea, even though Morgan Tsvangirai has withdrawn, will his name still remain on the ballot. And if so, in theory, could he still win? QUIST-ARCTON: Guy, let me just read what Zimbabwe's electoral commission is saying. It says the commission is going ahead with the plans for the June 27th presidential runoff election which are now at an advanced stage. As far as the commission is concerned, the runoff is going ahead as Tsvangirai has not formally communicated this withdrawal. So yes it looks as if his name will remain on the ballot. But we'll have to see whether in fact that he comes out the winner. What the opposition is saying is that their supporters have been so beaten and so intimidated by Robert Mugabe's thugs as they call them and his supporters and his youth militia that people have been intimidated into not voting. So goodness knows who is going to come out and vote on Friday and whether the opposition supporters will probably not since their candidate says he's withdrawn. RAZ: Now there has been some initial reaction to this decision by Morgan Tsvangirai from the international community. What are you hearing so far? QUIST-ARCTON: Well, South Africa, and South Africa is the appointed regional mediator. Southern African development community has been trying to mediate in the crisis in Zimbabwe for the past year or so. It's saying it hopes that the two sides will be able to sit down together and talk. At the moment, of course, the opposition is saying absolutely not. Why should it negotiate with Robert Mugabe who has tried to cheat in elections. And who is now trying to kill people to stay in power. But I think negotiation is the only way. And there is talk and there has been for the past month or so of a national unity government. But the opposition is not going to get involved if it thinks that Robert Mugabe will head that government. It says that the official elected leader of Zimbabwe is Morgan Tsvangirai. RAZ: Ofeibea, thanks for joining us. QUIST-ARCTON: Always a pleasure. RAZ: That's NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton speaking with us from Johannesburg, South Africa.  GUY RAZ, host:  From NPR News, it's ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Guy Raz in for Andrea Seabrook.  Zimbabwe's opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai has withdrawn from his country's presidential runoff election set to be held this Friday. That decision leaves the field open to one man, Zimbabwe's long-time president Robert Mugabe. He's held power since 1980. Tsvangirai accuses Mugabe's party, ZANU-PF, of fomenting violence against supporters of his political party, the Movement for Democratic Change.  Mr. MORGAN TSVANGIRAI (Movement for Democratic Change): We will no longer participate in this violent, illegitimate sham of an election process.  RAZ: Now back in March, Tsvangirai won the highest number of votes in the first round of voting, but enough to win outright. Still, human rights groups critical of Robert Mugabe believe this Friday's runoff election was the best chance Zimbabwe's opposition had to oust Mugabe. Earlier, we asked Nelson Chamisa, a spokesman for Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change why the party has opted out of the runoff.  Mr. NELSON CHAMISA (Spokesman, Movement for Democratic Change): It's not possible for an election to be held in this country. So we don't want to just go in that process as a ritual. We want a process that going to create any disposition for Zimbabweans. The situation has completely changed from the way it was in March when we held the first election. Now, even if we were to win, Mugabe has declared that he will not respect the outcome of the people so why then go into that?  RAZ: Mr. Chamisa, you say it would've been a sham of an election but there are literally hundreds of monitors, election monitors in Zimbabwe now. Wouldn't this have been a fair election?  Mr. CHAMISA: Well, certainly not. It's just impossible for an election to be held. This is about war, you know, people are armed, guns are being used. The bullet has taken over. So the politics is no longer important. And we are people won't believe in the violence so this is not our game.  RAZ: So where does the opposition in Zimbabwe go now? I mean you're essentially withdrawing from your best chance of gaining political power, what do you do now?  Mr. CHAMISA: Certainly not. We are going to announce our best way forward and our vision in two days time and that is what the president indicated.  RAZ: But if there is an election happening on Friday and you're withdrawing, I mean, many people are putting their hopes in your party, in your movement to change Zimbabwe.  Mr. CHAMISA: You see, it's not possible to change this regime through a sham of an election. It's almost like, you know, playing football without a soccer ball.  RAZ: Nelson Chamisa, thanks for joining us.  Mr. CHAMISA: Thank you very much.  RAZ: That was Nelson Chamisa, a spokesman for Zimbabwe's opposition party; Movement for Democratic Change speaking with us from Harare. The group's leader, Morgan Tsvangirai announced today that he's withdrawing from his country's presidential runoff.  We turn now to our own Ofeibea Quist-Arcton who's following developments in Zimbabwe from neighboring South Africa.  Ofeibea, we just heard Nelson Chamisa say that the opposition will announce their next steps in the coming days. Now that they've essentially ceded the election to President Robert Mugabe, what are their options?  OFEIBEA QUIST-ARCTON: I think they're waiting to see what the international reaction is to what was, after all, a pretty difficult decision to pull out of the election. But as you heard Nelson Chamisa say and the opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, the whole thing was a farce. And they have been saying this for a very long time. They also said, are they going to wait until Robert Mugabe steals the election, their word, for world leaders to react to the situation in Zimbabwe?  They said it was untenable. Also that a number of supporters they have lost. They're saying more than 60, 70 people dead, thousands chased from their home, thousands brutally beaten on all over their body, their hands, their feet, their buttocks are - it's too high a price to pay to run in this election. But they're now going to have to see whether they have support outside.  RAZ: Ofeibea, what kind of options does the international community have, particularly the African Union? Can they apply pressure to the current Zimbabwean government?  QUIST-ARCTON: That's exactly what Morgan Tsvangirai and the opposition is hoping for. And that's probably why they have taken this move because they feel that regional leaders in Southern Africa and more widely on the continent have not done enough to stop the violence that has after all lasted what? Two months almost since the first round of the presidential vote back in March.  So I think this is a real challenge to Africa, to the African Union, and (inaudible) to friendly western and other governments to say what is happening in Zimbabwe is wrong and must stop.  RAZ: And all of that violence coming from the ruling ZANU-PF party?  QUIST-ARCTON: Well, that's what not only the opposition says, but human rights organizations, western diplomats, other diplomats, and increasingly African leaders who had initially been reluctant to criticize Robert Mugabe, or to criticize the situation in Zimbabwe. But over the past ten days or so they have saying that violence must stop. From the government side they say the opposition is responsible for the attacks.  RAZ: Ofeibea, even though Morgan Tsvangirai has withdrawn, will his name still remain on the ballot. And if so, in theory, could he still win?  QUIST-ARCTON: Guy, let me just read what Zimbabwe's electoral commission is saying. It says the commission is going ahead with the plans for the June 27th presidential runoff election which are now at an advanced stage. As far as the commission is concerned, the runoff is going ahead as Tsvangirai has not formally communicated this withdrawal.  So yes it looks as if his name will remain on the ballot. But we'll have to see whether in fact that he comes out the winner. What the opposition is saying is that their supporters have been so beaten and so intimidated by Robert Mugabe's thugs as they call them and his supporters and his youth militia that people have been intimidated into not voting.  So goodness knows who is going to come out and vote on Friday and whether the opposition supporters will probably not since their candidate says he's withdrawn.  RAZ: Now there has been some initial reaction to this decision by Morgan Tsvangirai from the international community. What are you hearing so far?

The first five years are the most important in terms of shaping a child's brain. We're all born with different gifts, but how we'll will be able to live and learn depends in part on the nutrition and stimulation we get as little ones.  So today we continue our series on kids with a look at the best ways parents and caregivers can develop their child's brain. In a few minutes we'll speak to a psychology professor about the impact of culture and environment on brain development. But right now, we have Annapurni Trouth, the chairperson for the Department of Neurology at Howard University Hospital. She also serves as the director of pediatric neurology at Howard University hospital. Plus Areva Martin. She's a civil litigation lawyer who specializes in disability law and special education. She's also the cofounder and president of the Special Needs Network. It provides services to families with disabled children in underserved communities. Ms. AREVA MARTIN (Civil Litigation lawyer): Good morning, welcome. CHIDEYA: So Dr. Trouth, let me start with you. When does the brain start developing? Dr. ANNAPURNI TROUTH (Chairperson, Department of Neurology, Howard University Hospital): Almost from day one. In a sense start to differentiate in an early embryo. You find that a certain group of cells that are going to form the brain, the neuroplasts, line themselves up and form a streak. And then they dip in from a tube and around this tube you found there's a lot of cells that divide and divide and subdivide and the division of these cells, the neurons, which are going to form the neurons, that is the formation for the brain. The brain produces about 200 billion cells, you know, many more than an adult has, and unless there's proper connectivity, some of those cells kind of die off because they don't connect well and they don't stay ion the brain system. And the brain actually is about 25 percent of the size of an adult brain in a new born baby. By the time you are about three years, old you are almost the size of the brain size is almost the size of an adult brain. So there's a very rapid development of the brain in particularly in the first three years of life. CHIDEYA: Now over the past decades, people have changed their ideas about what intelligence is and, you know, how people develop skills and whether they'rre gifted is, etcetera. How is it that some people can get more stimulation than others in ways that help their brain? Isn't it a situation where you can have a child who's born and they could become very different depending on the environment and the nutrition that they get. Dr. TROUTH: Absolutely. There's not only environment that plays a role, the genes play a role. But the environment and the gene interaction is very, very important and that can change the gene function, the environment can change the gene function and how the brain develops and the synaptic connections in the brain. So I think there's a big interaction that is occurring. And around that is the social and emotional factors that are important in the development of the child, so the nurturing of the child is just a s important and can even alter genes, you know, because that's part of the environment in a growing child. So I think there's a lot of factors here that are involved in a baby's growing and the maximum stimulation that clearly should be given to a child is in those first three years of development. CHIDEYA: What is it that's so important about the first three years? Dr. TROUTH: That is when the brain is growing maximally, the brain is almost like a sponge, it absorbs everything that can be given to a brain. Now once you do not really intervene during these first three years, then people have shown in the studies that the brain actually is a smaller brain. And even in animal studies, it's been shown, animals that are in the wild have a much bigger brain than animals that are brought up in captivity. So you find a human child is just the same.  You know, if you have a child who is not nurtured, nobody talks to the child, the child is not really socially stimulated then the brain size can actually be smaller than a normal, what a normal brain would be. And with the size you have the connections in the brain, the so-called synapses. So these synapses, it's very important, but stimulation, really, you know, the brain is plastic and stimulation really kind of channels where these connections will occur. And it is a circuitry in the brain, how the cells are connected, how many thousands of neurons are interconnected, you know, that clearly tells us how a person will grow and think and socially adjust himself. And be a value to society. CHIDEYA: Let me bring you in, Ariva. You are someone who clearly values education, is very accomplished is very successful, mother of three. When you had your first two children, specifically, and we'll get to your third child in a second, what did you do to try and make sure that they were getting what they needed to grow healthy and to maximize their potential? Ms. MARTIN: Basically the social interaction piece that the doctor talked about. I found that was critically, critically important to the development of my two girls. So getting them to the library, reading them books, taking them out in the community, introducing them to different people, to art, to music and really, as the doctor indicated, stimulating their minds, trying to engage them. I found that that was really important to their development. And today my teenage daughter is an avid, avid reader. She reads the New York Times ferociously. She knows every fact that's ever been printed in the New York Times. And my husband and I know that that's attributable to the time we took as a child with her really engaging her in the reading process. CHIDEYA: What was one of the fun moments - and there are always fun moments with kids - where you just saw them getting something? You saw them, something clicked in and they got a new skill when they were little? Ms. MARTIN: Well I think for me with my girls in particular, it was the independence. You start to notice that your children don't rely on you as much for things they had become so accustomed to relying on you for. So I saw my girls start to, you know, move away from my husband and I, and to take steps and to start to really think on their own, to start piecing together what had been taught to them, you know, as preschoolers and as toddlers. CHIDEYA: Let me turn back to you, Dr. Trouth. It sounds as if, simply from the tone of your voice, you're very exciting by the ways in which all of this brain development takes place. How much do you think parents at this point actually know? I mean, do you think parents are really aware that you can actually change your child's brain over the first three years by what you do, or what you don't do?  Dr. TROUTH: I think that many parents still do not know this. You know they think that this is all a part of growth and if just nutrition is supplied that might be enough for the baby, but - and some people, you know, really dearly need to be educated about how much their role is in the development of their children. And I think those first three years are really very clearly important in a  child's life.  CHIDEYA: Now, Areva, your youngest child has autism. That has all sorts of different implications for how you interact with a child and teach a child and how the child develops. When did you notice there was something different? Ms. MARTIN: Probably around 18 months, I started to notice that he wasn't talking. The social interaction piece that we've been talking about this morning, my son just wasn't engaging. He wouldn't give eye contact to other children or adults and he separated himself. We would find him in a room by himself playing with toys or lining things up, or engaged in all kids of really, what I now know to be repetitive conduct that's is very typical of children with autism. At the time, I didn't have the education that the doctor is talking about in terms of noticing, or not necessarily noticing, but knowing what those signs really mean for my child, which I now later learned were all symptoms, very common symptoms of autism. CHIDEYA: Dr. Trouth, is there something different about he brains of children with autism? I mean there's so much kind of new research coming out every day. But when we talk about the way that autistic children behave and live in the world, and autism is now being talked about more and more, is it that their brains are different, or what do we think is going on? Dr. TROUTH: We know really very little. We are scratching the surface. At this point we know that the genes probably play a role, but we do not know which genes. It does run more in families, but again there is no direct genetic factor. Now could the environment play a role? Yes, I think there is an environmental factor. but it's not only an environmental factor. I know there has been a lot of news media coverage for vaccinations and maybe vaccinations may produce it. But there are millions of children getting vaccinations and we really don't have a direct cause and effect relationship.  So I think there's multiple factors that probably line up and it appears to be the male brain is more susceptible. You know the incidents of autism is not more in males, in most five times greater in males as compared to females. You know there's a special form which is in the process of development (unintelligible),  which is genetically related called the red syndrome(ph) which you se in girls. But the autism is major and much more commonly seen in boys. Now we do not really know exactly what the causes of autism. CHIDEYA: Now Ariva, we want you to stay with us. We're going to bring in another one of our medical experts. But Dr. Trouth, we want to thank you for being with us. Thank you so much. Dr. TROUTH: Thank you. CHIDEYA: we were just speaking with Annapurni Trouth, chairperson for the Department of Neurology at Howard University Hospital. And now I want to bring Yvette Harris into the conversation. She's an associate professor of psychology at Miami University and author of the book \"The African-American Child: Development and Challenges. \" How are you doing? Professor YVETTE HARRIS (Associate Professor of Psychology, Miami University): I'm doing well. CHIDEYA: So we have been speaking about Areva's family, which includes two children who do not have autism or special needs and one child who does. When you think about - let's start with children who don't have any special needs. In the course of your work, what do African-American kids really need at early ages to thrive? Prof. HARRIS: I think similarly with other children, they need the stimulation, they need a very secure environment, they need the ability to develop an attachment relationship with a caregiver. So similar with other children, they have those basic needs. They need to feel that they're in a stable environment, an environment that will continually provide for them to allow them to develop a sense of trust with their environment. CHIDEYA: But when you specifically have a book that talks about development and challenges, what kind of challenges are you talking about? Prof. HARRIS: I'm talking about challenges such as the health challenges, specifically focusing in on our high infant mortality rate in comparison to other ethnic and racial groups. I'm talking about the specific health challenges that African-American children are confronted with, such as sickle cell anemia, lead poisoning, all of those that have a direct impact on their cognitive develop, as well as their psychosocial, emotional development. CHIDEYA: Areva, you and your husband are professionals who no doubt are in a position to really be able to apply certain resources, whether it's time or money, to the care of your children, including your son with his special needs around autism. But that doesn't mean that the problem disappears. And you also are working with this Special Needs Network that really tries to help people who don't necessarily have the resources that you might have. Tell us about the work that you're doing with that. Ms. MARTIN: It's very exciting work, and I get really passionate about talking about it, because one thing that our organization does, we go into communities where families don't have access to information, they don't have access to resources or to services, and we educate them about the very topics we're talking about this morning. The need to be involved with their children at very young ages, the need to know what the developmental milestones are.  Often times, African-American families don't know what to look for in a developing child. So you won't necessarily know that at the age of two, children should be speaking. And so I often see families that come into my organization that are five and six years old, and the children have no language. And the family hasn't taken any steps to get intervention, to get an evaluation or to determine what's happening with that child. So Special Needs Network looks to bring that kind of information and those kinds of resources into communities of color, into poor communities, into low-income communities so that families will know what to look for and how to then access services that can make a tremendous difference in the lives of a developing child. CHIDEYA: Professor Harris, in terms of identifying kids who may need some either additional help or some special educational coaching, how's that going, broadly, in terms of, you know, the African community - African-American community? Do you think that people know what to do? Prof. HARRIS: I think there are some people who do know what to do, and those are typically your high-resource people. But we're talking about a segment of people who are low-resource people and high risk and, you know, live in the most at-risk environments. And that group can be young and teen mothers who probably have limited knowledge about where to seek out services. You know, so therefore, groups like the one that Areva just talked about are so very, very important, especially targeting those young mothers and those poor mothers. CHIDEYA: You know, kids. . . Ms. MARTIN: Well. . . CHIDEYA: Please, go ahead. Ms. MARTIN: I was just going to say, we do know statistically that African-American and Latino children are often diagnosed with conditions like autism one to two years later than their typical counterparts. So we know that that information that our communities so desperately need is not getting into the hands of those parents that can then take some steps to do something about it. So our kids are lagging behind because they are not getting diagnosed timely. Therefore they are not getting intervention timely. CHIDEYA: Professor Harris, give me just two or three bullet points of things that might be the red flags. If your child does or doesn't do blank, you might want to go see a doctor. Prof. HARRIS: Language delay. Alright, I think knowledge of developmental time tables, but definitely language delay. And we're talking about, for example, autism language delay. If your child is not speaking, let's say, comparatively with other children, then you know that might be a red flag for you. If the child has any kind of motor delay, or any kind of repetitive behavior, you know, that might be a red flag for you. CHIDEYA: What on the other hand are things that you would consider doing for a kid who showed early promise, like an early reader or a kid who was musically gifted? Prof. HARRIS: You mean in terms of. . . CHIDEYA: Yeah, what should you do in terms - like if you see a kid who's kind of got the ball and running with it, what do you do with that kid? Prof. HARRIS: Oh, if it's a kid who's got a particular leaning toward reading, then you keep stimulating that, you know. You keep encouraging them to - you provide them with the opportunities to develop those more advanced reading kinds of skills. CHIDEYA: Now, Areva, we only have a little bit of time, but what have you learned from being a mother to children with different perspectives on growth? Ms. MARTIN: Well, what I've learned as both a mother, a lawyer and an advocate for children is that all children are different. They're all so incredibly special. And no matter if your child has a language delay or your child is gifted, as that child who's an avid reader, but we as parents play such a critical role in nurturing that child. And when we embrace that role as being the final arbiters of how our children will develop, that we can see our children just make incredible progress. CHIDEYA: I want to thank both of you so much. Ms. MARTIN: Thank you. Prof. HARRIS: Thank you. CHIDEYA: Areva Martin is a lawyer and advocate for special needs and disabled children in under-served communities. She was here with us at our NPR West Studios. And Yvette Harris is an associate professor of psychology at Miami University and author of the book \"The African American Child: Development and Challenges. \" She spoke with us from the studios at member station WBUM at Miami University.

We would find him in a room by himself playing with toys or lining things up, or engaged in all kids of really, what I now know to be repetitive conduct that's is very typical of children with autism. At the time, I didn't have the education that the doctor is talking about in terms of noticing, or not necessarily noticing, but knowing what those signs really mean for my child, which I now later learned were all symptoms, very common symptoms of autism.  CHIDEYA: Dr. Trouth, is there something different about he brains of children with autism? I mean there's so much kind of new research coming out every day. But when we talk about the way that autistic children behave and live in the world, and autism is now being talked about more and more, is it that their brains are different, or what do we think is going on?  Dr. TROUTH: We know really very little. We are scratching the surface. At this point we know that the genes probably play a role, but we do not know which genes. It does run more in families, but again there is no direct genetic factor. Now could the environment play a role? Yes, I think there is an environmental factor. but it's not only an environmental factor. I know there has been a lot of news media coverage for vaccinations and maybe vaccinations may produce it. But there are millions of children getting vaccinations and we really don't have a direct cause and effect relationship.   So I think there's multiple factors that probably line up and it appears to be the male brain is more susceptible. You know the incidents of autism is not more in males, in most five times greater in males as compared to females. You know there's a special form which is in the process of development (unintelligible),  which is genetically related called the red syndrome(ph) which you se in girls. But the autism is major and much more commonly seen in boys. Now we do not really know exactly what the causes of autism.  CHIDEYA: Now Ariva, we want you to stay with us. We're going to bring in another one of our medical experts. But Dr. Trouth, we want to thank you for being with us. Thank you so much.  Dr. TROUTH: Thank you.  CHIDEYA: we were just speaking with Annapurni Trouth, chairperson for the Department of Neurology at Howard University Hospital. And now I want to bring Yvette Harris into the conversation. She's an associate professor of psychology at Miami University and author of the book \"The African-American Child: Development and Challenges. \" How are you doing?  Professor YVETTE HARRIS (Associate Professor of Psychology, Miami University): I'm doing well.  CHIDEYA: So we have been speaking about Areva's family, which includes two children who do not have autism or special needs and one child who does. When you think about - let's start with children who don't have any special needs. In the course of your work, what do African-American kids really need at early ages to thrive?  Prof. HARRIS: I think similarly with other children, they need the stimulation, they need a very secure environment, they need the ability to develop an attachment relationship with a caregiver. So similar with other children, they have those basic needs. They need to feel that they're in a stable environment, an environment that will continually provide for them to allow them to develop a sense of trust with their environment.  CHIDEYA: But when you specifically have a book that talks about development and challenges, what kind of challenges are you talking about?  Prof. HARRIS: I'm talking about challenges such as the health challenges, specifically focusing in on our high infant mortality rate in comparison to other ethnic and racial groups. I'm talking about the specific health challenges that African-American children are confronted with, such as sickle cell anemia, lead poisoning, all of those that have a direct impact on their cognitive develop, as well as their psychosocial, emotional development.  CHIDEYA: Areva, you and your husband are professionals who no doubt are in a position to really be able to apply certain resources, whether it's time or money, to the care of your children, including your son with his special needs around autism. But that doesn't mean that the problem disappears. And you also are working with this Special Needs Network that really tries to help people who don't necessarily have the resources that you might have. Tell us about the work that you're doing with that.  Ms. MARTIN: It's very exciting work, and I get really passionate about talking about it, because one thing that our organization does, we go into communities where families don't have access to information, they don't have access to resources or to services, and we educate them about the very topics we're talking about this morning. The need to be involved with their children at very young ages, the need to know what the developmental milestones are.   Often times, African-American families don't know what to look for in a developing child. So you won't necessarily know that at the age of two, children should be speaking. And so I often see families that come into my organization that are five and six years old, and the children have no language. And the family hasn't taken any steps to get intervention, to get an evaluation or to determine what's happening with that child. So Special Needs Network looks to bring that kind of information and those kinds of resources into communities of color, into poor communities, into low-income communities so that families will know what to look for and how to then access services that can make a tremendous difference in the lives of a developing child.  CHIDEYA: Professor Harris, in terms of identifying kids who may need some either additional help or some special educational coaching, how's that going, broadly, in terms of, you know, the African community - African-American community? Do you think that people know what to do?  Prof. HARRIS: I think there are some people who do know what to do, and those are typically your high-resource people. But we're talking about a segment of people who are low-resource people and high risk and, you know, live in the most at-risk environments. And that group can be young and teen mothers who probably have limited knowledge about where to seek out services. You know, so therefore, groups like the one that Areva just talked about are so very, very important, especially targeting those young mothers and those poor mothers.  CHIDEYA: You know, kids. . .  Ms. MARTIN: Well. . .  CHIDEYA: Please, go ahead.  Ms. MARTIN: I was just going to say, we do know statistically that African-American and Latino children are often diagnosed with conditions like autism one to two years later than their typical counterparts. So we know that that information that our communities so desperately need is not getting into the hands of those parents that can then take some steps to do something about it. So our kids are lagging behind because they are not getting diagnosed timely. Therefore they are not getting intervention timely.  CHIDEYA: Professor Harris, give me just two or three bullet points of things that might be the red flags. If your child does or doesn't do blank, you might want to go see a doctor.  Prof. HARRIS: Language delay. Alright, I think knowledge of developmental time tables, but definitely language delay. And we're talking about, for example, autism language delay. If your child is not speaking, let's say, comparatively with other children, then you know that might be a red flag for you. If the child has any kind of motor delay, or any kind of repetitive behavior, you know, that might be a red flag for you.  CHIDEYA: What on the other hand are things that you would consider doing for a kid who showed early promise, like an early reader or a kid who was musically gifted?  Prof. HARRIS: You mean in terms of. . .  CHIDEYA: Yeah, what should you do in terms - like if you see a kid who's kind of got the ball and running with it, what do you do with that kid?  Prof. HARRIS: Oh, if it's a kid who's got a particular leaning toward reading, then you keep stimulating that, you know. You keep encouraging them to - you provide them with the opportunities to develop those more advanced reading kinds of skills.  CHIDEYA: Now, Areva, we only have a little bit of time, but what have you learned from being a mother to children with different perspectives on growth?  Ms. MARTIN: Well, what I've learned as both a mother, a lawyer and an advocate for children is that all children are different. They're all so incredibly special. And no matter if your child has a language delay or your child is gifted, as that child who's an avid reader, but we as parents play such a critical role in nurturing that child. And when we embrace that role as being the final arbiters of how our children will develop, that we can see our children just make incredible progress.  CHIDEYA: I want to thank both of you so much.  Ms. MARTIN: Thank you.  Prof. HARRIS: Thank you.  CHIDEYA: Areva Martin is a lawyer and advocate for special needs and disabled children in under-served communities.

Coming up, an island of myths and legends off the coast of Chile. But first, reaction around the world to Friday's presidential runoff election in Zimbabwe has been harsh. The U. S. called the election a sham. The European Union denounced it as hollow and meaningless. Those and other world powers said they would not recognize Robert Mugabe's government. Forces loyal to President Mugabe reportedly forced people to the polls. Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai said that millions boycotted the election despite the intimidation. Britain's Foreign Office minister Lord Mark Malloch Brown has been prominent in the efforts to pressure the Mugabe regime. He joins us now from London. Lord Brown, thanks for being with us. Lord MARK MALLOCH BROWN (Minister for Africa, Asia and the UN, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Britain): Thank you.  SIMON: All this condemnation, including Queen Elizabeth revoking President Mugabe's knighthood. But it does not seem to have had much effect. What might? Lord MALLOCH BROWN: Well, first I think this condemnation is reflective of a very different global political environment. For many years, President Mugabe could argue it was him against Britain and the U. S. Today, it's him against the world. His own neighbors, many African countries, have come out against him. And I think that's going to be very destabilizing for him. Initially just politically, but if he holds on, then I think he will see not just U. S. and European sanctions, but perhaps UN-based sanctions implemented by his African neighbors. So I think he's on a slippery slope now.  SIMON: When you get to the matter, the practical effect of economic sanctions - which we have seen in scores of areas around the world - is it possible to punish President Mugabe with sanctions without harming the innocent citizens of Zimbabwe? Lord MALLOCH BROWN: First, I think you start with sanctions, as we have, targeted at him personally and the 100 or so people around him. And we've already got steps against them. And I think those now need to go global. And we need to chase their financial assets. We need to chase them when they travel with potential human rights arrest warrants. We perhaps have to look at preventing their children going abroad to college and university. It may be that we will need to target the companies that are associated with them while trying to protect the broader mass of Zimbabweans, because the United States and the U. K. both remain very generous in humanitarian assistance, because we don't want them to be the victims of these sanctions. SIMON: What about the role of African governments, because a number of African governments have been - I think it's safe to say - unusually critical towards Zimbabwe in recent weeks. Lord MALLOCH BROWN: Yeah. I mean, I think they are very proud as a region of their improved democratic performance in recent years, and Mugabe has become a stain on that. And I think here in London where we celebrated Nelson Mandela's 90th birthday this week, when he came out and expressed horror for what was happening next door to his own country, in Zimbabwe, I think it was indicative of just how dramatic the change of opinion is and how Africa is anxious to move on and to see a transition in Zimbabwe.  SIMON: I noticed - BBC coverage, in fact - a number of people who were brave enough to give interviews in Zimbabwe or just over the border in South Africa. They said, somebody ought to send troops. Somebody ought to change this thing. What do you think about that? Lord MALLOCH BROWN: We've always felt that this needs to be solved by a combination of political and economic steps. The idea of a Western intervention, which was the original conception of this, is one we've clearly ruled out, as has the United States. But you know, it may be that in the face of the collapse of the country that South Africa and the other neighbors would have no choice but to try and stabilize it.

I'm Liane Hansen. This month on our program we've been examining the state of America's infrastructure. We've heard about the problems with the country's roads, levees, water systems and bridges. The question today is who's going to pay to make improvements? Certainly, we'll all pay in higher taxes. But what about private industry? What's in it for them to invest directly in public works? Coming up, a report from Curt Nickisch about private investment. But first we want to focus on efforts by elected officials to push for greater federal funding for infrastructure. This past January, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger spoke in front of a backdrop of snarled highway trestles. He was flanked by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell. Governor ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER (Republican, California): The bottom line is that America right now needs 1. 6 trillion dollars to rebuild and to really invest in the future. I think it is very important that we take this seriously. This is why we formed this coalition to put the spotlight on this issue nationwide. We must get going. We must invest. HANSEN: California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell joins us by phone. Welcome to the program, sir. Governor ED RENDELL (Democrat, Pennsylvania): Hi, Liane. How are you? HANSEN: Very well, thank you. You, Mayor Bloomberg, Governor Schwarzenegger, you've teamed up to form a coalition that's called Building America's Future. What do you hope to accomplish? Governor RENDELL: Well, that's right. We're the founding fathers. But we hope to get every local county and state government enlisted in Building America's Future and to deliver a message to Washington that if America is going to have a future, an economically-viable future, a quality-of-life future, a future that involves public safety, we have to begin the business of repairing infrastructure. Governor Schwarzenegger in that tape you just played mentioned 1. 6 trillion dollars. He didn't pull that out of thin air. That was a report from the American Society of Civil Engineers. It said that for America to repair its infrastructure, just repair what we have, would cost 1. 6 trillion dollars. HANSEN: Each state has its own issues. Pennsylvania has a unique set of infrastructure issues. What do you consider to be the top priorities in your state? Governor RENDELL: The top priority, just because we have so many roads and so many rivers and streams, is bridges. We lead the nation in the most structurally-deficient bridges. We also have a huge problem in our clean water and waste water systems as well, a 15 to 20 billion dollars statewide problem. So we have a ton of problems. And we're willing to do our part, but we need federal help. The federal government's got to step up. HANSEN: Let's talk a little bit about the Pennsylvania Turnpike. Last month, a Spanish firm and Citigroup bid some 12. 8 billion dollars to lease the turnpike. And it's the state's only toll road at the moment. And you've been pushing for this deal for quite a while, but this past week the Pennsylvania Senate unanimously voted against the plan. How do you think this is going to affect foreign investment in your infrastructure in your state? Governor RENDELL: Well, I think there's still a place for it. But I have told the legislatures, if you're worried about foreign investment then don't fly into Orlando. Don't take your family to Disney World, because guess who runs the Orlando Airport? You want to take a guess, Liane? HANSEN: I don't know. Governor RENDELL: Albertis. HANSEN: One of the same companies. Governor RENDELL: The same company that is bidding to run the turnpike, runs the Orlando Airport. If we're going to meet our infrastructure goals, if we're going to repair our roads, repair our bridges, do something about our waste water and water systems, we're going to have be creative. And the federal government's also going to have step up.  HANSEN: You called yourself and Mayor Bloomberg and Governor Schwarzenegger kind of the founding fathers of this transportation coalition. Early this month - I mean, speaking of founding fathers - we spoke to historian Robert Fishman about the history of infrastructure planning in this country. We want to play a little clip from that interview because he describes how Thomas Jefferson's Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin put together a national plan for roads and canals. Professor ROBERT FISHMAN (Architecture and Urban Planning, University of Michigan): Think about the incredible task of spanning a continent, of uniting this vast area into one country, into one economy. This was inconceivable without conscious national planning at the largest scale. Gallatin was a great economist, and he understood that maintenance was at least as important as initial investment. HANSEN: Governor Ed Rendell, what do you think Gallatin and the founding fathers would have to say about the situation today? Governor RENDELL: Well, I think if they were here, they would take a look at where we are, and I think they would adhere to one of our basic suggestions. And that's for a federal capital budget. You know, the federal government builds roads the same way it buys paperclips. Paperclips have a 30-day half-life, roads have a 30-year life. It's crazy. No one else does it in the entire U. S. Every state, county and local government has a capital budget. You need a federal capital budget to get an infrastructure repair program along the level of the 1. 6 trillion that Governor Schwarzenegger talked about.  And we need to restore the public's confidence. So, major infrastructure projects. Some money will continue to go to the states, but major infrastructure projects go to this infrastructure bank that Senator Hegel, Senator Dodd have proposed, that Senator Obama is backing. And that infrastructure bank gives the yea or nay based on a good cost-benefit analysis of projects, particularly projects that take more than one state in.  HANSEN: So it's possible to build on the legacy of Gallatin? Governor RENDELL: Absolutely. It just takes the will to get this done. And the time to get it done is now. And think about one other benefit from this, Liane. We're in a stagnant economy and maybe even a full-blown recession. If we spent over the next five years, five to six years, repairing every aspect of the American infrastructure, building out a passenger rail system, what would we produce? Well, number one, we'd produce maybe millions of jobs, high-paying jobs, for Americans that can't by their very nature, can't be outsourced.  Secondly, we'd produce a whole boatload of orders for American steel and concrete and timber companies, for companies who produce all sorts of supplies. So it would be a huge shot in the arm for the economy, probably the best economic stimulus you could do. So you'd get a side benefit from the most important benefit, repairing and expanding our infrastructure, improving our economic competitiveness, or quality of life, and our public safety.  HANSEN: Governor Rendell, you sound like you might make a good secretary of transportation in the next administration. I mean, is it an offer that you would accept? Governor RENDELL: Well, I said on a TV show in Harrisburg on Thursday night that I would be very interested in serving in either energy or transportation. But that would have to be after I serve my term as governor. If that position were open in January of 2011, I'd love to take a shot at something like that. HANSEN: Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell, thanks so much. Governor RENDELL: Thanks, Liane. Have a great rest of the week. HANSEN: You too.   LIANE HANSEN, host:  From NPR News this is Weekend Edition. I'm Liane Hansen. This month on our program we've been examining the state of America's infrastructure. We've heard about the problems with the country's roads, levees, water systems and bridges. The question today is who's going to pay to make improvements? Certainly, we'll all pay in higher taxes. But what about private industry? What's in it for them to invest directly in public works? Coming up, a report from Curt Nickisch about private investment. But first we want to focus on efforts by elected officials to push for greater federal funding for infrastructure. This past January, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger spoke in front of a backdrop of snarled highway trestles. He was flanked by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell.  Governor ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER (Republican, California): The bottom line is that America right now needs 1. 6 trillion dollars to rebuild and to really invest in the future. I think it is very important that we take this seriously. This is why we formed this coalition to put the spotlight on this issue nationwide. We must get going. We must invest.  HANSEN: California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell joins us by phone. Welcome to the program, sir.  Governor ED RENDELL (Democrat, Pennsylvania): Hi, Liane. How are you?  HANSEN: Very well, thank you. You, Mayor Bloomberg, Governor Schwarzenegger, you've teamed up to form a coalition that's called Building America's Future. What do you hope to accomplish?  Governor RENDELL: Well, that's right. We're the founding fathers. But we hope to get every local county and state government enlisted in Building America's Future and to deliver a message to Washington that if America is going to have a future, an economically-viable future, a quality-of-life future, a future that involves public safety, we have to begin the business of repairing infrastructure. Governor Schwarzenegger in that tape you just played mentioned 1. 6 trillion dollars. He didn't pull that out of thin air. That was a report from the American Society of Civil Engineers. It said that for America to repair its infrastructure, just repair what we have, would cost 1. 6 trillion dollars.  HANSEN: Each state has its own issues. Pennsylvania has a unique set of infrastructure issues. What do you consider to be the top priorities in your state?  Governor RENDELL: The top priority, just because we have so many roads and so many rivers and streams, is bridges. We lead the nation in the most structurally-deficient bridges. We also have a huge problem in our clean water and waste water systems as well, a 15 to 20 billion dollars statewide problem. So we have a ton of problems. And we're willing to do our part, but we need federal help. The federal government's got to step up.  HANSEN: Let's talk a little bit about the Pennsylvania Turnpike. Last month, a Spanish firm and Citigroup bid some 12. 8 billion dollars to lease the turnpike. And it's the state's only toll road at the moment. And you've been pushing for this deal for quite a while, but this past week the Pennsylvania Senate unanimously voted against the plan. How do you think this is going to affect foreign investment in your infrastructure in your state?  Governor RENDELL: Well, I think there's still a place for it. But I have told the legislatures, if you're worried about foreign investment then don't fly into Orlando. Don't take your family to Disney World, because guess who runs the Orlando Airport? You want to take a guess, Liane?  HANSEN: I don't know.  Governor RENDELL: Albertis.  HANSEN: One of the same companies.  Governor RENDELL: The same company that is bidding to run the turnpike, runs the Orlando Airport. If we're going to meet our infrastructure goals, if we're going to repair our roads, repair our bridges, do something about our waste water and water systems, we're going to have be creative. And the federal government's also going to have step up.   HANSEN: You called yourself and Mayor Bloomberg and Governor Schwarzenegger kind of the founding fathers of this transportation coalition. Early this month - I mean, speaking of founding fathers - we spoke to historian Robert Fishman about the history of infrastructure planning in this country. We want to play a little clip from that interview because he describes how Thomas Jefferson's Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin put together a national plan for roads and canals.  Professor ROBERT FISHMAN (Architecture and Urban Planning, University of Michigan): Think about the incredible task of spanning a continent, of uniting this vast area into one country, into one economy. This was inconceivable without conscious national planning at the largest scale. Gallatin was a great economist, and he understood that maintenance was at least as important as initial investment.  HANSEN: Governor Ed Rendell, what do you think Gallatin and the founding fathers would have to say about the situation today?  Governor RENDELL: Well, I think if they were here, they would take a look at where we are, and I think they would adhere to one of our basic suggestions. And that's for a federal capital budget. You know, the federal government builds roads the same way it buys paperclips. Paperclips have a 30-day half-life, roads have a 30-year life. It's crazy. No one else does it in the entire U. S. Every state, county and local government has a capital budget. You need a federal capital budget to get an infrastructure repair program along the level of the 1. 6 trillion that Governor Schwarzenegger talked about.   And we need to restore the public's confidence. So, major infrastructure projects. Some money will continue to go to the states, but major infrastructure projects go to this infrastructure bank that Senator Hegel, Senator Dodd have proposed, that Senator Obama is backing. And that infrastructure bank gives the yea or nay based on a good cost-benefit analysis of projects, particularly projects that take more than one state in.  HANSEN: So it's possible to build on the legacy of Gallatin?  Governor RENDELL: Absolutely. It just takes the will to get this done. And the time to get it done is now. And think about one other benefit from this, Liane. We're in a stagnant economy and maybe even a full-blown recession. If we spent over the next five years, five to six years, repairing every aspect of the American infrastructure, building out a passenger rail system, what would we produce? Well, number one, we'd produce maybe millions of jobs, high-paying jobs, for Americans that can't by their very nature, can't be outsourced.   Secondly, we'd produce a whole boatload of orders for American steel and concrete and timber companies, for companies who produce all sorts of supplies. So it would be a huge shot in the arm for the economy, probably the best economic stimulus you could do. So you'd get a side benefit from the most important benefit, repairing and expanding our infrastructure, improving our economic competitiveness, or quality of life, and our public safety.   HANSEN: Governor Rendell, you sound like you might make a good secretary of transportation in the next administration. I mean, is it an offer that you would accept?  Governor RENDELL: Well, I said on a TV show in Harrisburg on Thursday night that I would be very interested in serving in either energy or transportation. But that would have to be after I serve my term as governor. If that position were open in January of 2011, I'd love to take a shot at something like that.  HANSEN: Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell, thanks so much.  Governor RENDELL: Thanks, Liane. Have a great rest of the week.  HANSEN: You too.

For more, we've got Emira Woods. She's co-director of Foreign Policy In Focus at the Institute for Policy Studies. Hey, Emira. Welcome back.  Ms. EMIRA WOODS (Co-Director, Foreign Policy in Focus, Institute for Policy Studies): Hey, Farai. Great to be with you.  CHIDEYA: So we just heard from the Zimbabwean ambassador to the U. S. And the nation's president, Robert Mugabe, is in Egypt for an African Union summit. His fellow African leaders have called on him to negotiate with the opposition, the Movement for Democratic Change. And here is how Mugabe responded.  President ROBERT MUGABE (Zimbabwe): Victory by us does not mean death, the death of the MDC. I said we will remain open to discussion if there are any proposals but not because we are being dictated to by the outside world. The moment the outside world starts dictating to us, we will not proceed.   CHIDEYA: Emira, what do you make of the tone and substance of those remarks?  Ms. WOODS: It is almost as if it's surreal, Farai, you know? When you see the level of violence, the level of intimidation, the fact that only Mugabe's name was on the ballot in the end, to say that, oh, all is well and this is a victory, you know, to say, as the ambassador said, that things are normal, is really surreal and is almost as if the Mugabe forces are living in a parallel universe, you know? It's a second life type thing, Farai, and it's astounding, when you see the condition of people's lives, when you hear the stories people are text messaging, people are sending emails, ordinary people, Zimbabweans who are extremely concerned both about the political crisis and also the economic chaos of their lives. And so to hear these statements is absolutely outrageous.  CHIDEYA: You know, one thing we found just incidentally is that it's very difficult to break through on the phone lines. And you know, that's - the information infrastructure has been in some trouble or at least overloaded there for a while. But all this communication you mentioned that's going on, there'd probably be even more if there was more capacity. But nonetheless, people continue to talk about the situation, and we want to bring up Desmond Tutu, Nobel Peace Laureate. He said the African Union and the United Nations have the right to intervene in the crisis.  Archbishop DESMOND TUTU (Nobel Peace Laureate): That crisis has to be resolved sooner rather than later, and a very good argument can be made for having an international force to restore peace.  CHIDEYA: So when you think about someone like Desmond Tutu, who holds no elected office but who is a, you know, kind of a moral leader, not just in Africa but throughout the world, do statements by people like him make any difference at all in a situation like this? Ms. WOODS: Without a doubt, because of the moral political force that he brings. But also people like Nelson Mandela, people like the UN undersecretary general who heads the Economic Commission for Africa. There have been a steady flow of statements from prominent African leaders, particularly over the last week and a half, Farai, and I think it is those calls for peace, for justice, for a sense of order to return to Zimbabwe that must be heard in the both the African and the international policy-making circles.    CHIDEYA: Now President Bush says that sanctions are a good idea. He's called for the Security Council to ban arms sales and freeze assets of some specific individuals and firms. Do you think that, first of all, the UN Security Council would make a move like that, and what do you think of sanctions in terms of their effectiveness?  Ms. WOODS: Well, Farai, I think, clearly, the UN Security Council is discussing this. I think the role of both the U. K. and the U. S. , as you've heard in the rhetoric of the ambassador, in particular, it is divisive, and so I think it is critical that African voices, African nations continue to lead the push to a better day in Zimbabwe.  And I think it is those leaders coming out of Kenya, coming out of Sierra Leone, coming out of Botswana, Tanzania - the list is growing now of African leaders that are trying to put forward proposals for both a political resolution, as well as for a peacekeeping mechanism that would bring stability once again to Zimbabwe.   CHIDEYA: You mentioned Kenya, and we saw that country just completely shaken by political violence, election-related political violence, and then a move to a coalition government. Well, Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga urged the African Union to suspend Robert Mugabe.  Prime Minister RAILA ODINGA (Kenya): The situation in Zimbabwe calls for nothing less than an intervention by the African Union and the UN also to send a peacekeeping force to Zimbabwe to preside on them to bring normalcy so that free and fair elections can take place in Zimbabwe.  CHIDEYA: That was yet one more Zimbabwe-related statement. But when you think about issues like Darfur, Somalia, AFRICOM, is all the other business of the day being kind of pushed aside because of what's gone on so recently in Zimbabwe?      Ms. WOODS: Well, clearly, one of the key agenda items for the African Union has been meeting the challenge of conflict on the continent. And so Zimbabwe and those countries that you mentioned are squarely on the table, on the agenda. There are other things on the agenda, as well, and it's true that the more economic focus agenda items have been sort of sidelined, as the focus has been so squarely on Zimbabwe. But I think it is critical to, you know, to keep in mind that the African Union is relatively young.  This is the 11th meeting of the African Union. And I think Zimbabwe is a critical test of some of the policies that are in place, like a peer review mechanism that really, you know, need to be tested. Are they just words or is it possible to hold peers accountable within the African Union? I think there have been some tests already in Darfur, in Mauritania, in a number of countries where the African Union has sided with those calling for justice. And I think they have, really, a responsibility to do the same when it comes to Zimbabwe.   CHIDEYA: All right. We have time for one last quick issue, and that is in London, over the weekend, celebrities and political figures gathered to celebrate former South African President Nelson Mandela's 90th birthday. His actual birthday is July 18th, and sometime between now and then, people here in the U. S. are hoping that they can get Mandela and the ANC off of the U. S. terror watch list.  The African National Congress was at one time and technically still considered a terrorist organization. So the Senate approved a bill to remove Mandela and the ANC from this watch list. It's going ahead to the White House and the president's expected to sign it. Is the symbolism important, even though it comes quite a time after his name has been in a totally different context? Ms. WOODS: Well, Farai, it is absolutely a travesty that Mandela, that really all of the leaders of South Africa have to get a special pass to be able to travel to the U. S. because of these travel restrictions. So the Bush administration has quite rightly moved on North Korea to remove North Korea from that list of terrorists. But all these decades, you know, since the end of the apartheid era, we still have South Africa on - especially the African National Congress, including Nelson Mandela, on that list of terrorists.  So I think we need to really applaud the Black Congressional Caucus who, you know, they took up this mantle and they have pushed, just as they did in the anti-apartheid struggle. They have pushed to say, look, we need to really recognize an era here in U. S. policy and move swiftly to change it. So it is their leadership that has brought congressional action. It is also the leadership of the South Africans who have said, enough is enough.  CHIDEYA: Emira, thanks so much. Take care.  Ms. WOODS: It's a pleasure. Thank you, Farai.

I'm Melissa Block. MICHELE NORRIS, Host: This afternoon, she spoke with reporters in a Paris hotel as Eleanor Beardsley now reports. ELEANOR BEARDSLEY: Betancourt has been given a hero's welcome in France and has been talking mostly to the French press, but today, she spoke in English. After her initial elation, Betancourt says that now she is utterly exhausted and fears she may slip into a depression. She spoke quietly and slowly about her ordeal. She says her Catholic faith helped pull her through, but she also found other ways to cope. INGRID BETANCOURT: The important thing was to fill the day with activities that could be repeated like in a schedule, so to give you stability in a world of no stability. That was the key. BEARDSLEY: Betancourt was campaigning for the Colombian presidency in February 2002 when she was taken hostage by FARC guerillas. The Marxist group has been fighting the Colombian government for 40 years and holds more than 700 hostages. Betancourt was one of 44 high-profile political captives, so were three American contractors who Betancourt met during their five years in the jungle. BETANCOURT: It was very difficult for them. It was difficult for them because they arrived and only one of them could speak the language. They had gone through very hard conditions. When they were put in the same group as us, in the same camp, I think that they found a way of sharing with others what they thought was only what was happening only to them. So the sharing is important, the sharing of the despair. BEARDSLEY: The hostages were chained to a tree every day. Betancourt says they were tormented and tortured. She was one of the few women being held by the FARC. Betancourt has so far refused to speak of the grimmer details of her captivity. BETANCOURT: It's not easy to talk about things that are still hurting. And probably, it will hurt all my life, I don't know. The only thing that I've settled in my mind is that I want to forgive. I have to forget in order to find peace in my soul and be able to forgive. BEARDSLEY: Betancourt says she will eventually testify about what happened in the jungle. She and the American captors were rescued in a spectacular military operation by the Colombian army. Pretending to be FARC guerillas, Colombian soldiers spirited Betancourt, the Americans, and 11 other hostages away on the helicopter. Betancourt calls her rescue a miracle and says she's still trying to adjust to her new freedom. BETANCOURT: I know that now, this is the time to retreat, to be with my family. You know, I'm like landing like a parachute in the life of others. They have their own lives, their daily activities, and I don't have anything.

Welcome, ambassador. Ambassador WINSTON LORD (Diplomat): Nice to be with you. SEABROOK: How does an American diplomat even begin to negotiate with an enemy country? Amb. LORD: Well, you get in touch through secret channels. You may have an envoy go over there, not for announced reasons but for some other reasons and talk to the local people, or you may send back-channel messages through the intelligence services. There are ways that you can handle it so only a few people at each end know that you're trying to get going. In the case of China, which you mentioned, it was even more difficult because we had no communications with China at that point, in 1969 and the early '70s, so we had to go through a third country, notably Pakistan. SEABROOK: So you send a note through the diplomatic channels there, and then they send it along? Amb. LORD: Yes, well what happened was we went through several governments, Nixon and/or Kissinger, asking the heads of state whether they would be a channel between us because we didn't know how to get in touch with the Chinese. We had no contact for 22 years. And finally trying various channels, we settled on the Pakistani one as the most reliable for both sides, and we proceeded sending messages through the Pakistani ambassador in Washington. Kissinger and I would meet with him in Kissinger's office. We'd give him a message for the Chinese. He would send it to his president in Pakistan, who would then send it on to Chou En-Lai and Mao Tse-Tung in China. SEABROOK: Then when a meeting is finally arranged, a secret meeting, what is that room like? It must be full of pressure and things unsaid. Amb. LORD: Well, they are, because by definition, the reason you have these secret meetings are with enemies usually - you don't need them with friends - they usually take place because you have profound differences with the other country, and it's very hard, given the sensitivity of the relationship and each other's domestic public opinion to negotiate publicly. So in the case of Vietnam, we were trying to negotiate an end to the very controversial and bloody war that was going on, and we had to have a lot of patience, because this went on for a couple years, and part of the problem was that we were making somewhat generous offers for peace to the Vietnamese at the time. Because it was secret, we could be more flexible rather than public posturing and propaganda by both sides, but the Vietnamese were stubborn, we didn't make much progress for a while, and meanwhile, Nixon and Kissinger were being lambasted by the press and by the Congress for not trying to negotiate an early end to the war. SEABROOK: Ambassador Lord, in the current presidential campaign, there's been a pretty stark difference between the candidates on this issue. Senator Barack Obama says he would talk directly with America's enemies, specifically Iran. Hillary Clinton called that naive. Later, John McCain and President Bush also criticized the stance. When do you think it's appropriate to talk with an enemy? Amb. LORD: Well, I think you have to be precise here. On the one hand, you should be willing to talk to your enemies. It's not a concession just to talk to them, and you shouldn't place tremendous conditions on doing that before you even sit down because that doesn't make any sense. I mean, for example, to tell Iran they've got to give up all their nuclear weapons, and then we'll sit down with them, that's what you've got to negotiate. So that doesn't make any sense. Now on the other hand, you can't start with a summit meeting with a declared enemy. What you've got to do is meet at lower levels, let's say assistant secretary or undersecretary of state, before the presidents meet to make sure that there's going to make some sense in a summit, but it's hard to think of any example where you don't at least explore at the working level whether such talks would make some sense. SEABROOK: Ambassador Winston Lord. Thanks very much, sir. Amb. LORD: You're welcome, thank you.  ANDREA SEABROOK, host:  Opening a dialogue with an enemy is complex and requires a delicate touch.

A cyclone killed about 85,000 people in Myanmar earlier this year. Three months later, the survivors are still recovering, and some got a visit from John Holmes. He's the United Nations humanitarian chief. Mr. JOHN HOLMES (Humanitarian Chief, United Nations): I went to a place called Set Ham(ph), which is a village I'd been to two months ago. That was a month after the cyclone. It was still pretty much wrecked. People were living in some tented encampments, and the school had been destroyed, and people were just standing around in a rather hopeless way. And when I went back this time, virtual houses had been repaired in some way, either with a new roof or at least a tarpaulin over the roof. Some new houses have been built. The temporary school has been built, and it was working while I was there. People are beginning to start working in the fields again, planting the rice. Fishermen had some new boats they were starting to use. So there were some good signs, although we need to reach people right down in the south of the delta with more aid because that's where it's so difficult to get at because you can only get there with small boats. There are no roads whatsoever down there. I think we have made some progress, but we've got a huge amount still to do. INSKEEP: When you say people were starting to plant rice in this huge rice-growing region, is this the normal planting season? Mr. HOLMES: It is the normal planting season. There's a couple more weeks still available to plant rice. Now, not everybody is going to be able to do that because a lot of fields were flooded and were flooded with saltwater, which is a problem. But the monsoon rains have washed a lot of the salt out, so the situation there is not quite as bad as we feared, although of course the rice harvest will be significantly down. And that's why people will need food assistance, food aid from the World Food Program and others for several months to come before they can start harvesting and make sure they've got enough food to live on in a sustainable way. INSKEEP: Can people afford food, besides whatever they get from the World Food Program? Mr. HOLMES: Some people have money, many people don't. That's why they need this kind of assistance. They need more help with shelter, and they need more help with food. We need to get more clean water to them. We need to make sure they've got all the medical aid they can deal with, because a lot of them don't have money because their livelihoods are gone. Most of them are farmers and fishermen, and they need to restart that. We're trying to make sure, with all the departments we're working with, that they have seed, they have fertilizers and they have some kind of plows they can use because most of the water buffalo were killed in the cyclone as well and so they can restart that. The fishermen need boats and nets to restart their lives. INSKEEP: Striking little detail there. It sounds like whether your water buffalo survived and you can plow might make the difference between success and failure or even life and death for a family. Mr. HOLMES: Well, that's absolutely right, and that's why we need to make sure they do have the basic necessities of life, you know, for a six-month or a nine-month period for those who have not been able to plant this year - because these are people who are living on the edge of the poverty line or below the poverty line in the best of times. When you've had a major disaster like that, then whether they can plant their rice for next year is exactly the difference between life and death, and that's where we can make a difference. INSKEEP: Even though it sounds like you're hopeful that a lot of people are receiving assistance and will, did you look around that village you were in and think to yourself that in six months or nine months of very difficult living, a lot of these people will not be there if you return to that village again? Mr. HOLMES: I don't think people are dying. I don't think we've seen people dying from starvation, although a lot of people are hungry. They've not got as much food as they'd like - this is a very difficult thing to live with, but they're a very resilient group of people. They are very good at helping each other. I've no doubt they'll pull through it, although it will take two or three years, at the best, before lives are fully back to normal. INSKEEP: John Holmes is humanitarian chief for the United Nations and has just finished a three-day mission to Myanmar. Thank you very much. Mr. HOLMES: Okay, thank you.

Just ahead, she found out that her ancestors brought thousands of men and women and children into this country in chains. We find out what she decided to do about it.   But first, we focus on Zimbabwe, and for just four days, power-sharing negotiations are off. The talks were arranged to find a solution to the bloody conflict between supporters of Zimbabwe's long time president, Robert Mugabe, and members of the opposition, the Movement for Democratic Change.  Mugabe was declared the winner of a sixth term earlier this month after standing unopposed in a run-off election marked by what most observers considered an open campaign of state-sponsored violence of supporters of opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, who had beaten Mugabe in the original election. Mr. Tsvangirai pulled out of the run-off after dozens of supporters and family members were harassed, beaten, and driven out of their homes. To find our more, we turn to Peta Thornycroft. She's Zimbabwe's correspondent for the Daily Telegraph. Hello, thanks for speaking with us. Ms. PETA THORNYCROFT (Correspondent, Daily Telegraph): Hello there. MARTIN: Peta, not much is known about what's been going on inside the negotiations since both parties agreed to a media blackout. So the first thing I want to know is, how did both parties come to the table to begin with after so much animosity between the two? Ms. THORNYCROFT: For Morgan Tsvangirai, who had a significant victory over Robert Mugabe in the presidential poll on March 29, and for the NDC, which saw Zanu-PF lose its parliamentary majority, there was really no other way out. Mr. Mugabe would not allow the run-off election to take place except accompanied by such enormous violence. When I say enormous violence, it was really in parts of the country, no go areas, curfews, people were not only being killed, but in fact, many more people were injured than were killed, villages burned at a time of no food.  Morgan Tsvangirai really had no alternative but to withdraw from that election, and so Mugabe proceeded to hold the election. People then went to vote. Some people went to vote just to get the red ink on their finger so that they would be able to prove that they had voted. Despite all of that, of course, there was a substantial boycott of the poll, but obviously, Mugabe was the only candidate. And he won, and he was sworn into six years in power. There was really nothing else for the NDC but to go into the negotiations. MARTIN: But what about the - what about Mugabe's party? He's demonstrated his imperviousness to outside pressure and, apparently, to the suffering of his own people. Why did he agree? And what do you think has happened since? Ms. THORNYCROFT: I think he's run out of cash. I think the Southern African Development Community has divided significantly over the case of Zimbabwe, and they put pressure on him. And the African Union had significant numbers to also say to Mr. Mugabe that at the end, you know, something had to be done about this.  And the observers, who were all African observers, all three groups issued statements ahead of the one candidate poll saying that the situation for an election was neither free nor fair. In other words, they backed Morgan Tsvangirai's interpretation of the political climate in Zimbabwe at the time. And perhaps Mugabe, the pressure on him was intense from Thabo Mbeki, the South African President. Thabo Mbeki, who was appointed as the facilitator for the Southern African Development Community to try and find a solution.  Last year there had been negotiations. There were some few alterations to repressive laws and better electoral laws which came out of those negotiations, but the big picture, a new constitution, a time frame for a transition failed. Both negotiations were never completed, so, for Thabo Mbeki, it was unfinished business, and he put on significant pressure onto Mr. Mugabe.  And Morgan Tsvangirai did a lot of diplomacy around Africa, and you suddenly, for the very first time, and had presidents, like, of Zambia, of Botswana, even of Tanzania. MARTIN: Peta, we only have about a minute left. So I wanted to ask that South Africa's President, Thabo Mbeki, as you mentioned, the lead mediator in the talks, is presenting this breakdown after four days as a temporary pause. Do you think that that's accurate, as best as you can determine? Ms. THORNYCROFT: Well, they seem to have only got down to serious negotiations on Saturday, and they then got into the bit of the key position of executive power. And it seemed to have fallen down on the very first attempt at executive power. From what we understand, the Zanu guest negotiator offered Morgan Tsvangirai a third vice presidency, which has no executive powers attached to it at all. And he did win the elections, and so his negotiators turned around and said, no, that's simply not good enough. And (unintelligible) have to go back to Harare to consult Mugabe, and that seems to be the position that the talks have reached at this moment. Mbeki saying, however, they'll be finished within two weeks.  MARTIN: And finally Peta, what are conditions, as best you can determine, in Zimbabwe at the moment? You mentioned a horrific campaign of violence. It seems to have calmed down in the wake of discussions. What are you hearing now about circumstances there?               Ms. THORNYCROFT: Yes, the violence has calmed down, although there are bases, Zanu-PF bases in many parts of the country, which we have seen with, you know, first hand. And the worst situation is the food situation, especially in southern and eastern Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe and Mr. Mugabe banned all food aid ahead of the elections, and he has not yet lifted that ban. It was one of the questions meant to be discussed at the negotiations.  So humanitarian agencies are not allowed to do emergency feeding programs, and there are many people literally on the point of starvation. It was the worst crops ever last summer season. There's no food security. You have got millions percent of inflation. The numbers mean nothing, and there's a shortage of cash. MARTIN: Peta, forgive me, Peta, thank you. We're going to have to leave it there for now, but we appreciate you keeping us informed. Peta Thornycroft is a Zimbabwe correspondent for the Daily Telegraph. She prefers that we not disclose her location at the moment. Thank you so much for speaking with us.  MICHEL MARTIN, host:   I'm Michel Martin, and this is Tell Me More from NPR News.

HATFILL (Former U. S. Army Virologist): I have had nothing to do, in any way, shape, or form, with the mailing of these anthrax letters. ALEX CHADWICK, host: That's another government scientist, or former government scientist, Steven Hatfill, recorded six years ago. You may recall that he was under a lot of suspicion, and there were a lot of stories in the media pointing the finger at him for these anthrax letters. Recall, five people died in the mailings of these things. David Folkenflik covers the media for NPR. David, look back on these stories of Mr. Hatfill, and what does this news of Bruce Ivins do for all that? DAVID FOLKENFLIK: Well, it's absolutely haunting to hear Steven Hatfill's voice these many years later, you know, having proclaimed his innocence all along, the tension clearly having swung to Bruce Ivins. Let's add the caveats that weren't added those years ago about Steven Hatfill. We don't know that Ivins was guilty. It hasn't been proven in court, and he won't go to court as he's now no longer alive. But Steven Hatfill came under the white hot attention of both the FBI and the news media, working, in a sense, in concert. Years later, it doesn't look very good, his life ruined by the notion that he was responsible for this domestic terrorist attack. He went around proclaiming at every opportunity that he had nothing to do with this. CHADWICK: There were stories originally that came out that, oh, they've got the guy, or they think they've got the guy, and it's a government scientist, and he wasn't named. And then this guy comes out and gives a press conference and says, hey, I'm the one they're after, and I didn't do it. It was an extraordinary moment. FOLKENFLIK: That's right. And don't forget then Attorney General John Ashcroft, the chief law-enforcement official of the nation, declared him a person of interest, a term that has absolutely no meaning in law, but nonetheless, directing the entire nation's attention on this one man. You know, it's a little bit like a terrible Hitchcock plot, you know, the scenario of the wrong man. Meanwhile, it appears that one of the experts in bioterrorism at Fort Dietrich, where Mr. Hatfill had been working, you know, who had helped the government to investigate Mr. Hatfill, it turns out that the FBI ,years and years, later look at him as the primary suspect, look at him as the one being responsible. It's the guy down the hall. CHADWICK: I have to say, we saw those stories, we reported those stories, intense media interest and kind of one scoop after another, to name this guy, to find him, to learn all about him, the details. The media doesn't look so good on this one. FOLKENFLIK: Media looks very bad on this. It looks credulous for Justice Department sources. Hatfill had filed suit against the government and, you know, sought to get the names of sources from journalists, taking them to court to do so, and to try to prove that the Justice Department had intentionally leaked this, as they sought to, you know, circle in on him and to capture him for these attacks. CHADWICK: Now, this year, there was a settlement, a legal settlement, for Steven Hatfill from the government. FOLKENFLIK: That's right. Just a few months ago, the government essentially paid out a package - depending on how you value it - but about 5. 85 million dollars to compensate him for lost revenue over the course of his career. He lost a job at Louisiana State University, as a result of this, that he had been offered. Interestingly, the government did not exonerate him directly. Although the entire settlement tended to do that, but it not explicitly exonerate him, and nor did it apologize to him for this.  CHADWICK: I don't imagine that we in the media are going to be apologizing to him either. NPR's David Folkenflik, thank you. FOLKENFLIK: You bet.

Mr. RAYMOND SIMONSE (Field Director, Detentions and Removal, ICE, Charlotte, North Carolina): You know, I'd say that, when we've made apprehensions in the past, as part of the fugitive program, and some individuals we encounter advise us that, you know, had they known that we were looking for them, they would have turned themselves in. We have attorneys that will tell us the same things.  You know, this offers individuals who've been ordered from the United States - removed from the United States, who have failed to actually leave after receiving an order of removal or deportation, to go ahead and turn themselves in so that our fugitive teams don't have to go to their homes.

Mr. SIMONSE: We'd like to avoid having to arrest a parent in front of their children, if at all possible. If someone's been ordered removed from the United States, and they've failed to leave the country in violation of the law, then there certainly should be an expectation that law enforcement may enforce that order at some point in time.  This provides them an opportunity to surrender themselves, to cooperate with immigration in the process of scheduling their removal, so that they don't have to spend time in a detention facility for a month or two, depending on the individual case and the nationality of the individual involved, while we obtain a travel document.  They can work with us from their homes to obtain the travel documents, to work on the flight reservations, so they can leave at a time of their convenience. So they can close out their bank accounts and do other things that they may not necessarily have an opportunity to do if we arrest them in their residence and then have to detain them because they've proven themselves to be a flight risk.

I'm Alex Chadwick. MADELEINE BRAND, host: I'm Madeleine Brand. Coming up, Beijing's army of Olympics volunteers, a force to be reckoned with. But first. . . CHADWICK: If you remain anxious about the state of our national security, this next story is not going to help. A kid in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, D. C. - he just graduated from high school - is under arrest for attempted carjacking. At his home, police found bomb-making equipment, 50 pounds of explosives, high-powered guns, armor-piercing ammo, and a map with the motorcade route the Secret Service uses to drive President Bush to the Camp David retreat in the nearby mountains.  The suspect is named Collin McKenzie-Gude. He's 18 years old. Dan Morse has been covering the story for the Washington Post. Dan, I just called this young man a suspect. What exactly do authorities suspect him of? Mr. DAN MORSE (Reporter, Washington Post): Well, the big question is why. They found all these things inside his house. A lot of it was actually found in his bedroom. And then, you know, it's also revealed that they found this map, they found some other things, some instructions that purport to show how to kill someone from 200 meters.  So they've found all this stuff. You know, the question is why and what his intentions were. One detective told me yesterday that what's gotten his attention and everyone's attention is, he said this kid knew stuff he shouldn't have known. CHADWICK: He graduated from high school, a private high school with kind of a military element to it. His dad is an Air Force veteran and, I guess, accused also by police authorities of buying guns for his son? Mr. MORSE: Right, right. They've accused him of that, and they've technically charged him with making a straw purchase of weapons, where you buy the weapons, but you're essentially buying the weapons for someone else. Investigators have told me that the dad, you know, one of them described him as a fairly straight shooter, but also someone who would buy things for his son. So they now have charges against three people, the dad, his son, Collin, who you mentioned, and also a juvenile, a 17-year-old friend of Collin's. CHADWICK: A friend of Collin's, who he apparently had, well, they were working on something together. Mr. MORSE: Yes, they were. They were doing something and the big mystery here, you know, on one extreme, these are kids doing, well, you know, certainly not ordinary to be setting off pipe bombs in a field. But, you know, are they doing that, or do they have something much more sinister in mind? And right now, I don't know, and I think a lot of the investigators don't know at this point. They're still trying to get to that. CHADWICK: He had a fake CIA identity card. He had another kind of odd identity card. He was arrested last week in a carjacking attempt of some kind. Something set him off, drove him to a local mall, where he tried to steal a car from someone. Mr. MORSE: Right, and that certainly caught the attention of a judge here. On Tuesday, there was a bond hearing, and in that bond hearing, the prosecutors had to argue to the judge why he should remain in jail and at a very high bond. And the two things they argued were that he was a danger to the community and also a flight risk. So that's where a lot of these things came out. During that hearing, this carjacking came up, and the victim in that case was a 78-year-old man who was trying to lock this little Geo Prism, and Collin is accused of coming up and elbowing him and knocking him to the ground. They've also got a witness who heard, you know, screams of help. So this is a 78-year-old man in a parking lot outside a shopping mall, and that certainly caught the attention of the judge, who, you know, from the bench sort of cut through all the stuff about Camp David and the map and everything and just, you know, keyed on that. CHADWICK: What is it that set off the police last week? How was it that they were going to his house to search his house? MORSE: They got a tip from a citizen in the community of Gaithersburg, which is just outside of Rockville. I've talked to a woman who is a relative of the 17-year-old, who said it was her that brought this to the police's attention at one point in the form of a long letter to the police chief here.  She noticed through her relative, you know, some things about Collin McKenzie-Gude. She brought it to the police's attention, according to her, and her story does track because a few days after her letter, you know, they're getting a search warrant and coming to Collin's home, where he lives with his two parents in this very nice street in a nice neighborhood.  You know, I talked to one of their neighbors; they don't even remember ever a mugging on this street. So the idea that the police go and search this house and start bringing out all these assault rifles and bomb-making stuff has certainly got people's attention on that block.

The display includes the Unabomber's cabin. That day we also spoke with his brother, David Kaczynski, who said he probably would not come to see it. (Soundbite of NPR's Talk of the Nation, June 25, 2008) Mr. DAVID KACZYNSKI: I think all the focus, unfortunately, is on the person who committed the violence and not so much on lessons that could be learned from it. In my brother's case, there was a serious mental illness, and I think we need to deal proactively. Hopefully, you know, crimes, though, like my brother's, lives could have been saved if there had been an intervention and treatment early on. CONAN: Today, word got out that the Unabomber himself, Ted Kaczynski, protests the display of his cabin in a three-page, handwritten letter from prison to the U. S. Court of Appeals. He wrote that the exhibit violates the victims' wish to limit further publicity about this case. Gary Wright, one of the Unabomber victims, joins us in a moment. But first, let me introduce Susan Bennett, vice president and deputy director of the Newseum, who's among our hosts here at the Newseum, and Susan Bennett, nice to have you on the program today. Ms. SUSAN BENNETT (Deputy Director, Vice President, Marketing, Newseum): Well, glad to have you at the Newseum, Neal. CONAN: And what do you think of Kaczynski's protest? Ms. BENNETT: Well, it's interesting that he is talking about concern for the victims at this point in time, because for 17 years, the FBI tried to track him down as he was mailing pipe bombs and other explosive devices to a number of people, innocent people around the country. There were three people killed, 23 injured, during his crime spree. CONAN: And remind us. Why is this - why is his cabin here at the Newseum? Ms. BENNETT: His cabin is one of 200 artifacts given to us, loaned to us, by the FBI. 2008 is - marks the 100th anniversary at the FBI's law enforcement, and they came to us, because no longer is the FBI tour available to the public in Washington, D. C. , unfortunately, because of security concerns. And so, we said we would be interested in doing an exhibit on the FBI, but only in terms of how there's been a sometimes cooperative, sometimes combative, relationship between the FBI and the news media. CONAN: In the letter, Ted Kaczynski said he wanted to talk to you about this. Are you going to call him? Ms. BENNETT: Well, it's up to him to call us, I think, at this point. I didn't know that he wanted to talk to us. We, being a news museum, are willing to talk to anybody and give anyone their say. I mean, obviously, this was one of many crime stories that we tell in this exhibit. We thought it was a particularly interesting case because it was an instance of where there was incredible cooperation between the news media and the FBI. The FBI, for 17 years, had not been able to track down the killer. And the - Ted Kaczynski had mailed what he called a manifesto to various news publications, wanting it published, and the FBI came to the New York Times and the Washington Post and asked that that be done. CONAN: After much agonizing, they decided to go ahead. Ms. BENNETT: They did. I mean, it's not often that two competitors such as the New York Times and Washington Post agree to do something cooperatively. But they agreed they would both pay for it and that it would be published in the Washington Post. And it was a direct result of that publication that Ted Kaczynski was caught. His brother recognized some of the writings in the manifesto as similar to things that his brother had written, and he, in effect, turned him over to the FBI. CONAN: And again, after much agonizing, anyway. Ms. BENNETT: Yes. CONAN: We're talking about the display of the Unabomber's cabin here at the Newseum, and you're listening to Talk of the Nation from NPR News. Also with us is Gary Wright, one of the Unabomber's victims. He joins us from member station KXJZ in Sacramento, and Gary, nice to have you back on the program today. Mr. GARY WRIGHT (Victim of the Unabomber): Thanks, Neal. Glad to be here. CONAN: And what do you think of the Unabomber's protest? Mr. WRIGHT: Well, it's interesting. We've been involved in a court case for some time now, the victims and survivors, and I think that it's, as was mentioned, the timing's interesting, in that for the longest time I don't think that Mr. Kaczynski really cared one iota what had happened to his victims, when you look through some of the writings and some of the things that were presented in court. And now, I think the only reason that he is positioning himself this way is to protect his writings, that he would maintain control of them. Whereas right now, there is an effort to sell those writing and pay restitution to the victims. CONAN: Now, this would be the contents of his cabin, not just his writing, but all the other objects, which would be auctioned off, I guess, and the proceeds would then go to his victims. Mr. WRIGHT: Yes, correct. And when you look at it, I mean, there are some things in that that maybe have some intrinsic value to folks, but I think that the writings are probably the most interesting, in that it gives a firsthand view of his thought process and what he went through as he made his decisions in going forward and victimizing folks. CONAN: And after all this time, would you be interested in seeing those writings and seeing those objects, and maybe coming here to the Newseum and seeing the cabin? Mr. WRIGHT: I mean, for me to see the cabin, honestly, it would be not a tough call for me. I would do it, simply because it was such a long time where I didn't know who it was that had attacked me, and it gives me a little more semblance to how this man lived and things like that. So, for me, it has nothing to do with being a victim or any sort of morbid fascination with it. It's more that I've come to closure with who he was as a man and that sort of thing. But I guess it's just one small piece that I haven't seen. I think the bigger piece, as I've seen in full effect, you know, given his mental capacity and the way that he chose to go about expressing himself, so for me, it's not a big thing for me to see the cabin. CONAN: And it's not, as you mentioned earlier, anything - at least, speaking just for yourself, some might say there's a certain ghoulish quality to auctioning of his possession and using the money to pay his victims. Mr. WRIGHT: Yeah, and I understand that. Being on the other side of it, where insurance didn't pay for any of my medical expenses and things like that, I guess - and coming from a law-enforcement family, I truly believe in restitution for criminals. And in that regard, I guess it doesn't bother me to have those things sold in order to make people whole again, not just myself, but other people. I mean, if there's kids who want to go onto college or grandchildren, if a victim or survivor's family wanted to put that money to some good use, I think it's, you know, really well-served to do that. CONAN: And Susan Bennett, quickly, just how long is that exhibit going to be available - open to the public? Ms. BENNETT: It's going to be available 'til at least June of 2009. We have a commitment from the FBI that long, and we may extend the show. CONAN: Susan Bennett, thanks very much for your time. Ms. BENNETT: Thank you, Neal. CONAN: Susan Bennett, vice president and deputy director of the Newseum with us here at the Newseum in Washington, D. C. Gary Wright, thank you for speaking with us again.

Just ahead, millions of Iraqis have been displaced by the fighting in their country.  A few thousand have made it to the U. S.  We speak to one man who came here after working for the U. S. military, about the hard decision to leave and what his life is like now.  And a little later, another installment in our Summer Sipping series.  We'll have some tea.  But first, we're going to continue our international briefing with developments in Georgia.   Heavy fighting erupted over the weekend, when Georgian and Russian soldiers clashed over the breakaway region of South Ossetia.  A ceasefire was signed on Tuesday, but Georgian officials accused Russia of violating the agreement just a day later by bombing the central city of Gori just outside South Ossetia.  An unofficial estimate puts the number killed in the conflict so far at about 2,000 people, with another 100,000 displaced.  The conflict has raised tensions between the U. S. , Russia, and western Europe, with the U. S. strongly urging the Russians to pull back and the Russians insisting on the right to defend nationals living in the disputed area.   We wanted to know how this situation was affecting people, so we called on Davit Mamulaishvili.  He's a graduate student in political economy at Central European University in Hungary.  He joins us on the phone from his hometown of Batumi in Georgia.  Welcome.  Thank you for speaking with us. Mr. DAVIT MAMULAISHVILI (Political Economy Graduate Student, Central European University, Hungary):  Thank you, Michel.  Thank you for inviting me. MARTIN:  How are you doing? Mr. MAMULAISHVILI:  We're doing good, all right so far.  Everything is peaceful, for now. MARTIN:  Can you talk to me about South Ossetia and how is it viewed by the people in your country? Mr. MAMULAISHVILI:  South Ossetia has always been believed to be an integral part of the country.  Prior to the Soviet occupation, it was a Georgian territory with lot of Georgian citizens living in the territory and lot of Ossetian citizens also in.  And, as you probably know, in the beginning of the 90s, a couple of military conflicts erupted and a lot of refugees, Georgian refugees primarily, had to flee the region, and therefore, now, it's a problematic area because it's been impossible - quite difficult, not to say impossible, to return these refugees.  And the belief in the heart and soul of every single Georgian person is that it's an integral part of Georgia, as integral as Tbilisi or any other part of the country. MARTIN:  And you know, of course, that the Russians see it the opposite way?  Is that accurate? Mr. MAMULAISHVILI:  Actually, I think that the Russian diplomatic position on the issue right now is that the status of South Ossetia is still undetermined.  They do not yet claim it as part of their own country, even though they provided a massive passportization of the citizens there.  And because of the conflict now, as it stands today, the Russians claim that all their military actions on the territory of Georgia, including this area of South Ossetia, is soley for the purpose of defending the Russian citizens, meaning those Oseetians that they provided the passports for. MARTIN:  And how is that being reported in the media there, in the Georgian media?  And I'm particularly interested in how it's being reported, who was the provocateur in this, because, obviously, there are two points of view about that, also.  What are you being told about this? Mr. MAMULAISHVILI:  Well, about two to three weeks prior to the fightings, there was media reports of some military attacks, even bombing, some civilian kidnappings from the side of Ossetian-controlled villages over to the side of Georgian-controlled villages and Georgian inhabited villages.  And our side of the story is that we got the information of heavy military buildup from the Russian side, on the Russian-Georgian border, and we got the information that we were attacked from the Ossetian's side.  So our entrance into the South Ossetian region, which was not controlled by the government but within the territorial integrity of the country, was for self-defense purposes and to eliminate the aggressors, primarily South Ossetian criminals who were trying to provoke Georgia into making a mistake and entering into an open conflict.  And our president has exclusively been very open, and in his very first statement, he said that he regretted the decision to commit the country to a war. But he said that there was no other choice, and we had to do so in order to defend ourselves. MARTIN:  Now, I know that this is hard to estimate because you're just one person, but do you have a sense of whether most people in Georgia support President Saakashvili right now?  Do they agree with the way he's handled the situation? Mr. MAMULAISHVILI:  I can assure you that coming, especially from the issue of territorial integrity of the country, and the popular absolute belief that we have that South Ossetia and the other breakaway region of Abkhazia are integral parts of the country.  I'm sure that, if not the entire, at least 95 percent of the population is behind the president and the Georgian government on this issue.  And there was public uprising in Tbilisi on August 12th.  It was just another proof of how committed and united the Georgian people are, and how we will not give up on our causes, maintaining our freedom, and maintaining our country. MARTIN:  And I know that you're about 200 miles away from the, sort of, the active conflict or the scene of the bombing, but are people scared?  Are they worried that the conflict is going to widen?  Are they concerned? Mr. MAMULAISHVILI:  Yes, people are very concerned.  I would even say scared, probably, because we have lived through the military might of the Soviet Union for 70 years.  So we have no doubts about the military capacity, and we have witnessed how far they're willing to go.  So I would say people are scared. MARTIN:  And is day to day life being affected? Like, are people stockpiling food and supplies and things like that?  Or how are you - how are people responding to this crisis? Mr. MAMULAISHVILI:  Actually, as far as I know, and the thing is that I was in Tbilisi exactly when the war erupted, and I had to travel to Batumi two days after that. I had to go through the town of Gori right before it got bombed.  I can assure you that in the two cities that I lived in, in Tbilisi and in Batumi, the situation is very calm.   People are living there as if there is no serious threat.  I mean, you can see people in the streets.  There is no chaos.  There is no robberies, no crimes, no nothing like that.  I think that people understood the importance of the situation, and they have concentrated and mobilized themselves even more so to make sure that whatever problems we're facing externally, we don't add any internal problems to it. MARTIN:  And finally, you are a student of political economy, as I said, and I just wondered if you would put your future diplomat hat on and tell me, what do you anticipate next?  Do you think there will be a diplomatic resolution here? Mr. MAMULAISHVILI:  I think, right now, everything depends on what the plans are of the international community with regards to Georgia.  I think the situation can be handled diplomatically, and I think that very soon, hopefully, with God's help, everything will go back to its normal life. MARTIN:  Davit Mamulaishvili is a graduate student in political economy at Central European University in Hungary.  He joined us on the phone from his hometown of Batumi in Georgia.  Davit, thank you so much for speaking with us, and good luck to you. Mr. MAMULAISHVILI:  Thank you for having me. MARTIN:  For more information about the conflict and the region, we suggest you go to npr. org.  There are a number of stories explaining the history of the conflict, the key players, and an interactive map.  MICHEL MARTIN, host:  I'm Michel Martin, and this is Tell Me More from NPR News.

Throughout the summer, we've been bringing you our Summer Sipping series, where we sample beverages to cool us off in the heat.  Previously, we tried some microbrews, that's specialty beers, and some fancy rums.  Today, though, we're doing tea.  For this tasting, we ventured into Teaism, it's a teahouse in Washington, D. C. , where we met with co-owner Michelle Brown. Ms. MICHELLE BROWN (Owner, Teaism):  Our teahouse was designed, you know, to bring tea to America, really.  And we felt that Americans sort of needed to be hit over the head with a notion that tea comes from Asia, largely.  So we have a nation-inspired menu. MARTIN:  And is tea just the leaf, or is there anything else? Ms. BROWN:  Yes, tea comes from one plant, the Camellia sinensis, and Americans also were confused about that because herbals are packaged and called tea, but they are really herbal infusions or fruit infusions.  They have no tealeaf, meaning leaf from the plant Camellia sinensis. MARTIN:  But when we hear things like black tea or Oolong tea or green tea, and I also hear there's something called white tea now, are those teas? Ms. BROWN:  They are all teas, and they are all from the same plant.  It's that the leaf after being plucked is processed in a different fashion. MARTIN:  So where does most tea come from? Ms. BROWN:  Most tea comes from India, China, Japan, Sri Lanka has beautiful tea, Kenya, and now, we're even seeing tea from Bolivia, which is what I am super excited about for today, and I've iced some for you. Tea is wonderful because drinking tea is an ancient tradition, and to see beautiful exquisite leaf coming out of Bolivia is really kind of an exciting thing.  And it's through the help of USAID that they've actually been able to develop this estate, and they've been producing now for over a year, and it's really exquisite tea.  I'm just so very impressed, you know. Well, I've iced some of the Bolivian green tea for you, and I have it here without any sugar. MARTIN:  All right. Ms. BROWN:  And then I have it here with a half a teaspoon of sugar. MARTIN:  And what am I looking for other than pure refreshment?  Is there any particular quality I'm looking for? Ms. BROWN:  I think in refreshment, you'll find a nice astringent finish that is very cleansing to the palate and refreshing. MARTIN:  OK.  It's nice.  It tastes a little smoky.  And I'm not going to lie to you, I'm a sweet girl, so I'm going to move right over here to the sweetened one.   Ms. BROWN:  A little bit of sugar goes a long way. MARTIN:  You know, I know you're going to rock somebody's world here, but loose versus bagged tea, is there an opinion here? Ms. BROWN:  Well, yes, there is an opinion because here at Teaism, we sell only loose leaf tea.  There is something that often goes into a tea bag. It's called dust and fanning sort of the bottom of the tea chest, you know, it's kind of what falls out, so it's always the worst stuff.   It's also something that's mass produced. So they want to have high volume, and they want to sell the stuff all over. MARTIN:  You know, what I think a lot of people are wondering is how do you know how long to brew a tea?  Or this is solely a matter of taste? Ms. BROWN:  It is a matter of taste and practice, really. So you need to decide how you like it.  If you over-brew, you can always add a little more water to dilute. MARTIN:  OK, now, you've got this really interesting green one here.  What is that? Ms. BROWN:  This is what we call Japanese sweet green tea.  It is very sweet and very green, and kids love the color of it.  It's this deep deep olive crazy green.  You're ingesting the tea itself, so it's made from matcha, which is the tea that's used in the Japanese tea ceremony that's ground down to a powder.  And in the tea ceremony, it's actually whipped and suspended in the water. So here it's also suspended in the water, but there's a lot of sugar in it.  So it's very popular in Japan. MARTIN:  Oh, is it?  I was going to ask if you have Japanese customers who come in and see this iced and go, oh, no!  No!  No! Ms. BROWN:  It's a real Japanese thing. MARTIN:  Is there caffeine in this? Ms. BROWN:  A little bit.  A little bit of caffeine in the green teas. MARTIN:  Are there health properties to tea, or is that a myth that we just promulgate because we want to drink it? Ms. BROWN:  Well, definitely, there are health benefits.  It's full of antioxidants, and I think, if you drink tea three or four or five times a day, you're definitely going to be fending off some of the issues, the health issues. MARTIN:  But are you going to be spinning close to the ceiling like you would be if you drink four or five cups of coffee? Ms. BROWN:  No.  Absolutely not.  A black tea, which is highest in caffeine, has 50 percent the amount of caffeine in a cup of coffee.  So you're already backed off by 50 percent. MARTIN:  Now, I see something that really looks like me, that looks like a milkshake.  What is that? Ms. BROWN:  OK.  This is bubble tea, sometimes called Boba.  We call it zhenzhu. MARTIN:  Where does it come from? Ms. BROWN:  It's from Taiwan, a popular, fun beverage.  We serve it in its classical form, so there are these gelatinous tapioca pearls in the bottom.  You get a big fat straw so that you can suck up the candy as you're enjoying the tea, and we brew a very very rich black tea, salon tea.  We brew it really really strong in water, add some sugar, add a little half-and-half to finish it off, and I think it's really good.  And this one carries some caffeine.  This is the one that at four o'clock in the afternoon, I'd say, I got to have some. MARTIN:  This is great. Ms. BROWN:  Isn't that fun? MARTIN:  This is like chocolate milk for grown ups.  Excuse me for chewing and making yummy sounds.  Sorry.  But this is really good. Ms. BROWN:  Aren't they fun?  Yes.  They are good.  Very very good. MARTIN:  You know, a lot of people are into chai tea now.  So is that really tea? Ms. BROWN:  It is tea.  It's a black tea that's spiced.  We cook it with milk and sugar.  We serve it in a more classical form.  A lot of places use concentrates and whatever, but we actually boil the tealeaf, we boil the spices with sugar, boil the milk, strain it.  When we have Indian visitors, they always appreciate it.  They always get that, you know, we put the effort into it, and it's better than - it's the real stuff.  Yeah. MARTIN:  When you say boiling, how about the whole microwave?  No microwave? Ms. BROWN:  No.  No. MARTIN:  I'm just getting, like, all kinds of tea demerits here.  I'm ashamed.  I'm very ashamed. Ms. BROWN:  I think that the microwave imparts flavor to the water.  There's something that you get off of the water that changes it. MARTIN:  But I'm thinking now that maybe that's partly why tea is relaxing because the process of making it is pleasant.  And if you get the aroma. . . Ms. BROWN:  I love to cook. MARTIN:  Yeah.  Maybe that's why.  Because there's something about the doing that makes it nice. Ms. BROWN:  Yes.  It is part of the process.  It's the ritual.  I mean, that's why you can enjoy exquisite tea in a paper cup if that's what you have or a hand-blown pottery piece that's like a hundred years old.  It's the ritual that you want to make it in the moment, in that moment, whatever you want it to be, it can be that. MARTIN:  I would like it if you came and made it for me. Ms. BROWN:  I would love to. MARTIN:  Michelle Brown is the co-owner of Teaism.  It's a teahouse in Washington, D. C.  There are three.  We are in the Penn Quarter location.

I'm Alex Chadwick. ALEX COHEN, host: I'm Alex Cohen. What it means to be rich in the U. S. Coming up, how the presidential candidates define prosperity. CHADWICK: First, the emergency NATO meeting in Belgium over the crisis with Russia and the war in Georgia. We're joined by one of the participants at that NATO meeting, the foreign minister of Poland, Radek Sikorski. A Russian general threatened his country with a nuclear attack if it goes ahead with an American missile deal. Mr. Minister, welcome to Day to Day. What happened at the NATO meeting? Mr. RADEK SIKORSKI (Foreign Minister, Poland): Well, the secretary general commented on those particular words of the Russian deputy chief of the general staff, calling them pathetic and unhelpful. And I think that's right, that NATO should respond to threats against one of its members. CHADWICK: This is Russian Colonel-General Anatoly Nagovitsin. He's been a spokesman for the Russian military. He said over this last weekend that this deal to build a U. S. missile defense base in Poland might provoke a nuclear attack, that this is Russian military doctrine. What has your country said to Moscow about this statement? Mr. SIKORSKI: Well, we're not going to get involved in issuing statements. NATO has responded, and that's sufficient. We're satisfied by that. We think that the MD base is not directed against Russia. Poland has volunteered to offer Russia inspection rights and even technical monitoring. So this rhetoric is unnecessary and unhelpful. CHADWICK: This will be a base that will hold 10 missiles. The U. S. says these missiles have nothing to do with Russia. Poland has said these missiles really have nothing to do with Russia. They are meant to deter threats, perhaps from Iran, if Iran were to launch missiles. But after haggling for months, Poland just agreed to this deal last week, when the war was on with Georgia. Isn't this really about Russia? Mr. SIKORSKI: It was a coincidence, the last round was scheduled before the events in the Caucuses, and we had intimation before that we were going for a successful conclusion. CHADWICK: So you're saying the media has made too much of this. The Russians are making too much of it. Mr. SIKORSKI: It's an understandable association, but I'm telling you again, it's a coincidence. CHADWICK: What is your take on the Russians these days? What are they after? Mr. SIKORSKI: Well, by not withdrawing after they've said to the EU President several times that they would imminently, Russia's credibility is suffering, and people are beginning to suspect that not only has Russia crossed an international boundary, not only has it rampaged and bombed all over Georgia, that it may now be degrading Georgia's military and civilian infrastructure in order to change the democratically-elected government of Georgia by other means. CHADWICK: The Russian troops, by some reports in Georgia, are beginning to withdraw. They've withdrawn from the town of Gori, according to the Associated Press. Does this signify something to NATO? Mr. SIKORSKI: Well, that would be a step in the right direction, and that would be a vindication of EU's peacemaking efforts. We do need to see the withdrawal of Russian forces back to Russia and then a political process and a humanitarian effort and a reconstruction effort. CHADWICK: The U. S. secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, will be in Warsaw to sign this missile base agreement tomorrow. You're saying Poland is going ahead with this, despite these very clear warnings from the Russians. Mr. SIKORSKI: We are, and I will be signing the agreement with her tomorrow. But we feel vindicated in that we were insisting, in the course of these negotiations, that Poland needs to be strengthened in terms of military capabilities and that we need additional political statements of solidarity with the United States to face military and non-military challenges around Poland's borders. And we are very glad that the Polish-American relationship is being strengthened by this agreement. CHADWICK: You say you need additional political statements from the United States? What kind of statements are you looking for? Mr. SIKORSKI: Together with the MD agreement, a political declaration is being issued which contains what we call a solidarity clause, namely that Poland and the United States will work together to face both military and non-military threats that may emerge from third parties. CHADWICK: Radek Sikorski, Foreign Minister of Poland, speaking with us from the emergency NATO meeting in Brussels, Belgium. Mr. Minister, thank you. Mr. SIKORSKI: Thank you.

I'm Neal Conan in Washington. Over the weekend, the American Psychological Association held its annual convention in Boston. Outside the hall, about 100 anti-torture activists staged a protest rally. The big issue inside and outside was psychologists' role in military and CIA interrogations. Members debated a resolution to bar the practice. Those in favor argued that working with the military in places like Guantanamo Bay legitimizes and condones cruel and abusive treatments of detainees. Opponents say the resolution harms the people that it seeks to protect, vulnerable populations and ethical psychologists. Today, we'll hear from psychologists on both sides. Later in the hour, too wealthy for a Bentley? Inside one rich man's world. But first, psychologists and interrogation. If you're a psychologist or a mental health professional, should psychologists work with military and intelligence interrogators? Give us a call, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr. org. You can also join the conversation on our blog at npr. org/blogofthenation. We begin with Robert Resnick, a professor of psychology at Randolph-Macon College, with us today from member station WCVE in Richmond, Virginia. Nice to have you on the program with us today. Dr. ROBERT J. RESNICK (Psychology, Randolph-Macon College): Thank you. CONAN: And as I understand it, we're talking about a unit called behavioral-science consultation teams that work with the military. They're made of psychologists and others who assist in interrogations. Dr. RESNICK: The BSCTs, yes. CONAN: They're called BSCTs, informally. OK. Now, you wrote the argument against this proposal, and given the abuses that we've heard reported from Bagram in Afghanistan, from Guantanamo, CIA black sites, how can it be ethical to aid in what many consider torture? Dr. RESNICK: It's never ethical, and the APA has never ever, ever said it was ethical. Since the early '80s, APA and American psychologists had been saying torture is not permitted under any conditions. You know, the major issue is, do no harm. CONAN: The major issue is, do no harm, yet if psychologists participate in those BSCT teams that were involved in some of these situations, as they're reported to be, maybe that's not always obtained. Dr. RESNICK: That may be true, and it's disheartening to hear that psychologists may have been involved in that, but I don't think that this petition does anymore than our very strong ethical code that says torture, under any conditions, is unethical and inappropriate. CONAN: What's wrong, then, with reinforcing that? Dr. RESNICK: Well, because as written, there are some very poor intentions that may happen. Very ethical and caring psychologists will be forced to leave a job, or be out of the job, or not take a job, in situations where they can help detainees or patients in psychiatric hospitals or prisons, because the language is a little bit loose in the details. CONAN: And how would that work? I mean, what do you mean specifically? Dr. RESNICK: Well, follow a prison psychologist, and prisoners often charge their constitutional rights had been breached. If that is the allegation and this petition were part of the APA policy, I would immediately have a problem, because I'm now working in a place that violates the U. S. Constitution. Psychiatric hospitals, the same thing, involuntary commitments, the same way, people allege their rights have been abridged, and if so, that would put me in conflict with the language of this petition. CONAN: And that's how you argue it would harm those it seeks to protect. Dr. RESNICK: Exactly. People in those institutions do great work helping disadvantaged persons, persons who are incarcerated or have psychiatric mental illness, and under this petition, they may be forced to move out of those situations. CONAN: Also with us is Brad Olson. He's a psychologist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, with us today from Avenue Edit Studios in Chicago. Nice to have you in the program as well. Dr. BRADLEY D. OLSON (Human Development and Social Policy, Northwestern University): Thank you. Nice to be on here. CONAN: And inadvertently, might Robert Resnick's argument - obtain (ph), might it harm people who are threatened and ethical psychologists? Dr. OLSON: No, I don't think it would, and I understand the worry, the concern, that exists, but this is very - the resolution is very clearly focused on settings that are tied to the Global War on Terror and national security settings. And we're not even saying that psychologists should not be part of these settings. What we're basically saying is that in these places, where the major role of psychologists is to exploit vulnerable detainees, in places where the U. S. Constitution is violated, places where international law is violated - I mean, if we look at these settings, if you look at the first twelve articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a place like a CIA black site, eleven those of articles apply to the CIA black sites. Those CIA black sites are violating those articles. Now, that's not true of U. S. prisons or U. S. psychiatric facilities, even though, you know, there are some concerns about those settings. But we've made it very clear that these are tied to Global War on Terror settings. CONAN: And why are, then, the strictures that Bob Resnick told us about, that have been in place since 1980 against torture, strictly prohibiting participation in any way in torture, why are they inadequate? Dr. OLSON: Well, they're inadequate - I think, probably the single most reason that they're inadequate is it's extraordinarily - I mean, these settings in CIA black sites and Guantanamo Bay exists where they are, sequestered from the mainland of the U. S. for a reason, to avoid some of our laws, and to make it very difficult for information to come out of these settings. So, it's impossible to sort of say, you know, this psychologist - even though we know standard operating procedures - say that a job of the psychologists is exploitation, and our ethics code says, do not exploit, it's impossible to know what is happening in these centers. And so therefore, we're focusing on the settings themselves. CONAN: Given that, how would this be enforced? Dr. OLSON: Well, you know, the American Psychiatric Association and American Medical Association came out before the APA's 2005 PENS Report, basically saying that physicians and psychiatrists have no role in these interrogations. And one of the criticisms that the American Psychological Association leveled at them was, well, this is not enforceable. But the truth is, the Department of Defense - because of these policies, because the APA's resolutions have really tried to secure the psychologists in these roles - the Department of Defense clearly now favors psychologists in these BSCT roles. So, what we really want is we want a clear policy, and we're going to work to enforce it. It's going to take some work, but we think that can be achieved. CONAN: Bob Resnick, I'd like you to respond to what Brad Olsen had to say. Dr. RESNICK: Well, I respectfully disagree. I think that we have ethical statements on the book. I'll read one sentence: Psychologists are absolutely prohibited from knowingly planning, designing, participating or assisting in the use of all condemned techniques. There's over two dozen listed and more can be added as they are evolved. I don't know how to make it any clearer than that. And moving from our ethical code to this resolution, we're talking about location rather than behavior and our ethical code says you cannot do this behavior anywhere. We don't need to say especially not there, because you're can't do it anywhere. CONAN: Brad Olson? Dr. OLSON: Well, I mean, yes. We are focusing on location, and that's not - I mean, typically psychologists, I mean, by our trade, we focus on individuals, but the truth is, you know, the reason we haven't focused on location before, haven't focused on these specific settings, is we've never been in the situation in the United States, where we've seen anything that's this far outside of the law. And psychologists hold the key to these settings, because the torture memos, the Yoo/Bybee memos, basically says it's not torture if the interrogator is not intending to produce harm and if the mental harm is not prolonged. So, by having a psychologist, a professional, legitimize what the interrogator is doing, you essentially - even in cases where we would say, anyone would say, this is torture - the argument could be made, this is not technically torture. . . CONAN: Because that psychologist on the site said it wasn't. Dr. OLSON: Exactly. CONAN: But there are already restrictions against that psychologist for participating in torture. Dr. OLSON: Well, again, it's the complete lack of transparency in these settings. I mean, we know that psychologists have played a central role going, all the way up from the Yoo/Bybee memos through the reverse engineering of the SERE program, the program that's used to inoculate U. S. soldiers against countries that violate the Geneva Conventions. Psychologists were central to reverse engineering those techniques and using them against detainees to extract information from them and orchestrating these interrogations that involved techniques of the Army Field Manual. This is even less intense than the enhanced techniques that the CIA uses, but that escalate fear, attempt to produce, depression and - I mean, that's just antithetical to the idea of what we're about as a profession of psychologists. CONAN: Bob Resnick, he says the psychologist's role is central. What do we actually know about what psychologists do on these BSCT teams? Dr. RESNICK: Well, that's an interesting question, because it's not clear how many psychologists, if any - I have no idea of how many - are involved and to the extent of their involvement, and there's lots of people saying there's a great deal, but I have known of no data that says there's any number in particular. But I want to again make the point that the American Psychological Association has never said torture - patient abuse, detainee abuse - is appropriate behavior. We have always said it's unethical and prohibited. CONAN: But let me just go back on that point. Do the psychologists, you know, have an earpiece into the interrogators ear and say, ask him about his mother, that'll push his buttons? Dr. RESNICK: I do not know. CONAN: Do you know, Brad Olson? Dr. RESNICK: Yes, I do. We have a standard SOP from - Standard Operating Procedure - from - signed by the surgeon general of the Army at one point, Kevin Kiley, and it's clear what psychologists do. I mean, their job is to make assessments of the detainee. Their job is to come up - orchestrate what the interrogation is going to look like, set up the conditions of detention to soften up the detainee, and I think, one of the primary techniques that psychologists are involved in, setting up social isolation, so that, at one point - for 30 days, a detainee was isolated so that they would be desperate for the need for human contact. So, when the interrogator came in the room, they were looking to talk, and so - I mean, that's exactly what the psychologist does, is they work on exploitation. CONAN: We're talking about the debate over psychologists and interrogations. We'll take your calls when we get back, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr. org. Stay with us. I'm Neal Conan. You're listening to Talk of the Nation from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) CONAN: This is Talk of the Nation. I'm Neal Conan in Washington. We're discussing a debate that's erupted among members of the American Psychology Association. At issue, whether its members should ever be involved in military interrogations. The APA has a longstanding ban on participation in torture of any kind or abuse; but now, a new resolution argues that that does not go far enough, that psychologists should not work at military or CIA detention centers at all. A new referendum is up for discussion. A mail ballot has been sent out, and the results are not going to be clear for some time yet. You can read more about the case that's sparked the controversy on our website at npr. org. Today, we're talking with psychologists on both sides of the debate. If you're a psychologist or a mental health professional, should psychologists work with military and intelligence interrogators? 800-989-8255. Email is talk@npr. org. Our guests are Brad Olson, a psychologist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois - He argued the pro statement on whether the APA should pass its resolution - and with us also, Robert Resnick, professor of psychology at Randolph-Macon College, author of the con statement. And let's get a caller on the line, Jared, Jared calling us from Atlantic County in New Jersey. JARED (Caller): Hi, yes. How are you today? CONAN: Very well, thanks. JARED: I appreciate you taking the time to take my call. I'm a licensed professional counselor in New Jersey, and frankly, I'm a little sickened by the question that's being raised. We attribute to ourselves a set of ethical guidelines when we entered this field that suggests that we in no way, shape, or form should ever knowingly, and even by that matter, we do everything that we can to, even, not mistakenly, harm any of the people that we work with, regardless of what our title is in this field. And my concern is that I'm hearing a tremendous slippery slope from one of your guests, that's saying that we are responsible, in this role, to knowingly put people at risk, regardless of whether we think they're the, quote/unquote, \"bad guys,\" or not. They're human beings. And regardless of what it is that they've done, our ethical guidelines indicate to us that we are never supposed to harm people. And putting us in a position where we have anything - in any way, shape or form - to do with potential torture, whether that \"torture\" word is in quotation marks or whether our government says, well, is this really torture, or is it not really torture, puts our field at risk, and. . . CONAN: Let me ask you, Jared. . . JARED: Yes, sir? CONAN: Do you see any circumstances under which the psychologists should - can ethically work under any kind of interrogations with the military and intelligence? JARED: I think the question is incredibly complex, and I think that that's probably why this debate is raging like it is. My initial answer, my go-to response is to say, no, we have an ethical response to - or an ethical responsibility to. . . CONAN: So, any interrogation is inherently unethical? JARED: Interrogation, by definition, yes. CONAN: Robert Resnick? Dr. RESNICK: I'm not sure with interrogation. That's asking questions. The point that I've been trying to go over and over again is this is a petition about an anti-torture drive. And my point continues to be the same. We have in place the strongest language possible. It says you cannot, under any circumstances, do this kind of behavior. And I don't think that now saying even more so in this workplace contributes in our understanding of what we should not do. CONAN: And Brad Olson, I think the kind of revulsion we hear from Brad is - from Jared, excuse me - our caller - well, is that what's fueling this controversy, do you think? Dr. RESNICK: Oh, I - it definitely is, and I think Jared is exactly right, that this is an incredibly complex issue, particularly the question of, should psychologists be involved in interrogations at all? And what we're trying to say with this resolution is that, you know, this is not just about interrogations. This is about settings that - like the CIA black sites - where the U. S. Constitution and international law is violated so systemically. CONAN: But what if they weren't? I mean, Guantanamo Bay, is that - no psychologist should work at Guantanamo Bay, period? Is that what you're arguing? Dr. RESNICK: No - well - that is what we - Guantanamo Bay, at this point, we would say absolutely yes. I mean, here's the thing. You have some psychologists. . . CONAN: Absolutely, yes, they should not participate? Dr. RESNICK: Absolutely, yes, psychologists should not be at Guantanamo Bay or CIA black sites. And this is why. You have psychologists who are using the Army Field Manuel, psychologists who have designed enhanced interrogation techniques, which are indisputably torture, and you've got those psychologists there at the setting. And they're working on the detainee. They're saying what they're doing is safe, legal, ethical, and effective, and it is none of those things. They're working to harm mental health with no goal of helping the detainee. Now, their job is basically to keep the detainee below the threshold of what they would consider torture, or severe, prolonged, permanent, mental harm. And so, then you have another psychologist, who is also a licensed professional, who is providing therapy for those detainees, and it becomes, I mean, it becomes almost absurd that one psychologist - and one thing we care about as psychologists is therapeutic alliance. So, a detainee is tortured by one set of psychologists and then handed over to increase their mental health, what, to the ability to be interrogated again. CONAN: Mm-hm. JARED: We can (unintelligible). . . Dr. RESNICK: So, that, you know, those are the complications of these settings. CONAN: Jared, go ahead. JARED: I'm sorry. We cannot afford in our profession to play good-cop/bad-cop. We cannot afford to do that. Our role and responsibility at all times is to protect the individuals with whom we associate. We work in this field. We work with rapists, and child molesters, and the people that society would consider - and many psychologists would consider - to be the worst of the worst. Regardless of what that person has done, our role, the role we choose to endow our lives to, is to protect people. And if the role that we're playing in these facilities - I heard one of your guests and I'm sorry, I didn't realize who it was - but one of your guests mentioned that sometimes the role of a psychologist is to indicate whether or not a person should be deprived of social contact for X amount of time. That's the thing that we know as human beings. Social contact is something that's needed. It's an absolute necessity. So, to be part of the decision-making process where we deprive somebody of that inherent, human need is, in fact, harming them, whether it's designed to be called torture, whether our government or any other government decides to manipulate the definition of torture or not - I mean, we've been - we've heard just now that the reason that these sites are very often off of American soil is because the Constitution can kind of be evaded. CONAN: Yeah. JARED: And that tells you the nature of the job we're being asked to do. CONAN: Jared, thanks very much. Appreciate it. JARED: Thank you very much for a great show. CONAN: Here's an email from Pat in Belleville, Illinois. I'm not a clinical psychologist, but my degree reads, Ph. D. in psychology. If licensed psychologists do not work in these interrogations, who will end up working there? Will other persons do the work that psychologists now do if this resolution passes, except less well and with more damage to the suspects? Brad Olson? Dr. OLSON: Well, we - you know, as psychologists, we have a lot of pride in our discipline. And I think that's great. But I think we also need to recognize that psychologists, even though we're professionals, we certainly have no monopoly over ethics. And many, many of the situations that we know, interrogators, linguists, others, other individuals in those settings, were very concerned with what's happening. And the psychologist has asked to push further. We have the recent case of a young man - well, when he was captured, he was 16 or 17, so we'll say a boy - was crying to a picture of his mother, and had a series of actions that the interrogator was very concerned about. A behavioral science consultant was brought in, said she doesn't believe him. He was put in isolation. He later attempted suicide. And so, here we have a case of the interrogator saying, look, I'm concerned, and the psychologist is saying, push harder. And she took. . . CONAN: Yet, isn't that. . . Dr. OLSON: She took the fifth, the right to science - silence. CONAN: Yeah, but isn't that the indication of - given that the strictures that Bob Resnick has told us about - that's an indication of an individual who may have violated the ethical strictures that were already on the books, one person, an aberration, not systematic. Dr. OLSON: Oh, well, I mean, this is a miracle that - I mean, we have worked hard to find out every bit of information that we can so that we can have accountability later on. But what we're trying to do is we're trying to prevent this from happening before it comes about. And this is not just - I mean, this is part of the Standard Operating Procedures. This is not a rotten-apple story. This is an orchard that is built for harm. CONAN: Bob Resnick, given what he's just said, do you think that psychologists should be working at Guantanamo Bay? Dr. RESNICK: I think, when they're helping those individuals who are detained and experiencing psychological issues, whatever - again, do no harm, help those that are in need, help those who cannot help themselves. I - again, the restriction is absolute in APA. No torture, no abuse. The association has rebuked Bush. The administration has written letters to the CIA, to the FBI. No one says, you should be doing torture, no one. CONAN: Let's get to Eric on the line, and Eric's with Columbia in South Carolina. ERIC (Caller): Yes, sir, thank you for taking my call. And this is an interesting discussing, because it's a mirror image of one that has taken place in several of the past few conferences of the American Translators Association. Our membership includes interpreters. And of course, the question has arisen, how many interpreters have participated in these torture sessions? So, a draft resolution has been circulated over the past several conferences condemning such behavior and holding those accountable - who participated accountable for it, so - and a common defense for that has been, well, APA has not yet found it necessary to pass any such resolution. So. . . CONAN: Against torture? We've been told over and over again that they have that ban on torture since 1980. ERIC: No, I mean, an additional response to the current situation, the - any further specific code or resolution concerning the current behavior that's going on in Guantanamo and. . . CONAN: And again, we've heard from Bob Resnick repeatedly that the Bush administration has been condemned by the APA. There have been repeated protests to the attorney general and various other places. What more do you need? ERIC: Well, let me ask him my question. If he found out any of his members worked - had definitively participated in any of the torture sessions, would they be removed from the APA? CONAN: Bob Resnick? Dr. RESNICK: They would be brought up an ethical charges, and if found guilty of those charges, could be expelled from the association, yes. ERIC: Well, then, you're one step further than the American Translators Association. Thank you. I appreciate your discussion. CONAN: OK, Eric, thanks very much for the call. But interesting, as Brad Olson mentioned, this is a discussion that is ongoing in several different groups. We just heard from the translators, and the APA, as he suggested, has no monopoly on ethics. We're talking with Brad Olson, a psychologist at Northwestern University, who authored the pro statement on whether the APA should pass a resolution restricting the role of psychologists at military and intelligence installations. Robert Resnick is also with us, Bob Resnick, a professor of psychology at Randolph-Macon College, author the con statement. And you're listening to Talk of the Nation from NPR News. And let see if we can go - rather, let's go to Brendon, Brendon with us from Dayton, Ohio. BRENDON (Caller): Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my call. I'm a graduate student and, well, actually I'm a doctoral student in clinical psychology at Wright State. And so I've been following the topic of today, based on the fact that our dean was associated with Guantanamo Bay. So, basically my question has to deal with, what is the black eye that maybe left on the profession if we don't pass this resolution? And what is the black eye left just from the inherent participation that psychologists have already had in these types of behaviors and what not? CONAN: Well, let's hear first from Brad Olson. Dr. OLSON: Well, is it the - I mean, there are already several black eyes from this that have occurred since 2005, since the APA put their, you know, first endorsement of the role of psychologist in the behavioral-science consultation role. But now, you know, now, we're - now we have the opportunity. I mean, now, this referendum is going to the membership. So, it's not just an issue of - I mean, the APA leadership is trying to fight this referendum. But the truth is that it's really the psychologists' decision for themselves. So, they've got a great opportunity now to vote yes for the referendum and say that psychologists absolutely should not be working and bolstering these settings that violate U. S. Constitution or international law, unless they're working independently for the detainee, as an attorney for the Center for Constitutional Rights would, or unless they're working for a third-party human-rights group. So, if they're coming in from the International Committee of the Red Cross, that's wonderful. And we've got a great new APA presidential candidate, Steven Reisner, who is really true - his - one of his main efforts is to build more internship programs with human-rights groups. CONAN: Let me just say quickly, in other words, if they're working as a consultant to the military or in uniform, they should not be there? Is that what you're saying, Brad? Dr. OLSON: In these settings. . . CONAN: In those settings, OK. Dr. OLSON: Yeah, in these settings. . . CONAN: All right, just wanted to get that straight. Dr. OLSON: Yeah, sure. . . CONAN: All right. So, let's get a response there from Bob Resnick, going back to Brendon's question, would failure to pass the resolution leave the APA with a black eye? Dr. RESNICK: I don't believe so, because what we have in place is more strongly worded than this resolution and it's much clearer. You get into a very, very slippery slope when you talk about when and how and what circumstances our constitutional rights have been violated or when U. N. rights are violated. It allows people to bring further lawsuits against psychologist who are working in prisons, psychiatric hospitals, forensic units. The black eye isn't there, because the language - and won't be there - because the 2008 language couldn't be any stronger. They're absolutely prohibited, et cetera, et cetera. CONAN: And do you fear that this would require the members of the APA to become sort of the amateur constitutional lawyers? Dr. RESNICK: Well, you will have to wonder about, you know, an inmate says, my rights to - my constitutional rights have been violated, and so now I'm bringing a suit. And I'm a psychologist. I don't have a law degree. I don't know what that means for me, but somebody could take that into my licensing board with a complaint. Someone could take it into a civil court. And even though it may be thrown out, it'd cost the psychologist several thousand dollars in legal fees to have that case dismissed. I don't think the language - while I'm sympathetic to the intent - the language is ambiguous enough that it could harm some very ethical - a psychologist doing very good work with the detainees or other persons who are incarcerated. CONAN: Well, Brendon, thanks very much for the call. Good luck with your studies. BRENDON: Thank you. CONAN: And just one final quick question, Bob Resnick, results are expected when on this ballot? Dr. RESNICK: Oh, don't ask me that. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. RESNICK: In about three weeks, I believe. CONAN: In about three weeks. Well, we'll revisit the question in some form or another then. Thank you both very much for your time today. We appreciate it after coming back from Boston. Dr. RESNICK: Thank you. CONAN: Bob Resnick, a professor of psychology at Randolph-Macon College, with us from member station WCVE in Richmond, Virginia. Brad Olson, thank you for your time, too. Dr. OLSON: Thank you. CONAN: Brad Olson, a psychologist in Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, with us from a studio in Chicago. Coming up, why some of the country's ridiculously wealthy cheered the economic downturn. Maybe now, owning a jumbo jet will mean something again. Jaime Johnson joins us on the culture of the WASP elite. Stay with us. I'm Neal Conan. It's Talk of the Nation from NPR News.  NEAL CONAN, host:  This is Talk of the Nation. I'm Neal Conan in Washington. Over the weekend, the American Psychological Association held its annual convention in Boston. Outside the hall, about 100 anti-torture activists staged a protest rally. The big issue inside and outside was psychologists' role in military and CIA interrogations.  Members debated a resolution to bar the practice. Those in favor argued that working with the military in places like Guantanamo Bay legitimizes and condones cruel and abusive treatments of detainees. Opponents say the resolution harms the people that it seeks to protect, vulnerable populations and ethical psychologists. Today, we'll hear from psychologists on both sides. Later in the hour, too wealthy for a Bentley? Inside one rich man's world.  But first, psychologists and interrogation. If you're a psychologist or a mental health professional, should psychologists work with military and intelligence interrogators? Give us a call, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr. org. You can also join the conversation on our blog at npr. org/blogofthenation. We begin with Robert Resnick, a professor of psychology at Randolph-Macon College, with us today from member station WCVE in Richmond, Virginia. Nice to have you on the program with us today.  Dr. ROBERT J. RESNICK (Psychology, Randolph-Macon College): Thank you.  CONAN: And as I understand it, we're talking about a unit called behavioral-science consultation teams that work with the military. They're made of psychologists and others who assist in interrogations.  Dr. RESNICK: The BSCTs, yes.  CONAN: They're called BSCTs, informally. OK. Now, you wrote the argument against this proposal, and given the abuses that we've heard reported from Bagram in Afghanistan, from Guantanamo, CIA black sites, how can it be ethical to aid in what many consider torture?  Dr. RESNICK: It's never ethical, and the APA has never ever, ever said it was ethical. Since the early '80s, APA and American psychologists had been saying torture is not permitted under any conditions. You know, the major issue is, do no harm.  CONAN: The major issue is, do no harm, yet if psychologists participate in those BSCT teams that were involved in some of these situations, as they're reported to be, maybe that's not always obtained.  Dr. RESNICK: That may be true, and it's disheartening to hear that psychologists may have been involved in that, but I don't think that this petition does anymore than our very strong ethical code that says torture, under any conditions, is unethical and inappropriate.  CONAN: What's wrong, then, with reinforcing that?  Dr. RESNICK: Well, because as written, there are some very poor intentions that may happen. Very ethical and caring psychologists will be forced to leave a job, or be out of the job, or not take a job, in situations where they can help detainees or patients in psychiatric hospitals or prisons, because the language is a little bit loose in the details.  CONAN: And how would that work? I mean, what do you mean specifically?  Dr. RESNICK: Well, follow a prison psychologist, and prisoners often charge their constitutional rights had been breached. If that is the allegation and this petition were part of the APA policy, I would immediately have a problem, because I'm now working in a place that violates the U. S. Constitution. Psychiatric hospitals, the same thing, involuntary commitments, the same way, people allege their rights have been abridged, and if so, that would put me in conflict with the language of this petition.  CONAN: And that's how you argue it would harm those it seeks to protect.  Dr. RESNICK: Exactly. People in those institutions do great work helping disadvantaged persons, persons who are incarcerated or have psychiatric mental illness, and under this petition, they may be forced to move out of those situations.  CONAN: Also with us is Brad Olson. He's a psychologist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, with us today from Avenue Edit Studios in Chicago. Nice to have you in the program as well.  Dr. BRADLEY D. OLSON (Human Development and Social Policy, Northwestern University): Thank you. Nice to be on here.  CONAN: And inadvertently, might Robert Resnick's argument - obtain (ph), might it harm people who are threatened and ethical psychologists?  Dr. OLSON: No, I don't think it would, and I understand the worry, the concern, that exists, but this is very - the resolution is very clearly focused on settings that are tied to the Global War on Terror and national security settings. And we're not even saying that psychologists should not be part of these settings.  What we're basically saying is that in these places, where the major role of psychologists is to exploit vulnerable detainees, in places where the U. S. Constitution is violated, places where international law is violated - I mean, if we look at these settings, if you look at the first twelve articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a place like a CIA black site, eleven those of articles apply to the CIA black sites. Those CIA black sites are violating those articles. Now, that's not true of U. S. prisons or U. S. psychiatric facilities, even though, you know, there are some concerns about those settings. But we've made it very clear that these are tied to Global War on Terror settings.  CONAN: And why are, then, the strictures that Bob Resnick told us about, that have been in place since 1980 against torture, strictly prohibiting participation in any way in torture, why are they inadequate?  Dr. OLSON: Well, they're inadequate - I think, probably the single most reason that they're inadequate is it's extraordinarily - I mean, these settings in CIA black sites and Guantanamo Bay exists where they are, sequestered from the mainland of the U. S. for a reason, to avoid some of our laws, and to make it very difficult for information to come out of these settings. So, it's impossible to sort of say, you know, this psychologist - even though we know standard operating procedures - say that a job of the psychologists is exploitation, and our ethics code says, do not exploit, it's impossible to know what is happening in these centers. And so therefore, we're focusing on the settings themselves.  CONAN: Given that, how would this be enforced?  Dr. OLSON: Well, you know, the American Psychiatric Association and American Medical Association came out before the APA's 2005 PENS Report, basically saying that physicians and psychiatrists have no role in these interrogations. And one of the criticisms that the American Psychological Association leveled at them was, well, this is not enforceable. But the truth is, the Department of Defense - because of these policies, because the APA's resolutions have really tried to secure the psychologists in these roles - the Department of Defense clearly now favors psychologists in these BSCT roles. So, what we really want is we want a clear policy, and we're going to work to enforce it. It's going to take some work, but we think that can be achieved.  CONAN: Bob Resnick, I'd like you to respond to what Brad Olsen had to say.  Dr. RESNICK: Well, I respectfully disagree. I think that we have ethical statements on the book. I'll read one sentence: Psychologists are absolutely prohibited from knowingly planning, designing, participating or assisting in the use of all condemned techniques. There's over two dozen listed and more can be added as they are evolved. I don't know how to make it any clearer than that. And moving from our ethical code to this resolution, we're talking about location rather than behavior and our ethical code says you cannot do this behavior anywhere. We don't need to say especially not there, because you're can't do it anywhere.  CONAN: Brad Olson?  Dr. OLSON: Well, I mean, yes. We are focusing on location, and that's not - I mean, typically psychologists, I mean, by our trade, we focus on individuals, but the truth is, you know, the reason we haven't focused on location before, haven't focused on these specific settings, is we've never been in the situation in the United States, where we've seen anything that's this far outside of the law. And psychologists hold the key to these settings, because the torture memos, the Yoo/Bybee memos, basically says it's not torture if the interrogator is not intending to produce harm and if the mental harm is not prolonged. So, by having a psychologist, a professional, legitimize what the interrogator is doing, you essentially - even in cases where we would say, anyone would say, this is torture - the argument could be made, this is not technically torture. . .  CONAN: Because that psychologist on the site said it wasn't.  Dr. OLSON: Exactly.  CONAN: But there are already restrictions against that psychologist for participating in torture.  Dr. OLSON: Well, again, it's the complete lack of transparency in these settings. I mean, we know that psychologists have played a central role going, all the way up from the Yoo/Bybee memos through the reverse engineering of the SERE program, the program that's used to inoculate U. S. soldiers against countries that violate the Geneva Conventions. Psychologists were central to reverse engineering those techniques and using them against detainees to extract information from them and orchestrating these interrogations that involved techniques of the Army Field Manual. This is even less intense than the enhanced techniques that the CIA uses, but that escalate fear, attempt to produce, depression and - I mean, that's just antithetical to the idea of what we're about as a profession of psychologists.  CONAN: Bob Resnick, he says the psychologist's role is central. What do we actually know about what psychologists do on these BSCT teams?  Dr. RESNICK: Well, that's an interesting question, because it's not clear how many psychologists, if any - I have no idea of how many - are involved and to the extent of their involvement, and there's lots of people saying there's a great deal, but I have known of no data that says there's any number in particular. But I want to again make the point that the American Psychological Association has never said torture - patient abuse, detainee abuse - is appropriate behavior. We have always said it's unethical and prohibited.  CONAN: But let me just go back on that point. Do the psychologists, you know, have an earpiece into the interrogators ear and say, ask him about his mother, that'll push his buttons?  Dr. RESNICK: I do not know.  CONAN: Do you know, Brad Olson?  Dr. RESNICK: Yes, I do. We have a standard SOP from - Standard Operating Procedure - from - signed by the surgeon general of the Army at one point, Kevin Kiley, and it's clear what psychologists do. I mean, their job is to make assessments of the detainee. Their job is to come up - orchestrate what the interrogation is going to look like, set up the conditions of detention to soften up the detainee, and I think, one of the primary techniques that psychologists are involved in, setting up social isolation, so that, at one point - for 30 days, a detainee was isolated so that they would be desperate for the need for human contact. So, when the interrogator came in the room, they were looking to talk, and so - I mean, that's exactly what the psychologist does, is they work on exploitation.  CONAN: We're talking about the debate over psychologists and interrogations. We'll take your calls when we get back, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr. org. Stay with us. I'm Neal Conan. You're listening to Talk of the Nation from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  CONAN: This is Talk of the Nation. I'm Neal Conan in Washington. We're discussing a debate that's erupted among members of the American Psychology Association. At issue, whether its members should ever be involved in military interrogations. The APA has a longstanding ban on participation in torture of any kind or abuse; but now, a new resolution argues that that does not go far enough, that psychologists should not work at military or CIA detention centers at all. A new referendum is up for discussion. A mail ballot has been sent out, and the results are not going to be clear for some time yet. You can read more about the case that's sparked the controversy on our website at npr. org.  Today, we're talking with psychologists on both sides of the debate. If you're a psychologist or a mental health professional, should psychologists work with military and intelligence interrogators? 800-989-8255. Email is talk@npr. org. Our guests are Brad Olson, a psychologist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois - He argued the pro statement on whether the APA should pass its resolution - and with us also, Robert Resnick, professor of psychology at Randolph-Macon College, author of the con statement. And let's get a caller on the line, Jared, Jared calling us from Atlantic County in New Jersey.  JARED (Caller): Hi, yes. How are you today?  CONAN: Very well, thanks.  JARED: I appreciate you taking the time to take my call. I'm a licensed professional counselor in New Jersey, and frankly, I'm a little sickened by the question that's being raised. We attribute to ourselves a set of ethical guidelines when we entered this field that suggests that we in no way, shape, or form should ever knowingly, and even by that matter, we do everything that we can to, even, not mistakenly, harm any of the people that we work with, regardless of what our title is in this field.  And my concern is that I'm hearing a tremendous slippery slope from one of your guests, that's saying that we are responsible, in this role, to knowingly put people at risk, regardless of whether we think they're the, quote/unquote, \"bad guys,\" or not. They're human beings. And regardless of what it is that they've done, our ethical guidelines indicate to us that we are never supposed to harm people. And putting us in a position where we have anything - in any way, shape or form - to do with potential torture, whether that \"torture\" word is in quotation marks or whether our government says, well, is this really torture, or is it not really torture, puts our field at risk, and. . .  CONAN: Let me ask you, Jared. . .  JARED: Yes, sir?  CONAN: Do you see any circumstances under which the psychologists should - can ethically work under any kind of interrogations with the military and intelligence?  JARED: I think the question is incredibly complex, and I think that that's probably why this debate is raging like it is. My initial answer, my go-to response is to say, no, we have an ethical response to - or an ethical responsibility to. . .  CONAN: So, any interrogation is inherently unethical?  JARED: Interrogation, by definition, yes.  CONAN: Robert Resnick?  Dr. RESNICK: I'm not sure with interrogation. That's asking questions. The point that I've been trying to go over and over again is this is a petition about an anti-torture drive. And my point continues to be the same. We have in place the strongest language possible. It says you cannot, under any circumstances, do this kind of behavior. And I don't think that now saying even more so in this workplace contributes in our understanding of what we should not do.  CONAN: And Brad Olson, I think the kind of revulsion we hear from Brad is - from Jared, excuse me - our caller - well, is that what's fueling this controversy, do you think?  Dr. RESNICK: Oh, I - it definitely is, and I think Jared is exactly right, that this is an incredibly complex issue, particularly the question of, should psychologists be involved in interrogations at all? And what we're trying to say with this resolution is that, you know, this is not just about interrogations. This is about settings that - like the CIA black sites - where the U. S. Constitution and international law is violated so systemically.  CONAN: But what if they weren't? I mean, Guantanamo Bay, is that - no psychologist should work at Guantanamo Bay, period? Is that what you're arguing?  Dr. RESNICK: No - well - that is what we - Guantanamo Bay, at this point, we would say absolutely yes. I mean, here's the thing. You have some psychologists. . .  CONAN: Absolutely, yes, they should not participate?  Dr. RESNICK: Absolutely, yes, psychologists should not be at Guantanamo Bay or CIA black sites. And this is why. You have psychologists who are using the Army Field Manuel, psychologists who have designed enhanced interrogation techniques, which are indisputably torture, and you've got those psychologists there at the setting. And they're working on the detainee. They're saying what they're doing is safe, legal, ethical, and effective, and it is none of those things. They're working to harm mental health with no goal of helping the detainee.  Now, their job is basically to keep the detainee below the threshold of what they would consider torture, or severe, prolonged, permanent, mental harm. And so, then you have another psychologist, who is also a licensed professional, who is providing therapy for those detainees, and it becomes, I mean, it becomes almost absurd that one psychologist - and one thing we care about as psychologists is therapeutic alliance. So, a detainee is tortured by one set of psychologists and then handed over to increase their mental health, what, to the ability to be interrogated again.  CONAN: Mm-hm.  JARED: We can (unintelligible). . .  Dr. RESNICK: So, that, you know, those are the complications of these settings.  CONAN: Jared, go ahead.  JARED: I'm sorry. We cannot afford in our profession to play good-cop/bad-cop. We cannot afford to do that. Our role and responsibility at all times is to protect the individuals with whom we associate. We work in this field. We work with rapists, and child molesters, and the people that society would consider - and many psychologists would consider - to be the worst of the worst. Regardless of what that person has done, our role, the role we choose to endow our lives to, is to protect people.  And if the role that we're playing in these facilities - I heard one of your guests and I'm sorry, I didn't realize who it was - but one of your guests mentioned that sometimes the role of a psychologist is to indicate whether or not a person should be deprived of social contact for X amount of time. That's the thing that we know as human beings. Social contact is something that's needed. It's an absolute necessity.  So, to be part of the decision-making process where we deprive somebody of that inherent, human need is, in fact, harming them, whether it's designed to be called torture, whether our government or any other government decides to manipulate the definition of torture or not - I mean, we've been - we've heard just now that the reason that these sites are very often off of American soil is because the Constitution can kind of be evaded.  CONAN: Yeah.  JARED: And that tells you the nature of the job we're being asked to do.  CONAN: Jared, thanks very much. Appreciate it.  JARED: Thank you very much for a great show.  CONAN: Here's an email from Pat in Belleville, Illinois. I'm not a clinical psychologist, but my degree reads, Ph. D. in psychology. If licensed psychologists do not work in these interrogations, who will end up working there? Will other persons do the work that psychologists now do if this resolution passes, except less well and with more damage to the suspects? Brad Olson?  Dr. OLSON: Well, we - you know, as psychologists, we have a lot of pride in our discipline. And I think that's great. But I think we also need to recognize that psychologists, even though we're professionals, we certainly have no monopoly over ethics. And many, many of the situations that we know, interrogators, linguists, others, other individuals in those settings, were very concerned with what's happening. And the psychologist has asked to push further.  We have the recent case of a young man - well, when he was captured, he was 16 or 17, so we'll say a boy - was crying to a picture of his mother, and had a series of actions that the interrogator was very concerned about. A behavioral science consultant was brought in, said she doesn't believe him. He was put in isolation. He later attempted suicide. And so, here we have a case of the interrogator saying, look, I'm concerned, and the psychologist is saying, push harder. And she took. . .  CONAN: Yet, isn't that. . .  Dr. OLSON: She took the fifth, the right to science - silence.  CONAN: Yeah, but isn't that the indication of - given that the strictures that Bob Resnick has told us about - that's an indication of an individual who may have violated the ethical strictures that were already on the books, one person, an aberration, not systematic.  Dr. OLSON: Oh, well, I mean, this is a miracle that - I mean, we have worked hard to find out every bit of information that we can so that we can have accountability later on. But what we're trying to do is we're trying to prevent this from happening before it comes about. And this is not just - I mean, this is part of the Standard Operating Procedures. This is not a rotten-apple story. This is an orchard that is built for harm.  CONAN: Bob Resnick, given what he's just said, do you think that psychologists should be working at Guantanamo Bay?  Dr. RESNICK: I think, when they're helping those individuals who are detained and experiencing psychological issues, whatever - again, do no harm, help those that are in need, help those who cannot help themselves. I - again, the restriction is absolute in APA. No torture, no abuse. The association has rebuked Bush. The administration has written letters to the CIA, to the FBI. No one says, you should be doing torture, no one.  CONAN: Let's get to Eric on the line, and Eric's with Columbia in South Carolina.  ERIC (Caller): Yes, sir, thank you for taking my call. And this is an interesting discussing, because it's a mirror image of one that has taken place in several of the past few conferences of the American Translators Association. Our membership includes interpreters. And of course, the question has arisen, how many interpreters have participated in these torture sessions? So, a draft resolution has been circulated over the past several conferences condemning such behavior and holding those accountable - who participated accountable for it, so - and a common defense for that has been, well, APA has not yet found it necessary to pass any such resolution. So. . .  CONAN: Against torture? We've been told over and over again that they have that ban on torture since 1980.  ERIC: No, I mean, an additional response to the current situation, the - any further specific code or resolution concerning the current behavior that's going on in Guantanamo and. . .  CONAN: And again, we've heard from Bob Resnick repeatedly that the Bush administration has been condemned by the APA. There have been repeated protests to the attorney general and various other places. What more do you need?  ERIC: Well, let me ask him my question. If he found out any of his members worked - had definitively participated in any of the torture sessions, would they be removed from the APA?  CONAN: Bob Resnick?  Dr. RESNICK: They would be brought up an ethical charges, and if found guilty of those charges, could be expelled from the association, yes.  ERIC: Well, then, you're one step further than the American Translators Association. Thank you. I appreciate your discussion.  CONAN: OK, Eric, thanks very much for the call. But interesting, as Brad Olson mentioned, this is a discussion that is ongoing in several different groups. We just heard from the translators, and the APA, as he suggested, has no monopoly on ethics. We're talking with Brad Olson, a psychologist at Northwestern University, who authored the pro statement on whether the APA should pass a resolution restricting the role of psychologists at military and intelligence installations. Robert Resnick is also with us, Bob Resnick, a professor of psychology at Randolph-Macon College, author the con statement. And you're listening to Talk of the Nation from NPR News. And let see if we can go - rather, let's go to Brendon, Brendon with us from Dayton, Ohio.  BRENDON (Caller): Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my call. I'm a graduate student and, well, actually I'm a doctoral student in clinical psychology at Wright State. And so I've been following the topic of today, based on the fact that our dean was associated with Guantanamo Bay. So, basically my question has to deal with, what is the black eye that maybe left on the profession if we don't pass this resolution? And what is the black eye left just from the inherent participation that psychologists have already had in these types of behaviors and what not?  CONAN: Well, let's hear first from Brad Olson.  Dr. OLSON: Well, is it the - I mean, there are already several black eyes from this that have occurred since 2005, since the APA put their, you know, first endorsement of the role of psychologist in the behavioral-science consultation role. But now, you know, now, we're - now we have the opportunity. I mean, now, this referendum is going to the membership. So, it's not just an issue of - I mean, the APA leadership is trying to fight this referendum.  But the truth is that it's really the psychologists' decision for themselves. So, they've got a great opportunity now to vote yes for the referendum and say that psychologists absolutely should not be working and bolstering these settings that violate U. S. Constitution or international law, unless they're working independently for the detainee, as an attorney for the Center for Constitutional Rights would, or unless they're working for a third-party human-rights group. So, if they're coming in from the International Committee of the Red Cross, that's wonderful. And we've got a great new APA presidential candidate, Steven Reisner, who is really true - his - one of his main efforts is to build more internship programs with human-rights groups.  CONAN: Let me just say quickly, in other words, if they're working as a consultant to the military or in uniform, they should not be there? Is that what you're saying, Brad?  Dr. OLSON: In these settings. . .  CONAN: In those settings, OK.  Dr. OLSON: Yeah, in these settings. . .  CONAN: All right, just wanted to get that straight.  Dr. OLSON: Yeah, sure. . .  CONAN: All right. So, let's get a response there from Bob Resnick, going back to Brendon's question, would failure to pass the resolution leave the APA with a black eye?  Dr. RESNICK: I don't believe so, because what we have in place is more strongly worded than this resolution and it's much clearer. You get into a very, very slippery slope when you talk about when and how and what circumstances our constitutional rights have been violated or when U. N. rights are violated. It allows people to bring further lawsuits against psychologist who are working in prisons, psychiatric hospitals, forensic units. The black eye isn't there, because the language - and won't be there - because the 2008 language couldn't be any stronger. They're absolutely prohibited, et cetera, et cetera.  CONAN: And do you fear that this would require the members of the APA to become sort of the amateur constitutional lawyers?  Dr. RESNICK: Well, you will have to wonder about, you know, an inmate says, my rights to - my constitutional rights have been violated, and so now I'm bringing a suit. And I'm a psychologist. I don't have a law degree. I don't know what that means for me, but somebody could take that into my licensing board with a complaint. Someone could take it into a civil court. And even though it may be thrown out, it'd cost the psychologist several thousand dollars in legal fees to have that case dismissed. I don't think the language - while I'm sympathetic to the intent - the language is ambiguous enough that it could harm some very ethical - a psychologist doing very good work with the detainees or other persons who are incarcerated.  CONAN: Well, Brendon, thanks very much for the call. Good luck with your studies.  BRENDON: Thank you.  CONAN: And just one final quick question, Bob Resnick, results are expected when on this ballot?  Dr. RESNICK: Oh, don't ask me that.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. RESNICK: In about three weeks, I believe.  CONAN: In about three weeks. Well, we'll revisit the question in some form or another then. Thank you both very much for your time today. We appreciate it after coming back from Boston.  Dr. RESNICK: Thank you.  CONAN: Bob Resnick, a professor of psychology at Randolph-Macon College, with us from member station WCVE in Richmond, Virginia. Brad Olson, thank you for your time, too.  Dr. OLSON: Thank you.  CONAN: Brad Olson, a psychologist in Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, with us from a studio in Chicago. Coming up, why some of the country's ridiculously wealthy cheered the economic downturn. Maybe now, owning a jumbo jet will mean something again.

I'm Alex Chadwick. MADELEINE BRAND, host: I'm Madeleine Brand. Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick will be the subject of an extraordinary hearing in Michigan this week. Today, a judge cleared the way for Michigan's governor to conduct a hearing to remove Kilpatrick from office. Among other things, Mayor Kilpatrick has been accused of lying on the witness stand about an affair he had with his chief of staff. Celeste Headlee reports on what people in Detroit are saying about their mayor and about his troubles. CELESTE HEADLEE: Rodney Armstrong (ph) is carrying his young daughter on his shoulders, a bright grin across his face, but the smile fades when he's asked about Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick and the governor's hearings. Mr. RODNEY ARMSTRONG (Detroit Resident): I'm kind of tired of it. You know, I hope that he can be replaced with somebody just as good or better. HEADLEE: But you're hoping he'll be replaced? Mr. ARMSTRONG: Yeah, I kind of hope so. HEADLEE: Kimberley Hansard (ph) is also hoping Governor Jennifer Granholm removes Kilpatrick from office this week.  Ms. KIMBERLEY HANSARD Detroit Resident): The city, it has to move forward. It can't - I mean, he's got a lot of things that he has to battle, and he can't handle the city business the same way. The confidence in the administration is not there. HEADLEE: It's been months since Kilpatrick was charged with perjury, misconduct, obstruction of justice, and several other felonies. Since then, the city council has acted to try and remove him from office, and there's a grassroots campaign to have him recalled. Sharon McPhail, general counsel for the city of Detroit, is defending the mayor in tomorrow's hearing. She says Kilpatrick has no intention of stepping down. Ms. SHARON MCPHAIL (General Counsel, City of Detroit): When things are this unfair, I've got to tell you, there's no way you can just walk away. It's like pleading guilty to something you didn't do. HEADLEE: McPhail says there are legitimate issues that must be addressed, but the mayor continues to do his job even as he handles his legal challenges, and there's no reason to remove him. She says the governor's hearings are politically motivated. Ms. MCPHAIL: It's absolutely, entirely political. HEADLEE: But Governor Jennifer Granholm denies there's any bias in her decision to hold these hearings. Press Secretary Liz Boyd says the city council submitted a sworn affidavit to the governor this year. Ms. LIZ BOYD (Press Secretary, Governor Granholm): She has a request before her that's been filed according to state law, and as the governor of Michigan, she must deal with that. HEADLEE: Boyd says the governor has two questions for the mayor. First, did he offer more than eight million tax-payer dollars to settle a whistle blower law suit in exchange for concealing hundreds of racy text messages he traded with his mistress, and second, did he hide that part of the deal when he went to city council to get approval on the settlement. Wayne council executive Robert Forcarno (ph) says it's long past time for Kilpatrick to step down. He says the mayor's legal troubles are damaging the city and the region.  Mr. ROBERT FORCARNO (Executive, Wayne Council): What you want to see and everybody wants to see is the growth, the ribbon cutting, and things like that, that shows there's progress going on. Unfortunately when you see the paper now, it's always the mayor in a courtroom. HEADLEE: Kilpatrick has made national headlines and some say his bad press will hurt other African-American politicians. Casey Gane-mcCalla is an editor of the online news magazine, News One. Mr. CASEY GANE-MCCALLA (Editor, News One): We live in a very racially critical society, where the masses of African Americans are judged by the heroes and the villains, and he's definitely one of the villains. HEADLEE: McCalla says he's particularly enraged by the mayor's complaints during the state of the city address that he's the victim of racism. Mr. GANE-MCCALLA: Racists didn't invite those strippers to your party, you know. Racists didn't send those text messages on city public phones between you and your girlfriend. That's you who did that. Don't use racism in defense because next time, when a politician has a legitimate gripe against racism, everybody crying wolf.  HEADLEE: But Kilpatrick will not be tried in the court of public opinion tomorrow. He'll have to face a one-time political ally in hearings that may end with his ouster. The hearings are expected to last three days, but Detroit attorney Sharon McPhail says she believes the governor has already made up her mind. Ms. MCPHAIL: It's pretty clear that the decision has already been made, and this is really just an exercise in futility. HEADLEE: Should the mayor lose his job, the city council president will step into the office until a new election is held. And for many Detroiters, that's the best thing that could happen.

His plea agreement stipulates that he leave office and not seek another elected position for five years, during which time he'll be on probation. Reporter Celeste Headlee is in Detroit. Celeste, welcome back, and remind everyone of the background of this case. CELESTE HEADLEE: This case is several years old. It stems from a whistleblower lawsuit filed by a couple of police officers. They say they were fired because they were investigating some person indiscretions on the part of the mayor, and the mayor supposedly lied under oath in those whistleblower lawsuits to conceal an affair that he was having with his then chief of staff. CHADWICK: So, he was called to testify in a court case, and he lied. HEADLEE: Correct. CHADWICK: So, what's the plea agreement? HEADLEE: Under the plea agreement, he's going to owe one million dollars to the city of Detroit. That's payable over five years, though he had to pay about 20,000 of it today. He's going to serve 120 days in jail, he has to surrender his law license, and he'll be on probation for five years, during which time he cannot seek an elected office. CHADWICK: Now, there also is a separate charge here of assault on a police officer, and there's been a lot going on that in the last month or so. What's happened? HEADLEE: Well, he pleaded no contest to that. Supposedly, a couple state police officers went to his sister's home to serve a warrant on someone there, and the mayor, at the time, assaulted them, not only verbally with profanities, but also shoved them out of the way, shoved one police officer into another. That's also a felony charge. So, he pleaded no contest to that today, and that comes with 120 days in jail, which he'll serve at the same time he's serving 120 days in jail for obstruction of justice. CHADWICK: And why the plea in the assault case? HEADLEE: Well, you know, the difference between the no contest and guilty, of course, is mostly about civil liability. In no contest, he's saying, yes, the facts of the case, as you state them, are correct, but I'm not guilty. (Soundbite of laughter) HEADLEE: That's basically what he's saying, and I was assuming because he doesn't want to make himself completely open to lawsuits filed by the two police officers. CHADWICK: What about jail? Is Mayor Kilpatrick headed to - and I guess he no longer really is Mayor Kilpatrick, he's resigned - is he headed to jail? HEADLEE: Not today, but he is going to jail. His sentencing hearing is on October 28th at two p. m. And prosecutor Kym Worthy says, on October 28th, at two p. m. he will go to jail and serve his 120 days sentence. CHADWICK: In fact, he has said repeatedly, I'm not quitting. I'm fighting this. I'm fighting. So, what's his demeanor in the courtroom today? HEADLEE: You know, he was a little odd. He was giggling. (Soundbite of laughter) HEADLEE: Sometimes he was kind of smiling and smirking, and at the time when they were summing up the case at the end, he was saying some things to himself that weren't entirely audible. And you know, at one point, when the judge was asking him if he understood his rights, he clearly made it sound as though he was a bit of a victim. (Soundbite of hearing) Judge RONALD GILES (36th District Court, Michigan State Court): You're also giving up the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty. Do you understand? Mayor KWAME KILPATRICK (Democrat, Detroit, Michigan): I think I gave that up a long time ago, your honor. Yes. HEADLEE: So, I don't think that's the demeanor of a man who is abashed or humbled. He did not seem in any way, shape, or form remorseful. CHADWICK: This must be some relief at last for the city of Detroit. Who's going to be running things there? HEADLEE: Well, the president of the city council is going to step into the mayor's shoes, at least until they hold another election. So, President Ken Cockrel will then become the mayor of Detroit. He says he's been preparing it for awhile. This could be kind of a very sketchy time for the city, though, because you have to understand that when Kwame Kilpatrick came into office, he also appointed more than two dozen of his friends and relatives to city government as well. And what's going to happen to those appointees is anybody's guess. CHADWICK: And isn't the city looking for a new police chief? HEADLEE: Yes, in a very interesting turn of events, the chief of police, Ella Bully-Cummings, timed the announcement of her retirement to coincide with the mayor's plea-agreement deal. Now, the chief of police was very closely aligned with Kwame Kilpatrick. Many people have called for her resignation because she was implicated in both the whistleblower lawsuit and the eventual cover-up of the racy text messages that the mayor had been exchanging with his mistress. But yeah, they're going to need a new police chief, I mean, we don't know what's going to happen. The chief of staff in the mayor's office is a childhood friend of Kwame Kilpatrick's. The director of recreation is a -somebody he used to play football with at his high-school football team. So, what could happen with all these different people, who knows? CHADWICK: Celeste Headlee, from the most high drama city in America, where the mayor from Detroit has resigned. Celeste, thank you. We'll hear more from you. HEADLEE: Thank you.

It was a crash between a Metrolink commuter train carrying 225 people and a Union Pacific freight train in Chatsworth. 25 people died. More than 100 are injured.  Metrolink officials say the engineer of the commuter train went through a red light telling him to stop. Investigators, though, say it is still too early to pinpoint the cause. And today, the Metrolink spokeswoman who earlier made a claim that Metrolink was to blame has resigned. KQED's Rob Schmitz reports.  ROB SCHMITZ: On Friday afternoon, Veronica Gonzales was on the phone with her sister when both of them saw on television that a commuter train had crashed. The sisters suddenly became very worried. Gonzales's 18-year-old niece, Maria Elena Vialobos (ph), texted her mother just an hour earlier from Union Station in L. A. telling her she was taking the train home to Moorpark and that she'll be home by five o'clock.  Ms. VERONICA GONZALES (L. A. Resident): We were on the phone together, and my sister goes, hold on. There is a Metrolink accident, and I want to make sure where. And then, when she heard it was towards going to Moorpark, then she knew right then that it was her in there.  SCHMITZ: The train crashed less than two stops away from where Maria Elena would have gotten off. On Saturday morning, Gonzales said the family had been frantically looking for her. They even went to the morgue to view unidentified bodies from the wrack.  Ms. GONZALES: We went to a USC last night because there were two Jane Does, but she wasn't there. And we've been calling hospitals, but she's not there.  SCHMITZ: The story was similar for many families who gathered here in Chatsworth over the weekend.  (Soundbite of helicopter) SCHMITZ: Just a mile away, television helicopters hovered over the gruesome scene of the accident, the twisted burnt metal of a passenger train car impaled by the train's own engine. Two other passenger cars stood tilted, derailed, but incredibly still standing upright. Los Angeles Fire Department Captain Armando Hogan arrived to what he calls a scene of chaos just an hour after the head on collision.  Cpt. ARMANDO HOGAN (Los Angeles Fire Department): So with that, we had bodies that were visible. We had screaming.   We had people that were still by the time, even when I got here, we still had people who were hidden, who were trying to make us aware of where they were.  SCHMITZ: The National Transportation and Safety Board, or NTSB, has launched an investigation into why a commuter train and a freight train were traveling towards each other on a single track. Denise Tyrrell, a spokeswoman for Metrolink, repeatedly gave this reason. Ms. DENISE TYRRELL (Spokeswoman, Metrolink): We believe that our engineer failed to stop and continued down the main track.  SCHMITZ: But Tyrrell couldn't explain why the commuter train's engineer ran though a red signal light. NTSB investigators say blaming the engineer was premature.  Earlier today, Tyrrell resigned. Metrolink officials had said the agency's control center alarms went off after the train had passed the red light. A dispatcher then reached the conductor on the phone, but it was too late.  NTSB investigators dispute this claim, saying, by the time the dispatcher realized there was something wrong, the accident had already occurred. The engineer, whom authorities haven't yet identified, was a subcontractor with Veolia Transportation and a former Amtrak employee. He had worked for Metrolink for 12 years. Authorities later confirmed he was killed in the crash.  The local CBS affiliate claims the engineer text-messaged someone just before the crash. NTSB officials have criticized that claim and Metrolink's account of the accident. Investigators say it's just too early to establish the cause of the crash.  Mayor ANTONIO VILLARAIGOSA (Democrat, Los Angeles): Two trains on the same track is just unacceptable.     SCHMITZ: After spending a good portion of the evening at the scene, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa was frustrated that the error of one engineer may have caused so many deaths. Mayor VILLARAIGOSA: The idea that human error could cause this accident says to me that we need to have some fail-safe measure to protect against it.  SCHMITZ: Safety experts say the crash might have been avoided had Metrolink and the region's freight railroads taken advice from the NTSB. For the past 30 years, the agency has been calling for installing sophisticated warning devices that would override human error.  Ms. GONZALES: It's just hard, you know, and you never imagine that that would happen.    SCHMITZ: As Veronica Gonzales waited for news of her 19-year-old niece, she clutched a photo of her, a pretty young woman with long black hair who was attending fashion school in downtown L. A. On Saturday evening, Gonzales and her family's fears were confirmed. Maria Elena Vialobos was found dead. For NPR News, I'm Rob Schmitz in Los Angeles.

I'm Madeleine Brand.  ALEX COHEN, host:  And I'm Alex Cohen. Nearly five years after he was elected to whip California back into sound financial shape, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has been facing the longest budget impasse ever in California this summer. And now, Schwarzenegger is about to become the first governor in state history to veto an entire spending plan. John Myers of member station KQED has more.  JOHN MYERS: Early Tuesday, the California legislature approved a spending plan now more than seven weeks overdue. But just hours after the plan was sent to him, Governor Schwarzenegger said it's not good enough.  Governor ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER (Republican, California): Legislators had the chance to fix our past mistakes and put us on a right course, but they refuse to do so.  MYERS: In a news conference Tuesday afternoon, Schwarzenegger announced he would veto a budget that even legislators admitted is, well, lousy.  Governor SCHWARZENEGGER: I'm somewhat disappointed because they are three months late with the budget.  And this is what we get on the desk, is a budget that literally pushes the problem into next year, kicks the can down the alley.  MYERS: The budget approved early Tuesday erases a $15 billion shortfall through deep spending cuts and a long list of gimmicks, gimmicks like a permanent requirement of California taxpayers to pay more of their taxes in the first few months of the year. The accelerated tax collection will allow the state to count the revenues in the current fiscal year, thus helping balance the budget on paper. But what drew Schwarzenegger's veto was the debate over a rainy day fund for future bad years. Legislators agreed to the governor's demand to increase the size of the reserve, but they rejected what they saw as overly restrictive rules on using the money.  State Senator DON PERATA (Democrat, East Bay, California): No one in this business says, my way or the highway.     MYERS: Democrat Don Perata is the president pro tem of the California State Senate. He says the rainy day fund should be available to replenish the vital programs hit hard by budget deficits in years gone by.  State Senator PERATA: Otherwise, all you're doing is shrinking government.  And there are those who really want to make it very small and, you know, not have government doing the things that we believe it should be doing.  MYERS: If that was the only issue, Republicans in the state legislature might support Schwarzenegger's veto, but they don't. That's because the gimmick-laden budget was a result of their opposition to a tax increase, something both Schwarzenegger and Democrats wanted.  And they are inclined to reject Schwarzenegger's veto, says Dave Cogdill, the Republican leader in the state senate.  State Senator DAVE COGDILL (Republican, 14th District, California): We need to get this budget and get it out.  And we think it certainly meets the goals that we set this year. Everybody realizes it's not a perfect budget. I don't know that there is such a thing.  But our concern from the very beginning was to pass a budget that didn't do additional harm to the economy of the state. MYERS: Even Schwarzenegger expects his veto to be overridden this week. But that may actually play in his favor. After all, when next year's projected budget problems show up, the iconic chief executive can say, don't blame me. I didn't approve that budget.

Coming up, as the race for the White House tightens, both parties are intensifying their efforts to register voters and get them to the polls.  How do they do it?  Who are they targeting and why?  We'll talk about that in just a few minutes with a bipartisan round table.  But first. . . Mr. ROBERT DUNCAN (Chairman, Republican National Committee):  So it's my privilege to proclaim the 2008 Republican National Convention in session and call it to order. MARTIN:  That was Robert Duncan, the chairman of the Republican National Committee.  He's known as Mike Duncan.  He's held the position since January 2007, but his political resume includes serving on the campaigns of five presidents, from Richard Nixon to George W. Bush.  Mr. Duncan is with us now from his office.  Welcome to the program. Mr. DUNCAN:  Thank you, Michel.  Good to be with you. MARTIN:  We had a chance to visit briefly at the Republican Convention earlier this month in St. Paul, and this is some of what you said. Mr. DUNCAN:  Well, this convention is setting the stage for John McCain to make his case to the American people.  After this convention, we only have about 60 days until the election.  This is the latest convention in history, and we believe that we're going to have the wind at our back, and we're going to be able to sprint those final 60 days. MARTIN:  Now, I asked your counterpart, Howard Dean, this question.  I'd like to ask you. Are these conventions, these four-day extravaganzas, still worthwhile? Mr. DUNCAN:  Well, conventions are important for lots of different reasons. The first is the legal reason, that you have to nominate the president and vice president of the United States.  Of course, that wouldn't take four days to do.  We could do that probably in two days.  But there are other things, bringing like-minded people together to talk about the principles of the party.  We have our platform report. That's extremely important.  We also want to make sure that we see future stars of the party, and you saw a lot of people on the stage at the convention who will be future stars.  And we also recognize stars from the past.  It's just a great time to bring people together and talk about the principles of the party. MARTIN:  We have less than 60 days now to the election.  You said that the wind is at your back.  Is it still at your back and why? Mr. DUNCAN:  Well, with about 48 days to go, it is, and I think we were strategically positioned with our convention.  The Democrats chose first, and they chose a date that would have put us in competition with the Olympics had we gone before them, or we would had to have gone all the way back in July.   So we made the choice to have the latest convention in history this time, and I think that was a good decision because the party in power normally goes second, and we did that, and we believe that we had a stronger bounce coming out of our convention, which was one of the goals that we had.  And with seven weeks left, we think it was a great decision for the party. MARTIN:  Both parties have sharpened their messages in the days since both conventions. Both are coming out with new political adds.  Now, Karl Rove, who, of course, is the former deputy chief of staff to George W. Bush, he's called the architect of the president's two successful campaigns, had this to say when he was interviewed by Chris Wallace on Fox News last Sunday. Mr. KARL ROVE (Former Deputy Chief of Staff to George W. Bush):  Both campaigns are making a mistake, and that is, they are taking whatever their attacks are and going one step too far. Mr. CHRIS WALLACE (Host, Fox News):  In fair game, what is McCain doing that goes a step too far? Mr. ROVE:  Well, McCain has gone in some of his ads, similarly gone one step too far in sort of attributing to Obama things that are, you know, beyond the 100-percent-truth test. MARTIN:  What do you think about that, Mr. Duncan?  Do you agree that both campaigns are going too far?  And does it concern you that John McCain's campaign, since he's your candidate, is compromising his reputation for being beyond, you know, petty, partisan politics? Mr. DUNCAN:  Well, the day that John McCain became the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party, we sat in my office, and we talked about the kind of campaign that he wanted to run and that I wanted to run.  And that was a campaign of big ideas, and we've been doing that. And we had hoped that Barack Obama had - would've kept his word and attended the town hall meetings that we proposed.  At one point, Obama said any time, any place, and we proposed 10 different town hall meetings.  I suspect that the discourse level of the campaign would be a little bit higher had he done that, and the American people would be able to judge the two candidates face to face more times than the debates that we have upcoming.   And in politics, when you're attacked, you have to respond, and I don't think the Obama campaign knew what to do with Governor Palin when she became the vice-presidential nominee, and I think they struggled.  Their candidate for vice president, Joe Biden, said that she was prettier than him, and then they had another spokesman who talked about - she would do what she was told, and they attacked her for being a small-town mayor. And I think it has thrown them off their game, and it's shown in the last two weeks. MARTIN:  But you think that it's within the boundaries of appropriate discourse? Mr. DUNCAN:  I think responding to attacks in politics is something that we all have to do, and making sure that there is a distinction between the two candidates and the two parties are something that's the responsibility of the campaigns and the parties to do. MARTIN:  There's a column by David Brooks in the New York Times this week that suggested it just isn't wrong, that it is entirely legitimate to ask about Sarah Palin's qualifications.  What do you think?  Do you think it is sexist to ask about her qualifications? Mr. DUNCAN:  I think Sarah Palin has excellent qualifications.  I think she's been an executive officer of a county.  She's the chief executive officer of a state, and I think her qualifications are out there for everyone to see every day.   I want to talk about the qualifications of Barack Obama.  I want to talk about the fact that, when he was in the state legislature, that he voted present 130 times as opposed to voting yes or no.  I want to talk about the judgment that he has and that Joe Biden has also exhibited on foreign policy - over a short period of time for Obama and a long period of time for Joe Biden.  I think that people's qualifications do come into play. MARTIN:  Do you think that you can look the American people in the eye and say she's really the most qualified person to lead this country if something should happen to John McCain - from your party? Mr. DUNCAN:  I can say that Governor Palin is qualified to lead this country.  She's qualified to be president of the United States.  She's an executive decision maker.  She's worked her way up in government.  She's made more decisions in a short period of time than anyone in the United States Senate has been able to do. MARTIN:  If you're just joining us, we're talking with Mike Duncan. He is the chairman of the Republican National Committee, and we're talking about the race for the White House. Can we talk about you for a minute? Mr. DUNCAN:  Absolutely. MARTIN:  Why did you want to be RNC chairman?  It seems like rather a thankless job in some ways - either party, not just the Republican Party, either party. Mr. DUNCAN:  In November of 2006, when I agreed to take the job, there weren't a lot people lined up wanting to be RNC chairman, but I've been involved in party politics for a long time.  I started in politics when I was 9 years old. I had an uncle who ran for superintendent of schools, and I went with him all summer. I watched the Republican and Democratic conventions that summer. I got involved in my community. I ran for student office in high school and college, and it's been a way of life for me.  So it's something that I've enjoyed for a long period of time. MARTIN:  In your bio you call yourself a civic capitalist. What does that mean?  Is that kind of like a community organizer with a bigger budget? Mr. DUNCAN:  Well, when my wife and I decided to go back to Appalachia and go back to her hometown, one of the things that we agreed was to spend at least one day a week doing things that we wanted to do for the community.  And sometimes, it has taken on more than a week. I've taken periods of time to work in political campaigns or to serve colleges, or I actually worked at the White House for a period of time.  She's worked with her church. Of course, there have been different projects she's had over the years.  So we believe in giving back to the community. We think that's an important part of what you do in America. MARTIN:  Besides politics, your career has been in banking.  In light of the current mess on Wall Street, which - much of which is being sort of driven by the financial institutions, do you have some thoughts about this, why this is happening?  And how prepared is John McCain to tackle this, given that he's acknowledged that economics is not his strong suit?  And he has never run anything, either.  He has no executive experience, either, certainly no experience in business. Mr. DUNCAN:  He doesn't have the business experience, but he does have executive experience, you know.  He commanded a large strike force when he was in the service, and I think if you go back and look at the number of men that he commanded during that period of time and the number of decisions that he had to make then, you would understand that he does have executive decision.   I come at this from a Main Street as opposed to a Wall Street standpoint. I believe that's the same place that John McCain is.  I had a chance to watch his remarks, read his remarks where he talks about he wants to shake things up.  He wants to end the corruption and unbridled greed and reckless conduct that he perceives has been going on on Wall Street. MARTIN:  But what experience can you point to in his background that would suggest that he has the experience to address these particular issues at this time? Mr. DUNCAN:  Over a period of time, he has shown the judgment to say, wait a minute, we've got to do something about this.  Two years ago, he stood up to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and said, we've got to stop this.  We've got to understand what these instruments are that are being put out there.  We've got to make sure that we know what Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are doing.   And he has shown that throughout his congressional career, that he's been ahead of his time. He's been a maverick.  You know, he was ahead of his time on campaign finance.  He was ahead of his time on selecting judges.  He was part of the Gang of 14.  Time after time, John McCain has shown the judgment to lead this country. MARTIN:  Going back to the conventions, many commentators, ourselves included, noted the lack of diversity among the delegates.  The percentage of African-American delegates was at a 40-year low.   This is another question I asked of Howard Dean.  Given that the U. S. census figures released last month show that whites will become a minority in the U. S. by the year 2042 - that's about eight years earlier than expected - how does the Republican Party plan to adapt to this new reality?  And does the lack of diversity at the convention suggest that maybe you're a step or two behind? Mr. DUNCAN:  Michel, it's something that I work on everyday.  Obviously, it's something I'm concerned about.  We have a robust outreach effort at the RNC.  But I found over a period of time that you have to do this one person at a time, one community at a time, and one day at a time, and we're doing that.   We're recruiting African-American and Latino candidates, Asian candidates all over the country.  And you're not seeing them in high-profile races this time, the way you did in 2006, but you're seeing them at local levels. And this is how you have to build the party, over a period of time.  And we're committed to that, and it has to be an ongoing, sustained effort.   MARTIN:  What's your message, though?  I mean, given that the Democrats do have an African-American whom they've nominated for this country's highest office, what do you say to that? Mr. DUNCAN:  Our message is one of hope and opportunity.  Our message is that, over a period of time, give us a chance, and we will earn your vote.  We are a party that understands the role of government, that government is there to protect you.  We understand individual responsibility.  We understand why we have to have a strong national defense.  We understand that African-American and Hispanic businesses are started at a much higher rate than anyone else in the country, and that we've got to help put together an economy that fosters those small businesses in the country.  Give us a chance. MARTIN:  And I have to ask you this, and I hope you'll be straight with me because this is an important question.   Mr. DUNCAN:  OK. MARTIN:  I know you're a Kentucky native and a graduate of the University of Kentucky.  Your school is known for basketball, but the football team is 3 and 0.  Any chance they can shock the nation and go undefeated? Mr. DUNCAN:  I think we have another bowl game in our future, three in a row. MARTIN:  Three in a row.  OK. Mr. DUNCAN:  You have to go back to the early 1950s, late 1940s to find something like that in Kentucky. MARTIN:  Oh yeah, exactly, so - but are you like a cockeyed optimist? Mr. DUNCAN:  I am very optimistic.  Yes. MARTIN:  All right.  Mike Duncan is the chairman of the Republican National Committee.  He spoke to us from his office.  Thank you so much for speaking with us. Mr. DUNCAN:  Thank you, Michel.  It's good to be with you.  MICHEL MARTIN, host:  I'm Michel Martin, and this is Tell Me More from NPR News.  Coming up, as the race for the White House tightens, both parties are intensifying their efforts to register voters and get them to the polls.  How do they do it?  Who are they targeting and why?  We'll talk about that in just a few minutes with a bipartisan round table.  But first. . .  Mr. ROBERT DUNCAN (Chairman, Republican National Committee):  So it's my privilege to proclaim the 2008 Republican National Convention in session and call it to order.  MARTIN:  That was Robert Duncan, the chairman of the Republican National Committee.  He's known as Mike Duncan.  He's held the position since January 2007, but his political resume includes serving on the campaigns of five presidents, from Richard Nixon to George W. Bush.  Mr. Duncan is with us now from his office.  Welcome to the program.  Mr. DUNCAN:  Thank you, Michel.  Good to be with you.  MARTIN:  We had a chance to visit briefly at the Republican Convention earlier this month in St. Paul, and this is some of what you said.  Mr. DUNCAN:  Well, this convention is setting the stage for John McCain to make his case to the American people.  After this convention, we only have about 60 days until the election.  This is the latest convention in history, and we believe that we're going to have the wind at our back, and we're going to be able to sprint those final 60 days.  MARTIN:  Now, I asked your counterpart, Howard Dean, this question.  I'd like to ask you. Are these conventions, these four-day extravaganzas, still worthwhile?  Mr. DUNCAN:  Well, conventions are important for lots of different reasons. The first is the legal reason, that you have to nominate the president and vice president of the United States.

Rescue crews have found the wreckage of a small plane near Mammoth Lakes, California. Officials confirm it's the same one he was flying. They have not found his body. Here's Madera County sheriff John Anderson speaking to reporters this morning. Sheriff JOHN ANDERSON (Madera County, California): It appeared to me just looking at the pictures that it was a head on crash into the side of a mountain, into a rock. The plane moved up, in an upward direction for 100 feet or so and disintegrated. CHADWICK: The search for Steve Fosset's plane began again after a hiker found ID cards with his name on them along with some cash. Joining me now is that hiker. He's Preston Morrow. He's a manager at a sporting goods store near Mammoth Lakes. Preston, welcome to Day to Day. Set the scene for us. What's the terrain like where you were hiking? Mr. PRESTON MORROW: It's real rough terrain. I started on a trail to get to the area where I was going to go find some mines. It was getting late in that part of the day, so I knew I didn't have time to get to the mines, my original goal, and get back to the car before dark.  CHADWICK: Preston, this is Monday afternoon when you make this discovery, yes?  Mr. MORROW: Correct, yes.  CHADWICK: And what you find are these ID cards and some money. Were they in a wallet or just lying open or what?  Mr. MORROW: Yes, it was just - there were some trees around there, and I noticed in the pine needles in the dirt, there are these ID cards. And then underneath them was some dirty old hundred dollar bill that was pulled in half, all dirty and kind of weathered or quite weathered. And I went, oh my gosh, that's kind of crazy. (Soundbite of laughter)  CHADWICK: You saw Steve Fosset's name. You must have known who he was.  Mr. MORROW: Well, I do know who he was, but the name just didn't register in my head at that time. It didn't. I was in a hurry. I didn't look at the name and go hmm hmm hmm hmm. I grabbed all the IDs and the money and was thinking, this is kind of strange. I'm looking for a wallet. I'm looking for a bag because my logic, which makes sense around here, is a bear or an animal had grabbed this from a backpacker and dragged it somewhere to search for food. And that might have happened in this case also. An animal found this stuff in something cans or something and, I'll guess here, dragged it somewhere to look for food. I don't know.  CHADWICK: You get down from the mountain and what happens? How do you figure out, hey, wait a minute. This is Steve Fosset, the famous explorer who disappeared? Mr. MORROW: It was the next morning, actually. I went to work the next morning, and I said this is kind of strange, this name. And I showed this guy, and he's like, hey, that's that man in the news. There was three of us, and it took us about within a minute or two, Fosset, that's the guy, the missing pilot. So that morning, Tuesday morning, was when we realized what I have found.  CHADWICK: So what did you do? Call the sheriff, go back up there and look for the plane, or what? Mr. MORROW: Right. What we did was, there was a group that went up Tuesday, not to search exactly for the plane because we all knew it was difficult. I went to show them where I was and get a GPS coordinate. So I brought my wife, so we got the coordinates of close to where I was. I even had a hard time finding where I was again. And then, first thing Wednesday morning, I went to the authorities with the IDs, with the money, and with the map with the GPS coordinates on it and said, here, you all, this is what I found. This is where I was. I hope this helps you guys find what we guess is going to be the plane wreckage. CHADWICK: Well, you know, they subsequently found that plane wreckage. They positively said, this is the identification number. This is it. This is. . . Mr. MORROW: Yes. I'm very very happy I - yesterday was crazy with people just asking me about my story, as I just told. That's OK. But today, at the end of the day yesterday and today, I wanted to say, gee, they found something. And whether you know or not, it took all day Wednesday with a plane or two and lots of people on the ground, and it still took them to the end almost night to find the wreckage.  CHADWICK: This is a place that, according to the searchers, they had flown over this exact area almost 20 times looking for this plane wreckage. This is about 90 miles from the ranch in Nevada where Steve Fosset took off to go on this flight. So I guess it must be extremely rugged country if they've flown over it almost 20 times and still didn't see the wreckage.  Mr. MORROW: It was hard to find, yes.  CHADWICK: You must be a very experienced hiker to go out in that area. Now, you're going to be known ever more as the guy who found Steve Fosset.  Mr. MORROW: I guess so. I guess so. A little crazy for me.  CHADWICK: Preston Morrow, speaking with us from Mammoth Lakes, California, where he found the information that led to the discovery of Steve Fosset's missing plane. Preston, thank you and congratulations.  Mr. MORROW: Thank you.   ALEX CHADWICK, host:  There's a big development in the disappearance a year ago of the 63-year-old adventurer, Steve Fosset. Rescue crews have found the wreckage of a small plane near Mammoth Lakes, California. Officials confirm it's the same one he was flying. They have not found his body. Here's Madera County sheriff John Anderson speaking to reporters this morning.  Sheriff JOHN ANDERSON (Madera County, California): It appeared to me just looking at the pictures that it was a head on crash into the side of a mountain, into a rock. The plane moved up, in an upward direction for 100 feet or so and disintegrated.  CHADWICK: The search for Steve Fosset's plane began again after a hiker found ID cards with his name on them along with some cash. Joining me now is that hiker. He's Preston Morrow. He's a manager at a sporting goods store near Mammoth Lakes. Preston, welcome to Day to Day. Set the scene for us. What's the terrain like where you were hiking?  Mr. PRESTON MORROW: It's real rough terrain. I started on a trail to get to the area where I was going to go find some mines. It was getting late in that part of the day, so I knew I didn't have time to get to the mines, my original goal, and get back to the car before dark.   CHADWICK: Preston, this is Monday afternoon when you make this discovery, yes?   Mr. MORROW: Correct, yes.   CHADWICK: And what you find are these ID cards and some money. Were they in a wallet or just lying open or what?   Mr. MORROW: Yes, it was just - there were some trees around there, and I noticed in the pine needles in the dirt, there are these ID cards. And then underneath them was some dirty old hundred dollar bill that was pulled in half, all dirty and kind of weathered or quite weathered. And I went, oh my gosh, that's kind of crazy.  (Soundbite of laughter)   CHADWICK: You saw Steve Fosset's name. You must have known who he was.   Mr. MORROW: Well, I do know who he was, but the name just didn't register in my head at that time. It didn't. I was in a hurry. I didn't look at the name and go hmm hmm hmm hmm. I grabbed all the IDs and the money and was thinking, this is kind of strange. I'm looking for a wallet. I'm looking for a bag because my logic, which makes sense around here, is a bear or an animal had grabbed this from a backpacker and dragged it somewhere to search for food. And that might have happened in this case also. An animal found this stuff in something cans or something and, I'll guess here, dragged it somewhere to look for food. I don't know.   CHADWICK: You get down from the mountain and what happens? How do you figure out, hey, wait a minute. This is Steve Fosset, the famous explorer who disappeared?  Mr. MORROW: It was the next morning, actually. I went to work the next morning, and I said this is kind of strange, this name. And I showed this guy, and he's like, hey, that's that man in the news. There was three of us, and it took us about within a minute or two, Fosset, that's the guy, the missing pilot. So that morning, Tuesday morning, was when we realized what I have found.   CHADWICK: So what did you do? Call the sheriff, go back up there and look for the plane, or what?  Mr. MORROW: Right. What we did was, there was a group that went up Tuesday, not to search exactly for the plane because we all knew it was difficult. I went to show them where I was and get a GPS coordinate. So I brought my wife, so we got the coordinates of close to where I was. I even had a hard time finding where I was again. And then, first thing Wednesday morning, I went to the authorities with the IDs, with the money, and with the map with the GPS coordinates on it and said, here, you all, this is what I found. This is where I was. I hope this helps you guys find what we guess is going to be the plane wreckage.  CHADWICK: Well, you know, they subsequently found that plane wreckage. They positively said, this is the identification number. This is it. This is. . .  Mr. MORROW: Yes. I'm very very happy I - yesterday was crazy with people just asking me about my story, as I just told. That's OK. But today, at the end of the day yesterday and today, I wanted to say, gee, they found something. And whether you know or not, it took all day Wednesday with a plane or two and lots of people on the ground, and it still took them to the end almost night to find the wreckage.   CHADWICK: This is a place that, according to the searchers, they had flown over this exact area almost 20 times looking for this plane wreckage. This is about 90 miles from the ranch in Nevada where Steve Fosset took off to go on this flight. So I guess it must be extremely rugged country if they've flown over it almost 20 times and still didn't see the wreckage.   Mr. MORROW: It was hard to find, yes.   CHADWICK: You must be a very experienced hiker to go out in that area. Now, you're going to be known ever more as the guy who found Steve Fosset.   Mr. MORROW: I guess so. I guess so. A little crazy for me.   CHADWICK: Preston Morrow, speaking with us from Mammoth Lakes, California, where he found the information that led to the discovery of Steve Fosset's missing plane. Preston, thank you and congratulations.   Mr. MORROW: Thank you.  ", "section": "News", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2008 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The reports says the governor and her husband used their influence to try to settle a grudge against the governor's ex-brother-in-law. NPR's Martin Kaste has been following this story. Martin, thanks for being with us. MARTIN KASTE: Sure. SIMON: And what exactly is Governor Palin supposed to have done in the view of this investigator? KASTE: Well, this is about her sister's ex-husband, a gentleman named Mike Wooten, who's a state trooper in Alaska, and it's about a campaign to have him fired, basically by the Palin's. Todd Palin, the governor's husband, repeatedly contacted officials both on Palin's staff and elsewhere in state government, calling to their attention what he saw as this trooper's shortcomings as a state trooper. There were some - definitely some severe cases of misconduct on the job and that sort of thing, and so there were multiple contacts by Todd Palin with the staffers on the issue of this man's employment. And that, the investigator says, crossed the line. That the governor knew that her husband was doing this, did nothing to stop it. And what that essentially amounted to, said this investigator, is that the governor and her husband were using their office to - for personal benefit, to settle a personal matter. And he finds that that's a violation of an ethics law in Alaska that prevents the governor from using her office for personal matters. SIMON: But there were charges of misconduct against the trooper? KASTE: No doubt about it, but the thing is, the folks investigating this looked into that, and he had been sanctioned by the state in those cases, and the Palin's just kept pressing on these issues. SIMON: And who's this investigator? KASTE: His name is Steve Branchflower, and he was hired by the state legislature before Governor Palin had been picked as candidate for vice president. He's a retired prosecutor. He is believed to be, actually, pretty conservative personally, although he has really tried to stay out of the partisan aspect of all of this. So he was hired to handle this. He was basically hired as a contractor, and then as he was getting ready to investigate this, she was picked for vice president by the McCain people. And the temperature on what was a parochial investigation into a personnel matter just ballooned into, as you can imagine, a huge political push-pull over what effect this would have on the presidential race. SIMON: And at least what effect has it had so far, as you have been able to observe it, on the McCain campaign? KASTE: Well, the McCain campaign, of course, immediately - understands why, you know, flew people to Anchorage in September to push back a little bit on this investigation to discredit it ahead of time. They've been holding constant press conferences, pointing out what they see as conflicts of interest. They point out repeatedly the fact that the state senator managing this investigation is a Democrat, an Obama supporter. The Democrats say, well, yes, but he's not conducting the investigation. He's just the manager of the investigation. And there is a real sort of fight over the perception of conflict of interest in this investigation. It has to be pointed out that the legislative council, which is sort of a joint House-Senate body that conducts some of these affairs in the state legislature during the off season, so to speak, when they are not in session, they're the ones who authorized this investigation back in July, and they are a bipartisan body. And in fact, Republicans are the majority on that council. And the fact that they continued with the investigation and actually voted unanimously to release the report yesterday says something perhaps about Governor Palin's sort of prickly relationship with Republicans in her own party in Alaska. SIMON: Which is sometimes also cited as one of her assets in public life, that. . . KASTE: No doubt about it, but the fact is the state Republicans did not shut this down, and they had the opportunity to do so.  SIMON: But no legal consequences for the Governor, as I understand it. KASTE: This is like a Congressional hearing. This is an investigation into - to clarify something, but this does not lead necessarily to any kind of legal consequence for the governor.

It's our Thursday international briefing. Coming up, investing in Liberia's future. A conversation with American businessman Bob Johnson about a new venture to strengthen ties between the U. S. and Liberia.  But first, we note that tomorrow is United Nations Day. It's a day that commemorates the establishment of the UN Charter in 1945. And to mark that, we bring you a newsmaker conversation with one of the organization's leaders. Ms. NAVANETHEM PILLAY (United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights): I grew up as a second-class citizen with no legal recourse. In my lifetime, however, I had the privilege to witness a complete transformation. MARTIN: Navanethem Pillay is the newly appointed United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. It's one of the international organization's most visible and controversial positions. Before her term began September 1st, Commissioner Pillay's life story and career are the stuff of which films are made. A South African of Indian heritage, she grew up and began her human rights work during the apartheid era. She's a lawyer and served as a judge on both the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and on the International Criminal Court at the Hague. Her task now is to improve conditions for human rights around the world. We welcome Navanethem Pillay to our program. Thank you so much for joining us. Ms. PILLAY: Thank you very much, Michel. I'm happy to be here. MARTIN: What does the term human rights encompass now as defined by or agreed on by the international community? Ms. PILLAY: The human rights are rights that are the rights of every human being by virtue of a person being a human being. And the recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world. And a comprehensive vision of the body of human rights is set out in the United Nations Universal Declaration. And for me, that declaration is a beacon of hope for the future because it contemplates a world with full realization of all rights for all people: civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, without distinction. A world in which every man, woman and child lives in dignity, free from hunger, and a world without violence and discrimination, with the benefits of housing, health care, education and opportunity. So you will see this vision represents a global culture of human rights, and it should be a unifying force within and among all cultures. MARTIN: Speaking globally, of course, what do you consider to be the most pressing challenges to that vision of global improvement in human rights right now? Ms. PILLAY: The pressing challenges are - we have the right language. We have the rhetoric. We do not have implementation of these principles in almost every part of the world. Every country, for instance, has problems of domestic violence. Every country has problems of discrimination on racial grounds, and in some parts of the world more acutely discrimination on religious grounds. So the problem that faces us 60 years after the Universal Declaration is how best to have these principles implemented. MARTIN: Often on this program, we talk about issues of race and racism both nationally and internationally. You've called for a conference in April of next year on racism and xenophobia. What do you hope to accomplish there? Ms. PILLAY: This conference in April is a review conference of a conference held seven years ago in Durban on racism, xenophobia and all kinds of intolerance. And so the United Nations General Assembly ordered a review of that conference in order to assess how and whether states are implementing the consensus that was reached there on what the goals are and what the requirements should be to eradicate racism, xenophobia and intolerance. So the purpose of the April conference is for states to review their own records, to review the records of the world and look into compliance of these standards. MARTIN: And of course, that conference, that summit in 2001, was very controversial. The U. S. and Israel walked out, saying that it had become a forum for anti-Semitism. There was a heated discussion of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Obviously, the summit would be more effective with the participation of all member nations. How are you trying to ensure that? Ms. PILLAY: I have called for participation by all states because it's when you participate that your voice is heard. Whatever your opinion, you state it there. And the U. S. , mind you, is not without race problems. In fact, much more so in other parts of the world. My country has come out of apartheid. And so every country needs to participate because we want to achieve common standards, common consensus and common guidelines on the kind of laws we should pass, the kind of training our police and law enforcement officers should receive.  These are all for the good, and I think that's a good document that emerged from the Durban conference, which, mind you, was controversial because there was a small minority in the NGO forum which was outside the main conference, which became rather rabid and vigilant in anti-Semitic statements. And that hurt and upset many people. But in my view, it's not a cause for a responsible government to walk out of a meeting or to announce that it will not follow up - attend the follow-up conference. MARTIN: But do you agree, though, that part of that conference, that even though it was sort of off site, not part of the main conference, did degenerate into a kind of an anti-Semitic forum? Do you think that that is an accurate description of what happened then? Ms. PILLAY: I was not present. They have now - even though it happened in my city. You know, in every conference and meeting you have a small group of whatever persuasion, let's for the moment call them an extreme group, performing in one corner outside the hall. Why would you allow that to affect your view of this conference? The Durban conference must be weighed by the outcome document that Mary Robinson achieved, my predecessor. And that is the platform document which was achieved by consensus of all states. So to me, it's a success because if you look at that document, it has provisions that you and I and all your listeners would go along with. MARTIN: If you're just joining us, this is Tell Me More from NPR News. I'm speaking with Navanethem Pillay. She's the UN high commissioner for human rights.  Throughout your career, you've also been a strong advocate for the rights of women, for gender equality. Now - but this is an area that's difficult for many people because many people consider abortion rights or reproductive rights critical to gender equality, but there are other people who feel equally strongly that human rights should be extended to the unborn. How do you think about these conflicting and equally strongly held values? Ms. PILLAY: I think that these are controversial and difficult issues, and that's why very few people adopt one or the other point of view. My starting point is to allow women the right of choice so they make a decision about their own bodies. But the role of society, role of governments, is to help them make those choices. For instance, if there is ample provision that a child will be brought up and will have the assistance of the state, that mothers will receive help, you know, you don't have that in many parts of the world. The burden of bringing up children is not - does not receive the same level of focus as the abortion issue. So I think there are many factors that should be taken into account. As the high commissioner for human rights, I respect the different viewpoints on the matter. MARTIN: Can we just talk briefly about you in a minute that we have - the couple of minutes we have left? You grew up in South Africa, as we heard at the beginning of this conversation. You said you grew up as a second-class citizen. When you were growing up, do you think you envisioned the life you have now, the role you have now? Ms. PILLAY: You know, I never, even as an adult, I never thought that apartheid would end. We - it was like a way of life. You knew you could not go into the park. You could not go on the beaches because they were only for white people. You would pause before you entered a lift because even lifts were segregated. So if you grow up with that and you grow up feeling you - there is something wrong with you, you are inferior, even as an adult I never thought that the system would end. And I used to I say, I don't see it changing in my lifetime. So here I am, still living, and I, like many other South Africans, owe the change to the vision of Nelson Mandela who went for compromise and negotiation, you know, words that I scorned as a university student. But in our particular case in South Africa, it helped us to put our past behind and have a new, democratic South Africa. MARTIN: Finally, I'm going to ask you the same question I asked Jane Holl Lute, the new head of the UN Peacebuilding Commission . As you start this very important job, how will you know whether you have succeeded? Ms. PILLAY: Well, it's just six weeks into the job. I'm still learning. I would know that I have succeeded if I have in meaningful ways touched the lives of people on the ground, of victims who are suffering, because that's my role. It is the protection of the rights of victims who are suffering violations. MARTIN: Navanethem Pillay is the UN high commissioner for human rights. She was kind enough to join us from the UN in New York. We do hope you'll come back and speak to us from time to time. Ms. PILLAY: Thank you. I look forward to that, too. MARTIN: Thank you so much for joining us.  MICHEL MARTIN, host:  I'm Michel Martin and this is Tell Me More from NPR News. It's our Thursday international briefing.

So if you grow up with that and you grow up feeling you - there is something wrong with you, you are inferior, even as an adult I never thought that the system would end. And I used to I say, I don't see it changing in my lifetime.  So here I am, still living, and I, like many other South Africans, owe the change to the vision of Nelson Mandela who went for compromise and negotiation, you know, words that I scorned as a university student. But in our particular case in South Africa, it helped us to put our past behind and have a new, democratic South Africa.  MARTIN: Finally, I'm going to ask you the same question I asked Jane Holl Lute, the new head of the UN Peacebuilding Commission . As you start this very important job, how will you know whether you have succeeded?  Ms. PILLAY: Well, it's just six weeks into the job. I'm still learning. I would know that I have succeeded if I have in meaningful ways touched the lives of people on the ground, of victims who are suffering, because that's my role. It is the protection of the rights of victims who are suffering violations.  MARTIN: Navanethem Pillay is the UN high commissioner for human rights. She was kind enough to join us from the UN in New York. We do hope you'll come back and speak to us from time to time.  Ms. PILLAY: Thank you. I look forward to that, too.

It's the part of the program where we speak with distinguished elders from many walks of life hoping they'll share some of their wisdom with us. Today our guest is a civil rights pioneer who, like many Americans, feels a unique sense of pride at this historic moment.  Dr. Dorothy Height began a lifetime of activism during the Great Depression, a time when the simple right to vote free of the fear of violence seemed like an impossible dream for many African-Americans. And at the of 96, she is still going to the office just about every day trying to further the cause of equal rights for all Americans. She's serving as chair and president emerita of the National Council of Negro Women. She was kind enough to receive us at her office on historic Pennsylvania Avenue yesterday. I asked her where she was and what she was doing when she found out that Barack Obama had been elected president. Dr. DOROTHY HEIGHT (President Emerita, National Council of Negro Women): Well, at that time, I happened to be here in this building at the National Council of Negro Women, part of a group gathered under the Coalition for Black Civil Participation, and they had been working all day monitoring and answering calls all across the country if there were any experiences people had that were negative, or if they were discouraged and the like. And then after that we all watched the television and followed it together. And it was very exciting because of the young people, there were older people, there were black and white, but all of them had been working to help secure the vote. You see, we realized we had not only to get the vote but we had to protect the vote. And so that's what they were doing. But I cannot even describe to you what happened when that final word came over. The group just exploded. Everybody was so excited, and it was hard to believe that we all lived through this evening. MARTIN: I wanted to ask you about that because you have been working in this field since you were a very young woman. I mean, really, your entire adult life. Since your early 20s you've been an activist. Did you believe this day would come in your lifetime? Dr. HEIGHT: Well, you know, you had to have faith and had to believe. And I believed that it would come. I knew it would be a long ways over, but I'm so glad I lived to see it. Actually, I got started back when I was in my late teens, and I had moved from Pennsylvania to Harlem and when Ada Mitchell(ph) and I organized a youth committee against lynching and the poll tax(ph). So I've been working on trying to get the votes right since I was about 19.  And I think having the experience working also in the civil rights movement, where so much of our time was focused on just getting the right to vote, and then last night, to be able to witness people exercising that vote at the level they did was very, very exciting. MARTIN: The fact is, we did speak to some people who've been in the trenches with you. For example - I don't think it's wrong to call his name - Ambassador Andy Young. Dr. HEIGHT: Yeah. MARTIN: On our program we talked about this issue a couple of months ago, and he said, look, I just don't believe it's going to happen. I just don't believe the country is ready. He all but implied that the vote would be stolen. He almost said it. Dr. HEIGHT: Well, you know, I guess I got to - my faith was renewed working for 33 years with the YWCA of the United States. And I went there as a secretary or a staffer or something related to interracial education. After 33 years, I retired as a director of the Center for Racial Justice, and I split(ph) this an organization, that from 1946 really set out to open its services to all women, regardless of race or with full regard for race, and so I saw the way an organization that was founded by white, Protestant women that now is very inclusive, and I was a part of that development. When the YWCA in 1946 adopted an interracial charter, that was ahead of the Supreme Court's decision on Brown versus the Board of Education, so that in a sense I had already the experience. And I listened to people when they kept saying - well, some people, particularly white people, will say this but they won't go in. I also know that I worked with many white women who took a strong stand but they didn't discuss it at home because their husbands didn't agree with them, but they worked hard to see that the YWCA was integrated, as they called it. And today, the YWCA has Empower Women and Eliminate Racism as its slogan. And I think that made me know that there are many people who know that this is right to do and that they were willing to do it, but they didn't necessarily announce it. MARTIN: I remember that, reading in your memoir how your organization, the YWCA, was one of the first - and some precursor organizations were among the first to have integrated meetings, and how dangerous it was for some of these women to participate. Dr. HEIGHT: At that time there were - when we had meetings, sometimes we were talking about the klan. Sometimes we found that we were denied services that we had been promised when they realized fully what it meant that we would be women of different races. But you know, I found that were strong women in all racial groups, and I think that's what Barack Obama has shown us. There are people in every group who know what is right and who want to move, and they just need some kind of direction and some kind of feeling that other people are with them. I remember Dr. Mayo(ph) saying, I hear people say the time isn't right. And he said, but if it isn't right then it's your job to ripen the time, and that's the way I feel about it. MARTIN: We're going to take a short break, and when we return we're going to continue our conversation with Dr. Dorothy Height. That's coming up next on Tell Me More from NPR News. I'm Michel Martin. (Soundbite of music) MARTIN: I'm Michel Martin, and this is Tell Me More from NPR News. Coming up, educator and activist Geoffrey Canada tells us what he believes. It's the latest in our This I Believe essay series. But we're going to continue now our special Wisdom Watch conversation with Dorothy Height, chair and president emirita of The National Council of Negro Women. We're visiting with her at her offices in Washington, D. C. We're talking about President-elect Barack Obama's historic win.   Dr. Height, I want to talk with you about the earlier dynamic in the course of the election, between first Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama for the White House, and then this whole question of Sarah Palin on the Republican ticket. There are a lot of people who are proud of Barack Obama, but they still feel that there is an element of sexism that's affecting the chances of women to take full leadership. What's your take on that? Dr. HEIGHT: Well, I agree that's true. I still think it is. As you recall, I was a part of the strategy group in the civil rights movement, which even the press called The Big Six. And I always laughed because I said, I think since I was the one woman in the group, they didn't count me, so that's how it got to be six, because actually we were seven. And I think that there is a kind of way that we cannot deny the sexism, and I was very proud that Hillary Clinton would step up. I've known her 30 years, and that she would step up and she would open the way. And I think the way this thing has gone seems to me almost to be providential because there's no way now that we cannot recognize that there are strong women who have the capacity. Other countries - Liberia, Israel, England - so many countries had women leaders, and I think that we have to look at that because yes, there's an element of sexism and that we have to work at it. And I'm so glad that things are working this way because I think Obama will be an example to the whole world. MARTIN: Was there ever any feeling of one group rising at the expense of another? I mean, we were there in Denver, as were you, at the Democratic National Convention. There was a lot of grieving there among many women who had supported Senator Clinton who felt that it was just not fair that someone with her credentials did not prevail in the end, even though there are obviously people - many people very, very proud. There are those who felt that in a way this race pitted two groups who'd been outsiders against each other. Dr. HEIGHT: Well, I think I would take the tip from Hillary Clinton herself. I think the fact that she said to them, I want you to give your full support, and that's what she did for Barack Obama. She gave her full support and she let it be known that way. And I think this is a time when we cannot say which one is hurting the most. We have to take one at a time, and I think here we are, and I think we'll move forward. MARTIN: What about Sarah Palin? Any thoughts? Dr. HEIGHT: I don't know much about her. I didn't have much of a sense of her, but I did know Hillary, and I know the strength that she brings to the whole task. And I think she was a good example for women. MARTIN: What role do you think civil rights organizations have now? Dr. HEIGHT: Well, there's still a lot of unfinished business. Right now you have going across the country a whole effort to destroy affirmative action. In other words, we're finding that people are using civil rights in a negative way, and they're calling it, this is a civil right. In a sense, these bills that are being introduced are really anti-civil rights, and they just use the term civil right in order to fool people and make them vote. MARTIN: Are you speaking about Ward Connerly and some of his efforts to reverse affirmative action. . . Dr. HEIGHT: Yes, Connerly has gone into several states, and he has does this in a misleading way, and I think people ought to be alert to it and realize that if you vote for what he is talking about, you're cutting back something that got started during the days of Lyndon Johnson and was a part of the whole civil rights effort. It is not a preference. It is a way of saying, those who have been denied should be given an opportunity to be sought in (ph) so they can move ahead. MARTIN: There are those who would argue, though, that - to be blunt about it - that Barack Obama takes these so-called excuses off the table. People look at that, and they say, look at Barack Obama in the White House. And they say, what discrimination? What could they possibly - what barriers? Dr. HEIGHT: Yes. I think they will, but I would hope that they would also say to themselves, we need to look at who has the opportunities. We need to look at - Obama himself pointed that to us, that you can't have a flourishing Wall Street and a destroyed Main Street. He could have also said, I'm working for the middle class, but we still have poverty. And we cannot divide up like that. We cannot say who's hurting the most. We have to make sure they be dealing with everyone.  I have been working since my teenage days when I did an oration and won my college scholarship on the Constitution of the United States. I chose the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments. And I looked and realized, here, now, at this age, I'm still working to make the 14th amendment and its promise of equal justice under law, making it real for everybody. That's what you have to do. MARTIN: Is there anything that you fear about an Obama presidency, about having an African-American - the first African-American in the White House? Dr. HEIGHT: I suppose it's not a real fear. It's a hope that we will not take it for granted, that now we have achieved and all of our problems are answered. I think we will (unintelligible), as he did, as he said, I will be president of all the people. And by that he meant that he will work for all of us and that we all have to realize that there is unfinished business in civil rights. It will - we don't need the marches that we had in the past. But we need more consideration in looking at the boardroom tables and at the policies that are going on, looking at what's happening in industry, what's happening in terms of employment opportunities, housing and the like. So that I think it opens up a new way for us to look at our community. And one thing, I go down now to Deep South and Mississippi and places, where during the '60s, we moved with fear. I go down now and people are so welcoming that I forget what part of the country I'm in. And I think the people who are saying, we have no problem, have the biggest problem, that they really need to see how we can all work together and recognize that we need each other and see how we can really make this a society in which a person is judged, as Dr. Hayes(ph) said, on the basis of their character and what they do rather than on color of their skin or the language which they speak or their sexual preference, or any of those things. MARTIN: Since you were a young woman yourself, you've been famous when you work with young people. Do you have any wisdom to share, perhaps, to a young Dorothy Height who might be listening to us? Dr. HEIGHT: I like to say to young people today, you are the beneficiaries of what a lot of people worked and gave their lives for. And you are enjoying things - no matter how bad it may seen, you are still better off than any of those who worked to bring us to this point. And the important thing now is not to go it alone on your own, by yourself, but see how you will join with others. Get organized in how you will serve others and how you will help to move this forward. And I was so excited to hear President-elect Obama, like they call him now, to hear him say that he needed our help. And I think he does. And we need it not by thinking just of what we want, but how can we help achieve the kind of roles that he has said. Because when you do that and we're for something bigger than yourself, there's no way you can help but grow, and that will help to prepare you for the future. MARTIN: And finally, you are famous for your hats - for your fabulous hats. You happen to be wearing a fabulous, purple chapeau with a beautiful bow and even a fetching feather. Do you have something special picked out for the inauguration? Dr. HEIGHT: Well, I don't have, but I have a very (unintelligible) and I will let her know what I plan to wear, and she always comes through. She knows I love hats. I was the last person to give them up when they went out of style, and I was among the first when I picked them up again. When I had some pictures the other day, someone looked at them, she said, were you at a hat on(ph) then? I said, yes, I did. MARTIN: What do you recommend for Michelle Obama? Do you think she should wear a hat to the inauguration? Dr. HEIGHT: Well, she doesn't seem to be a hat person. But I think she looks beautiful, and I'm so glad, and I think it will be a blessing to us to have a woman like her in the White House. I'm so proud of her. MARTIN: Dr. Dorothy Height is the chair and president emerita of the National Council of Negro Women. She's also the chair of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights Executive Committee. She was kind enough to speak with us from her office on historic Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D. C. , just around corner from the White House. Thank you so much for speaking with us. Dr. HEIGHT: Thank you. Thank you, Michel. MARTIN: We've heard from civil rights pioneers Dorothy Height, Myrlie Evers-Williams and the Reverend Jesse Jackson about what Barack Obama's election means to them. Now we want to hear what it means to you. Has this election changed how you view this country? Your neighbors, perhaps, even yourself? To tell us more, please call our comment line at 202-842-3522. Again, that's 202-842-3522, or go the Tell Me More page at npr. org and blog it out.  MICHEL MARTIN, host:  Now it's time for our Wisdom Watch.

She was kind enough to speak with us from her office on historic Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D. C. , just around corner from the White House. Thank you so much for speaking with us.  Dr. HEIGHT: Thank you. Thank you, Michel.  MARTIN: We've heard from civil rights pioneers Dorothy Height, Myrlie Evers-Williams and the Reverend Jesse Jackson about what Barack Obama's election means to them. Now we want to hear what it means to you. Has this election changed how you view this country? Your neighbors, perhaps, even yourself? To tell us more, please call our comment line at 202-842-3522.

We have him on the line. Inspector Hartwell, where are you? Inspector PAUL HARTWELL (County of Los Angeles Fire Department): I am sitting at one of the Los Angeles city parks in the city of Sylmar, El Cariso Park, where the command post is. SEABROOK: Can you see the fire? Inspector HARTWELL: I can see the east side of the fire. So, the fire is burning, from where I'm looking, west towards the city of Santa Clarita. SEABROOK: What does it look like to you? How does it compare to others you've fought? Inspector HARTWELL: Well, from where I'm sitting now, it looks like every other brush fire that happens in the Angeles National Forest, but what we experienced, starting at 10:30 last night, was a whole different animal. I mean, we had wind 70, 80 miles an hour. It was hot. It was dry, and we lost numerous structures just through the night, which is something that doesn't normally happen. We lost upwards of 600 homes last night.  SEABROOK: You're one of a few people who can actually get close to this thing. What is it like? What does it sound like? What does it look like? Inspector HARTWELL: Yeah, that is actually a really good question. You really have to take all parts of your senses when you're fighting one of these fires. It sounds like a freight train. It has that roar to it. Your vision when the winds are blowing this hard is relatively down to zero, where you can't open your eyes. You can feel the heat even if you're a long distance away. You can still feel that reflected heat from the flames.  I mean, I was in my car this morning at two a. m. driving on the 210 freeway, and I could feel the heat through the glass of the windshield. The vision was down to zero. I couldn't see past my hood. And it looks like a lava flow or a waterfall of sparks blowing across the 210 freeway. It was really incredible. SEABROOK: Now if - you are all calling in reinforcements? Inspector HARTWELL: Yes, we are. Currently, right now, actually, at 11:30, we had 1,100 firefighters on scene of the (unintelligible) incident, and we've asked for an additional 700. We've asked for 36 strike teams, and each strike team has five fire engines involved. So, there's five fire engines and then a battalion chief, who drives the Suburban, who is in charge. And we've asked for 36 of those. So, it's about 700 people. SEABROOK: So, Inspector Hartwell, how long have you been out there so far? Inspector HARTWELL: I got here at two this morning. So, I've been going on 12 hours.  SEABROOK: And how long do you expect to stay - stay at the fire? Inspector HARTWELL: There is no end - end date as of right now. We don't know, really. Fires like this that happen all through the fall, you know, through Christmas. The wind is going to dictate how long all of us stay here.  Safety is our priority. No life is worth losing over a structure or a brush. So, they're emphasizing the safety factor. If you do get tired, they do let us go offline, but, you know, we'e got to stay here. This is what we do. This is our job. SEABROOK: Inspector Paul Hartwell, he's an engineer and a public information officer for the County of Los Angeles Fire Department. Thanks very much, sir.

It's a $6 billion global manufacturing company that makes ride control systems such as shock absorbers and struts, and also emission control products. Gregg Sherrill is Tenneco's CEO. I talked with him about the company's announcement last month that it was restructuring and cutting jobs in response to the industry downturn. Mr. GREGG SHERRILL (CEO, Tenneco): The sort of permanent jobs that we had to cut were around 1,100 globally. BLOCK: And how much of your workforce is that? Mr. SHERRILL: We had 22,000 people totally. BLOCK: So if I'm doing the math right, that's about five percent of the permanent staff. Mr. SHERRILL: Yes. It's easily double that that's off work right now with what we call the, you know, the flexing of plant employees that are simply not at work on any given week because our product line is not needed by that particular customer. BLOCK: And you also, I think, had to close a number of facilities? Mr. SHERRILL: Yeah, that's included in that. We are closing four facilities here in North America and restructuring a fifth. BLOCK: Well, how much of this scaling back would you say is directly linked to the problems of the Big Three automakers in Detroit? Mr. SHERRILL: Well, it's really related to the issues we're seeing, you know, industry-wide right now. Certainly, the Big Three, they still make over half the vehicles here in North America. They're major customers of ours. But Toyota is a big customer, Volkswagen's a big customer, Nissan's a big customer, so on and so forth. But the industry problems or the volume problems that have hit, the sales issues that we're seeing, are affecting everyone. BLOCK: What are you hearing from your fellow suppliers when you talk informally? What else - what are they saying to you? Mr. SHERRILL: Well, the biggest concern we have - I mean, we're really seeing an unprecedented situation, easily since World War II, in the automotive industry. The main problem is the credit issue that hit with the whole Wall Street crisis, really since mid-September. And it did two things to the automotive industry. It just wrecked consumer confidence. And of course the big-ticket items are the things you're going to pull back on the first. And a car is certainly in that category.  And secondly, it created a huge problem for businesses to access credit. And the immediate concerns that we have are really more related to that. And that's why we see that there ought to be some sort of bridging loan to help, you know, some of these carmakers get through this immediate crisis that they certainly didn't cause and they're now very much, you know, a victim of, that I've just described. BLOCK: You're saying that the automakers didn't cause this problem. But certainly on Capitol Hill, we've heard a lot of voices this week saying, you know, companies, you are partly responsible for what's going on. Top management is to blame. Poor operations are to blame. And what we need is not a bailout or a bridge loan, it's a complete overhaul of the industry. Mr. SHERRILL: And I understand that that's a lot of the rhetoric that we've been hearing, but I think, certainly, you know, decisions that have been made, contracts that have been signed in the past, there's a lot of, you know, blame we could lay everywhere. Yes, they are as involved as anyone in the world in the overall situation in the auto industry. But I don't think, you know, that they can be held responsible for the severity of this economic downturn and how severe it's hitting, you know, the automotive industry in particular.  And when you look at the number of employees, not only at the Detroit Three, but right down through the supply chain, and the effect that it can have on an economy that is already weakened to the degree that it is, I don't think any of us really want to see the results of that. BLOCK: You know, Mr. Sherrill, there was a study by the consultant Grant Thornton that estimated that one-third of auto suppliers are in danger of collapse. That's a really shocking number.

The two New Yorkers who ran the center, Rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg and his wife, Rivka, were among the dead.  The American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee also has an office in Mumbai, and Anthony Korenstein is that group's director for India. He's been in Mumbai throughout this crisis. Thanks for joining us, Mr. Korenstein. Mr. KORENSTEIN (Director, American Joint Jewish Distribution Committee, India): I wish I could say it was my pleasure, but under the circumstances, I'm glad to be able to speak to you from here.  SEABROOK: Tell us, what is the feeling in the Jewish community there today? Mr. KORENSTEIN: Well, the Jewish community is shocked. India is one of the few countries in the world that can boast millennia-old Jewish presence that has existed with virtually no anti-Semitism. So, this is a community that is used to living in harmony with its neighbors and to being part of the rich social fabric that this country represents.  And yet here for the first time is a Jewish institution that is being attacked. You know, this isn't in Europe, and it's not in Latin America. It's not any of the places where, you know, Jews are used to being attacked. But here in India and for the Jewish community, this is really a shocking event. SEABROOK: Mr. Korestein, I don't think it's presumptuous to say that most Americans know very little about the Jewish community in India or even that there is one. Mr. KORENSTEIN: The local Jewish community is really very ancient. It's thousands of years old, and it's centered today mostly in Mumbai. In the Mumbai area, there are 4,500 Jews here. So yes, there is a Jewish community here in India that has existed far from the other centers of Jewish life and has developed a very unique character. SEABROOK: You live in Israel, is that correct? Mr. KORENSTEIN: Yes, that's correct. SEABROOK: You were just visiting India this week, but you knew Rabbi Holtzberg and his wife. Mr. KORENSTEIN: Yes, I did. I come here, oh, for a week or 10 days every couple of months to oversee the work our organization does. And often, when I would come, I would spend time with Rabbi Holtzberg and his wife at the Chabad center.  Like many other western visitors who would come here, there was a very sort of warm and respectful relationship between our two organizations, even though their focus here in India was more on helping the Israeli travelers and other foreign visitors, and our focus is much more on the local Jewish community. SEABROOK: What can you tell us about them, the - Rabbi Holtzberg and his wife? Mr. KORENSTEIN: Well, I think - you know, well, one thing I didn't- that didn't really sink in for me until this whole instance broke and I started reading - would become their obituaries. But here are a couple who are 29 and 28 respectively, very, very young people, who came from thousands of miles away and for all intents and purposes settled here indefinitely, and their purpose was to help provide a home away from home, a Jewish presence, a feeling of Jewish warmth to visitors and others who would find themselves in Mumbai, and that they were able to accomplish this in the few short years they were here is really, really remarkable.  It's all too common to speak of the dead in glowing terms. I think what really says it all about Rabbi Gavriel and Rivka Holtzberg was that they were a couple of whom people spoke glowingly when they were alive. They'll be missed. SEABROOK: I understand they had a little boy? Mr. KORENSTEIN: They did. They had a little boy who, thank goodness, was saved by the nanny and is now, I understand, with his grandparents.

Man Fights For Bible Verse Vanity Plate In Court : NPR", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2008/12/09/98013295/vt-man-fights-for-bible-verse-vanity-plate-in-court", "author": "No author found", "published_date": "2008-12-09", "content": "ALEX COHEN, host: Back now with Day to Day. The English write sonnets, the Japanese, haiku. Americans have their own form of abbreviated poetry - the personalized license plate. Up to seven letters or numbers to say almost anything you want. Those limits are being tested now in federal court by a Vermont man who tried to write a six-character ode to Jesus on his plate. NPR's Robert Smith has more. ROBERT SMITH: Shawn Byrne is a used car dealer in West Rutland, Vermont, a born-again Christian, the proud owner of a vintage F100 Ford pickup truck. He even had an idea for a perfect license plate, JN36TN. For those of you not biblically inclined, JN36TN is John 3:16, \"For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten son. \" It's a favorite verse for evangelical Christians. You may have seen the guys in rainbow wigs at sporting events waving the big John 3:16 banners. But Byrne's lawyer, Jeremy Tedesco, says the license plate request was innocent. Mr. JEREMY TEDESCO (Attorney, Alliance Defense Fund): There's no proselytizing here. It's straight up religious speech. It's a reference to the Bible. People are allowed to reference almost anything they want on a vanity plate, even literature. He just wants a reference to religious literature, to his favorite Bible verse, and the state's saying no. SMITH: All states ban profanity and vulgarity on their license plates. But in polite Vermont, the law goes even further. Vermont bans all those subjects you aren't supposed to discuss at the dinner table. Ms. EVE JACOBS-CARNAHAN (Assistant Attorney General, Vermont): Political affiliation, religion, race, illicit drugs, sexual references, a variety of things. SMITH: Eve Jacobs-Carnahan is with the attorney general's office in Vermont. A license plate, she says, is not a bumper sticker. It's state property. Ms. JACOBS-CARNAHAN: People would look at it and say, the state office let that go on a license plate? SMITH: So how do clerks at the DMV make that decision without discriminating against particular points of view? That's the question that the two lawyers argued before the second circuit court of appeals yesterday. The lawyer for the 3:16 guy, Tedesco, read out to the court a list of controversial license plates that Vermont does allow. Mr. TEDESCO: Tree-hugger, earth first, anarchy, ACLU1, pro-nuke, pro-life - these are all Vermont license plates. There's also a lot of religious plates like Noah ark and Buddha. SMITH: The state of Vermont conceded that some of those slipped through the cracks. But it shows how hard it is to make a judgment call if something has a controversial meaning or not. If Shawn Byrne had a son named Jonathan born on March 16th, then John 3:16 might have made it through.  As the court of appeals considers the case, they'll have a lot of license plate case law to consider. Just about every state has had a similar fight. Stefan Lonce is the author of a forthcoming book about personalized plates called \"License to Roam. \" Mr. STEFAN LONCE (Author, \"License to Roam: Vanity Plates and the GR8 Stories They Tell\"): There was a God is good plate in Virginia. There's an Aryan1, which was in Missouri. There's another one from Vermont - S-H-T-H-P-N-S. SMITH: Well, yeah, stuff does happen. But the owner of that last one said it could mean shout happiness. It's been such a hassle for bureaucrats that at least one state, South Dakota, considered banning personal license plates altogether. But the public said N-O W-A-Y. Robert Smith, NPR News, New York.

NPR's Robert Smith has more.  ROBERT SMITH: Shawn Byrne is a used car dealer in West Rutland, Vermont, a born-again Christian, the proud owner of a vintage F100 Ford pickup truck. He even had an idea for a perfect license plate, JN36TN. For those of you not biblically inclined, JN36TN is John 3:16, \"For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten son. \" It's a favorite verse for evangelical Christians. You may have seen the guys in rainbow wigs at sporting events waving the big John 3:16 banners. But Byrne's lawyer, Jeremy Tedesco, says the license plate request was innocent.  Mr. JEREMY TEDESCO (Attorney, Alliance Defense Fund): There's no proselytizing here. It's straight up religious speech. It's a reference to the Bible. People are allowed to reference almost anything they want on a vanity plate, even literature. He just wants a reference to religious literature, to his favorite Bible verse, and the state's saying no.  SMITH: All states ban profanity and vulgarity on their license plates. But in polite Vermont, the law goes even further. Vermont bans all those subjects you aren't supposed to discuss at the dinner table.  Ms. EVE JACOBS-CARNAHAN (Assistant Attorney General, Vermont): Political affiliation, religion, race, illicit drugs, sexual references, a variety of things.  SMITH: Eve Jacobs-Carnahan is with the attorney general's office in Vermont. A license plate, she says, is not a bumper sticker. It's state property.  Ms. JACOBS-CARNAHAN: People would look at it and say, the state office let that go on a license plate?  SMITH: So how do clerks at the DMV make that decision without discriminating against particular points of view? That's the question that the two lawyers argued before the second circuit court of appeals yesterday. The lawyer for the 3:16 guy, Tedesco, read out to the court a list of controversial license plates that Vermont does allow.  Mr. TEDESCO: Tree-hugger, earth first, anarchy, ACLU1, pro-nuke, pro-life - these are all Vermont license plates. There's also a lot of religious plates like Noah ark and Buddha.  SMITH: The state of Vermont conceded that some of those slipped through the cracks. But it shows how hard it is to make a judgment call if something has a controversial meaning or not. If Shawn Byrne had a son named Jonathan born on March 16th, then John 3:16 might have made it through.   As the court of appeals considers the case, they'll have a lot of license plate case law to consider. Just about every state has had a similar fight. Stefan Lonce is the author of a forthcoming book about personalized plates called \"License to Roam. \"  Mr. STEFAN LONCE (Author, \"License to Roam: Vanity Plates and the GR8 Stories They Tell\"): There was a God is good plate in Virginia. There's an Aryan1, which was in Missouri. There's another one from Vermont - S-H-T-H-P-N-S.  SMITH: Well, yeah, stuff does happen. But the owner of that last one said it could mean shout happiness. It's been such a hassle for bureaucrats that at least one state, South Dakota, considered banning personal license plates altogether. But the public said N-O W-A-Y. Robert Smith, NPR News, New York.
