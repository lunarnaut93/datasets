Software developer Tami Reiss has one for you. In 2016, she wants you to think about how you write, especially if you're a woman. Her mission is to get women avoid using words like sorry, as in sorry to bother you or just, as in I was just reaching out because - you get the picture. TAMI REISS: We edit ourselves out and we minimize ourselves. And these qualifiers we do because we're afraid of coming off as too strong when in reality, by adding them, in we're making ourselves come off as weak. CORNISH: To help people stop using these words, Reiss' company, Cyrus Innovation, launched a plug-in that works on Gmail. It's called Just Not Sorry. It underlines such qualifiers so you can think twice about using them. It came out this week and already has about 15,000 users. Tami Reiss got the idea after watching Comedy Central's \"Inside Amy Schumer. \" Here's a sketch from the show about a panel of women - top innovators in their respective fields - who have trouble talking about their work. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"INSIDE AMY SCHUMER\")DOUG MOE: (As Moderator) Do you need some water? MANDY SCHMIEDER: (As Professor Sasha Baron) Yeah, sorry. That'd be great, but if you can't no worries. Don't worry about it. MOE: (As Moderator) No, why don't we just come back to you? SCHMIEDER: (As Professor Sasha Baron) Sorry. MOE: (As Moderator) Amy, can you give us a little background on the research you're involved with? AMY SCHUMER: (As Amy) Absolutely. I - well. . . SCHMIEDER: (Professor Sasha Baron) Oh, thanks so much. SCHUMER: (As Amy) Sorry. SCHMIEDER: (As Professor Sasha Baron) Oh, no, no, I'm sorry. SCHUMER: (As Amy) No, no, no, please - I. . . SCHMIEDER: (As Professor Sasha Baron) I'm so sorry. I just thought that - yeah. CORNISH: Ann Friedman has been thinking a lot about women and language, too. ANN FRIEDMAN: Policing language is sort of like treating a symptom rather than the disease. CORNISH: The New York Magazine columnist has been writing about this topic. FRIEDMAN: Linguists that I interviewed about this said, you know, these words serve a purpose. They're not just filler. And so I think that when you look at the ways communication happens in the workplace, this is actually - can be frequently a positive. But because women sometimes have a hard time being taken seriously in this more general way, it becomes easier to focus on language as something that's kind of a quick fix toward being - I don't know - heard more clearly. CORNISH: The take away - don't be sorry for saying you're sorry or for downloading a plug-in to help you stop saying it.

But did you know that January is also the busiest month for new sign-ups on online dating sites? According to match. com and plentyoffish. com - two popular sites - today, January 3, is the busiest day of the year for new sign-ups on their sites. But our next guest decided to take things in a different direction altogether. She decided to quit using all of her dating apps for three months and meet her dates the old-fashioned way - in person - what a thought. Lisa Bonos writes and edits pieces about the single life for the Solo-ish blog in The Washington Post, which recently published a piece about her going without dating apps. And she's here to talk with us about it, too. Lisa, welcome - happy New Year to you. LISA BONOS: Happy New Year to you, Michel. MARTIN: First of all, I have to be your old-fashioned friend and say I had no idea there were so many dating apps. BONOS: There are a lot, and I was on. . . MARTIN: How many were you on? BONOS: . . . Five or six of them. I mean, part of that is I have to test new ones out for my job, right? MARTIN: OK, sure. . . BONOS: It's. . . MARTIN: . . . It's your job. BONOS: . . . For work. But there are even more. MARTIN: Bumble, Hinge, Happn, JSwipe, Tinder - one, two, three, four - you were on five of these things? BONOS: Yeah, I was on five but probably Bumble and Hinge were the ones I was using the most. MARTIN: I guess the first revelation for me, these online apps are really important to your dating life. BONOS: If you want to be meeting people and going on dates on a regular basis, yes, it's important. I think if you want to go on one date a week, you are going to have to enlist the Internet or all of your friends to set you up. MARTIN: So why did you decide to delete your apps? BONOS: I was out with a bunch of friends on a Friday night. And a friend of mine looked at me - I was showing people about all the apps, right? And she was like you can meet people in person. Why don't you go off of these things and meet people in person? And we were in an environment where there were theoretically a lot of single people, right? We were at a bar on a Friday night in September. And so I thought - like, I looked around - I was like there are people all around; I don't need these apps. And I said yes, I'm going off of these. And I struck up a conversation with someone that night to sort of prove to her that I could talk to people in real life. MARTIN: Were you nervous about it? BONOS: I wasn't nervous about it. At the time, I was pretty tired of online dating, and I needed a break. MARTIN: What was it that was tedious or exhausting about the online - about using all these apps? BONOS: Yeah. MARTIN: And I have to say, I was dating in the pre-app era, and I found it exhausting and tedious, too. . . BONOS: Oh, of course, yes. MARTIN: OK, so. . . BONOS: It can be exhausting and tedious no matter where you're finding your dates. . . MARTIN: But what is it that you found sort of exhausting and tedious about it that you wanted to take a break from? BONOS: Well, there are so many people on these apps, right? So there's all these potential matches, and then once you get a match, you might start a conversation with someone. Some of the apps have time limits to how long - once a match is initiated, you only have 24 hours - I think all of it was starting to make me feel overwhelmed as far as, like, how many people can I fit into my life as potentials, and how many conversations do I want to carry on with strangers because those conversations are not very interesting most of the time. MARTIN: Well, so now that you've had your three-months app fast. . . BONOS: Yes. MARTIN: . . . Say, what's your takeaway? BONOS: The big revelation was that I probably liked them more than I thought I did. Trying to live without them was a little bit like trying to live without the Internet - that most singles now if you're out there dating and you're looking, you're probably going to be looking for dates online. And so to not look online made it feel like I was, like, living without the Internet. But my takeaway from the time away is that I might do it more often - just take a breath when I'm feeling overwhelmed - not say for three months I'm not going to use the apps, but maybe two days or three days. But I think I will probably consciously not rely on them as much. MARTIN: Putting you on the spot here, Lisa. BONOS: Yeah. MARTIN: So are you going back on the apps? BONOS: Of course I'm going back on the apps. (LAUGHTER)BONOS: January 3 is the big day. (LAUGHTER)MARTIN: Lisa Bonos writes and edits the Solo-ish blog for The Washington Post. We're talking about her piece about taking a break from dating apps for the three months. She was kind enough to join us in our Washington, D. C. , studios. Lisa, thank you so much for joining us.

The container is called the MoonArk, and it's part of Google's Lunar X Prize, a competition to send a robot to the moon. WESA's Irina Zhorov has the story from Pittsburgh. IRINA ZHOROV, BYLINE: The Ark is a sort of portrait of humanity, with more than 200 artists and designers contributing. Lowry Burgess is a professor at Carnegie Mellon University and the MoonArk project lead. He holds up one of his contributions, a vile full of red liquid. A drop will go in the ark. LOWRY BURGESS: And this is human blood, and that's all artists' blood. ZHOROV: Thirty-three artists' blood, all mixed together. Some of the artists are pretty famous, he says, but he won't name-drop. He's doing the same thing with a mixture of water from some of the world's rivers. There are hundreds of items in the ark. Burgess says each one is like a word in a poem. BURGESS: A poem is like a bell. Every word in a poem brings rings and makes all the rest of the words ring. So in this, everything that's there is making something else ring. So the totality is meant to hum together. ZHOROV: Yes, this is conceptual art, where the idea is more important than any traditional aesthetic. Or you can think of it as a time capsule with its contents open to interpretation. Burgess sees it as a cultural outpost in space, waiting to be discovered. BURGESS: We're desperately hoping that whoever opens it is perhaps a little more evolved than we are. ZHOROV: Unlike some earlier space art, like the Golden Records on the Voyager craft floating beyond the solar system, the Ark will stay in one place. But Mark Baskinger, one of the artists on the project, says the point is not to conquer. MARK BASKINGER: We think it should be different than sticking a flag in the soil and claiming territory. And maybe we're leaving breadcrumbs for someone else to find their way back here. It's an attempt to communicate forward in time. It's an attempt to communicate outward. ZHOROV: Other artists are just interested in the collaboration. Some don't really care about space or who finds it. Some of the artists are prone to over-intellectualizing, but some will let themselves get a little emotional. Dylan Vitone's contribution includes ordinary text messages between him and his wife. DYLAN VITONE: You know, cynical me is critiquing the way we broadcast our life. The sentimental me is kind of celebrating this thing that's really important for me and trying to give it more meaning than it actually has. ZHOROV: A copy of the Ark will stay here on Earth to be exhibited. In space, weight is money, so the team has had to be innovative with materials. The Ark's four chambers will weigh less than six ounces. I pick up one of the aluminum outer shells. It's so light, it almost feels flimsy, but it's designed to last hundreds of years. BURGESS: It's funny. You touched this, and your fingerprints are on it. Your fingerprints are actually going to go to the moon. ZHOROV: Suddenly, the moon is personal. My fingerprints are just a simpler form of self-expression than the other items on the MoonArk. For NPR News, I'm Irina Zhorov.

Well, get this - humans are still vital for some things, like protecting our water supply. We're about to meet reservoir caretakers. As Colorado Public Radio's Grace Hood reports, some cities and counties employ these workers to live in remote locations and keep a human eye on the water supply. GRACE HOOD, BYLINE: Many people start their work day with a computer login screen. For Doug Billingsley, it begins with a snowmobile ride that feels like a bucking bronco. DOUG BILLINGSLEY: This is where it gets fun. (SOUNDBITE OF REVVING SNOWMOBILE ENGINE)HOOD: Oh. Yeah, that's us falling into a snow bank. But we recover and head in 30-mile-per-hour winds. This is a typical day for Billingsley. By snowmobile, snowshoe or foot, he looks after about a half dozen northern Colorado reservoirs that feed the city of Greeley's water supply. He does it multiple times a week. And he's done the job for two decades. Today, Billingsley digs through snow at Barnes Meadow Reservoir to make sure the water levels are holding steady. Next, it's time to take a look at the nearby dam. BILLINGSLEY: Do I see any bulges? Do I see any rises? Do I see any dips? Anything out of the ordinary because I know what the dam's supposed to look like, summer and winter. HOOD: When it comes to dam safety, human eyes are still one of the best tools to recognize problems. That's according to Bill McCormick, dam safety chief for Colorado. Take for example earthen dams - automated tools monitor water seepage. Small amounts are common. But if new seepage starts in another location, sensors can't catch that problem. BILL MCCORMICK: The caretaker can help see those things, they can determine the appropriate action and they can prevent a small situation like that from ever becoming an emergency. HOOD: Today, water managers have a lot of automated tools to help out. Some, like the Bureau of Reclamation, can even operate dams remotely. But the need for a physical presence at reservoirs remains. Sometimes that's because the equipment is old. MICHAEL ROYCE: It really takes a lot of experience and practice with each valve. HOOD: Michael Royce watches over Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, a key water source for the San Francisco Bay area. Much of the equipment there is from the '20s and '30, when the reservoir was built inside Yosemite National Park. ROYCE: That's one reason why I think a watershed keeper will always be here. HOOD: And it's not just technical know-how. Many caretakers say the job also requires diplomacy and people skills. Royce fields questions about the controversy surrounding Hetch Hetchy Reservoir. Some environmental groups want to remove the dam there. Colorado reservoir caretaker Doug Billingsley checks water levels at a stream near Barnes Meadow Reservoir. For him, the job has become a calling. In order to watch over a reservoir, he didn't evacuate during a significant 2012 wildfire. He stayed put during the 2013 floods to make sure the dams held steady for the city of Greeley, which they did. BILLINGSLEY: They're trusting me to take care of the city's assets. And I'm up here enjoying life. I'm by myself 90 percent of the time. I'm out here in nature. I talk to myself and nobody judges me. It's great. HOOD: Billingsley's job may shift in the coming decades with technology. But many water managers believe the caretaker's role won't disappear completely. That's because some reservoirs are too remote. Also, the demand and importance of water is just too high for there not to be eyes on the ground to make sure water gets to those who need it.

HOOD: Billingsley's job may shift in the coming decades with technology. But many water managers believe the caretaker's role won't disappear completely. That's because some reservoirs are too remote. Also, the demand and importance of water is just too high for there not to be eyes on the ground to make sure water gets to those who need it.

And on the program yesterday, New York City police commissioner Bill Bratton said he liked the proposals. But I asked what impact they would have, and he said minimal. So what's the president actually proposing? Let's listen. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Anybody in the business of selling firearms must get a license and conduct background checks or be subject to criminal prosecutions. (APPLAUSE)GREENE: One thing Obama is doing is expanding background checks to include more guns bought or sold online. And gun control advocates say online sales have given buyers a major loophole. Here's NPR's Joel Rose. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: On any given day, there are tens of thousands of guns for sale online. No one knows exactly how many, but gun-control advocates say this is the big way that guns change hands without background checks. LANAE ERICKSON HATALSKY: You have to go meet them, like you would buy a dresser on Craigslist, and exchange the money. ROSE: I mean, it's basically Craigslist for guns. HATALSKY: It is Craigslist for guns. ROSE: Lanae Erickson Hatalsky is with Third Way, a Washington, D. C. think tank. The group studied the online gun market armslist. com during the summer of 2013. Hatalsky says there are some licensed gun dealers on the site who are required to perform background checks for any guns they sell. But Hatalsky says those commercial dealers are far outnumbered by private sellers. And in most states, those sellers are not obligated to run background checks. HATALSKY: There were people who were selling 20 guns at one particular moment in a state or people who were selling five guns and then the next day would list more. There were a lot of folks who were clearly using this as a source of income and a way to connect frequently with people they wanted to sell guns to. ROSE: The president says he wants to close that loophole by clarifying the existing federal law about who exactly is in the business of selling firearms. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)OBAMA: It doesn't matter whether you're doing it over the Internet or at a gun show. It's not where you do it but what you do. ROSE: The president's order may have limited impact in states that already require background checks for nearly all gun sales. That's the case in New York. But Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance says the White House's actions could help curb the flow of illegal guns into states like his. CYRUS VANCE: In New York state, for example, they are not going to have direct impact in any big sense. But the lax gun control and background checks from other states enables people to buy guns and then bring them to New York. Nine out of 10 guns that are involved in crimes of violence in New York come from out of state. ROSE: Still, gun rights advocates question whether expanded background checks would stop criminals from getting guns. Kim Stolfer is president of the group Firearms Owners Against Crime in Western Pennsylvania. He says the president's order is more likely to hurt law-abiding gun owners. KIM STOLFER: The average person that commits an unofficial violation who decides to buy a gun or to sell a firearm and somebody says to him, oh, yeah, man, you can sell it online. He goes over, and he does it. And it's a sting operation. ROSE: In a statement, the cofounder of armslist. com called the president's action, quote, \"well-meaning but ultimately ineffective,\" unquote. But at least one of the site's users, 26-year-old Kyle Eklund (ph) of Ohio, says he's OK with more background checks. KYLE EKLUND: I think it's crazy that a criminal can reply to an ad on Armslist and say, hey, I'm interested in your gun. And they can walk away with a gun. ROSE: Eklund says Armslist is great. He's bought and sold several guns on the site, always legally, to another Ohio resident face-to-face, but without a background check. EKLUND: I think that there should be a background check on every firearm transfer. And I'm willing to compromise, you know, with people who want more gun control. I'm willing to compromise with them and say, OK, I agree that we should have that. ROSE: The question is whether Washington is willing to make the same compromise. Joel Rose, NPR News, New York.

Back in 2011, a monkey in Indonesia grabbed a camera, aimed it at himself and managed to take his own photos. The selfies of the grinning crested macaque went viral. Because it was the monkey who took the wildly popular pictures, the question became - who owns the photos? - and, more importantly - who gets the royalties? An animal rights group says the monkey does, so they filed a lawsuit on his behalf. And that's how his case ended up in court. ANDREW DHUEY: (Reading) A monkey, an animal rights organization and a primatologist walk into federal court to sue for infringement of the monkey's claimed copyright. What seems like the setup for a punch line is really happening. MCEVERS: That's attorney Andrew Dhuey reading from his motion to dismiss the suit. His client is the photographer who owns the camera that the monkey used to take the selfie. DHUEY: My client is a professional photographer, and he made a lot of artistic choices. And just because the monkey pressed the shutter button doesn't mean the monkey is the author. My client is the author. MCEVERS: Yesterday, a federal judge agreed. He issued a tentative ruling that the monkey cannot own the copyright because - he's a monkey. Dhuey says it wasn't a tough case to win. DHUEY: My tuxedo cats could have won this case. MCEVERS: We were curious about copyright law as it applies to non-humans. So of course we asked our legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg to weigh in on the merits of the case. NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: To put this in terms we all understand - we all love our animals, but I don't think the founding fathers actually thought that the copyright stuff that's in the Constitution, which it is, applied to non-human individuals. MCEVERS: But Nina says the issue over animal rights and legal standing is an interesting one. TOTENBERG: There's some areas of the law where animals do have certain rights. I mean, there have been cases where dogs or animals do inherent, and somebody or some organization is appointed as a guardian for that pet. So there are parts of the law where I suppose you could say that animals have some standing to sue. MCEVERS: Yeah. TOTENBERG: Monkey see, monkey sue. MCEVERS: (Laughter). TOTENBERG: We just had to say it. MCEVERS: PETA, the animal rights group, says they will continue their fight, so we asked the photographer's lawyer if he thinks this case will drag through the courts. DHUEY: I assure you Ms. Totenberg will not be covering this at the Supreme Court. MCEVERS: But if it does, our fearless legal correspondent will bring you the story.

I'm Guy Raz. So think about how you respond to the question, where are you from? Maybe you say Pittsburgh or Sao Paulo or Berlin but probably not the U. S. or Brazil or Germany because cities are often the places we most identify with. And over the next 20 or so years, almost two thirds of us on this planet will live in or around them. Cities are like laboratories, places of experimentation, of possibility. But they're also places with big problems that affect all of us. So on the show today, we're going to explore the big ideas that come out of cities and how those ideas could shape the way our whole world is organized. First up, a story that ends with an idea about improving cities, but it starts in traffic - specifically, traffic in Boston, Mass. , which is where Daniele Quercia had just moved to from London. DANIELE QUERCIA: The big difference between London and Boston was that not many people were biking in Boston. RAZ: This was about five years ago and Daniele was biking. He moved to Boston for a job at MIT. But before that, he had mostly lived in small towns in Europe. And so. . . QUERCIA: I feel that I can move better by bike. RAZ: OK, so once he got to Boston, Daniele did what most of us do when we're in a new place and we need to figure out how to get somewhere. He pulled out his smartphone, he opened up the mapping app and he asked it for the best route. And the mapping app told Daniele that the most efficient way to go, the fastest way, was to take Massachusetts Avenue. QUERCIA: Mass. Ave is a big road with a bridge. There are a lot of cars, right? But, I mean, it was the easiest way, right, in terms of landmarks, in terms of volunteering. . . RAZ: Just the most direct way. QUERCIA: Exactly. RAZ: But not pleasant. QUERCIA: Not pleasant at all. RAZ: Not only were there no bike lanes. . . QUERCIA: Then usually the traffic lights were optimized for car traffic. RAZ: Which made certain intersections hard to cross. QUERCIA: So it was a bit stressful experience to go through that road. RAZ: Daniele was choking on exhaust fumes. He was weaving in and out of traffic. It was fast but not so fun. So after a few weeks of this, he started to think. QUERCIA: Maybe it was not a conscious process. It was more like I got fed up of doing the same. So I just said, no, I'm going to try a different road. RAZ: So one morning, Daniele left his house and he ignored the mapping app. He just stuck to the side streets, the alleys, those little one-way roads that he never really bothered with before. And what happened next, here's Daniele on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)QUERCIA: I just remember a feeling of surprise, surprise at finding a street with no cars as opposed to the nearby Mass. Ave full of cars, surprise at finding a street draped with the leaves and surrounded by trees. For an entire month, I was trapped in my mobile app that a journey to work became one thing only, the shortest path. In this single journey, there was no thought of enjoying the road, no pleasure in connecting with natures, no possibility of looking people in the eyes. And why? Because I was saving a minute out of my commute. RAZ: So - I mean, so that day just, like, going a different way - it just took a few minutes longer - but, I mean, it seems like it changed a whole experience of the city for you. QUERCIA: Yeah, so it totally - it changes the experience because you can look at shops, you can look at little things that make the difference. RAZ: Like the perspective of buildings. QUERCIA: The perspective of buildings and also just the very fact to look at people's eyes, you kind of have that human contact. And as humans, right, we are social animals. And that's what we need. RAZ: Daniele Quercia happens to be a computer scientist. And he uses data to find solutions to the kinds of everyday challenges humans face, things like the best way to get from point A to point B. So after he took that different route on his bike and found a more pleasant way to get to work, Daniele began to wonder how he could maybe use the power of data to focus less on efficiency. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)QUERCIA: Now, let me ask you, how many of you have never used a mapping app for finding directions? Most of you, if not all, have. And don't get me wrong, mapping apps are the greatest game changers for encouraging people to explore the city. You take your phone out and you know immediately where to go. However, the app also assumes there are only a handful of directions to destination. It has the power to make those handful of directions the definitive direction to that destination. Einstein once said logic will get you from A to B. Imagination will take you everywhere. So with a bit of imagination, we needed to understand which parts of the city people find beautiful. Based on that idea, we built a crowdsourcing platform - a web game. Players are shown pairs of urban scenes and they are asked to choose which one is more beautiful, quiet and happy. Based on thousands of user votes, then we are able to see where consensus emerges. We're able to see which are the urban scenes that make people happy. RAZ: And soon after Daniele built that crowdsourcing platform, he and his research colleagues made a web app that would allow users to tag photos of urban scenes around their city as either beautiful or quiet or happy. And they fed that data into a mapping application. And they called the project Happy Maps. QUERCIA: So right now, we have a website where you - in London - where you can put - like, you do in Google maps, you have point A and point B and it's going to give you two options. So one option is the shortest path and the other is the most pleasurable path, right? RAZ: The happy path. QUERCIA: Yes, exactly. RAZ: You know, we hear a lot about, like, smart cities, these places that are designed for ultra-efficiency. But, I mean, why don't people who design those cities, you know, think more about making them enjoyable? QUERCIA: Because of their mindset. They are engineers like I am. And our work, it's all about efficient way of solving problems. So think about the corporate rhetoric behind smart city, right? It's saying, OK, when you go to work, you're always on time. When you go shopping, there is no queue and you know what? You're going to feel really, really safe because of the CCTV cameras around you. RAZ: Yeah. QUERCIA: Now, efficiency, security, they're important and they make a city acceptable, but they don't make a city great. In reality, what we need to maximize is not efficiency but we need to maximize experience of people and ultimately well-being. RAZ: Daniele Quercia now lives in Cambridge, England where he runs the social dynamics team at Bell Labs. You can check out his TED Talk at ted. com. And you can also find out more info there about his Happy Maps project and others. QUERCIA: Right now, we are working on a project that's called Smelly Maps. RAZ: As an smell, the smelly parts of the city. QUERCIA: Yeah, Smelly Maps where basically we map the entire smellscape (ph) of the city through the pictures that people leave. So you take a picture in the park and then you annotate it with the words violet and rose. RAZ: Smelly Maps, they could be coming soon to a city near you. On the show today, Building Better Cities.

For almost 50 years, tech companies have rolled out their latest toys and more at the event, which wraps today in Las Vegas. But this year, nothing much seems all that new. They've got drones, wearables, robots, connected cars - stuff that's already out there. So how relevant is the show today? NPR's digital culture correspondent Laura Sydell has been covering the Consumer Electronics Show and joins us now. Laura, thanks so much for being with us. LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE: It's my pleasure. SIMON: When Apple wants to dazzle us, they hold their own event. So what keeps a convention like this going? SYDELL: (Laughter) Good question. I think part of it is just that people keep going and showing off products, and it's a place to network. So I think for a lot of the people who go - entrepreneurs and so forth - it's a place they can finally see somebody they've been communicating with overseas. I talked with a CEO of a company that makes cameras for mobile devices, Lee Hen Chen (ph), and she said, you know, when she comes, sometimes she bumps into somebody. They come look at her product, and they say maybe we can have a partnership. So you see a lot of that going on. It's also become a much more important place for cars, which are becoming increasingly computerized. SIMON: What makes news for companies if they don't have a gadget to launchSYDELL: Well, the car companies had some news. For example, Ford has a partnership with Amazon that they announced where they're trying to do voice activation. Toyota was there and announced a billion dollars they're putting into self-driving cars, and they're opening up an office in Silicon Valley and near MIT in Boston. So you hear that kind of announcement, but not the big news that you heard in previous years where companies really told you about a new product. SIMON: You covered the beat. What keeps you going there? SYDELL: It's an opportunity to get a hands-on experience with an awful lot of stuff, you know? And, really, you see hints of what the future will be sometimes there. There are incremental changes. You can see where things are going, or it's the first opportunity to get to try a gadget you know is coming out. For example, the Oculus Rift, the virtual reality headset, is going to be coming out on the market. They finally have a consumer version of it. So that's a lot of why I like to go because it's the only place I can try it all in one place, from robots to wearables to everything. SIMON: What did you see this year that bowled you over? SYDELL: A $9 computer. I don't want to say it bowled me over so much as it just showed how cheap computing is getting. But at $9, you can buy this device and it will allow you to hook up to a keyboard and to your television. It has Wi-Fi. It has Bluetooth. And it's open-sourced. It only has a four-gigabyte hard drive, but if you can connect to the Internet, there's still a lot of things you can do on it. I did visit with some robots. (LAUGHTER)SYDELL: And actually a robot danced for me this year. How's that? A dancing robot. It had arms and it could talk to me and say, look, I can dance (laughter). SIMON: Oh, my word, the Fred Astaire of robots - and well? SYDELL: I think its sense of rhythm was a little off, Scott, but it was cute. It looked good. It just didn't do that much other than dance and give you some nice statistics. It still couldn't bring my breakfast to me, you know what I'm saying? SIMON: Oh, oh, yeah. That's the mark of a great robot, right? SYDELL: (Laughter) Yeah. SIMON: NPR's Laura Sydell, thanks so much. SYDELL: You're welcome.

But the Authors Guild, a group which represents the interests of scribblers everywhere, has filed a petition on New Year's Eve asking the Supreme Court to review the latest decision in the Google Books case. It's become harder and harder for writers to earn a living. A lower court has upheld Google's right to add whole volumes to its database without paying fees or getting permission. A few days later, the Guild released an open letter to publishers demanding better contract terms for authors. NPR's Lynn Neary has more on the group's fight to raise the writers' wage. LYNN NEARY, BYLINE: Since 2009, the mean income for writers has gone down 30 percent, says Authors Guild Executive Director Mary Rasenberger. And that, she says, is huge. MARY RASENBERGER: So it's alarming. And incomes are now down to unsustainable levels. And that means that even longtime author, authors who have been writing books for decades, are now being forced to seek other work. So we are looking at this in a holistic way. You know, why is this happening? And what can we do about it? NEARY: The Google Books case, says Rasenberger, addresses the issue of copyright protection. The letter to the publishers takes on standard author contracts. Among other things, the Guild says, its writers should get a higher share of ebook income. And authors should have an option to retain the rights to their own books. The standard contracts the guild is protesting have been part of the business for decades. RASENBERGER: These are the agreements that the un-agented authors see - or those without powerful agents - where the terms tend to be much, much worse. NEARY: Much worse, that is, than the best-selling authors who can set their own terms. And that, says Porter Anderson, is part of the problem the Guild will face in dealing with publishers. Anderson, who writes about the industry for The Bookseller, an online British publication, says writers are not an easy group to organize. PORTER ANDERSON: They're all at very different levels. They have different professional experience. They have different reasons for writing. They have different types of writing. There are factions within factions inside the author cap. NEARY: Writers are also known for working in isolation. But, says Anderson, social media is changing all of that. ANDERSON: Not only are authors able to talk to each other continually in real time, but they're also in touch with their readers. This is new. NEARY: Anderson believes it significant that international writers organizations from Europe, Africa, Australia and Canada signed on to the Authors Guild letter to publishers. ANDERSON: If an international coalition can start communicating to readers all over the world, look what your authors are going through. Did you know this is the experience and the condition in which your favorite author is working? Something has changed. The publishers then are facing a new world in which a lot of questions can be asked in a lot of places in very loud voices. NEARY: The Authors Guild plans to meet with individual publishing companies to discuss their demands. And Mary Rasenberger says. . . RASENBERGER: Do we expect them to turn around tomorrow and create new agreements that meet all of our - all of our requests? Probably not. NEARY: But, she says, they're hopeful.

Writer Sarah Hepola has written a commentary for us about how online dating taught her something she's struggled to do all her life - tell men the truth. SARAH HEPOLA: The first time I told a guy I'd met online that I didn't want to see him again, my hands were actually trembling. I paced the room. I typed sentences only to erase them and retype them again. You'd think I was telling the guy I was pregnant, not passing on his offer to eat homemade linguine. Somehow I'd made it to my late-30s without the ability to tell another human soul I wasn't interested in dating them. I knew how to lie. I'm very busy right now. I'm sick with the flu. Lying had long been my preferred method of getting out of things because it protected people's feelings and allowed me to maintain an illusion of blanket likability. And lying to men had, unfortunately, been a long-standing habit. I have a headache. No, I don't mind if you text during dinner. I'd love to talk about \"Star Wars\" right now. Early in my online dating experience, I told a guy I didn't like that I was too busy to go out with him. And he came back the next week and asked me out again. How dare that man take me at my word. But then I began to think online dating might be a good excuse to start telling uncomfortable truths. Technology, after all, is a tool. We use it, not the other way around. Apparently there are men who can get lucky on Tinder using nothing but emoticons. If this is true, then surely a grown woman can find a way to say she isn't interested. It's not as though men were falling out of the trees to date me. In fact, my awkwardness was a result of being unaccustomed to such attention. I had come of age in bars, where no one asked anything directly until last call. You just got drunk, went back to his place, and maybe a month later you moved in together. Relationships were something that happened to me. But at 35, I had quit drinking, taking a sledgehammer to my most reliable romantic strategy, and thus forcing me to learn a deliberateness to which I was wholly unaccustomed - coffee dates, movie dates, an invitation to enjoy homemade pasta at his place. I had been on two dates with that guy, a lawyer - sweet man, but no spark. Shouldn't I be grateful for a nice lawyer's attention? But chemistry is something you feel, not something you reason your way into. And the lawyer deserved to save his pasta-making skills for someone who genuinely liked him, not someone haunted by voices in her head saying she might die alone. Still, I was scared to hurt him or make him mad. It's crazy the contortions I could put myself through to avoid another person's discomfort. I once read a modern love column in the New York Times about a woman who invented a story that she was moving to California just to avoid sleeping with this one guy again. I got it. At a time when random hookups have never been easier, the act of simple honesty can be so hard. There's a reason ghosting is such a common term in dating these days. Often the cleanest way to end a burgeoning relationship is to disappear - stop responding to emails and texts. But if the Internet makes it easier to disappear on a person, then it must also be pointed out the Internet makes it easier to show up. I typed out a response in the comfort of my kitchen. It took way too long. The email said something hugely unoriginal like, I don't think this is going to work. My stomach plummeted as I hit send. But not long afterward, I got a response back. He understood. He thanked me for letting him know, and that was it? Yes, that was it. I was free. I didn't have to pretend I had moved to another state or that I was dying of mad cow disease. Once I had learned to turn down dates, it became much easier to say yes to them. It was just another human interaction, the act of figuring out what you wanted and what you did not. If I decided not to see someone again, I sent a polite note, and the men were never crushed like I worried they'd be. They almost always wrote back warmly and said, good luck. And we all carried on - one more teensy, tiny step closer to the adults we hoped to be.

No state secrets or classified intelligence went missing. It was his personal email and phone accounts that were hacked by a teenager. The revelation came just months after the CIA director's personal email was also targeted. It got NPR's Mary Louise Kelly wondering who's next. MARY LOUISE KELLY, BYLINE: When you start calling around security experts, asking what they make of the news that the top intelligence official in the country has been hacked, you hear - well, you hear chuckles. AMIT YORAN: (Laughter) Sure. Clearly these types of compromises are an embarrassment. KELLY: That's Amit Yoran. He's former director of cybersecurity for the Department of Homeland Security. As you can hear, he appreciates the irony that the people charged with protecting the nation's cybersecurity can't protect their own. But Yoran, who's now president of the network security company RSA, says on another level, it's no laughing matter. Even if national security weren't compromised, hackers still may have gleaned valuable information. YORAN: So what is the tone in various communications? Who's inside his circle of trust? You know, what are his family interests and things like that which doesn't seem to have a whole lot of, you know, value at its face, but when you dig in, there's actually stuff which can be used down the road. KELLY: Stuff which can be used down the road - that's exactly what CIA Chief John Brennan said he was worried about when his private AOL account was breached last October and details like his wife's Social Security number ended up online. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOHN BRENNAN: I was certainly outraged by it. I certainly was concerned about what people might try to do with that information. KELLY: This prompts the question. Should officials operating at the very highest levels of national security be using private email accounts? Robert Knake was, until last year, the director of cybersecurity policy for the National Security Council at the White House. He argues spy chiefs like Brennan and Clapper don't have much choice. ROBERT KNAKE: If you're a government employee, you're not supposed to be using your DNI or CIA or Department of Homeland Security email address for anything other than business purposes. What it would introduce is a situation in which you would be making government records out of your mortgage statements. KELLY: That's right, mortgage statements, birthday messages to nieces and nephews. Knake points out that senior government officials have personal lives like the rest of us, which means they should try, like the rest of us, to follow the golden rule of the Internet era. Don't type anything you wouldn't want to see on the front page of the newspaper tomorrow. KNAKE: A harder lesson is don't receive anything that you wouldn't want on the front page tomorrow. KELLY: Meaning even if officials practice scrupulous online security - and there's no suggestion that Clapper or Brennan did otherwise - they can't control who emails them. Knake, now at the Council on Foreign Relations, says that's one way cyber intruders can get in. One possible solution - quitting free email providers like Yahoo and Gmail and moving to paid services that use voice or facial recognition. The days of using passwords to protect data may be numbered. But public figures like the head of the CIA will be targets no matter what precautions they take, says Tony Cole. He's the global government chief technology officer at FireEye, a security company. Cole says hackers are always eyeing the next big prize - OK, like who? TONY COLE: I wouldn't be surprised if someone hasn't tried diligently to go after the NSA director and others at that level, maybe in the White House.

MUZIO: Yeah, that moment there. We're in wintry Detroit. It's not completely unlikely that somebody might pull out in front of us. Or there might be a really compelling reason why I need to steer or break with gusto. By the way, just to reiterate the point that my hands are not on the wheel (clapping) - just for effect. GLINTON: I tell you. You know. MUZIO: (Laughter) OK, OK. GLINTON: No clapping, no more clapping. MUZIO: Noted, OK. Yes, sir. GLINTON: Are there downsides to these features that are meant to make us safer? MUZIO: Yeah. I don't want to be overly pessimistic, but I think once drivers are aware that the car will steer itself and, you know, maintain a distance from the vehicle ahead and all that other stuff that we'll expect it to do that.

That sounds like a lot, but not compared to Facebook, which has over 1. 2 billion. And Twitter's user growth has stalled. It may not be a coincidence that CEO Dorsey announced the departures in a longer tweet. Analyst Tim Bajarin says there have been credible rumors that Twitter may expand the length of the tweet to compete with the likes of Facebook. TIM BAJARIN: So one thing that could change their fortune is a loosening of that 140 character restriction. It would make it, I think, more of a social network than it is now as a news network. SYDELL: Though it was the news of four high-level departures that filled up Dorsey's long tweet, the departures include executives in communications, human resources, engineering and the product division.

It's a fight that requires them to reflect on the way they're perceived, even by their families. From member station WNIN in Evansville, Ind. , Paola Marizan reports. PAOLA MARIZAN, BYLINE: Many younger U. S. Muslims say their parents and grandparents have long been reluctant to speak out and risk drawing attention to themselves. Some like Ranny Badreddine want to take a different approach. Tired of being called a terrorist, he joined millennials and other young teens to help create World Changers, an initiative that uses cyberspace to combat misperceptions about Islam. RANNY BADREDDINE: Kids have to be worried about it - like, going outside and being scared that someone's going to beat them up because they're Muslim. As a 13-year-old kid, I don't want to live my life being scared of Americans trying to hurt me because of what I am and my religion. MARIZAN: Other members like Romaze Akhram say this battle for the hearts and minds of Americans is not just about religion. For him, its far more personal. ROMAZE AKHRAM: The problem is, when they talk about Islamic terrorism, people aren't necessarily seeing, like, ISIS and al-Qaida. Like, they're seeing me, and they're seeing, like, the kids that are with us today, you know? And we're working towards positive things, but they're going to see us as Islamic terrorists. MARIZAN: While some antiterrorist experts support the idea of deploying online strategies against ISIS, Muslim activist Humera Khan says religion is not the only or even the main reason driving the atrocities around the world. HUMERA KHAN: I don't think what ISIS is doing is at all Islam. They use some of the language, but their objectives are extremely political. MARIZAN: While that may be true, many American Muslims say they constantly have to deal with a perception that Islam is behind the atrocities. Mohammed Hussain is a pediatrician here in Evansville, and he says this tech-savvy generation is smart enough to use the same online strategies as the radicals. He supports their effort to call out what they see as false Islam. MOHAMMED HUSSAIN: We have all realized ISIS has people who are adept at using the media, and so they have been using it very effectively. So we have to convey the right message in the same matter so that it can get across. MARIZAN: These young American Muslims are joining an ages-old battle over the message of Islam. Seventeen-year-old Hani Yousef says he's often asked if the fight over messaging is a fair one. HANI YOUSEF: I think it might be beyond the point if it's fair or not. The situation is that people are taking the name Islam and using it in a derogatory way, and what's really the problem that we need to focus on is not if it's fair or not but how to combat it in a way that obviously is nonviolent and aligns with the ways of our religion. MARIZAN: The group not only engages by answering questions about Islam online but also works with other nonprofits to organize public forums, and it is committed to countering mistruth about Islam while defending their religion.

Frank Morris of member station KCUR reports on a couple of software developers in Kansas City who've built a robot that can unscramble a Rubik's Cube so fast it's likely to set a world record this week. FRANK MORRIS, BYLINE: In the early '80s, lots of kids, like Paul Rose, had to have one of those colorful, 3-by-3 cube puzzles. PAUL ROSE: I got a Rubik's Cube, and spent a little bit of time trying to figure it out. And after a week or so, put it down because I couldn't get it. MORRIS: No shame there. Heck, it took Erno Rubik more than a month to unscramble his own invention the first time. Will Wooden, a skinny, blond 12-year-old, solves them much faster. WILL WOODEN: We call them speed cubers. Speed cubers are, like, people who solve Rubik's Cubes for a living and can do it, like, really fast. MORRIS: Wooden's sitting in his room in Kansas City at a small table piled with Rubik's Cubes, quickly spinning the one in his hands, completing solve after solve as he talks, and timing the results. WILL: Seventeen seconds, but - I'm not as fast as those other guys, but I'm getting there. I'm getting there. MORRIS: A couple of months ago, 14-year-old from Kentucky broke the record, solving a standard Rubik's Cube in just under five seconds. Paul Rose says a machine made of Lego Mindstorms can do it in three-and-a-quarter. ROSE: I was very impressed that it could be done, but at the same time I thought if they can have a world record with Legos, I bet we can make one faster. MORRIS: By we, Rose means he and his coworker, Jay Flatland. They develop software at a high-speed stock trading company in Kansas City. This is where they've set up their robot, though robot seems a pretty lofty description for this contraption. Little black cameras screwed to two-by-fours point toward a Rubik's Cube. Short plastic arms grip the center block on each side of the cube. Small motor turn the arms. The whole thing's wired to a desktop computer. JAY FLATLAND: OK, 3, 2, 1. ROSE: One point oh-five seconds. FLATLAND: What's the hold up here? ROSE: One point oh-five is great. That's nearly as good as we've gotten without exploding the cube. MORRIS: (Laughter) How close was that cube to blowing up just now? ROSE: I don't know. It was pretty close. MORRIS: Well, not really blow up, but cubes do fly apart, even ones specially built for speed and greased with plenty of cube lube. At the top of this sport the mental work is lightning fast, but physically manipulating the cube slows things down. Flatland says something he acquired this summer got him thinking about speed. FLATLAND: So I bought a 3-D printer and was kind of try to find a project to learn how to use it. And then we came with up this idea of building the Rubik's Cube-solving robot, and it seemed like a perfect fit. MORRIS: It was, because the printer let Flatland quickly build, test and modify parts. The whole project took Rose and Flatland about six months of their spare time. A judge from Guinness will be in town from New York on Friday to oversee the world record attempt. Rose and Flatland hope to solve a cube in under a second, then publish all the specs for the robot to give future record-seekers a head start. For NPR News, I'm Frank Morris in Kansas City. KELLY MCEVERS, HOST:   If you've ever tried to solve a Rubik's Cube, you know how hard it can be to do that, let alone do it fast. Frank Morris of member station KCUR reports on a couple of software developers in Kansas City who've built a robot that can unscramble a Rubik's Cube so fast it's likely to set a world record this week. FRANK MORRIS, BYLINE: In the early '80s, lots of kids, like Paul Rose, had to have one of those colorful, 3-by-3 cube puzzles. PAUL ROSE: I got a Rubik's Cube, and spent a little bit of time trying to figure it out. And after a week or so, put it down because I couldn't get it. MORRIS: No shame there. Heck, it took Erno Rubik more than a month to unscramble his own invention the first time. Will Wooden, a skinny, blond 12-year-old, solves them much faster. WILL WOODEN: We call them speed cubers. Speed cubers are, like, people who solve Rubik's Cubes for a living and can do it, like, really fast. MORRIS: Wooden's sitting in his room in Kansas City at a small table piled with Rubik's Cubes, quickly spinning the one in his hands, completing solve after solve as he talks, and timing the results. WILL: Seventeen seconds, but - I'm not as fast as those other guys, but I'm getting there. I'm getting there. MORRIS: A couple of months ago, 14-year-old from Kentucky broke the record, solving a standard Rubik's Cube in just under five seconds. Paul Rose says a machine made of Lego Mindstorms can do it in three-and-a-quarter. ROSE: I was very impressed that it could be done, but at the same time I thought if they can have a world record with Legos, I bet we can make one faster. MORRIS: By we, Rose means he and his coworker, Jay Flatland. They develop software at a high-speed stock trading company in Kansas City. This is where they've set up their robot, though robot seems a pretty lofty description for this contraption. Little black cameras screwed to two-by-fours point toward a Rubik's Cube.

The Wall Street Journal reports that the company that made its name undercutting brick-and-mortar bookstores plans to open 400 brick-and-mortar bookstores. Amazon the company isn't commenting. It did open one walk-in store last November in Seattle, and NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports analysts are skeptical. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: This story doesn't even begin with Amazon. It started when the CEO of mall operator General Growth Properties made comments on an investor call on Tuesday. SANDEEP MATHRANI: You got Amazon opening brick-and-mortar bookstores, and their goal is to open, as I understand, 300 to 400 bookstores. NOGUCHI: The point, according to Sandeep Mathrani, is that retailers that started out online like Bonobos and Warby Parker are now increasingly in the market for physical locations, but his seemingly off-the-cuff comment triggered dozens of news stories about how Amazon, having killed off some major bookstore chains, is now laying plans to become one itself. Late today, Mathrani issued a statement saying he did not intend to represent Amazon's plans. The story never really made sense to R. J. Hottovy. R. J. HOTTOVY: It is a bit of a head-scratcher. NOGUCHI: Hottovy follows Amazon as an analyst for Morningstar Research. He says investing in storefronts doesn't fit neatly into the narrative the company has been selling successfully. HOTTOVY: In 2015, I think a big reason that the stock did so well is the company really focuses investments on its core parts of the business, whether it be ecommerce, whether it be logistics, whether it be Amazon web services. To see them go so far against that would be a surprise. NOGUCHI: The main characteristic in this drama, Amazon, says it doesn't comment on rumor and speculation, though that has done little to quell it. John Mutter is editor-in-chief of Shelf Awareness, which publishes news about the industry. Mutter says there's probably a kernel of truth to the rumor about the stores but just that. JOHN MUTTER: The basic idea that Amazon is going to open some more stores is accurate, but the number is wildly high. NOGUCHI: Insiders like Mutter have long known the online giant plans to open stores, but they put the number at about a dozen over the next few years. Mutter says it's not far-fetched to think the great online retailer would turn to physical stores. Ebook sales have plateaued. They're popular for niche use, but printed books, he says, are experiencing a resurgence. Outside Amazon's Seattle bookstore, Barbara Clouse remarked on the rareness of the occasion. BARBARA CLOUSE: I haven't gone to a lot of bookstores lately 'cause there aren't too many of them. NOGUCHI: She says she was drawn into this store visually. CLOUSE: The eye candy, the displays and a book that had a cute dog on it. NOGUCHI: Amazon's store is dissimilar from most bookstores in that it stocks a limited number of titles. Much of the store is devoted to displaying the Kindle, the Fire and other Amazon devices, and the store encourages browsing and buying online by only showing prices when you scan the title at a kiosk or on a phone. John Mutter, the industry news editor, says Amazon's online store is great for finding a specific book. MUTTER: But it's not a great place to find new titles or discover books that you didn't know about before. NOGUCHI: In other words, contrary to what people might say, they do like to judge books by their covers. If Amazon expands its bookstore footprint, it will likely lead to more drama. MUTTER: They're not well-liked by publishers or by other retailers. NOGUCHI: Mutter says it is, after all, king of online retailing. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News, Washington.

Carolina meets Denver in Super Bowl 50, and they will take the field at Levi's stadium, the home of the San Francisco 49ers, in the heart of Silicon Valley. And yes, in this day and age, anytime you have and event this big, it becomes a huge security undertaking. This year, officials are focusing in particular on cyberthreats. John Lightfoot joins me now. He is assistant special agent in charge of the FBI's San Francisco division. Welcome to the program. JOHN LIGHTFOOT: Thank you, Rachel. MARTIN: Let's talk about Levi's Stadium. This is not your average football stadium. It has hundreds of miles of fiber optic cable running through it, 13,000 Wi-Fi access points. How vulnerable is the stadium to a cyberattack, do you think? LIGHTFOOT: You know, first of all, you're absolutely right. Levi's Stadium is not your typical stadium. It is the newest in the country, and it's the most technologically capable stadium in the world. When they built and designed this place a couple of years ago, they built into it cybersecurity. And so going forward for tonight's game, we have not assessed that there are any credible cyberthreats to either the functionality of the stadium or to the users or the fan experience for the 80 - 90,000 people who will be there. MARTIN: We don't want to traffic in fear mongering, and you've just said there are no specific threats. But what, theoretically, could a hacker do? LIGHTFOOT: So at previous major sporting events at other stadiums, there have been scam websites, scam emails that try to sell you tickets, lodging or something to participate in the fan experience at the game. But a lot of those, in the past, have been bogus and they just scam people out of their money. MARTIN: I would also imagine you would have to protect the electrical grid, computer systems that help with crowd control or emergency services because, of course, we remember in 2013 that game. . . LIGHTFOOT: Yes. MARTIN: . . . In New Orleans when the lights went out. I mean, as a professional, when you saw that happening, what did you think? LIGHTFOOT: Well, there are a number of possibilities. Either somebody - you know, a fuse blew or an intentional act, and it took about 15 minutes, which is pretty fast, relatively, but not when you're on live TV worldwide in front of more than 1 billion viewers. And it turned out to be just a glitch in the system. So the folks here who manage the power grid do not want a repeat of the incident, and they've taken a lot of steps, a lot of measures to make sure that doesn't happen. MARTIN: And of course, you mentioned the fan experience, which is unique at this stadium. You can do all kinds of things here in the stadium from your phone - order food from your seat, watch replays, even find the closest bathroom with the shortest lines. . . LIGHTFOOT: Right. MARTIN: . . . I understand, which is crazy and I - quite utilitarian. What should fans be on the lookout for when they're trying to get online to access some of these services during the game? LIGHTFOOT: The main thing that people at the stadium will want to do is make sure when they log onto the Wi-Fi network, they're logging into the Levi Stadium network, not some other network. Just exercise due diligence, caution tonight at the game and any other time that you're using the Internet. MARTIN: Last pressing question - Carolina or Denver? LIGHTFOOT: As Coldplay said - as Chris Martin said the other day, he's rooting for the Denver Panthers. MARTIN: (Laughter). LIGHTFOOT: And I thought that was a great answer. MARTIN: John Lightfoot, special agent in charge in the FBI San Francisco division. John, thanks so much for talking with us. LIGHTFOOT: Thanks, Rachel. I appreciate it.

And those were just a few of the comments we heard from people in downtown Washington, D. C.

MANOUSH ZOMORODI, BYLINE: Good to be here, Ari. Thanks. SHAPIRO: Remind us again what you asked participants to do last week. ZOMORODI: OK, so what we first asked them to do was to choose an information goal for the week. Sort of a touchstone or a personal filter that would help them be more selective about all the videos and status updates and news articles that they took in. And by the way, the most popular goal of the five choices we gave people was be more in tune with yourself. The second one was be more creative. And. . . SHAPIRO: . . . So those are very abstract goals. We're not talking about only check my phone twice a day or something like that. ZOMORODI: No. So they would choose something sort of broad, and only they could define what be more creative meant to them. But then every morning, participants got an assignment from us, something more specific; a suggested behavior modification to try. So, like, on the first day, for example, we explained the science behind decision fatigue, something a lot of people have heard of, and some new, fascinating research on interruptions. And then we asked people to give up multitasking for the day and to try something that we called single-tasking. I think you can guess what that is. Do just. . . SHAPIRO: . . . One thing in a time. ZOMORODI: (Laughter) Yeah. SHAPIRO: How did you measure whether this worked or not? ZOMORODI: Well, what we did was we corresponded with them two ways, via email and via text, every single day. . . SHAPIRO: . . . Adding to their information incoming (laughter). ZOMORODI: The irony did not escape us. It is a paradox, but we are trying to meet people where they are. And at the end of every day, we asked them two things - could you read how successful you were at sticking to your information goal, and did you feel more, less or the same amount of information overload? SHAPIRO: And what happened? What did you discover? ZOMORODI: Well, OK. So it's interesting. At the end of day one, about 40 percent of the texting participants said that they felt less overloaded. It's pretty good. SHAPIRO: All right. ZOMORODI: Still less than half though. But by the end of day five, Friday, 71 percent said they felt less overloaded. But it was also interesting. We asked people how well did they feel that they were meeting their goals, and we saw those numbers increase as they went through the week as well. SHAPIRO: I suppose it's not that surprising. This is something where practice will improve performance. ZOMORODI: That's absolutely right. It's also kind of not surprising that the least successful group were the people who had set their goal to be more up-to-date on current events. SHAPIRO: What's the next step? ZOMORODI: OK, so we're going to be parsing the data much further, and the stories, with psychologists, technologists, data scientists because really, I think our goal is to start a longer-term cross-sector conversation about new approaches to - how do we build our technology? How do we consider how we use our technology? - because information overload is not something new. It has been dated to the 13th century. But what is new is the pace, and what we are finding is loss of focus. You can look at it from a utilitarian aspect - it is bad for personal productivity - but also from a mental health perspective. A lot of the people we spoke to reported a lot of anxiety, trouble sleeping, personal relationships being affected by this constant feeling of needing to keep up.

Things blow up on Twitter. Trends happen. Hashtags are created. Happy, angry tweets start flying. And over the weekend, Twitter itself became a trending topic. It happened after a report came out that the company would change the way tweets are displayed, that they would show up on your timeline differently. NPR's Laura Sydell is here to talk more about this. And Laura, one of the hashtags around this has been Twitter RIP, as in Twitter, rest in peace. Why are people so upset? LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE: Well, what happened is Buzzfeed reported that an unnamed source claimed that Twitter was going to start functioning more like Facebook. . . MCEVERS: Oh. SYDELL: . . . And use algorithms that will curate your news feed on Twitter. And this upset people because you follow people, and in real-time, they tweet something, and that's what pops up at the top of your feed. MCEVERS: It's chronological. SYDELL: It's chronological, and people have really liked that because it allows a lot of things to bubble up. You don't have to be famous to get to the top. If a tweet is good, it makes its way to the top. So, you know, something like Black Lives Matter started at the grassroots, bubbled up, and that's why people really like the way it is. So the rest in peace was the fear that they were going to change the algorithm. MCEVERS: Are they going to change the algorithm? SYDELL: Hard to say. I think, you know - Jack Dorsey, who is the CEO of Twitter, on Saturday, responded with a tweet that said, I want you all to know we're always listening. We never planned to reorder timelines next week. Now, mind you, he said next week, so does that mean they're thinking about it in the distant future or in the near future, just not next week? He also said, I love real time. We love live stream. It's us, and we're going to continue to refine it to make Twitter feel more, not less, live. Again, he didn't say explicitly, we're not going to change and put in an algorithm. MCEVERS: I mean, there are a lot of Twitter users who are very engaged with this site. I mean, some might even say obsessed. But at the same time, Twitter is having trouble building up its user base. I mean, would a new algorithm like this help? SYDELL: So Twitter has a little over 300 million users who use it on a monthly basis. And it really hasn't been able to make a consistent profit off that. Plus, growth has slowed. Take Facebook. Facebook has, you know, over 1. 5 billion users, still growing. So investors are saying, hey, come on, you know, Twitter; what's going on here? MCEVERS: Yeah. SYDELL: So I think that they've got to do something to make it easier to use. I think people feel that Facebook - it's actually fairly - you get on there, and you can see how to use it. Twitter takes some work. So there's a lot of pressure, and that, I think, is what this is all about - to make Twitter easier for the average person to understand. MCEVERS: And I kind of have to ask. I mean, would we be having this conversation if this was some other company, not Twitter? SYDELL: I have to admit - and, Kelly, I suspect you would agree - journalists really do like Twitter a lot, and we tend to follow it. And partially, that is because we use it. It is a great source for breaking news. I've used it myself. I mean, there have been moments when, you know, horrible stories - the bombing in Boston or whatever - the first of time I saw it was on Twitter because people were there on the ground, and they were tweeting it out. And so I think that's one of the reasons we journalists are always following Twitter and excited about it. Plus, it's kind of an interesting company. The current CEO, Jack Dorsey, came back - he's a cofounder. He came back, and he's running two companies at once. His other company is Square. So he's a double CEO right now. And I think that also makes for a good story that we journalists enjoy. MCEVERS: That's NPR's Laura Sydell. Thank you. SYDELL: You're welcome.

Thousands have been fleeing the city of Aleppo, many of them trying to get into Turkey. Two and a half million Syrians have already crossed that border during the war. And there's a small army of ordinary Turks quietly volunteering to help them. Here's NPR's Peter Kenyon. PETER KENYON, BYLINE: It's Sunday afternoon, and a commercial warehouse on Istanbul's European side is doing weekend duty as an humanitarian aid staging area. These people loading sacks of food into their cars are all volunteers. There are no uniforms, no logos and no leader. But questions do tend to get directed to an energetic woman who still can't believe this improvised operation is actually working. ZEYNAP KURMUS HURBAS: We never thought we could do it. (Laughter) We still don't believe we can do it. KENYON: Zeynap Kurmus Hurbas says last fall, after seeing one too many heartbreaking pictures of dead Syrian children on social media, she offered to coordinate aid deliveries in Istanbul. The next thing she knew, hundreds of families were depending on her and her friends. She makes it sound simple. HURBAS: We put a post on Facebook saying, this weekend we're going to give food and, you know, baby clothes and stuff to X amount of families. So people just buy things online and just send them to our depot here. KENYON: She's not fond of her online nickname, the Angel Without Wings. But she does appreciate how quickly social media helped her find others who were just waiting for a chance to share more than their sympathy. HURBAS: And look, we have - we have an American here as well. Come here. VALERIE TASIRAN: I'm Valerie Tasiran, and I'm from Fresno, Calif. KENYON: After a decade living in Istanbul, Tasiran noticed more and more pan-handlers in her neighborhood and thought there must be a better way to help. TASIRAN: Is it doing ultimate good? And so I wanted something more organized. My mom, who lives in the U. S. , also wanted to direct some aid to refugees. And so when I saw the announcement on Twitter. . . UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Foreign language spoken). KENYON: The group finds the neediest families by working with neighborhood community centers like this one. They've been springing up to help Syrians just as Hurbas' aid group did. The next stop is a neighborhood of textile factories where many Syrians have under-the-table jobs. A disturbing story waits in one of the drafty cement apartment blocks. At the door, Hurbas hangs back. HURBAS: You can go in. I'll stay outside. KENYON: Is it OK? HURBAS: Yes. DERAR AL-JASEM: (Foreign language spoken). KENYON: Inside, Syrian Derar Al-Jasem, tall and barefoot, offers visitors a seat on the mismatched, donated furniture. He tries his basic English to explain the situation, which is distressing. AL-JASEM: My son every day bleeding - every day bleeding. You need bone marrow transplantation. KENYON: The son who bleeds every day and needs a bone marrow transplant is 7-year-old Abdulatif, who's busy playing a video game on the couch. He has a rare disorder called acquired aplastic anemia. Jasem's phone is full of pictures of his son bleeding from the nose and mouth and under his skin. And here's the excruciating twist. The most likely blood marrow donor match is Abdulatif's older brother, Abdullah. Months ago, he was right there with them when the family boarded a smuggler's boat bound for Greece. But when people saw Abdulatif bleeding heavily, his parents had to take him off the boat, leaving the 9-year-old brother to go on alone. Somehow, he made it to his uncle's in Germany. And the Al-Jasems have been waiting for permission to join them. By this time, Zeynap Hurbas has slipped into the room. She's quietly comforting Abdulatif's distraught mother. But as we get back to the car, she explains why she was reluctant to go in. The emotional toll these visits exact can be heavy. HURBAS: Yeah, I try not to go in because I get upset. I used to go in and know everybody's names and get in touch with them. But then they start dying. And you just have to find a way to distance yourself from the whole thing. KENYON: With a little shake of her head, Hurbas heads off to the next stop on a mission of mercy that right now seems to have no end. Peter Kenyon, NPR News, Istanbul.

She was interviewing reporter Janet Babin about run-in Apple had at the time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)MADELEINE BRAND, BYLINE: Well, what's next for the company, then? JANET BABIN, BYLINE: Well, analysts are very optimistic. They say, you know, Apple's expected to sell 15 to 16 million iPods for the December quarter and 1. 7 Mac computers - a lot of sales. And then, on January 9, Piper Jaffray expects apple to debut its long-awaited product, the iPhone, that combines the iPod with a phone.

SIEGEL: Some people may hear about this case and assume that it's just about national security, catching terrorists, but you're saying it really isn't. KASTE: Now, it really isn't. The FBI has definitely been leading the charge in terms of the public war over this. The director of the FBI, James Comey, for a number of years has been complaining about what the FBI calls the process of going dark, which is what they call the process of not being able to get into a phone or another device that's been encrypted, even when they have a warrant. But really, local district attorneys and detectives I've talked to over the years say this is becoming a concern for them, too. Just a few minutes ago, I talked to Cy Vance Jr. , the district attorney in Manhattan, and he's really made this a cause. He was telling me that they now have a 155 smartphones in the district attorney's digital forensic lab there which they simply can't open, even though they have a legal right to do so. He told me he thought Apple and Google were being irresponsible. In fact, the phrase he used was that they were acting like teenagers because they were creating a product here that police couldn't get into even when they had a legitimate right to do so. And there's really been a lot of tension building over this in small departments and large. And a lot of the people in law enforcement, generally speaking, are happy to see the FBI now challenging the company, Apple, on this. SIEGEL: Martin, smartphones have been around for almost a decade. Why is this conflict happening now? KASTE: Well, when you look at the history here, it's sort of a gift that was taken away. For the first few years, smartphones were a detective's dream. When you think about it, we put our whole life into this object that we keep in our pocket. And then, when there's a crime, one of the first things detectives do, they tell me, is they find the phones. And in many cases, they can make their whole case on that phone. So for the first few years, this was great. But then, over time, those phones started becoming encrypted. They were first being locked, then encrypted. And at first, that was something the detectives could handle. For one thing, they could just negotiate with the person who owned the phone say and say, hey, just, you know, we're going to get a warrant anyway; open that up. That sometimes worked. If they had to get a warrant, it meant a delay. Eventually, Google often could open the phone remotely once they got the right papers. Apple - you'd have to send it to Apple. They'd open it. But they could get in. But once encryption started becoming a default setting and encrypting everything on the phone, then, all of a sudden, that started to vanish. And they would go to the companies, and the companies told them, sorry, we don't have the keys. SIEGEL: Well, does this encryption by default mean that criminals can communicate without any worries of being tracked by law enforcement? KASTE: No, it's really important to point out here that this is not about communications. This is - what we're talking about here are the data that you store in your phone, in your pockets. Law enforcement can still use the usual means to get a warrant and talk to your phone company and get the numbers you've dialed, other kinds of communications, data that often are very, very helpful in investigations in finding networks of criminals and that sort of thing. But when it comes to things like your contact list, photos, video, notes you might be taking or stored texts - things are only in the phone - that's what's at stake here. Now, most people don't think about this ahead of time, and they store - they backup their phone on the cloud, that kind of thing. And that can often be had, too. The phone company can - or, in this case, Apple can produce what you've backed up to the iCloud system. But some sophisticated criminals now are aware that, too, and they're turning off the backup process. So really, in some cases, there's data that only exists in the phone that you had in your pocket. SIEGEL: You mentioned that many in law enforcement are glad to see the FBI challenge Apple on this, but the FBI told the court that it's asking the company only to open this one phone. Why would this change things for the average police detective? KASTE: Well, I think a lot of people in law enforcement are hoping that this sets a precedent. What's interesting about this case is the federal court is not telling Apple just to turn over some information like you would in a normal warrant case. The court is using this 18th-century law called the All Writs Act to force Apple to actually do something, to actively write software that'll break into their phone. And law enforcement sees that as a possible precedent where these tech companies are forced to cooperate more actively with some of these investigations. SIEGEL: That's NPR's Martin Kaste.

He's the director of Internet science and technology research at the Pew Research Center. Welcome back. LEE RAINIE: Thanks, Ari. SHAPIRO: You guys published a new report on this a few weeks ago. And you found that 91 percent of adults agree or strongly agree that consumers have lost control of how personal data is collected and used. What does that say to you? RAINIE: It says that privacy is a enormous concern now on Americans' minds. They have paid a lot of attention over the years to privacy issues but especially since the Edward Snowden revelations and the run of retail data breaches and government data breaches that have occurred in the past couple of years. They're very anxious about the state of play. SHAPIRO: Do you find that the answers change when you go from general questions about privacy and security to specific questions about, like, terrorism investigations, for example? RAINIE: That's absolutely the case. The context of the questions and the context of just people's lives as they're answering questions about privacy make a lot of difference in how they answer. When there's a very vivid case in the news that people are concentrated on, their general tendency is to give a little bit of more support to law enforcement and security issues than to personal privacy issues. SHAPIRO: What does that mean in terms of policy because, for example, in this situation with Apple, you have Apple saying, well, the government would like us to do this one thing in this one case that may seem reasonable to most people but in fact, it's a slippery slope and it will lead to farm more government access than most people would feel comfortable with. RAINIE: Most Americans are in a very conditional and contingent frame of mind when they ponder these issues. So it's a really complicated environment for policymakers to try to sort out because Americans are not binary in their thinking about privacy. It's not all always about privacy or always about disclosure. Sometimes people want to protect their data, sometimes they're willing to share it and sometimes they're willing to let companies and the government collect their data. So it's a very complicated set of opinions for policymakers and people who run privacy policies to navigate through. SHAPIRO: You've been doing this kind of research for long time. And as we said, your latest report came out a few weeks ago before this latest standoff between Apple and the Justice Department. Given all the research you've done, what is your assessment of the impact this latest controversy is going to have? RAINIE: Well, we've seen over the years when there are vivid cases like this that the public when it's asked directly about the case will tend to side by a slight majority with the law enforcement community and on the side of the security issues related to these questions. But over time, as the vividness of the story diminishes, then they become more generally concerned about their privacy. So it's a moving target. And one would expand that the wave of polling that will certainly occur after the Apple FBI story will show that the public might likely be a little bit more supportive of the government than the company in this case. But over time, those views are going to mutate. SHAPIRO: That's Lee Rainie, the director of Internet science and technology research at the Pew Research Center. Thanks for joining us.

Specifically, it is the phone used by Syed Farook, one of the two terrorists who killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif. The feds say they can't access the phone because of Apple's security features. Apple calls the court order government overreach, arguing it threatens the privacy of all its customers. NPR's Martin Kaste has more. MARTIN KASTE, BYLINE: This fight's been brewing for more than a year, since the fall of 2014 when Apple rolled out a new operating system for the iPhone with encryption so good that even Apple wouldn't be able to open it without the owner's password. Cyrus Vance, Jr. says that made his job harder. He's the district attorney in Manhattan, and his evidence department now has a growing inventory of unopenable iPhones. CYRUS VANCE JR. : We now have about 155 to 160 devices that are running on iOS 8 that are blocked and we can't get in them. KASTE: They can't get in, even with a warrant. Permission from a judge is beside the point because Apple simply can't comply. Vance has been campaigning against the company's policy for months. He says a mature company would feel a responsibility to help with public safety. VANCE: They're taking the opposite approach and acting like teenagers saying you can't tell me what to do, no matter how important the public safety imperative is. KASTE: And this is why the law enforcement world is celebrating the FBI's showdown with Apple over the phone from San Bernardino. The feds are essentially saying - OK, Apple. You say you can't open this phone, but you still have to help us. ROBERT CATTANACH: The government is very strategic in doing two things. It picked a very high profile, very emotional case, and what it requested was very narrow. KASTE: That's Robert Cattanach, a former Justice Department attorney who now specializes in cybersecurity. He says the FBI is just asking Apple to write a piece of custom software that'll keep the phone from wiping its data while the feds use their own methods to try to hack in. It seems like a small favor to ask, and Cattanach says that's the point. CATTANACH: Once you take this step, if you are Apple - and I - there are all sorts of reasons why they're not going to take this step willingly. But then what's the next step and the next step? Then where do you draw the line? KASTE: In other words, this could be the start of a slippery slope, with the government asking for one small technical favor after another. Apple CEO Tim Cook certainly sees it that way. In a letter to customers, he said it could lead to government requests for Apple to write surveillance software or to track phone locations. That fear has privacy advocates rallying to Apple's side. Christopher Soghoian is the ACLU's principal technologist. He says people in law enforcement seem to think that they should never be completely locked out of any technology. CHRISTOPHER SOGHOIAN: They think that it's reasonable that people have a fight about what piece of paper the government gets - whether they get a warrant, whether they get a wiretap order, whether they get a subpoena - but that ultimately every single bit of information should be available to the government. And then I think there are many people in the civil liberties community who think that, in fact, that it should be possible to have a conversation that the government can never listen to. KASTE: Pete Modafferi is the chief of detectives for the district attorney's office in Rockland County, N. Y. , and he's been analyzing the effects of growing encryption for the International Association of Chiefs of Police. In recent years, cell phones have become key for police work. He says a detective is lucky when he finds one at a crime scene. And that's why he's puzzled by the people who are taking Apple's side in this. PETE MODAFFERI: But I can't understand why people are so upset about the possibility of law enforcement using legal process to get access to this evidence. We're not after John Q. Public. We're really after criminals, and I don't think they understand the magnitude of what they're doing to us. KASTE: For law enforcement agencies who share this view, the FBI's request for help in the San Bernardino case has the potential of swinging public opinion back toward the cops' point of view.

He's not a candidate. Jorge Ramos is one of the most-watched TV anchors in the country. He hosts news programs on the Spanish-language network Univision and the English-language cable channel Fusion. Ramos has been out on the campaign trail this year talking to voters, and NPR's David Folkenflik reports he's also drawing millions of new viewers on Facebook. DAVID FOLKENFLIK, BYLINE: I caught sight of Jorge Ramos on primary day outside Merrimack High School in New Hampshire. JORGE RAMOS: We have to walk all the way because there's a line of cars. It would've taken another hour. FOLKENFLIK: New Hampshire has few Latinos, but many people recognize Ramos right away, including this supporter of Donald Trump talking to Ramos while he was live-streaming on a Univision Facebook page. RAMOS: Hi. How are you? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Hi. Aren't you cold from Miami, yeah? RAMOS: I am really cold. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Yeah. RAMOS: Yeah. FOLKENFLIK: Ramos has challenged Trump's plan to build a huge wall along the border with Mexico and deport 11 million people who are in the U. S. without legal status. Back in August, Trump tossed Ramos out of a press conference. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DONALD TRUMP: Sit down. RAMOS: (Inaudible). TRUMP: Go ahead. RAMOS: I have the right to ask a question. TRUMP: No, you don't. You haven't been called. RAMOS: I have the right to have ask a question. TRUMP: Go back to Univision. FOLKENFLIK: Ramos has expanded beyond Univision and Fusion to attract new audiences on social media through a new feature called Facebook Live. Ramos's coverage there is raw, streamed live without editing. If the wireless connection drops, so does the broadcast. RAMOS: When people see the process at night on network news, they see the refined product, the final product. And I think they're kind of tired of that. The want to see the real thing, and this is the real thing. FOLKENFLIK: Facebook says 2. 6 million people watch Ramos's videos on the night of the Iowa caucuses. His videos on New Hampshire's primary day drew more than 4 million viewers. Those figures rival or exceed cable news audiences. RAMOS: Look; I've been doing this for 30 years, and suddenly, I'm - I just have here a cell phone and broadcasting everything on a cell phone. FOLKENFLIK: He said they're going where the audience is. I called over Dax Tejera. He's the executive producer of \"AMERICA With Jorge Ramos,\" which runs on Fusion. Dax - you join us for a sec? Whose idea was this particular project? DAX TEJERA: It was our idea. RAMOS: It was your idea. You told me - you went to my office and said, we have to report, but let's do it only on Facebook. TEJERA: Yeah, and look. What we've known all the time for Fusion is that if we try to compete with CNN or Fox and do their ideas for our audience, it won't work because that model has been tried, tested, and they've perfected it. So we constantly think about who our audience is and where they are, and it was increasingly clear to us that people were coming to see us through Facebook and that when Facebook Live became an option, it was a no-brainer, I think. FOLKENFLIK: During the live streams, Ramos often toggles back and forth between Spanish and English. The question of language and identity surfaced as Ramos talked with Mike Malzone, a local contractor and Merrimack Tea Party activist. He had been standing in the cold for hours, holding a poster for Trump. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MIKE MALZONE: He brought heaters and coffee for everyone, and we don't really - we gave something to everyone that was here because we're not haters. We respect the process. RAMOS: It's interesting that you say, we're not haters because some people might think that Mexicans, Muslims, women might not be welcome. MALZONE: Oh, disagree. FOLKENFLIK: Then Malzone turned the question back on Ramos and Univision. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MALZONE: I was disappointed with your station for quite some time because I could never SAP your station in English, and it's only been. . .

FOLKENFLIK: SAP - that's the way to receive translation of Univision's Spanish newscasts into English in real time. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MALZONE: That's not right. I couldn't SAP that in English. That wasn't cool, Man, right? But is that racism? RAMOS: No, it's not racism. We simply broadcast in Spanish. That's all. MALZONE: Yeah, but. . . RAMOS: But now I'm almost - also working for Fusion, so you can watch whatever we do in both English and. . . MALZONE: It's about time. Thank God. FOLKENFLIK: Ramos later told me he valued the contentious exchange with Malzone. RAMOS: I don't have the prompter or the lights or the set. It's the nature of our business - is true reporting and seeing. FOLKENFLIK: It was all right there for anyone to see. David Folkenflik, NPR News. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:   Now, someone else who's been going toe-to-toe with Donald Trump. He's not a candidate. Jorge Ramos is one of the most-watched TV anchors in the country. He hosts news programs on the Spanish-language network Univision and the English-language cable channel Fusion. Ramos has been out on the campaign trail this year talking to voters, and NPR's David Folkenflik reports he's also drawing millions of new viewers on Facebook. DAVID FOLKENFLIK, BYLINE: I caught sight of Jorge Ramos on primary day outside Merrimack High School in New Hampshire. JORGE RAMOS: We have to walk all the way because there's a line of cars. It would've taken another hour. FOLKENFLIK: New Hampshire has few Latinos, but many people recognize Ramos right away, including this supporter of Donald Trump talking to Ramos while he was live-streaming on a Univision Facebook page. RAMOS: Hi. How are you? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Hi. Aren't you cold from Miami, yeah? RAMOS: I am really cold. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Yeah. RAMOS: Yeah. FOLKENFLIK: Ramos has challenged Trump's plan to build a huge wall along the border with Mexico and deport 11 million people who are in the U. S. without legal status. Back in August, Trump tossed Ramos out of a press conference. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: Sit down. RAMOS: (Inaudible). TRUMP: Go ahead. RAMOS: I have the right to ask a question. TRUMP: No, you don't. You haven't been called. RAMOS: I have the right to have ask a question. TRUMP: Go back to Univision. FOLKENFLIK: Ramos has expanded beyond Univision and Fusion to attract new audiences on social media through a new feature called Facebook Live. Ramos's coverage there is raw, streamed live without editing. If the wireless connection drops, so does the broadcast. RAMOS: When people see the process at night on network news, they see the refined product, the final product. And I think they're kind of tired of that. The want to see the real thing, and this is the real thing. FOLKENFLIK: Facebook says 2. 6 million people watch Ramos's videos on the night of the Iowa caucuses. His videos on New Hampshire's primary day drew more than 4 million viewers. Those figures rival or exceed cable news audiences. RAMOS: Look; I've been doing this for 30 years, and suddenly, I'm - I just have here a cell phone and broadcasting everything on a cell phone. FOLKENFLIK: He said they're going where the audience is. I called over Dax Tejera. He's the executive producer of \"AMERICA With Jorge Ramos,\" which runs on Fusion. Dax - you join us for a sec? Whose idea was this particular project? DAX TEJERA: It was our idea. RAMOS: It was your idea. You told me - you went to my office and said, we have to report, but let's do it only on Facebook. TEJERA: Yeah, and look. What we've known all the time for Fusion is that if we try to compete with CNN or Fox and do their ideas for our audience, it won't work because that model has been tried, tested, and they've perfected it. So we constantly think about who our audience is and where they are, and it was increasingly clear to us that people were coming to see us through Facebook and that when Facebook Live became an option, it was a no-brainer, I think. FOLKENFLIK: During the live streams, Ramos often toggles back and forth between Spanish and English. The question of language and identity surfaced as Ramos talked with Mike Malzone, a local contractor and Merrimack Tea Party activist. He had been standing in the cold for hours, holding a poster for Trump. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MIKE MALZONE: He brought heaters and coffee for everyone, and we don't really - we gave something to everyone that was here because we're not haters. We respect the process. RAMOS: It's interesting that you say, we're not haters because some people might think that Mexicans, Muslims, women might not be welcome. MALZONE: Oh, disagree. FOLKENFLIK: Then Malzone turned the question back on Ramos and Univision. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MALZONE: I was disappointed with your station for quite some time because I could never SAP your station in English, and it's only been. . . RAMOS: Now you can do it, right? MALZONE: Yeah, but it's only been the last couple years. RAMOS: Exactly. FOLKENFLIK: SAP - that's the way to receive translation of Univision's Spanish newscasts into English in real time. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MALZONE: That's not right. I couldn't SAP that in English. That wasn't cool, Man, right? But is that racism? RAMOS: No, it's not racism. We simply broadcast in Spanish. That's all. MALZONE: Yeah, but. . .

Facebook and Twitter have both said they side with Apple in its battle with the federal government. Apple is resisting a demand to build software to crack the encryption on one iPhone used by a shooter in the San Bernardino attacks. The Mozilla Foundation, which advocates openness, has now launched a pro-encryption publicity campaign, and we're going to talk about that with Mark Surman, who's the foundation's executive director. Welcome to the program, sir. MARK SURMAN: Happy to be here, Steve. INSKEEP: So everybody's landed on a pretty hard case here, haven't they, because one iPhone linked here to a shooter in San Bernardino. Why should that one iPhone not be cracked open? SURMAN: Well, it's difficult to talk about tech policy in the context of something so horrific, but, you know, what is being asked for as far as we understand it really is an overreach because what Apple is saying is that it's software that will be written once, but a software, that once it exists, has the potential to be used for others. INSKEEP: Martin Kaste, one of our correspondents, noted the other day on the air that even with an encrypted iPhone, there's an immense amount of information that law enforcement officials can get. They can find out, for example, what phone calls were made and to whom, and any number of messages that were sent in various directions can be tracked. Are we actually getting that much protection from encryption? SURMAN: Well, encryption is there to protect the everyday things we do with the Internet. All of us transact online, communicate, you know, in intimate ways online, and encryption is there when we choose to be private, to make sure things are private. In many ways, this spot we're at right now with the help of the Internet is where we were with the environment in the '50s. There were scientists who knew that pollution existed, but, you know, most of us didn't, and it took decades for us to understand that the help of the environment was something we all needed to take on. And I think that's where we're headed with the help of the Internet. If we undermine encryption, we undermine something that all of us use every day. INSKEEP: One last thing, coming back to this San Bernardino case, we don't know what's in that iPhone. We don't even know if it's important. But let's spin out the worst case scenario as a prosecutor might. Suppose your side wins, that phone is never opened, and as a result, the government misses a chance to find some other suspect and disrupt some attack. The attack goes forward, and people are killed. Will that have been worth it in order to protect encryption? SURMAN: We need to find ways to really be able to seek communications before they're sent or after they're sent and actually work with law enforcement on doing this well. There are alternative ways to get information, getting access to it before or after it's encrypted. What we want to avoid is creating a precedent where encryption can be broken by an arbitrary third party. INSKEEP: So you're saying, in essence, it may well be harder to catch terrorists, but you can still work at it, and the extra difficulty is worth it. SURMAN: You can still work at it, and we actually all need to work at it as a society how we do law enforcement well and also be able to build an Internet that is secure for the legitimate business we do online.

But Apple is also at the center of a new development in the ongoing story about diversity in the tech world. If you follow the industry, then you know that some of the world's most prominent tech companies have been challenged repeatedly for their lack of racial and gender diversity in their workforces. Now a shareholder at Apple has initiated a potentially historic challenge to that pattern. Over the next week, Apple shareholders are eligible to vote on a measure asking Apple to bring more people of color to its senior management team and board of directors. While the measure is not binding, it is believed to be first at any company. Antonio Maldonado is the man behind this effort, and we reached him in London. Mr. Maldonado, thanks so much for speaking to us. ANTONIO AVIAN MALDONADO II: Thank you for having me, Michel. MARTIN: I understand that you're the creative director for a music company. So you don't work in the tech world per se. How did you get this idea? MALDONADO: Well, actually, this was an adventure into career management for my son. We were discussing career routes, and the tech world just happened to pop up. And we were reviewing the website for Apple and just said oh, look at that, I'll be the first person of color up there. That stuck in my mind, believe it or not. And for three years I did some research, and I started challenging Apple directly about this. And unfortunately, they never gave me sufficient answers as to why it was occurring. So I decided to come up with this. MARTIN: Had you ever done any kind of shareholder activism before? MALDONADO: No. I've never done this before, so it's a first-time adventure. MARTIN: So what is the state of play at Apple at this point when it comes to diversity? MALDONADO: It's a mixed bag to be quite honest because they have a great diversity program. But unfortunately, in my opinion, it's external mostly. So they do a lot of goodwill gestures - for instance, donating to scholarship funds and to schools. And in their retail stores, it's quite diversified and everything else. But once you hit management - upper management - it seems like you're hitting a brick wall at that given stage where it's not very diverse. MARTIN: What has been the reaction from the company? MALDONADO: At first I would say that they were trying to justify their numbers. And the final AGM we had last year, I brought up the same question about their numbers. And they pointed out to two black executives, which I felt in my opinion was tokenism. After that, during discussion with a legal team, it was a battle back and forth as to perception. They believed that they're making a lot of progress and that their numbers are great in upper management. In mine, it's actually quite the opposite. I believe it's abysmal because when you're considering that they only have one Hispanic in upper management out of 103 and four black members, that's quite appalling, especially for 2016. MARTIN: And what about the fact that the HR director is a person of color? That is a critical position presumably. Your response to that is what - I'm not taking a position on this either way. I'm simply reflecting back to you that this is what they said to you. What do you say to that in response? MALDONADO: Well, unfortunately, when they start pointing to something like that, it tends to be tokenism, OK? Let's just look at the facts, for instance, in the board of directors. It was a span of 18 years between having black members within the board of directors. Delano Lewis was the last person in the 1990s. And from that point on, there was not another appointment until James Bell recently in the board of directors. And they only did that because they're getting some pressure, for instance, from Jesse Jackson and everyone else. So I believe that that was more tokenism as compared to genuine wanting to have inclusion. MARTIN: So as we mentioned that the shareholder resolution is nonbinding. MALDONADO: Correct. MARTIN: So even if it passes, the company doesn't have to do it. What would you argue the utility of this exercise is? MALDONADO: Well, it does - believe it or not, even though it's nonbinding, it does nudge a company to actually act rightly. It's a black mark on their brand if they decide to go against something that the shareholders want. After all, the company's owned by shareholders, not by individuals. So therefore, they have to comply eventually to shareholders requests. Even though it may not be today or tomorrow, eventually they have to. Our goal, of course, is to hopefully get this to pass, and if it doesn't pass to bring up again soon - hopefully come up with a good solution within the next year or two. MARTIN: Mr. Maldonado, thanks so much for speaking with us. Keep us posted if you would. MALDONADO: Thank you, Michel, for everything. MARTIN: That's Antonio Maldonado, the shareholder behind a vote asking Apple to accelerate efforts to diversify its board and senior management team.

It works like this. Instead of having two hands, it has a hand for every member of the family. And instead of pointing at the time, the hands swing around to indicate where each family member is at any given time, for example - home, school, traveling, prison, even mortal peril. Well, a computer science student named Trey Bagley decided that wizards shouldn't be the only ones to benefit from such a clever device. So he made his own version of the Weasley clock for his own family. Trey joins me now to talk about his invention. Hey, Trey. Thanks for being with us. TREY BAGLEY: Hi. Thank you. MARTIN: Can you just tell me - where is the clock? Where's it hanging? BAGLEY: In the wall of the kitchen, back home in Houston. MARTIN: Describe this clock to me. How is it different from the Weasley clock? - because it is. You made some modifications. BAGLEY: (Laughter) Yeah, I had to improvise a little without magic. MARTIN: (Laughter). BAGLEY: But in general, there are - we have six members of the family. And there are six hands that can be lit up under each category on the clock face. We all set up rules on our phones so that for different locations or events, it'll change which category we're lit up under. MARTIN: So tell me what categories you put on the clock. BAGLEY: So we have home, work, on the way, forest, holiday and mortal peril. MARTIN: Home, work, on the way - I get all those. What does the forest look like in your family's life? BAGLEY: That's part of the fun of the project is that everyone gets to categorize it in different ways. So for me, as a Duke student, we have the Duke Gardens just outside of campus. So I'm able to draw a radius around that on the computer and say - if my phone enters this line, then set me to forest. MARTIN: Huh. BAGLEY: My mom - for her running trail back at home, it just draw an area around where she runs through. So whenever she brings her phone on that run, she'll be set to forest. MARTIN: Cool. And what about mortal peril? BAGLEY: (Laughter) Mortal peril. I think only a couple of us have rules for that one, but we try to find humorous ways to light up that one. MARTIN: What's your mortal peril? BAGLEY: My mortal peril is - I'm signed to work for Microsoft next year. And if their stock drops below their three-year low, it automatically sets me to mortal peril. MARTIN: (Laughter) That's awesome. So let's get not super far into the technical weeds, but let's just explain a little bit how this works. BAGLEY: All the LEDs inside the clock are all wired up in a string, which is wired up to this little microcontroller chip called the Photon, which can connect to Wi-Fi and receive messages through it. MARTIN: I understand - so you have three siblings? And you guys are in your 20s, or a couple of them are teenagers still. Was everyone so keen on this? Because when you're a teenager, do you necessarily want your parents or everyone else in the family to know exactly where you are at any given time? BAGLEY: Right. My sisters weren't too keen, as I predicted. I had to make sure they would all agree to this before we started the project. MARTIN: How has this worked for your family? Do people really keep tabs on one another this way? BAGLEY: My mom will tell me that before she goes to bed, she'll check it. And if she sees everyone up at home, then she knows we're all either in bed or in a dorm, and it's a nice little comforting thing. MARTIN: Trey Bagley, he's a designer of a real life Weasley clock.

MARTIN: I understand - so you have three siblings? And you guys are in your 20s, or a couple of them are teenagers still. Was everyone so keen on this? Because when you're a teenager, do you necessarily want your parents or everyone else in the family to know exactly where you are at any given time? BAGLEY: Right. My sisters weren't too keen, as I predicted. I had to make sure they would all agree to this before we started the project. MARTIN: How has this worked for your family? Do people really keep tabs on one another this way? BAGLEY: My mom will tell me that before she goes to bed, she'll check it. And if she sees everyone up at home, then she knows we're all either in bed or in a dorm, and it's a nice little comforting thing. MARTIN: Trey Bagley, he's a designer of a real life Weasley clock. Thanks so much for talking with us, Trey. BAGLEY: Thank you.", "section": "Technology", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SIEGEL: To those of you listening in your car right now or who might, at some point, drive a car, here's a question. Would you rather have a computer do the driving for you? Well, that's what we asked these drivers. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: No. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: No. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: No. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: No, not me. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: No. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: Absolutely not. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: No. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #5: Yes, if that computer is accurate and, you know, there's no bugs in it. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #4: I would prefer to be in control of it myself. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #6: Computer messes up - ain't nothing like the human brain. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #5: I'd want to be in control. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #7: I'd rather know what's going on with my car. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #8: Don't trust it. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #9: I want to focus on the road. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #10: I enjoy the ride to work. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #11: I just don't like the idea. SIEGEL: Motorists in Washington, D. C. , all at the wheel - we heard Mohammad Asiri (ph), Dwight Harpen (ph), Andrew Chen (ph), Will Rowe (ph), Terry Caldwell (ph), Jeanette Stubbs (ph), Irene Billips (ph), Tanya Tyson (ph) and Robert Gray (ph). A University of Michigan survey found that about 90 percent of Americans have some concerns about the concept of self-driving cars, but most also say that they do want some aspects of the car to be automated. Whatever Americans think, the legal and regulatory groundwork is being laid right now for a drastically different transportation landscape in which we ride around in cars that drive themselves. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #12: Surely within the next 10 years. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #6: As early as five years. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #13: Over the next three to five years. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #14: I have a 12-year-old son, and the goal is to get this out into the world before he has to get his driver's license. SIEGEL: We've been talking to some big players in that coming self-driving reality, and we'll be hearing from them this week. We'll start at the U. S. Department of Transportation. ANTHONY FOXX: I've actually ridden in a self-driving car, and I see the future when I'm in one. SIEGEL: That's Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. FOXX: We actually have some studies that some private-sector folks have done suggesting that the combination of autonomous and connected vehicles would potentially reduce our fatalities by 80 percent. That's a pretty significant number when you consider we have almost 33,000 fatalities on the road every year. SIEGEL: I wanted to pursue a little bit with you - I want to pursue a bit what autonomy or self-driving means. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, NHTSA, sent a letter to Google this month, saying that the self-driving system can be considered the driver of a self-driving car. What does that mean? FOXX: Well, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration basically sets federal standards for what defines a vehicle. And hereto for, there's been separation between the concept of who the driver is and what the vehicle is. And our interpretation is now allowing the system that is operated by a driverless car to be considered as the driver. SIEGEL: Secretary Foxx, the California Department of Motor Vehicles has proposed a regulation. Self-driving cars should be required to have a licensed driver inside. Is that a good principle? FOXX: Yeah. I mean, I think, obviously, where technology is today, that is definitely a good principle. And of course, we would not suggest putting something unsafe on the road. That's why we have federal motor vehicle standards in the first place. And by the way, our interpretation of a driver as, you know, one of these driverless system doesn't mean that the car itself meets all of our standards. There are still some questions that have to be resolved by the technology companies as to whether those vehicles meet our standards. SIEGEL: But do you assume that the presence a licensed driver inside a self-driving car means someone sitting in the driver seat and being there as an ever-ready backup system in case the self-driving car doesn't get it right? FOXX: Well, let me put it this way. We've promised the industry over the next six months to provide as many of the answers to these questions as we can. I can't tell you definitively today that our view will be that having a licensed driver in the car is a requirement or should be a requirement of operating a driverless car. These are questions that we are actually trying to get our arms around today. SIEGEL: What are some of the other questions as you plan to provide guidelines also to the states later this year? What are some of the questions you're still trying to get your arms around like that one? FOXX: (Laughter) Well, you know, let's think about what it takes to get a driver's license in the first place. When I came out of high school, I was raring to go get my driver's license, and the expectation at that time was that the driver would be fully engaged a hundred percent of the time when he or she was operating the vehicle. In a world where the vehicle is doing more of the driving task, we are also asking ourselves questions as to how you train people to drive in cars like that. SIEGEL: We seem to be taking several steps toward much more sophisticated automated vehicles. One of the questions facing your department, the U. S. Department of Transportation, this year has been the idea of a rearview mirror that could flip to a setting in which it's not a physical mirror; it's a screen displaying the images from a rearview camera. FOXX: Yeah. We've asked the industry to give us innovations that they think can and should be part of vehicles. GM, for example, has requested that we interpret our federal safety standards to allow for the camera you described, and today, we are issuing guidance that this technology does qualify under our current standards. SIEGEL: Historically, the government doesn't test vehicles. It sets requirements and standards and expects manufacturers to certify that they meet those requirements. In this area of relatively unknown technologies, of computer piloted cars, should government regulators get more hands-on, do some more riding around in these cars? FOXX: That's one of the things that's interesting about where we are, is, we need to be at the leading edge of this revolution in technology and transportation, and our NHTSA department needs to be at the table as this technology is coming into place, you know? Under our old methodology, we would've waited for an auto company to come up with a driverless car, and we would've had to learn the entire system at one time. And that would've taken years and years, and we wouldn't have been as familiar with it. The way we're doing it now, taking interpretations like the interpretation we made about GM's rearview mirrors, the interpretation about the car being effectively the driver under our safety standards - these interpretations are also teaching us. And so as we learn, we're going to be better and better at being able to keep pace with innovation, and I think safety will benefit as a result. SIEGEL: Tonight during rush hour, being in the cars that you've been in - the self-driving cars - would you feel confident driving home again or being driven home by a self-driving car? FOXX: (Laughter) I wouldn't say so, not yet. I think we've still got some ways to go, but I think it is within our line of sites. SIEGEL: That's U. S. Secretary of Transportation Anthony Fox. Secretary Foxx, thanks for talking with us. FOXX: Hey, thank you, Robert. SIEGEL: And tomorrow, we'll hear from Brian Soublet, deputy director and chief legal counsel for the California DMV. BRIAN SOUBLET: The person is the backup to the automated systems. We don't want to see vehicles just stopping in the roadway. There has to be some contemplation of how the vehicle would be controlled such that it doesn't become a danger to other motorists. SIEGEL: That's tomorrow as we hear more about the coming days of the self-driving car. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:   We begin today with this week's edition of All Tech Considered.

But news last week that an LA hospital paid a ransom worth $17,000 to hackers holding its computer data hostage raised new concerns about bigger targets. Experts say there are millions of these sorts of ransom attacks attempted each year. Some companies pay; others don't. To discuss how companies are responding to ransomware, we've called Adam Kujawa. He's head of malware intelligence at the security firm Malwarebytes. Welcome to the program. ADAM KUJAWA: Thanks for having me. CORNISH: So just how common have attacks on targets like a hospital become? KUJAWA: Well, you know, the attack vectors - rather, the victim - is pretty broad as far as who ransomware hackers are targeting. They go after everywhere from consumers - your average person - to businesses - small businesses, large businesses - anybody, really, they can get their hands on. CORNISH: Now, when you go to law enforcement, what happens? What kind of advice do you get? KUJAWA: Well, the FBI has come out pretty much telling people they should go ahead and pay the ransom. The security community itself tends to disagree with that, and often we tell people not to pay the ransom. CORNISH: But talk about that split a little bit more. Why do law enforcement essentially say pay up, and why would security folks such as yourself say hold out? KUJAWA: Well, I mean, the law enforcement - they're trying to get people, basically, back where they were. From the security community standpoint, whenever a victim pays, it not only encourages the actual criminal who's attacking the user or the company in this instance, but it also encourages other cybercriminals to do the same. CORNISH: What makes certain industries, say, like the medical industry, more vulnerable than others? KUJAWA: Well, the medical industry is - not only the fact that they often don't have the kind of resources or budget to invest in cybersecurity similar to other big corporations usually 'cause they're spending a lot of it on medical equipment and things like that, but the different kinds of equipment they have to use usually aren't updated as quickly as far as what operating system they run on or what kind of tools they have, which makes them vulnerable. CORNISH: I want to talk for a minute about Hollywood Presbyterian. This hospital paid the hackers. What assurance can it give patients that that data is safe? KUJAWA: Well, the data itself has been unencrypted according to the hospital after they paid the ransom. As far as assurance on whether or not it's safe from now on, the reality is that no data is really that safe because of just a lax amount of security that's employed by hospitals, organizations, things like that. I'm really trying to think of a good answer that sounds reassuring. (LAUGHTER)CORNISH: This is depressing. KUJAWA: Yeah. No, it is. CORNISH: Why can't you? Is there something - are certain industries vulnerable, and if so, why? KUJAWA: Every industry is vulnerable. A few years ago, we saw attacks - breaches from retailers like Target or Home Depot, so credit card information, personal information like that was stolen. We saw attacks against banks which went after things like personal details - your address, your phone number. We've seen attacks against insurance companies and other medical facilities. I mean, unfortunately, it seems to be a trend these days that after an attack happens to a particular industry, that industry starts paying a lot more attention to the cybersecurity measures. And in this case, with hospitals, I guarantee you that medical facilities, hospitals and things like that will start taking these kinds of attacks more seriously than they ever have before.

Apple is resisting a court order to unlock the phone used by one of the San Bernardino shooting suspects. The FBI says it wants access to just that one phone.

Enjoy your show. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Thank you, ma'am. FRANK MORRIS, BYLINE: At the annual RV show in Topeka, Kan. , retirees and younger families are strolling past rows of camper trailers to the sound of country music radio under American flags. Mike Glasgow says he doesn't think the government should be able to force Apple to help it defeat the iPhone's security. MIKE GLASGOW: I mean, they can't run the post office or health care or anything else, so I surely don't want their hands on my phone. MORRIS: A lot of people here though just aren't quite sure what to make of another situation where privacy and physical safety seem to be at odds. GEORGIA BONNER: People need their privacy. I mean, that's the way it is. And we have terrorists that are going around killing everybody. So this is one of those where there's a lot of gray area, so I don't know. MORRIS: Georgia Bonner's concerned about her iPhone-carrying grandkids. Tim McCoy doesn't want the phone in his pocket compromised. TIM MCCOY: I understand both sides of it. I kind of like Apple's position better because once you open that door, you know, it's - you can't close it. BETTY VIEUX: It's kind of iffy and scary. They're already hacking everything all around. MORRIS: Betty Vieux says cracking iPhone security would just make matters worse. This came to a head last week when a judge ordered Apple to help unlock an iPhone used by Syed Farook, one of the shooters who killed 14 people and wounded 20 in San Bernardino. The FBI can't get into the phone. Apple so far refused to help. GREG SMITH: Under the circumstances, I just feel that we should do everything in our - within our power, whether it be Apple or anybody else that would help provide whatever we need to keep this - keep America safe. MORRIS: Greg Smith says phone privacy just isn't that big of a deal to him personally. Dave Melcher feels the same. DAVE MELCHER: I ain't got nothing that I don't care if everybody knows (laughter) you know? I -you know, they - whatever they want, they can have as long as it keeps us safe. MORRIS: Sixty miles east in Kansas City, Mo. , people are sipping freshly-roasted coffee and artisanal cocktails in a place called Thou Mayest. Few here think Apple should acquiesce on privacy. NASH KILLSPRAY: I think what Apple has done is very brave and reassuring to people who think that, you know, bigger corporations are willing to fight for the little guy, you know what I'm saying? ELAINE EASON: And I think that's one of the biggest draws to Apple's brand is that they're known for their top-notch security. MORRIS: That's a musician calling himself Nash Killspray and Elaine Eason. They like Apple's stand on principle. But Elizabeth Sell sees something more pragmatic going on. ELIZABETH SELL: Because what Apple really cares about is losing customers and what the FBI cares about is keeping people safe. MORRIS: Most people here think the motivations involved are messier. And Bill Holzhueter doesn't think the resolution to this conflict is going to be any too transparent, either. BILL HOLZHUETER: What passes the courts will be one thing. But what the deals are actually reached between the intelligence agencies and the high-ups at Apple will probably be something we'll have to learn 50 years from now in a declassified document. MORRIS: Meantime, people across the country are talking about what scares them the most - terrorists, hackers in their own government. For NPR News, I'm Frank Morris in Kansas City.

MORRIS: Betty Vieux says cracking iPhone security would just make matters worse. This came to a head last week when a judge ordered Apple to help unlock an iPhone used by Syed Farook, one of the shooters who killed 14 people and wounded 20 in San Bernardino. The FBI can't get into the phone. Apple so far refused to help. GREG SMITH: Under the circumstances, I just feel that we should do everything in our - within our power, whether it be Apple or anybody else that would help provide whatever we need to keep this - keep America safe. MORRIS: Greg Smith says phone privacy just isn't that big of a deal to him personally. Dave Melcher feels the same. DAVE MELCHER: I ain't got nothing that I don't care if everybody knows (laughter) you know? I -you know, they - whatever they want, they can have as long as it keeps us safe. MORRIS: Sixty miles east in Kansas City, Mo. , people are sipping freshly-roasted coffee and artisanal cocktails in a place called Thou Mayest. Few here think Apple should acquiesce on privacy. NASH KILLSPRAY: I think what Apple has done is very brave and reassuring to people who think that, you know, bigger corporations are willing to fight for the little guy, you know what I'm saying? ELAINE EASON: And I think that's one of the biggest draws to Apple's brand is that they're known for their top-notch security. MORRIS: That's a musician calling himself Nash Killspray and Elaine Eason. They like Apple's stand on principle. But Elizabeth Sell sees something more pragmatic going on. ELIZABETH SELL: Because what Apple really cares about is losing customers and what the FBI cares about is keeping people safe. MORRIS: Most people here think the motivations involved are messier. And Bill Holzhueter doesn't think the resolution to this conflict is going to be any too transparent, either. BILL HOLZHUETER: What passes the courts will be one thing. But what the deals are actually reached between the intelligence agencies and the high-ups at Apple will probably be something we'll have to learn 50 years from now in a declassified document. MORRIS: Meantime, people across the country are talking about what scares them the most - terrorists, hackers in their own government.

Federal prosecutors want a look inside the iPhone used by one of the shooters in the mass killing in San Bernardino, Calif. Apple is resisting an order to do that. It turns out that Apple has fought this battle in court before. NPR's Joel Rose reports. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: The Brooklyn case starts with a drug dealer. Jun Feng pleaded guilty to selling methamphetamine. As part of its investigation, the FBI got a search warrant for Feng's iPhone. But the phone was locked by a pass code. So prosecutors asked a judge for an order compelling Apple to bypass the lock. This was all pretty routine, says Susan Hennessy. She's a former lawyer for the NSA who's now at the Brookings Institution. SUSAN HENNESSEY: In approximately 70 prior occasions, this exact situation had occurred. And Apple had elected to comply with the court order. GREENE: The fact that Apple had bypassed the lock on 70 phones in similar cases was revealed during a court hearing last October. Apple might have quietly done the same for Jun Feng's phone too, but something unusual happened. Federal magistrate Judge James Orenstein did not sign the order the government wanted. Instead, he went public and asked Apple if the company had any objections. JENNIFER GRANICK: What was remarkable is that the public hadn't seen the argument surfaced. ROSE: Jennifer Granick is with the Stanford Center for Internet and Society. GRANICK: Judge Orenstein had concerns about whether the government's legal argument for compelling Apple was a valid legal argument. ROSE: The judge seemed particularly skeptical that the government is relying in part on an 18th century law called the All Writs Act. Prosecutors say it gives them authority to compel companies like Apple to help carry out search warrants. Susan Hennessey at the Brookings Institution says the government probably expected Apple to comply, just like the company had dozens of times before. HENNESSEY: The All Writs Act, it's intended to be a gap-filling measure. This is precisely how All Writs has been applied throughout history. ROSE: But this time, lawyers for Apple disagreed. They said the company had complied when the law seemed settled. But in October, Apple's lawyers argued that the government was actually asking for something novel, the power to force a tech company to defeat the security on one of its own devices. It's similar to the argument that's now playing out in California, where the FBI wants Apple to unlock the iPhone of Sayed Farook. ALEX ABDO: The cases are different. But the underlying legal question is very similar. ROSE: Alex Abdo is a lawyer with the ACLU. ABDO: The question in the New York case is whether the government can rely on this very old statute to conscript Apple into government service. ROSE: There are some key differences between the two cases. The defendant's iPhone in New York was using an older operating system, which makes it relatively easy for Apple to bypass the lock. The iPhone in California is running Apple's newer operating system. And the company says it would have to write software to get into the phone. Alex Abdo at the ACLU says that's a conscious change by Apple. ABDO: Because they didn't want to be in a position, they told the court, of having to serve as a government investigative agent. They wanted to be out of the business of spying on their customers. ROSE: That may be especially important to Apple in international markets, where security is a big selling point. But U. S. law enforcement is frustrated by that argument. Federal prosecutors say Apple is putting its own public relations interests ahead of national security. They think Apple could easily defeat the security on phone in California and Brooklyn, just like it's done 70 times before. Joel Rose, NPR News, New York.

Navy does pretty much the same thing. GPS and digital charts have become the norm aboard many of its vessels, but the Navy is worried about electronic warfare. So as NPR's Geoff Brumfiel reports, it's returning to an ancient technique - navigating by the stars. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: It's a Monday at the U. S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md. , and the midshipmen are getting ready for their first lecture on celestial navigation. DANIEL STAYTON: So raise your hand if you have ever determined your location on the planet using the stars. BRUMFIEL: Lt. Daniel Stayton is leading the class. A midshipmen halfheartedly put ups her hand. STAYTON: So at least one. All right, so I've got to stick to the truth then. I can't just make stuff up. BRUMFIEL: Right up until the mid-20th century, navigation on the sea was done by looking at the heavens above. But starting in the late 1970s, the military began launching GPS satellites and everything changed. In 2000, the U. S. Navy began phasing out sextants and charts in favor of computers. Rear Adm. Michael White is in charge of the Navy's training. MICHAEL WHITE: We do periodic reviews of our curriculum to make sure we're teaching the most appropriate material in the time allotted. We don't have infinite training time available. BRUMFIEL: Training became focused on the Navy's equivalent of Google Maps, something called the Voyage Management System. It uses GPS, radar and other tools to precisely track a ship's position and course across the ocean. But after a decade of focusing on electronic training, the Navy is reversing course, and there are a couple of reasons why. First, the U. S. military is increasingly worried it's overly reliant on GPS. BRIAN WEEDEN: We use it to synchronize all the military operations. We use it to navigate everywhere. It's - you know, it's just something that the U. S. military really can't live without. BRUMFIEL: Brian Weeden is with the Secure World Foundation, a nonprofit that studies security issues in outer space, where GPS satellites orbit. In a big war, the satellites could be shot down or, more likely, the GPS signal could be jammed or hacked. Already, jamming is becoming more common, Weeden says. WEEDEN: You can buy all kinds of GPS jammers off the Internet. Well, a lot of those are made by Russia. BRUMFIEL: He thinks the Russians probably have systems to jam the special signals the military uses as well. And China may be developing similar capabilities. Adm. White, who heads the Navy's training, says there's also a desire to get back to basics. Over the past decade, navigation systems on ships have gotten easier to use, so less training is required. He says the Navy is bringing back celestial navigation to make sure its officers understand the fundamentals. WHITE: You know, I would equate it to, like, blindly following the navigation system in your car. If you don't kind of have an understanding of north, south, you know, east, west or perhaps where you're going, it takes you to places you didn't intend to go. BRUMFIEL: In fact, there's been at least one incident in the past decade where a Navy ship ran aground in part, investigators say, because of problems with the electronic navigation system. Back in the classroom, the midshipmen are finishing up their first course. And frankly, they seem a little bewildered. Twenty-year-old Audrey Channell says until now, celestial navigation wasn't on her radar. AUDREY CHANNELL: I mean, obviously I've heard of, you know, in the old days using stars to navigate. But I never thought I'd actually be using it. BRUMFIEL: Like many of the other midshipmen in this class, she uses GPS in her daily life. Her instructor says, that's OK. No one is expecting these future officers to become Magellans overnight. Geoff Brumfiel, NPR News. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:   You know, many of us rely on our smartphones to get from point A to point B.

Critics say many of those new streetcar projects are running into unexpected roadblocks. NPR's Joel Rose reports from New York, where city leaders have proposed a multi-billion dollar streetcar to connect Brooklyn and Queens. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: On a map, Red Hook looks like a little elbow of land jutting out into New York Harbor. It doesn't seem far from the rest of Brooklyn, but it's cut off by water and a major highway. JACKIE SOTO: I mean, Red Hook is isolated. ROSE: Jackie Soto lives in a big public housing development, one of several in the neighborhood. She says it's a long walk to the nearest subway station. SOTO: There's only really one way into Red Hook, and that's it. We only have the buses that come in and out. ROSE: But Soto says those buses are slow. Nicholas Aviles says he'd rather walk to his job than take the bus. Aviles would love to see more public transit options to connect Red Hook with the rest of the city. NICHOLAS AVILES: It is a good idea 'cause, like, right now, I'm walking to work all the way over there. I could be taking that to work. You know what I'm saying? ROSE: That's exactly what New York Mayor Bill de Blasio has in mind. This month, de Blasio unveiled some details of his plan to build a 16-mile streetcar connecting waterfront neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens, including some of the fastest-growing parts of the city. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BILL DE BLASIO: This will create connections between many neighborhoods. It'll connect them all to each other in a way that's never been true before. Every time we give people more options, it not only makes their lives better, it gives them more access to jobs, it makes their commute shorter. ROSE: The $2. 5 billion plan has the backing of some public transit advocates and prominent real estate developers whose property values figure to rise if the streetcar gets built. But not everyone is on board. MARC SCRIBNER: This isn't really a mobility-enhancing technology. This is a government subsidy to property developers. ROSE: Marc Scribner is a research fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute in Washington. He points to other streetcar systems around the nation that never got up to speed, including the D. C. streetcar, which is said to begin carrying passengers this weekend after years of delays. For months, empty cars have been rolling up and down H Street in an extended safety test. Scribner blames the troubled roll-out on poor planning by the city. SCRIBNER: Part of the problem is you're dealing with bureaucracies that really didn't understand what all went into this. And then part of the problem is it's just sort of inherent with the technology. ROSE: Scribner says streetcars are hard to maneuver in traffic, so any streetcar that has to share the road with cars and buses is inevitably going to be slow and unreliable. And he points to what's happening in Atlanta. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Welcome aboard the Atlanta streetcar bound for King historic district. ROSE: Atlanta's streetcar system opened in 2014. Ridership has been disappointing, especially since it starting collecting a fare earlier this year. Some riders complain the streetcar is just too slow to be useful. AMBER MCQUEEN: Yeah, sometimes it is a little quicker to walk. ROSE: Atlanta resident Amber McQueen commutes on the streetcar anyway, but she's surprised at how few other riders she sees. MCQUEEN: I'm really trying to figure out in my mind how are they able to operate it with so little traffic? It's not a lot of people who use it. ROSE: Even public transit advocates are starting to have their doubts. Jarrett Walker is a transportation consultant in Portland, Ore. , the city that's widely credited with launching the streetcar revival more than a decade ago. Walker says Portland's streetcar did spur major investment in downtown but as transportation, it hasn't lived up to the hype. JARRETT WALKER: Streetcar is one of those really problematic words because the real estate industry loves it. But more and more, transit advocates are looking at what's been built in the name of streetcar revival and saying no, this isn't durable long-term, great public transit.

SHAHANI: Facebook is mapping the human population in different countries too to figure out the best way to provide Wi-Fi. Clearly, Facebook is becoming more than an app. But when asked if the California-based company should be subject to the same regulations that apply to mobile carriers in the different countries it's entering, Zuckerberg said decisively no. He doesn't build physical networks like the mobile operators. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ZUCKERBERG: We're not doing those things. Our business is fundamentally different.

Facebook's products, like messing services and voice-calling services, are challenging his business.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ZUCKERBERG: We're this year going to launch our first satellite over Africa. SHAHANI: Facebook is also convening the various companies that lay the cables and sell the data plans worldwide so that everyone can figure out together how to do more for less. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ZUCKERBERG: And if that goes well, then maybe some of that savings will get passed along to consumers in terms of cheaper data plans. SHAHANI: Facebook is mapping the human population in different countries too to figure out the best way to provide Wi-Fi. Clearly, Facebook is becoming more than an app. But when asked if the California-based company should be subject to the same regulations that apply to mobile carriers in the different countries it's entering, Zuckerberg said decisively no. He doesn't build physical networks like the mobile operators. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ZUCKERBERG: We're not doing those things. Our business is fundamentally different. SHAHANI: Lovemore Nyatsine, with Econet Wireless, a Zimbabwe carrier, says Zuckerberg is not playing fair. Facebook's products, like messing services and voice-calling services, are challenging his business. LOVEMORE NYATSINE: I think what's very clear is that when you look at Facebook, they are freeloaders. SHAHANI: He says as Facebook's functions look more and more like mobile carriers, it should be regulated that way.

NPR's Laura Sydell looks at the company under Tim Cook. LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE: Looking back at Tim Cook's public appearances in the last few years makes the standoff with the government look almost inevitable. Here he is at a cyber security summit speaking in front of President Obama at a time when tech companies were on edge following Edward Snowden's revelations about hacking by the NSA. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TIM COOK: If those of us in positions of responsibility fail to do everything in our power to protect the right of privacy, we risk something far more valuable than money. We risk our way of life. SYDELL: And Tim Cook has not been afraid to confront the government on issues he considers morally important. Last year, he wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post speaking out against state legislation that he believed would let businesses deny services to gay, lesbian and transgender people. Cook himself came out as gay in the pages of Bloomberg Businessweek. NEIL SEIBERT: Tim Cook is much more comfortable than many CEOs taking stances on issues that impact all of us. SYDELL: Analyst Neil Seibert founded the website Above Avalon which follows Apple. Under Cook's leadership, Apple is now using 100 percent renewable energy in the U. S. and China, and it's worked to improve conditions at its manufacturing plants in China. SEIBERT: It's about trying to tell the world certain ideals that represent Apple. SYDELL: Even under Apple founder Steve Jobs, the company did emphasize values. Remember the Think Different ad campaign that used pictures of the Dalai Lama, Amelia Earhart, Mahatma Gandhi? But Jobs focused on the integrity of Apple's products. Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan, Ross School of Business sees a change under Cook. ERIK GORDON: Apple's a different company. It just doesn't seem to have that excitement that it used to have. The new products are not knocking people out, and you know, the CEO is not providing that kind of leadership. SYDELL: Under Cook, Apple has a new product line with the Apple Watch, but it hasn't generated the kind of excitement that the iPod, iPhone or iPad did. Still, Cook can't be called a failure. Under his leadership, the company released a larger version of the iPhone to record sales. Kellie McElhaney, a professor at UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business, says Cook has a great team of people, and unlike Jobs, he delegates. KELLIE MCELHANEY: Let's not forget. He's not operating alone. He has a very intelligent, quite-capable, quite-successful senior leadership team who's obviously at the table with him. He's got a trove of advisers. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Singing) Oh, freedom. SYDELL: This week, protesters lined up in front of Apple stores nationwide to show support for the company's stance on privacy. MALKIA CYRIL: The FBI is reaching for power, and I want to hear you say, hell no. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: Hell no. CYRIL: Say, hell no. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: Hell no. CYRIL: Say, hell no. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: Hell no. SYDELL: Malkia Cyril of the Center for Media Justice says as an African-American activist, she's aware of the history of government surveillance of black activists, and that's why Apple's got her support.

It's probably an Internet search, and it's probably Google. That's what many voters are doing right now, and this is why presidential campaigns spend a lot of time and a lot of resources to make sure it's their website, not something else that pops up at the top of search results. Here's NPR's Scott Detrow. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: In February 2011, Eric Sherred was feeling good. The Republican had just landed a new assignment working on Rick Santorum's presidential campaign as a digital strategist. Part of the job - search engine optimization - making sure the campaign's website turned up high in Google searches. So Sherred was pretty happy. That is, until he went home, turned on Comedy Central and saw Stephen Colbert tell people to Google Rick Santorum. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE COLBERT REPORT\")STEPHEN COLBERT: And if you're eating nachos, you might want to put them down. (LAUGHTER)COLBERT: OK, so here's his problem. When you Google Santorum, the first result you get is, quote. . . DETROW: And we have to stop the clip right there. Just know it's gross - really. The segment aired the day Sherred found out he'd be working on the campaign. ERIC SHERRED: I just - I went home. I watched it, and it was just one of those most defeating moments because you're, like, well. . . DETROW: Now, this problem had been dogging Santorum for years at that point. It was the result of an online stunt by Dan Savage - sex columnist who was upset by Santorum's views on homosexuality. Nearly a decade earlier, Savage had enlisted a digital army to create an unpleasant association with Santorum's name. SHERRED: This was, actually, pretty much our top priority. DETROW: The hostile site was an extreme example of what every campaign has to deal with. There's a lot of negative material out there, and campaigns need to make sure their websites are popping up ahead of those other sites in people's search engines. SHERRED: Because when you're interested in something, you know, the common thought is, well, I'm going to Google it. And with that, you want to be sure that you're at the top of the results page. DETROW: So Sherred and his team got to work. SHERRED: So one of the things that we made a big focus on was posting content that actually contained, you know, Senator Santorum - Rick Santorum's name every single day. DETROW: Google's search algorithm is secret, but outside links always play a big role. Sherred says they'd reach out to friendly bloggers, asking for links. This sort of digital grunt work is par for the course for political campaigns. Because so many voters turn to Google and other search engines to learn about candidates, observers are paying more and more attention to search trends. Republican digital strategist Patrick Ruffini has been studying Google Trends data in the days before this year's primaries and caucuses. PATRICK RUFFINI: Particularly that very last day, in the morning of, you usually see something interesting that later gets borne out in some way in the election results. DETROW: Like in New Hampshire, where searches for John Kasich skyrocketed ahead of his surprise second-place finish. In fact, Ruffini says Republican candidates' final share of search totals have been eerily similar to the percentage of votes they ended up with. RUFFINI: It matched up to within a point or two in South Carolina, and it was almost as close in New Hampshire. DETROW: That's not to say we should throw out exit polls Bernie Sanders has consistently outpaced Hillary Clinton on search traffic, probably because she's been a national figure for decades. As for Eric Sherred and the Santorum campaign, they kept plugging away, post after post, link after link. And then one day a few weeks before the 2012 Iowa caucuses, it happened. SHERRED: We were very, very proud that one day when we finally, you know, clicked around and said, we're number one. We finally did it. So it's - that was a big day for us. DETROW: All that hard work had paid off, so much so that four years later, when he ran a second time, Rick Santorum had no problem asking voters to go ahead and Google him. Scott Detrow, NPR News.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TIM COOK: What is at stake here is can the government compel Apple to write software that we believe would make hundreds of millions of customers vulnerable around the world, including the U. S. , and also trample civil liberties that are at the basic foundation of what this country was made on? GREENE: That is Apple CEO Tim Cook in an interview on ABC News' \"World News Tonight With David Muir\" last night. This standoff between Apple and the government continues to escalate, and it's happening very publicly. Here now to discuss why tensions are running so high is NPR tech reporter Aarti Shahani. She's at a big tech conference in Barcelona right now, and she's on the line. Aarti, good morning. AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: Good morning. GREENE: So public opinion, as we have reported, is so divided on this case. But it does not sound like Tim Cook is giving any ground at all here. SHAHANI: No, not at all. And it's really breathtaking to watch the responses inside the industry. You know, as you mentioned, right now I'm in Barcelona at this huge tech conference. And people are super divided on Cook's stance. For some, he's a hero. And for other, he's just an American businessman who doesn't want to be subject to regulation. And, you know, I remember back in San Francisco earlier this month, I was at a smaller cybersecurity gathering organized by Google. And people there were saying that they think the FBI is going to stop banging the drum on backdoors. You know, then the FBI went after Apple. GREENE: But what the FBI is doing, Aarti, I mean, is talking about one phone, right? So, I mean, can you explain why Tim Cook is using such dramatic language and talking about how unlocking this one phone will make all Apple customers this vulnerable? SHAHANI: Yeah, let's take an analogy that's been floating around. Say the iPhone is a safe in a bank. GREENE: OK. SHAHANI: So, you know, police want to get into the safe - see if there's drugs there or something. So they ask the bank to help crack the combo lock or, you know, give them unlimited time to crack it themselves. Well, here's where that analogy falls apart. In the physical world, you're just cracking the combo for a specific safe in a specific bank. When that safe is digital, when it's software inside an iPhone, it's code that's shared by every single safe - every iPhone. So when you figure out how to crack that code, you've created a master key. And yeah, you know, you can say we're just going to use it this one time. But you can't control if that really happens or if it falls into the wrong hands. GREENE: Tim Cook basically saying, you create this master key, and you can say all you want that you're going to be able to hide it, but someone might get their hands on it. SHAHANI: Right, exactly. GREENE: Sound like a legitimate argument. But what's the other side say? SHAHANI: You know, he's right about the way encryption works. That's just factually correct. But when he says that there is no precedent, you know, that's not really true. Cook wrote in that letter to customers that day the California court decision came out, he said, quote, \"we can find no precedent for an American company being forced to expose its customers to a greater risk of attack. \" You know, well, back in the 1990s, the company Microsoft wanted to use a certain kind of strong encryption. But U. S. regulators said no; if you want to sell overseas, we think your software is so strong it's basically a weapon, and we're going to ban you from exporting that weapon. So Microsoft had to basically weaken its product so they could enter into foreign markets. So that definitely impacted privacy and exposed customers to greater risk. GREENE: OK, so debate for precedent there is one part of this. How does this get resolved? You have this deadline looming tomorrow for Apple to respond to this court order. SHAHANI: That's right. They have to respond by tomorrow. And, you know, they'll make their legal case. But Cook also suggested last night that maybe there's another way to address the situation. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)COOK: This is not what should be happening in America. If there should be a law that compels us to do it, it should be passed out in the open, and the people of America should get a voice in that. The right place for that debate to occur is in Congress. GREENE: OK, so he basically wants a different branch of government to handle this. He wants this decided in Congress, where he and FBI Director James Comey are both scheduled to testify next week. I mean, it sounds like quite a showdown. SHAHANI: Yeah, there will be fireworks. GREENE: All right, that's NPR tech reporter Aarti Shahani reporting for us in Barcelona, where she is attending a big tech conference. Aarti, thanks. SHAHANI: Thank you. DAVID GREENE, HOST:   The software equivalent of cancer - that is how Apple CEO Tim Cook is describing code the government wants Apple to write so the FBI can unlock the iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino terrorists. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TIM COOK: What is at stake here is can the government compel Apple to write software that we believe would make hundreds of millions of customers vulnerable around the world, including the U. S. , and also trample civil liberties that are at the basic foundation of what this country was made on? GREENE: That is Apple CEO Tim Cook in an interview on ABC News' \"World News Tonight With David Muir\" last night. This standoff between Apple and the government continues to escalate, and it's happening very publicly. Here now to discuss why tensions are running so high is NPR tech reporter Aarti Shahani. She's at a big tech conference in Barcelona right now, and she's on the line. Aarti, good morning. AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: Good morning. GREENE: So public opinion, as we have reported, is so divided on this case. But it does not sound like Tim Cook is giving any ground at all here. SHAHANI: No, not at all. And it's really breathtaking to watch the responses inside the industry. You know, as you mentioned, right now I'm in Barcelona at this huge tech conference. And people are super divided on Cook's stance. For some, he's a hero. And for other, he's just an American businessman who doesn't want to be subject to regulation. And, you know, I remember back in San Francisco earlier this month, I was at a smaller cybersecurity gathering organized by Google. And people there were saying that they think the FBI is going to stop banging the drum on backdoors. You know, then the FBI went after Apple. GREENE: But what the FBI is doing, Aarti, I mean, is talking about one phone, right? So, I mean, can you explain why Tim Cook is using such dramatic language and talking about how unlocking this one phone will make all Apple customers this vulnerable? SHAHANI: Yeah, let's take an analogy that's been floating around. Say the iPhone is a safe in a bank. GREENE: OK. SHAHANI: So, you know, police want to get into the safe - see if there's drugs there or something. So they ask the bank to help crack the combo lock or, you know, give them unlimited time to crack it themselves. Well, here's where that analogy falls apart. In the physical world, you're just cracking the combo for a specific safe in a specific bank. When that safe is digital, when it's software inside an iPhone, it's code that's shared by every single safe - every iPhone. So when you figure out how to crack that code, you've created a master key. And yeah, you know, you can say we're just going to use it this one time. But you can't control if that really happens or if it falls into the wrong hands. GREENE: Tim Cook basically saying, you create this master key, and you can say all you want that you're going to be able to hide it, but someone might get their hands on it. SHAHANI: Right, exactly. GREENE: Sound like a legitimate argument. But what's the other side say? SHAHANI: You know, he's right about the way encryption works. That's just factually correct. But when he says that there is no precedent, you know, that's not really true. Cook wrote in that letter to customers that day the California court decision came out, he said, quote, \"we can find no precedent for an American company being forced to expose its customers to a greater risk of attack. \" You know, well, back in the 1990s, the company Microsoft wanted to use a certain kind of strong encryption. But U. S. regulators said no; if you want to sell overseas, we think your software is so strong it's basically a weapon, and we're going to ban you from exporting that weapon. So Microsoft had to basically weaken its product so they could enter into foreign markets. So that definitely impacted privacy and exposed customers to greater risk. GREENE: OK, so debate for precedent there is one part of this. How does this get resolved? You have this deadline looming tomorrow for Apple to respond to this court order. SHAHANI: That's right. They have to respond by tomorrow. And, you know, they'll make their legal case. But Cook also suggested last night that maybe there's another way to address the situation. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) COOK: This is not what should be happening in America. If there should be a law that compels us to do it, it should be passed out in the open, and the people of America should get a voice in that. The right place for that debate to occur is in Congress.

Jarrod Burguan is police chief of San Bernardino, Calif. That's where two people conducted a mass-shooting last year, including one who used an Apple iPhone that the FBI wants to open. Apple is resisting that demand to help. In his first remarks on this issue, Chief Burguan told us he favors unlocking the phone even if there's little inside. JARROD BURGUAN: I'll be honest with you, I think that there is a reasonably good chance that there is nothing of any value on the phone. What we are hoping might be on the phone would be potential contacts that we would obviously want to talk to. INSKEEP: Do you think there may be a less intrusive way to get at the information that might be there if there is anything of value? BURGUAN: Not that I'm aware of. This is an effort to leave no stone unturned in the investigation. And this is something that to allow this phone to sit there and not make an effort to get the information or the data that may be inside of that phone is simply not fair to the victims and their families. The worst-case scenario obviously, is that maybe there was some information on there that would lead to a larger plot or to a larger network and therefore are other people out there that are still a potential danger. I think the probability is probably low, but it could be. INSKEEP: Are you fearful that this form of encryption will completely change the rules of the game? BURGUAN: I think it very well could, yes. INSKEEP: Let me ask though because you're probably well aware that even before the San Bernardino shooting, federal law enforcement officials and other law enforcement officials were raising concerns about encryption and urging some kind of change in the rules, some kind of solution so they could get easier access to phones. Has it crossed your mind that you're being used a little bit in this situation, that this case is being used as an example to advance that agenda which was already there? BURGUAN: No, no. I keep in mind that law enforcement across the board is concerned about this encryption issue. You know, I'll be honest with you, I have an Apple phone. I have an iPad. I am a bit of a fan of Apple products. I don't necessarily see this as a fight of the FBI against Apple. In this particular case, Apple is challenging the FBI's request, so to speak, to overcome that encryption. But the larger issue here is do we want companies to have the right to create something that would be that much of potential danger? INSKEEP: Although Apple argues that if the government is given this right that's going to make your information less secure over time. Is that an acceptable price for you to pay? BURGUAN: At the speed of technology, this particular operating system will be obsolete in six months to a year. It'll be completely replaced by a new system and whatever version of iOS this is will be, you know, useless in a short period of time. INSKEEP: So you're not going to feel any less secure about your Apple devices if this court order is complied with. BURGUAN: No. No. INSKEEP: Jarrod Burguan is police chief in San Bernardino, Calif.

By that I mean, they insert everything from computer chips to LED lights into their bodies. This week in Austin, about 300 body hackers gathered to share ideas and techniques at a first-of-its-kind conference in the U. S. NPR's Eyder Peralta went there to explore the ethics and philosophy behind this cyborg movement. EYDER PERALTA, BYLINE: Amal Graafstra is sitting in the middle of an exhibit hall filled with booths on everything from exercise equipment to meditation techniques to brain scanning caps. He's getting ready to implant microchips in a long line of people. The guy who's next in line is sporting a mohawk. AMAL GRAAFSTRA: You're doing right hand? UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: (Unintelligible). GRAAFSTRA: Ready? PERALTA: A huge needle pierces his hand, and a chip that's a bit bigger than a grain of rice slips under his skin. The RFID chips can hold encrypted information, and their unique ID number can be used to open doors or unlock your smartphones. That's what the guy with the mohawk wants to do. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: No longer do I have to worry about the thumbprint or putting in a password. PERALTA: Across the way, Sascha Rose (ph), who was working at a meditation booth, wonders if it's a good idea to embed personal data into your body. SASCHA ROSE: That's why it's crazy to me, actually - is 'cause people are just willing to just line up and go - yeah, stick that in me. PERALTA: That night, I meet with Amal Graafstra who is chipped and has a magnet in his finger that he says let's him sense some magnetic fields. He's outside a club with Ryan O'Shea, whose company makes LED devices that light up under the skin. Graafstra says we live in a new world, where technology can improve the human body instead of just fixing what's broken. GRAAFSTRA: Like, a patient may someday come, you know,  very soon and say my eye is totally fine, but I want, like, a eye that can see infrared. And I want an eye that can zoom. PERALTA: O'Shea says that people are only freaked out about these devices because they're not thinking about them logically. O'SHEA: I think once people realize, oh, it's OK that my grandma has a pacemaker, a magnet's much less invasive than that - people are going to start to accept this. You know, the era of transhumanism, I would say, is here. So let's accept that and then see where that logically takes us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)PERALTA: Inside the club, there's a drone hovering above the dance floor, and Tony Salvador is at a table near the bar. He's an anthropologist for Intel who studies social values and how they affect technology. He says that sometimes technology moves too fast and accepted social boundaries, not to mention the law, don't keep up. That's part of the reason, he says, that people who wore Google Glass were called glassholes - with the G. TONY SALVADOR: It created a social misunderstanding. You didn't know what was going on. PERALTA: He says that it's up to philosophers to help set those boundaries, and they're letting us down. SALVADOR: There are too few of them. They are too esoteric, and we're not actually addressing the moral and ethical issues and saying these are the right ways to go. PERALTA: So later, of course, I call a philosopher. I ask Alva Noe, a Berkeley professor who's written books on cyborgian naturalness and also blogs for NPR, about society's tolerance for artificially enhancing the body. ALVA NOE: We don't condemn people for using glasses to see better. But we do start to think taking speed to cope with, you know, your work life is a - is questionable. PERALTA: But Noe says society may never settle on just where we draw the line. NOE: We may reach consensuses and then lose them, just as there was once a consensus where it was OK to smoke to function effectively. And now we have the consensus that, increasingly, it's not OK to do that. PERALTA: Back outside the convention center in Austin, I meet with a guy who's considered the rock star of the body hacking movement. He's Neil Harbisson, a colorblind artist from Barcelona, who has a camera screwed to the back of his skull. The lens arcs over his head and dangles in front of his face. He calls it an antenna because it detects the color in front of him and translates it into musical notes. NEIL HARBISSON: The traffic light now is A. It was F a moment ago. PERALTA: When he gave the keynote address, he said the first time he heard those colors while dreaming, he felt truly cyborg. Now, he identifies not as human, but as a, quote, \"cybernetic organism. \"HARBISSON: If we define ourselves as organisms, suddenly our group is wider. We are on the same level as an insect or as a cat or as a plant. PERALTA: But he's well aware of how the world perceives him. On more than one occasion, he says, people have tried to rip off his antenna. I ask him if he's ever thought about just taking it off. HARBISSON: To me, it's much stronger, the wish to sense what's around me than the fact that people keep annoying me.

Alexa can dim the lights, convert cooking measurements, even act as your alarm clock. It's been on the market since 2014 but slowly gaining converts. But who needs another gadget, really? We're skeptical. So we asked The Boston Globe's Hiawatha Bray to explain the appeal. Hiawatha, thanks for being with us. HIAWATHA BRAY: Glad to be here. MARTIN: You own an echo, I understand. BRAY: Yeah. Well, I sort of borrowed one from Amazon. But I haven't been quite willing to give it back yet because it's such an impressive device. MARTIN: How come? BRAY: It really is a - how come? Because what it is is one of the early examples of this much-hyped concept that begins to show you some of the stuff - just a tiny hint - of why this could turn out to be such a transformative technology in the way we live our lives. I mean, when you're sitting there in your room and you want to know the news, you can just say, Alexa, give me a news bulletin. And it starts playing headlines from NPR or the BBC. If you want to know the weather, it tells you the weather. If you have music on your Amazon Prime account, you can say, play my favorite music by - I don't know - Broms (ph). But the point is to take just about everything electronic in your house and have it set up so that it can be controlled with verbal commands from Alexa. MARTIN: By Amazon - we're talking about Amazon taking over the controls of my home? BRAY: Well, not Amazon. They're just giving you the tool that allows you to do it. MARTIN: OK. BRAY: It connects to your Wi-Fi. Already there are Wi-Fi-enabled light bulbs. There are Wi-Fi-enabled home security systems. There are Wi-Fi-enabled thermostats. So you can easily imagine a future in which you walk into your home and say, Alexa, turn on CNN. Set the temperature to 70 degrees. And heat the oven to 400. MARTIN: Wow. BRAY: Ford Motor Company later this year is coming up with an Alexa-compatible car. You want to start your car up on a frosty morning so it's already warm when you get there? Say, Alexa, start the car. Out back, your car starts up. MARTIN: Wow. BRAY: That's coming from Ford this year. Absolutely, that's just one example. Everything's going to be connected. MARTIN: You are blowing my mind (laughter). BRAY: I mean, that's the world we're facing. And there are challenges. Don't get me wrong. There are serious challenges. And there's plenty of evidence that right now, people haven't really figured out how we're going to secure all this stuff. MARTIN: Yeah. BRAY: Because it - the data security and privacy challenges are gigantic. And you're right to be concerned about that. But on the other hand, this is going to be so cool. MARTIN: (Laughter). BRAY: I mean, this is going to be wonderful. MARTIN: Privacy schmivacy (ph). (Laughter). BRAY: Yeah, I mean, imagine - I don't know. I don't think we're there yet. You know, one of the problems is that Amazon isn't - their system isn't as intelligent as Google, for example. Of all the speech recognition stuff out there, Google's - Google now is my favorite because Google knows so much. It usually gives better answers than any of the others. But the other guys are going to catch up. And so you're going to eventually have incredibly smart stuff where you're going to just be able to ask - you know, you saw the commercial where he said, how many Super Bowls did Dan Marino win? Eventually, you're going to be able to ask even more complex questions. And these things are going to be able to just give you the answer. It's going to be fantastic.

BRAY: Ford Motor Company later this year is coming up with an Alexa-compatible car. You want to start your car up on a frosty morning so it's already warm when you get there? Say, Alexa, start the car. Out back, your car starts up. MARTIN: Wow. BRAY: That's coming from Ford this year. Absolutely, that's just one example. Everything's going to be connected. MARTIN: You are blowing my mind (laughter). BRAY: I mean, that's the world we're facing. And there are challenges. Don't get me wrong. There are serious challenges. And there's plenty of evidence that right now, people haven't really figured out how we're going to secure all this stuff. MARTIN: Yeah. BRAY: Because it - the data security and privacy challenges are gigantic. And you're right to be concerned about that. But on the other hand, this is going to be so cool. MARTIN: (Laughter). BRAY: I mean, this is going to be wonderful. MARTIN: Privacy schmivacy (ph). (Laughter). BRAY: Yeah, I mean, imagine - I don't know. I don't think we're there yet. You know, one of the problems is that Amazon isn't - their system isn't as intelligent as Google, for example. Of all the speech recognition stuff out there, Google's - Google now is my favorite because Google knows so much. It usually gives better answers than any of the others. But the other guys are going to catch up. And so you're going to eventually have incredibly smart stuff where you're going to just be able to ask - you know, you saw the commercial where he said, how many Super Bowls did Dan Marino win? Eventually, you're going to be able to ask even more complex questions. And these things are going to be able to just give you the answer. It's going to be fantastic.

Members of the House Judiciary Committee grilled FBI director James Comey and Apple's top lawyer. NPR tech reporter Aarti Shahani joins us now to discuss how this debate between privacy and security is playing out in Congress. Hey, Aarti. AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: Hi. SHAPIRO: The FBI has said this case is about just that single iPhone that was used in San Bernardino. Did Comey maintain that position today? SHAHANI: No, he did a 180 on that, or I should say, he was cornered into admitting it's not just about this one case. There's this key exchange where Representative John Conyers kept pushing Comey on that. Comey was evasive, and then Conyers posed a yes-or-no question. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOHN CONYERS: If you succeed in this case, will the FBI return to the courts in future cases to demand that Apple and other private companies assist you in unlocking secure devices? JAMES COMEY: Potentially, yes. SHAHANI: Now, this is exactly what Apple's been saying, that the FBI is trying to establish a precedent. And actually, New York's district attorney, Cyrus Vance, another expert witness today - he's saying he's got 170-plus iPhones he'd like some help unlocking. So this all raises another public safety concern. If Apple creates a process to keep unlocking phones, bypassing encryption, then couldn't the tools fall into the hands of the bad guys? Another expert witness argued this debate is not really about privacy versus security. It's about security versus security - the ability of police to investigate versus the ability of technology to protect consumers from hackers. SHAPIRO: So far, the courts have been split. California ruled in favor of the FBI, and just yesterday, a New York judge ruled in favor of Apple. What do the lawmakers want? SHAHANI: Well, you know, Congress is scratching its head. Zoe Lofgren raised the issue of China. China passed their own cyber security law at the end of last year. The Chinese government decided to not make their tech companies build in backdoors, ways for the government to read encrypted messages. And now Lofgren's saying China is revisiting that. So she's concerned that the U. S. is sending the wrong signal abroad. Meanwhile, another Democrat, Luis Gutierrez, sounded a lot more sympathetic to law enforcement. He indicated maybe we're letting private companies create places that are above the law, as in - you know, with a warrant, police can search every physical place in which you go. Are we creating warrant-proof zones in the digital world? SHAPIRO: And what about the witness from Apple? What did lawmakers ask there? SHAHANI: Apple got a lot of support in that room. Lots of people in Congress use iPhones. But Congressman Trey Gowdy of South Carolina - he felt Apple was taking a really hard-line stance on privacy, and he asked Apple's lead attorney, Bruce Sewell, basically, does Apple every think it should break its own code in a national security emergency? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TREY GOWDY: Whether it be nuclear weaponry, whether it be a terrorist plot, can you imagine a fact pattern where you would do what the Bureau is asking? BRUCE SEWELL: Where we would create a tool that doesn't. . . GOWDY: Yes. SEWELL: . . . Exist in order to reduce the. . . GOWDY: Yes. SEWELL: . . . Security and safety of our users. GOWDY: Yes. SEWELL: I'm not aware of such a fact pattern. GOWDY: So there is no balancing to be done. You have already concluded that you're not going to do it. SHAPIRO: So it sounds like there's a real spread of opinion among lawmakers on how to regulate encryption. Is that really the essential question here? SHAHANI: Well, there is another issue that came up quite strongly, in fact. It's the issue of, is it that the iPhone is too strong, or is it that the FBI's cyber investigation skills in the 21st century - is that just too weak? So FBI is pushing Apple to write code for it, and maybe the FBI needs to figure out how to unlock phones themselves, and maybe Congress should focus on funding that.

That's actually not a figure of speech, it is a literal fact. On February 14, one of Google's self-driving prototypes hit a bus. STACEY HENDLER ROSS: When it pulled out into the lane, our bus was already going by. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  That's Stacey Hendler Ross, a spokesperson for the Valley Transportation Authority in Santa Clara, Calif. She says the self-driving car was apparently trying to get around some sandbags in the street as the city bus was passing. ROSS: So these buses on this particular product are extended, are what we call articulated buses, and they have sort of an accordion in the middle. And the driverless car sort of pulled out into the middle of the lane and it struck the middle of the bus. CORNISH: Pow (ph), right in the accordion part. SHAPIRO: Pow (ph). CORNISH: Yeah. SHAPIRO: Google admits the bus had the right of way, and they say they bear some responsibility for the crash. That's a first for Google. Nobody was hurt in this low-speed accident, neither bus passengers nor the testers in Google's modified Lexus. CORNISH: Google declined our request for an interview today. Last month, we spoke to Chris Urmson, the director of Google's self-driving car project, and Urmson told us that Google prototype cars are still learning. CHRIS URMSON: We can't program them for every conceivable event, there's an infinite number of them. And so the trick, really, is to have the vehicles generalize what they've observed in the past and be able to understand when they don't know what's going on. And in those situations, do the cautious thing. SHAPIRO: Google said in a monthly report from the self-driving car project that in the future, quote, \"Our cars will more deeply understand that buses and other large vehicles are less likely to yield. \"CORNISH: All of this raises a question - how will liability work in a future full of self-driving cars? Well, if they really turn out to be as safe as promised, personal injury attorney Jason Fernandez says it will dramatically change his work. JASON FERNANDEZ: I'll have to find a new job, and I'm OK with that. SHAPIRO: In all seriousness, Jason Fernandez says lawyers will have to hire computer experts to investigate accidents. He might even be less likely to take a case. FERNANDEZ: If someone now is involved in an accident with a driverless car and they sustain very minor injuries, the answer is probably no because the cost of investigating such a claim would overwhelm the value of the case. CORNISH: Auto insurance might become more mundane, like product liability insurance. But we're not there yet. For the moment, a minor self-driving car accident still makes headlines. ROSS: Yes, we've gotten many calls - international. Even though this was considered basically a fender bender, it's big news to people.

NPR's science blog, Skunk Bear, celebrates that last part with an award, the Golden Mole Award For Accidental Brilliance - what a name. They called for stores of mistakes, coincidences and surprises that led to new discoveries. Now NPR's Adam Cole has the winner. ADAM COLE, BYLINE: Many of the stories start the same way - with confusion, dismay and beer. DAVID AWSCHALOM: Most of the experiments were failing miserably. MELISSA BROWN: I was flummoxed. GEORGE LIU: Aha - this was the source of a problem. CALDEN CARROLL: That's sort of the end of the road for this one. Back to the drawing board. AWSCHALOM: So I would say initially, there were a lot of Friday night beers, not so much about excitement but, why should we keep trying this experiment? COLE: But the stories don't end there because the scientists stuck with it. And their problems turned out to be the key to new ways of thinking. Melissa Brown's grad student couldn't tell the difference between male and female lab mice. BROWN: There is really just a very subtle difference in the spacing of orifices in the genital region. COLE: She mixed them up. But the gender switch led to a whole new line of multiple sclerosis research. George Liu was struggling to figure out the defense mechanisms of bacteria, but his experiments weren't working, and he kept getting distracted by calls from his anxious mother. LIU: She came back to me and harped on the point that I should take more vegetable and fruits because they're bright colors, and they're rich in vitamin. COLE: Suddenly, he realized that something he never considered - the pigment in the bacteria - could explain his weird lab results. David Awschalom studies materials for quantum computing. He moved to a new lab, and his experiments went haywire. AWSCHALOM: The room lights were having a very big effect on this experiment. And we were just lucky enough - or ignorant enough - to be able to see it. COLE: The thing that was messing up their experiments was actually an effect that engineers have been trying to achieve for years. In graduate school, Elizabeth Tibbetts spent hours watching footage of wasp colonies. She was trying to understand how they cooperate. She would paint each wasp with a color-coded dot so she could tell them apart. ELIZABETH TIBBETTS: You use model airplane paint. That's the gold standard wasp paint. COLE: But one day, she was watching a video and realized she had forgotten to paint a few of the wasps. TIBBETTS: And of course I was annoyed. COLE: But then, she noticed something. TIBBETTS: The wasps actually looked kind of different, even without the paint. COLE: Looking closer, she realized that each wasp had a unique face. TIBBETTS: Some of them have little, you know, eyebrows above their eye. And they can be big eyebrows or no eyebrows. And then in this little plate above their face they can have black, brown or yellow, and various combinations of stripes and spots. COLE: That made Tibbetts wonder - if she could distinguish between individual wasps, could they tell each other apart? That question went against established wisdom. The traditional idea was that social insects don't care who's who. They're interchangeable. TIBBETTS: Maybe if I had more experience, I wouldn't have pursued it because maybe I would have thought it was implausible. COLE: But luckily, Tibbetts was not burdened by experience, and her experiment showed that wasps can recognize each other. They're capable of personal relationships. That was a dozen years ago. Since then, she's learned much more about the complexities of wasp social life. And she made another discovery. Wasps' tiny, tiny brains are actually wired to recognize faces, just like human brains. Tibbetts turned a chance observation into a career, and she is the winner of the 2016 Golden Mole Award For Accidental Brilliance. (SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE)COLE: But it was a close call.

ADAM COLE, BYLINE: Many of the stories start the same way - with confusion, dismay and beer. DAVID AWSCHALOM: Most of the experiments were failing miserably. MELISSA BROWN: I was flummoxed. GEORGE LIU: Aha - this was the source of a problem. CALDEN CARROLL: That's sort of the end of the road for this one. Back to the drawing board. AWSCHALOM: So I would say initially, there were a lot of Friday night beers, not so much about excitement but, why should we keep trying this experiment? COLE: But the stories don't end there because the scientists stuck with it. And their problems turned out to be the key to new ways of thinking. Melissa Brown's grad student couldn't tell the difference between male and female lab mice. BROWN: There is really just a very subtle difference in the spacing of orifices in the genital region. COLE: She mixed them up. But the gender switch led to a whole new line of multiple sclerosis research. George Liu was struggling to figure out the defense mechanisms of bacteria, but his experiments weren't working, and he kept getting distracted by calls from his anxious mother. LIU: She came back to me and harped on the point that I should take more vegetable and fruits because they're bright colors, and they're rich in vitamin. COLE: Suddenly, he realized that something he never considered - the pigment in the bacteria - could explain his weird lab results. David Awschalom studies materials for quantum computing. He moved to a new lab, and his experiments went haywire. AWSCHALOM: The room lights were having a very big effect on this experiment. And we were just lucky enough - or ignorant enough - to be able to see it. COLE: The thing that was messing up their experiments was actually an effect that engineers have been trying to achieve for years. In graduate school, Elizabeth Tibbetts spent hours watching footage of wasp colonies. She was trying to understand how they cooperate. She would paint each wasp with a color-coded dot so she could tell them apart. ELIZABETH TIBBETTS: You use model airplane paint. That's the gold standard wasp paint. COLE: But one day, she was watching a video and realized she had forgotten to paint a few of the wasps. TIBBETTS: And of course I was annoyed. COLE: But then, she noticed something. TIBBETTS: The wasps actually looked kind of different, even without the paint. COLE: Looking closer, she realized that each wasp had a unique face. TIBBETTS: Some of them have little, you know, eyebrows above their eye. And they can be big eyebrows or no eyebrows. And then in this little plate above their face they can have black, brown or yellow, and various combinations of stripes and spots. COLE: That made Tibbetts wonder - if she could distinguish between individual wasps, could they tell each other apart? That question went against established wisdom. The traditional idea was that social insects don't care who's who. They're interchangeable. TIBBETTS: Maybe if I had more experience, I wouldn't have pursued it because maybe I would have thought it was implausible. COLE: But luckily, Tibbetts was not burdened by experience, and her experiment showed that wasps can recognize each other. They're capable of personal relationships. That was a dozen years ago. Since then, she's learned much more about the complexities of wasp social life. And she made another discovery. Wasps' tiny, tiny brains are actually wired to recognize faces, just like human brains. Tibbetts turned a chance observation into a career, and she is the winner of the 2016 Golden Mole Award For Accidental Brilliance. (SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE) COLE: But it was a close call. We received so many great stories. And you can find more of our favorites on Skunk Bear's Tumblr and YouTube channel.

This is the case where the FBI wants Apple to help it unlock an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters, and it's not only experts who are taking sides. We asked you, our listeners, how the debate is playing out in your lives. NPR's Joel Rose reports on what we learned. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: The legal standoff between Apple and the FBI is reverberating far beyond the courtroom. It's dividing siblings, parents and children, even husbands and wives. RAYLAN BURKHARDT: This is a no-knead bread. ROSE: Raylan and Jacob Burkhardt (ph) are working in the kitchen of their tidy ranch house outside Oklahoma City. They've been married for three years, just had their first kid in November. R. BURKHARDT: We are kind of opposite on things. Like, I'm a vegan. He's a hunter. ROSE: That is not the only thing they disagree on. Raylan has an iPhone. Jacob has an Android. Their politics are different, too. When it comes to this issue - whether Apple should help the government get data out of the iPhone used by Syed Rizwan Farook - Raylan has some sympathy for the FBI. R. BURKHARDT: If there was a way to have it on just that phone, then I could definitely agree with that and, say, yeah, that's - you know, that - to me, that's no different than going into a house of the - you know, somebody that committed a crime or a terrorist act. It's kind of the same thing to me. ROSE: The FBI says the phone might yield some information that would help its investigation, but Jacob Burkhardt is more skeptical of law enforcement's motives. JACOB BURKHARDT: If we all knew that it was just this one phone this one time, open it up and get the information they needed, then I would say, sure, by all means. Like - but unfortunately, our government has proven to be untrustworthy in a lot of areas, so why should we believe them when they say it's just this one phone; we'll never do it again? ROSE: That is what Apple is worried about. The company says if it writes software to help the FBI extract data from Farook's iPhone, that would open the door to more requests from law enforcement. And if that software gets into the wrong hands, it could undermine the security of every device the company sells. That also worries Sandy Rodman (ph) in Lakeland, Fla. SANDY RODMAN: I love my iPhone, and part of why I love my iPhone is that I'm always leaving my phone somewhere. I'm just happy that, you know, nobody can get in and steal my entire life. ROSE: Rodman's brother lives in England. She says they usually agree on the big questions about privacy and security but not this one. RODMAN: We were chatting on Facebook, and he said, well, if you don't have anything to hide, you don't have anything to fear. And I hold an opposite opinion. I just don't feel that that is something that I would be willing to give up my privacy rights for. ROSE: Were you surprised that you and your brother were in different places? RODMAN: I was surprised. ROSE: Rodman's family isn't the only one that's divided. Christine Burgess (ph) is a nurse in Portland, Ore. She doesn't own a smartphone, but her husband and kids do. She brought up the issue at dinner this week. CHRISTINE BURGESS: Most everybody came down on the side of the FBI, but my youngest son disagreed. He is distrustful of the FBI. His opinion is that they have enough information already, so voices were raised during that interchange between father and son, yes. ROSE: Burgess agrees with her husband. She thinks the FBI should be allowed to get into Farook's phone. BURGESS: If the judge ordered it, Apple should comply with their request, and it would be good to find out what's on that phone so that we can protect our people if we can. ROSE: That's the case the FBI has made in public and that prosecutors will make again in court starting later this month. Joel Rose, NPR News.

The FCC accused Verizon of improperly using what are called supercookies. It was a way to track customers online. Now Verizon will pay a fine of 1. 35 million dollars. NPR's Aarti Shahani reports. AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: Verizon Wireless was supposed to tell customers in advance, hey, we're starting to put supercookies, also known as unique identifier headers, into your Internet traffic. That way, we, Verizon, can see exactly who you are and what you're into - Adele or Beyonce, Giants tickets, depression meds, cheating on your spouse. But Verizon did not ask. The mobile carrier was far less transparent about it than another well-known tracker, Google.

AT&T has filed a federal lawsuit against the city after local lawmakers streamlined the installation process for Fiber Internet providers. That lawsuit could have big implications for Google Fiber beyond Kentucky. Jake Ryan from member station WFPL reports. JAKE RYAN, BYLINE: Matt Embry cranes his neck as he stands just off a busy highway in Louisville. MATT EMBRY: So we're looking at a typical telephone pole. It's a little bit worn and aged, but when you look up the pole, the first thing that you will see attached to it is part of AT&T's network infrastructure. RYAN: Embry is the president of the local Communications Workers of America union. He says access to these poles is the root of the lawsuit filed by AT&T of Kentucky. The company alleges the Louisville Metro City Council overstepped its jurisdiction when it approved a policy to streamline high-speed Internet installation. The issue - allowing a contractor for one company to move utility cables of a competitor. Embry says that breaches the union contract with AT&T. EMBRY: This work has been done by bargain employees for a very long time, and we have negotiated contract after contract for decades to have that exclusivity for CWA workers to do that. RYAN: Industry watchers say the suit is more than just protecting the rights of union workers. Jason Hiner is a chief global editor of TechRepublic, an online trade publication. He notes AT&T also wants to bring high-speed Internet to Louisville. JASON HINER: The longer that they can delay this for Google, the faster they can get their product to market, and so that behooves them. RYAN: The suit isn't against Google Fiber. It targets the city of Louisville, so any company's installation could be delayed here. Hiner says the suit has far-reaching implications for Google, which wants to bring gigabit speed Internet across the U. S. HINER: Louisville is much more like most of the top 10 cities in America like San Francisco and New York where the infrastructure's owned by these different entities and Google has to negotiate a way, you know, with the city or these other entities to get the right-of-way, essentially. RYAN: Hiner says other cities will likely fight Google Fiber. It's already been done in Tempe, Ariz. , and Austin, Texas. A major delay in Louisville could slow Google Fiber's future expansion. HINER: It's a really important test case. You know, for the future of Internet and the U. S. , it has pretty huge implications. RYAN: Ted Smith is the city of Louisville's chief innovation officer. He knows other regions are watching closely. TED SMITH: Everybody's in a slightly different position or a situation, but there are a lot of commonalities, and there are a lot of places in the country where pole attachment is a real factor. RYAN: Smith, like Hiner, says more companies offering ultra high speed internet is good for consumers, can help attract businesses and give cities the cool factor. Matt Embry, back at the utility pole, says he's also for the competition. More companies could mean more jobs for workers like him. He just doesn't like the way it's happening now. EMBRY: It is, for us, a Catch-22. We want to see the competition come in. We just want them to have to negotiate and do it along the same lines as everyone else did.

KOWALCZIK: The hardest thing is to lay people off. That's it, sorry. BRADY: How many people did you have to lay off? KOWALCZIK: The day before Christmas Eve, we laid off 15, and we're up to 25. BRADY: One of the 25 is Connie Berry. She worked as an installer. CONNIE BERRY: It's been two months now since I got laid off, and I was hoping to get a call back, you know, thinking that things would turn around. I guess that I'm still hopeful. I've got my tools, and I'm ready to go. BRADY: Out in the Robco Electric parking lot, it's the middle of the day, and two of the company sales cars are there. Sales and Marketing Manager Tim Webb says last year, they would have been out chasing down new leads. And he says there were a lot of other solar companies on the road, too. TIM WEBB: It was kind of, like, the solar gold rush here. All these companies flocked into town, set up an office and sold systems. So now they are gone. There's just a few of us remaining. BRADY: The big companies pulled up stakes after the PUC changed the rules for something called net metering. That allows a homeowner with solar panels to sell excess electricity they generate to the utility at retail rather than wholesale rates. It's a great deal for a homeowner. They can do something good for the environment and save money on their energy bill. But here's the rub. Every kilowatt generated on someone's roof is one less the local utility sells. And utilities use that money to maintain the electrical grid. In this case, the local utility, NV Energy, is owned by Warren Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)WARREN BUFFETT: We do not want the non-solar customers to be subsidizing the 17,000 solar customers. BRADY: Speaking on CNBC last month with what sounded like a waterfall in the background Buffett echoed an argument utilities across the country are making. When solar customers don't pay to maintain the power grid, that leaves everyone else to pick up the tab. On top of that, Buffett says his utility can produce solar power from large centralized plants for less money than rooftop solar. BUFFETT: We do not our million-plus customers that do not have solar to be buying solar at 10-and-a-half cents when we can turn it out for them at 4-and-a-half cents or buy it at 4-and-a-half cents. BRADY: SolarCity co-founder and CEO Linden Rive says utilities like NV Energy are just trying to protect their monopolies. LINDEN RIVE: They want to deploy the infrastructure. They do not want to let consumers deploy that infrastructure because then they don't get a regulated return on that infrastructure. BRADY: Rive wants big changes for the country's power grid. Instead of central generators delivering electricity out to customers, he imagines a grid where customers produce their own power, too, and compete with the local utility. Under Rive's vision for the grid, there's a smaller role, and less profit, for utilities. RIVE: We need them to manage the lines and let the rest be a competitive market. Competition will drive innovation which will then create products that we can't even think of today. BRADY: SolarCity and others plan to challenge what's happened in Nevada first in the courts and then with a ballot referendum in November. Meantime, though, solar customers are the big losers. Hey there, nice to meet you. DALE COLLIER: Nice to meet you. BRADY: Dale Collier's home in Henderson outside Las Vegas has 56 solar panels on the roof. He refinanced his house to pay for them. Up until the rules changed, he was saving about $150 a month on his power bill. Once the incentives are phased out, though, he figures having solar panels will cost him money. COLLIER: You know, I thought this was the smartest thing I ever did. Now I think it might be one of the stupidest things I ever did. BRADY: NV Energy asked regulators to grandfather in people like Collier, but the PUC said all solar customers, new and existing, should get the same deal. The question now is whether Nevada's experience will spread to other states. Solar advocates successfully preserved incentives next door in California. Now they're focused on another sunny state, Arizona, where the next battle over residential solar incentives appears to be heating up. Jeff Brady, NPR News. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:  Now to Nevada, where the home solar business is in turmoil. Regulators have started to phase out incentives for homeowners who put solar panels on their houses. And so big solar companies are ramping down business in the state and laying off hundreds of workers. As NPR's Jeff Brady reports, this once-booming business has slowed to a trickle. JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: The warehouse at Robco Electric in Las Vegas used to be filled to capacity with pallets of solar panels stacked high. Now it's nearly empty. ROB KOWALCZIK: The PUC made a decision, and it just devastated our industry. BRADY: Rob Kowalczik is the owner.

He spoke at the annual South By Southwest Interactive Festival. The president went there to ask for help getting Americans more civically engaged, but he also spoke for the first time at length about the issues in the standoff between his administration and Apple over a terrorist's iPhone. NPR's Laura Sydell reports. LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE: Since last month, Apple and the Justice Department have been slinging legal arguments at each other like swear words. The fight began after a federal magistrate ordered Apple to write special software to assist the FBI in breaking into an iPhone. The phone in question was used by one of the terrorists who killed 14 people in San Bernardino. Apple is challenging the magistrate's order. President Obama said he couldn't address the San Bernardino case directly, but he gave his thoughts on those who think the government should never be able to get into somebody's smartphone. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BARACK OBAMA: That, I think, does not strike the kind of balance that we have lived with for 200, 300 years, and it's fetishizing our phones above every other value. SYDELL: Like safety. President Obama pointed out that authorities have always been able to break locks in the physical world when they can prove to a judge that they have probable cause to believe someone is a criminal. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)OBAMA: And they can go into bedroom and into bedroom drawers and rifle through your underwear. . . (LAUGHTER)OBAMA: . . . To see if there's any evidence of wrongdoing. SYDELL: And Obama notes that since the attacks on 9/11, Americans have put up with searches and screenings before they step on an airplane. Obama said we must find a way to balance privacy and security. And the tech community must help or Congress will act. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)OBAMA: In ways that have not been thought through. And then you really will have a dangerous (ph) to our civil liberties because we will have not done - the people who understand this best and who care most about privacy and civil liberties have sort of disengaged or have taken a position that is not sustainable for the general public as a whole over time. SYDELL: Obama's stated purpose in visiting South By Southwest was to bridge a gap between the private tech sector and government. Most of his time on stage, he spoke about technology specialists helping government better engage with citizens to solve big problems. And it seems like he may have bridged some gaps, even as the fight between Apple and the FBI continues to create friction. Tony Weisman, the CEO of tech marketing firm DigitasLBi, says when he walked into Obama's talk, he was on Apple's side completely. TONY WEISMAN: It shifted my position because I think what he does so is he tends to take the heat out of an argument. And a lot of social media in our - particularly in this tech world tends to be dominated by absolutist views and black and white. And he's very good at finding a common ground. SYDELL: Weisman says he now isn't so sure that smartphones should be sacred spaces where the government can never look, even when public safety is an issue. He wasn't the only one persuaded by the president. Cameron Barragan with the tech marketing firm Bazaarvoice also began to see that there might be some way for techies and the government to find middle ground. CAMERON BARRAGAN: Where both parties can come together and find a solution really built on this whole idea of - the same kind of concepts behind probable cause as you, like, use in a car or in someone's house. So that was a new way for me to kind of think about it. SYDELL: But some others said they weren't persuaded by the president. And most people in the tech community won't get to hear Obama in person, so there's likely to be more mudslinging from both sides over privacy, security and our smartphones.

The road can be dangerous. More than 40,000 cyclists are struck by cars, and more than 700 are killed each year. That's led city planners to create bike lanes and launch public education campaigns as more people take up the sport. And now some cyclists are embracing a new tool - tiny cameras to record their rides. From Austin, Texas, Brenda Salinas reports. BRENDA SALINAS, BYLINE: Hill Abel owns one of the biggest bike stores here in Austin, Bicycle Sport Shop. In the last year, he's helped a lot of customers pick out just the right camera to wear while they ride. And after yesterday's ride, he's thinking of joining them. HILL ABEL: A guy cut me off, you know, for no reason. He's got both lanes to pass freely, but he comes honking around me and then tried to cut me off. If I would have had a camera to film that, I think that then I would report it to APD. SALINAS: That's the Austin Police Department. There are more than two dozen cameras on the market for cyclists. They start out at $50 for a bike-mounted black box the size of a credit card, and they can range to $300 if you're looking at a deluxe action-style camera to mount on your helmet. The cameras can help police figure out what really happened in a crash. But one cyclist's distracted driver can be a motorist's careless cyclist. And to be clear, most cyclists and drivers are responsible and share the road. But three-time world champion cyclist Rebecca Rusch has had enough bad experiences with motorists to get her off the road. REBECCA RUSCH: Sadly, I have had close calls with aggressive drivers and definitely had people buzzing me or saying aggressive words or even throwing a beer can out the window at me. And it's part of the reason that I ride mountain bikes and ride on gravel roads. SALINAS: And that seems to happen to almost every cyclist. Dallas attorney Bill Shirer represents cyclists in court after accidents with cars. And he says every time he screens a jury, he meets drivers who think bikes just don't belong on the road. BILL SHIRER: There would somebody who stands up and says, yeah, cyclists, they slow us down. They get in the way. And then sometimes cyclists will just totally disregard traffic laws. You know, they shouldn't be even allowed on the road. SALINAS: Shirer says videos shot from the cyclist's point of view do help his cases. And he wonders if, in a few years, the cameras themselves might play a role in preventing accidents, much like red light cameras. Even though there are now upwards of 200,000 videos on YouTube showing encounters between drivers and cyclists, Rebecca Rusch cautioned cyclists against posting anymore. She says just give them to the police. RUSCH: I doubt that somebody who's thrown a beer can out the window is going to see a camera go, oh, maybe I shouldn't do that. But what it can do is that it can alert law enforcement, you know, you can document a license plate number. SALINAS: It's not known whether distracted drivers might be more careful if they know they're being recorded. But even if the cameras don't serve as a direct deterrent, the evidence they capture just might. For NPR News, I'm Brenda Salinas in Austin.

Kind of a rough political season, huh? Makes you long for a simpler time, like, I don't know, 1996 maybe? \"Jerry Maguire\" was the big movie. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"JERRY MAGUIRE\")TOM CRUISE: (As Jerry Maguire) Show me the money. CUBA GOODING JR. : (As Rod Tidwell) Jerry, you better yell. CRUISE: (As Jerry Maguire) Show me the money. MARTIN: Celine Dion was climbing the charts. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"BECAUSE YOU LOVED ME\")CELINE DION: (Singing) I'm everything I am because you loved me. MARTIN: It was the early days of the Internet, the World Wide Web. And while there's not a lot that survives from the pre-high-speed days, you know what's still there? A snapshot of 1996 in the form of the campaign website of Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole and his running mate, Jack Kemp. Robert Arena was a 22-year-old kid when he built that site, and he took us on a tour. First, he set the scene. (SOUNDBITE OF MODEM DIALING)ROBERT ARENA: Back in the '90s, high speed would've been a 56 K modem. So today, a 50-megabit connection would be considered somewhat fast. That is 1,000 times faster than the Internet speeds that we working with back in 1996. MARTIN: Wow. ARENA: In total, there were 20 million people on Internet, and that's worldwide. Google did not exist. You might have had your own personal webpage at GeoCities, which was one of the top. . . MARTIN: Oh, yes. ARENA: . . . Websites back in 1996. So you would've waited for everybody to get off the phone so that you could use your phone line, and your dial-up modem would screech to life. And then after going through your Internet service provider, you would have come to what was the very, very early days of the World Wide Web. So there was no Flash back in those days, we were just going to see things call Shockwaves, so websites were very flat. MARTIN: OK, so here I am, looking at Robert's website, dolecamp96. org, and it does look tiny and a little flat. And then I notice something. Can we talk about this coffee cup? ARENA: The rotating GIF file. MARTIN: (Laughter) There is a coffee cup on the front of the website. . . ARENA: . . . Steaming hot. MARTIN: It is - the steam is moving. This is, like, groundbreaking stuff. ARENA: Rachel, this technology is all over Snapchat and text messages right now. MARTIN: It's true. ARENA: I mean, that's really what this is. We are really trying to make a website that was interactive. But at the same time, you're stuck on a modem, so you can't really have video files everywhere. This was the technology to make something move back in 1996. MARTIN: OK, but as much as Robert Arena is telling a story about nostalgia, it is also a story about foresight. ARENA: We ended up with about 15,000 people volunteered for this campaign online in 1996. MARTIN: Wow. ARENA: In today's numbers, that doesn't sound like a lot. But again, relative to where we were, that impact of that was something like one-quarter of our small business coalition was generated on the Internet. We actually did do fundraising online. If you gave $25 in the primary, you got a free Dole for president mouse pad mailed to you. MARTIN: (Laughter). ARENA: But certainly all the customization features we were driving towards were really about list-building and really creating a one-to-one relationship with an individual voter. And that's really what Internet's promise was, particularly in the political space back then, was to bypass the traditional media and speak directly to the voter. MARTIN: That's Robert Arena. He was the director of Internet strategy for the '96 Dole campaign. Oh, and one more thing. ARENA: When we went to the general election, we redid our letterhead. And we were not allowed to put the website address on the letterhead because person at the time in charge of that thought that it would look like a typo. MARTIN: And so to those of you working with fresh-faced 22-year-olds as I happen to, listen to them because everyone once in a while, they might have a pretty good idea.

ARENA: The rotating GIF file. MARTIN: (Laughter) There is a coffee cup on the front of the website. . . ARENA: . . . Steaming hot. MARTIN: It is - the steam is moving. This is, like, groundbreaking stuff. ARENA: Rachel, this technology is all over Snapchat and text messages right now. MARTIN: It's true. ARENA: I mean, that's really what this is. We are really trying to make a website that was interactive. But at the same time, you're stuck on a modem, so you can't really have video files everywhere. This was the technology to make something move back in 1996. MARTIN: OK, but as much as Robert Arena is telling a story about nostalgia, it is also a story about foresight. ARENA: We ended up with about 15,000 people volunteered for this campaign online in 1996. MARTIN: Wow. ARENA: In today's numbers, that doesn't sound like a lot. But again, relative to where we were, that impact of that was something like one-quarter of our small business coalition was generated on the Internet. We actually did do fundraising online. If you gave $25 in the primary, you got a free Dole for president mouse pad mailed to you. MARTIN: (Laughter). ARENA: But certainly all the customization features we were driving towards were really about list-building and really creating a one-to-one relationship with an individual voter. And that's really what Internet's promise was, particularly in the political space back then, was to bypass the traditional media and speak directly to the voter. MARTIN: That's Robert Arena. He was the director of Internet strategy for the '96 Dole campaign. Oh, and one more thing. ARENA: When we went to the general election, we redid our letterhead. And we were not allowed to put the website address on the letterhead because person at the time in charge of that thought that it would look like a typo. MARTIN: And so to those of you working with fresh-faced 22-year-olds as I happen to, listen to them because everyone once in a while, they might have a pretty good idea.

Well, joining us now is Stephanie Lampkin, CEO of a company called Blendoor. It's an app designed to help companies find the right people to hire. Welcome to the program. STEPHANIE LAMPKIN: Thank you. SIEGEL: First of all, your app is supposed to break down bias in hiring. How does it do that? LAMPKIN: So with Blendoor, we hide candidate name and photo and only show their skills, work experience and education. We also remove any indication of age. And so we're actually removing data as opposed to building algorithms to circumvent bias in recognition that there are certain things like gender, the way name sounds or how it's spelled, which can contribute to response rate. SIEGEL: Why did you do this? What made you decide to make this happen? LAMPKIN: So I came up with the idea the fall after many of the companies in Silicon Valley released their employee diversity numbers. And their argument was that there just aren't enough women - qualified women and people of color to hire, which I knew wasn't completely the case. And so I wanted to create a platform - and we would actually have data to validate that this is not just a pipeline problem. SIEGEL: You are a Stanford and MIT-educated - well, MIT MBA, but also a computer scientist? LAMPKIN: I actually got an engineering degree from Stanford. SIEGEL: You're an African-American woman. LAMPKIN: That's correct. SIEGEL: Did you find that you were typecast as somebody who was not right for the kind of job that you felt you were absolutely trained for? LAMPKIN: Oh, yeah, absolutely. And my first years at Microsoft, I experienced issues related to gender more so than race, which was surprising. It was definitely a wake-up call. SIEGEL: Ultimately, you're blocking out key information about applicants until they get to the interview stage - right? - because eventually, they're going to sit down and talk to somebody if this succeeds. LAMPKIN: Correct. SIEGEL: If there actually are biases built into hiring, they could still come into play at that moment, wouldn't they? LAMPKIN: Yes. By having this data - so even being able to track how far certain demographics of people are making it in the recruiting pipeline, we think having this information will actually make people a little bit more accountable. When you know you're being watched, it makes you a little bit more conscious about what you're doing. SIEGEL: Is it correct to say that the assumption - I think the pretty hopeful assumption behind Blendoor is that if job applicants were considered gender-blind, race-blind, age-blind, whatever, the results of who would advance would be much, much more diverse than they are when people are aware of those factors. LAMPKIN: Yes, absolutely. So this was actually implemented by many symphonies years ago. Auditions happen behind a curtain, and everyone has to wear soft shoes - so you can't tell the gender of the person even based on their shoes - and the gender diversity increased by five X as a result of this blind audition strategy. And so we are trying to replicate that when sourcing for talent. SIEGEL: Well, Stephanie Lampkin, thank you very much for talking with us today. LAMPKIN: Thank you.

People have biases, so when they write computer programs, those programs can have biases, too. NPR's Laura Sydell is at the South by Southwest Interactive conference where tech experts are talking about that problem. LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE: Jackie Alsina (ph) was at a concert with friends, and he took a bunch of pictures. Later, he loaded them into Google Photos, which stores and automatically organizes images. Its software is able to group together pictures of a particular friend or pictures of dogs together, cats, et cetera. But when it labeled a picture of one of Alsina's friends, it left him speechless. Both he and his friend are African-American. JACKIE ALSINA: It labeled them as something else. It labeled her as a different species, a creature. SYDELL: You can't even say it. ALSINA: Yeah, and I kind of refuse to (laughter) more or less 'cause I don't want to accept - by saying it, I kind of, like, reinforce the idea of it, so I kind of try and pull away from that. SYDELL: I'm not going to reveal which animal it labeled his friend. It also happened to others with dark skin, and Google has apologized and fixed the problem. But Alsina isn't buying that it's just some weird technical glitch. ALSINA: And, well, they say, oh, it's a computer. I'm like, OK, yeah, a computer build by whom, a computer designed by whom, a computer trained by whom? SYDELL: Alsina's conclusion is that there probably weren't any black people on the team that designed Google Photos. Google says it did test the product on employees of different races. Alsina's experience is one of many strange biases that turn up in computer algorithms which sift through data for patterns. Most of us are familiar with suggestion algorithms used by Amazon and Netflix. If you like this movie, you'll probably like that one. For example, the computer may learn over time, the viewers who like the film \"Terminator\" also enjoy \"Ex machina. \" But in another context, user feedback can harden societal biases. A couple of years ago, a study at Harvard found that when someone searched in Google for a name normally associated with a person of African-American descent, an ad for a company that finds criminal records was more likely to turn up. The algorithm may have initially done this for both black and white people, but over time, the biases of the people who did the search probably got factored in, says Christian Sandvig, a professor at University of Michigan's School of Information. CHRISTIAN SANDVIG: Because people tended to click on the ad topic that suggested that that person had been arrested, when the name was African-American, the algorithm learned the racism of the search users and then reinforced it by showing that more often. SYDELL: Sandvig says there are also studies that show women are more likely to be shown lower-paying jobs than men in online ads. Sorelle Friedler, a professor of computer science at Haverford College, thinks women may reinforce this bias without realizing it. SORELLE FRIEDLER: It might be that women are truly less likely to click on those ads, and probably, that's because of the long history of women making less than men and so perhaps thinking, oh, that ad isn't really for me; I'm not as likely to get that job. SYDELL: And so the algorithm determines it should no longer show those ads to women. What worries Friedler and other social scientists is that computer algorithms are being used in a growing number of ways. Pennsylvania's testing the idea of using algorithms to suggest how to sentence a particular criminal. Some companies are using them to narrow the pool of job applicants. And it can be hard to guard against bias, says professor Sandvig. SANDVIG: The systems are of a sufficient complexity that it is possible to say the algorithm did it. And it's actually true. The algorithm is sufficiently complicated, and it's changing in real time. It's writing its own rules on the basis of data and input that it does do things, and we're often surprised by them. SYDELL: Yet, Sandvig remains optimistic about fixing biased algorithms and actually using computers to guard against prejudice. There are already apps to keep discrimination out of the hiring process. Sandvig and others say it's important to talk about the problem because if humans don't fix it, computers won't do it themselves. Laura Sydell, NPR News, Austin, Texas.

I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, ideas about the things that are hidden all around us and how technology and sometimes just old-fashioned sleuthing is helping us to detect more and more of our invisible world. So to start the show, a little experiment with. . . (BAG RUSTLING)RAZ: A bag of chips. These ones are kettle cooked. And what this bag of chips is about to reveal is just how much of our world is hidden. Does it work with Doritos? ABE DAVIS: You know, I don't think we've tried Doritos. I suspect so. RAZ: Lays, I'm assuming, will work fine. DAVIS: We have done Lays, yeah. RAZ: OK, good. So this is the guy who did the experiment with chips. DAVIS: I'm Abe Davis. I'm a Ph. D. candidate at MIT. RAZ: As for what Abe's studying, let's just say it has to do with hidden information. And before we tell you about Abe's chip experiment, there's something you need to know. And it's a basic truth of our physical world. And it's a truth that enables Abe to do his work. DAVIS: It turns out that most of things most of the time are moving a little bit. RAZ: To put this another way, almost everything around us is constantly, almost imperceptibly, vibrating but in a way that is totally invisible to us. DAVIS: You know, our visual system is sort of tuned to pay attention to certain things. And likewise, it's tuned to ignore certain things. RAZ: Yeah. DAVIS: For instance, really tiny motions or really fast motions, these are things that we don't typically see with our eyes. RAZ: Yeah, like a hummingbird's wings. Like, we don't see the flap, flap, flap, flap. We just see, like, a hummingbird body and just, like, this weird kind of thing around it. DAVIS: Yeah. RAZ: But just like we can use cameras to capture the movement of a hummingbird's wings, Abe Davis uses cameras to capture teeny tiny vibrations, vibrations that are normally hidden from us but that surround us all the time. DAVIS: Caused by sound. RAZ: Sound. So I'm sitting here in the studio, and I have this mug of tea. It's not moving. You're telling me that the tea is vibrating just from the sound of my voice? DAVIS: Oh, yeah. RAZ: Really? DAVIS: Always. RAZ: So what happens? What do you do with that movement? You actually point a camera at it? DAVIS: Yeah. So that image of that mug of tea to us, if we look at even the image, probably won't look like it's moving at all because the actual motion is going to be a lot smaller than even a single pixel. But if it moves by just a fraction of a fraction of a pixel, then some of these pixels that see the mug will get just a little bit brighter and some will get just a little bit darker. And we can analyze that very subtle change and we can actually recover this information from it. RAZ: And then translate that information into what? DAVIS: Well, in this case, into sound. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: OK, people, this is huge. So listen closely because what Abe is saying here is that almost any object in the world around you can become a microphone. And with a pretty ordinary video camera and the right lighting, you could shoot silent video of an object and then analyze the tiny, imperceptible motion in the video and translate that motion into sound, into words even. Now, until recently, this was all theoretical, which is how Abe wound up standing in his lab one day, screaming at a bag of potato chips in a video he shared on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK, VIDEO PLAYING)DAVIS: Three, two, one, go. Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb. (LAUGHTER)DAVIS: So this experiment looks completely ridiculous. I mean, I'm screaming at a bag of chips, and we're blasting it with so much light, we literally melted the first bag we tried this on. But ridiculous as this experiment looks, it was actually really important because with the right algorithms, we can take this silent, seemingly still video and we can recover this sound. (VIDEO PLAYING)DAVIS: (Audio muffled) Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb. (APPLAUSE)DAVIS: And this was really significant because it was the first time we recovered intelligible human speech from silent video of an object. And so it gave us this point of reference. And gradually, we could start to modify the experiment using different objects or less light or quieter sounds. And that led to experiments like this one, where again, I'm going to speak to a bag of chips. But this time, we've moved our camera about 15 feet away, outside, behind a soundproof window. And the whole thing is lit by only natural sunlight. And this is what things sound like from inside, next to the bag of chips. (VIDEO PLAYING)DAVIS: Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow. And everywhere that Mary went, that lamb was sure to go. And here's what we were able to recover from our silent video captured outside, behind that window. (VIDEO PLAYING)DAVIS: (Audio muffled) Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow. And everywhere that Mary went, that lamb was sure to go. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: OK, Abe, we should explain this to people listening because what you've done here is you've taken silent video of the chips and then, using a computer algorithm, you analyze the tiny vibrations in the bag. You extract the sound that caused those tiny vibrations in the first place, all from a bag of chips. DAVIS: Yep, just a bag of chips. RAZ: This is incredible. I mean, it's. . . DAVIS: Enticing. RAZ: Yeah, right? DAVIS: Yeah. RAZ: Why do you think that is? DAVIS: I mean, speaking personally, it's exciting to sort of discover this whole new world of information. RAZ: I mean, you could imagine a future where nothing is hidden anymore, where somebody just sitting, having a quiet conversation next to an empty bag of chips, is being listened to. DAVIS: You know, it's interesting. It's easy for the mind to go there, right? It's easy to imagine, oh, man, this gives me access to this information, so therefore this information, you know, can no longer hide. RAZ: Yeah. DAVIS: But I think what's going to happen now that we know the information is there, the information is everywhere. And it's in such abundance. And we just - nobody has the resources to look at all of it. It's like telling people, I know that there's a needle in this haystack. That doesn't mean you're going to find it. RAZ: But now we can find it. That's the thing. Like, there's no way that, like, intelligence agencies aren't excited by this. Like, there's no way. This is technology that could disrupt the way they operate. DAVIS: (Laughter) I mean, I think that if you invested enough, then this does potentially open up some new doors, yeah. Is that - is that a sufficiently vague answer? RAZ: Yeah. DAVIS: I think a lot of the potential is in other kinds of information. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)DAVIS: It's not hard to imagine how you might use this technology to spy on someone. But keep in mind that there's already a lot of very mature technology out there for surveillance. In fact, people have been using lasers to eavesdrop on objects from a distance for decades. But what's really new here, what's really different, is that now we have a way to picture the vibrations of an object, which gives us a new lens through which to look at the world. And we can use that lens to learn not just about forces like sound that cause an object to vibrate but also about the object itself. And you could imagine, for instance, looking at an old bridge and wondering what would happen - how would that bridge hold up if I were to drive my car across it? And, you know, that's a question that you probably want to answer before you start driving across that bridge. We've just started to scratch the surface of what you can do with this kind of imaging because it gives us a new way to capture our surroundings with common, accessible technology. And so looking to the future, it's going to be really exciting to explore what this can tell us about the world. Thank you. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: Abe Davis, he's a Ph. D. candidate at MIT. You can see his entire TED Talk - and you really should 'cause it is super visual and really cool - at ted. com. GUY RAZ, HOST:  It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, ideas about the things that are hidden all around us and how technology and sometimes just old-fashioned sleuthing is helping us to detect more and more of our invisible world. So to start the show, a little experiment with. . . (BAG RUSTLING) RAZ: A bag of chips. These ones are kettle cooked. And what this bag of chips is about to reveal is just how much of our world is hidden. Does it work with Doritos? ABE DAVIS: You know, I don't think we've tried Doritos. I suspect so. RAZ: Lays, I'm assuming, will work fine. DAVIS: We have done Lays, yeah. RAZ: OK, good. So this is the guy who did the experiment with chips. DAVIS: I'm Abe Davis. I'm a Ph. D. candidate at MIT. RAZ: As for what Abe's studying, let's just say it has to do with hidden information. And before we tell you about Abe's chip experiment, there's something you need to know. And it's a basic truth of our physical world. And it's a truth that enables Abe to do his work. DAVIS: It turns out that most of things most of the time are moving a little bit. RAZ: To put this another way, almost everything around us is constantly, almost imperceptibly, vibrating but in a way that is totally invisible to us. DAVIS: You know, our visual system is sort of tuned to pay attention to certain things. And likewise, it's tuned to ignore certain things. RAZ: Yeah. DAVIS: For instance, really tiny motions or really fast motions, these are things that we don't typically see with our eyes. RAZ: Yeah, like a hummingbird's wings. Like, we don't see the flap, flap, flap, flap. We just see, like, a hummingbird body and just, like, this weird kind of thing around it. DAVIS: Yeah. RAZ: But just like we can use cameras to capture the movement of a hummingbird's wings, Abe Davis uses cameras to capture teeny tiny vibrations, vibrations that are normally hidden from us but that surround us all the time. DAVIS: Caused by sound. RAZ: Sound. So I'm sitting here in the studio, and I have this mug of tea. It's not moving. You're telling me that the tea is vibrating just from the sound of my voice? DAVIS: Oh, yeah. RAZ: Really? DAVIS: Always. RAZ: So what happens? What do you do with that movement? You actually point a camera at it? DAVIS: Yeah. So that image of that mug of tea to us, if we look at even the image, probably won't look like it's moving at all because the actual motion is going to be a lot smaller than even a single pixel. But if it moves by just a fraction of a fraction of a pixel, then some of these pixels that see the mug will get just a little bit brighter and some will get just a little bit darker. And we can analyze that very subtle change and we can actually recover this information from it. RAZ: And then translate that information into what? DAVIS: Well, in this case, into sound. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: OK, people, this is huge. So listen closely because what Abe is saying here is that almost any object in the world around you can become a microphone. And with a pretty ordinary video camera and the right lighting, you could shoot silent video of an object and then analyze the tiny, imperceptible motion in the video and translate that motion into sound, into words even. Now, until recently, this was all theoretical, which is how Abe wound up standing in his lab one day, screaming at a bag of potato chips in a video he shared on the TED stage.

FBI. The government has asked a federal court in California to vacate a hearing tomorrow where experts from both sides had been expected to discuss how Apple could help the investigators unlock a phone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters. We're joined now by NPR tech reporter, Alina Selyukh to update us on this breaking news. And first, Alina, does this mean the case is over? What's the status? ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE: It definitely does not mean the case is over. What the government was asking for is a delay. We're now hearing that the judge has granted the delay, so basically the hearing that was supposed to happen tomorrow will not happen for a little while. The big news is that the government is testing a brand-new method of getting inside the iPhone in question that does not involve Apple. And we don't know what that testing method is. They are not telling us what that is. But what the Justice Department is saying is that they never gave up looking for an option that did not involve Apple. And now a third party, someone outside from the government, has shown them a method that they now want to test to see if it's viable. CORNISH: And we'll get into more detail there, but, first, you know, FBI Director James Comey has been saying that he'd - he was confident that the government had tried all the options, right? And that they thought that involving Apple was the only way. SELYUKH: That is sort of what he was saying. He got pressed in a congressional hearing on some of the potential other methods. A bit of a specific - he was saying, I'm the director of the FBI. I don't really get into the nitty-gritty, but I have high confidence that my people did. And they did arrive at the decision that involving Apple was the only way to go. What they're saying now is that this worldwide attention to the case has kind of brought a lot of people out of the woodwork. People have started sending them suggestions and over the weekend they had somebody come in and show them a new way. And they really want to try it. CORNISH: Remind us about - like this - I'm sorry - help us understand this new method and remind us what the original method was that the government was calling for. SELYUKH: Right, so for context, the original challenge here was that the iPhone is protected by a passcode and the stuff inside of it is encrypted. So the only way to read the content of it, you have to have a passcode. The FBI can crack the passcode, but in order to get to that point, they have to have Apple lift some of the security features that prevent them from even attempting that. And doing that means that Apple needs to write a new kind of software. And the company says that software would effectively amount to a master key that would really jeopardize all of the iPhones out there. CORNISH: Right, going as far as to describe it as a cancer. SELYUKH: That is what CEO Tim Cook said, yes. CORNISH: Now, do you have any idea of what this new method that the FBI would use would look like - or even - you mention it's an outside party suggesting it? SELYUKH: Right, the government is not giving us any hints as to who they're working with or what this new method entails. For the past few weeks, we have heard from various security researchers suggesting different ways. There's a way to shave off part of the chip that's inside or there's sort of cloning of a memory card. We don't know which one they're testing, but we do know they want about two weeks before they produce the report. And one of the experts I spoke with suggested that that might mean it's not a tremendously new kind of idea. CORNISH: So in the meantime this delay is just so that they can try out this method. SELYUKH: That's exactly right. CORNISH: That's NPR tech reporter Alina Selyukh. Thanks so much. SELYUKH: Thank you. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:   A big surprise today in the case of Apple v. FBI.

And today, robots to the rescue. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CORNISH: Imagine a cockroach-sized robot, for instance, finding people trapped in a collapsed building, or a walking humanoid robot fighting fires aboard Navy ships. Researchers are working on both of those things. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  And around the Greek island of Lesbos, an American team is putting a robot to work to help rescue migrants crossing the Mediterranean. The researchers from Texas A&M are sending a jet-powered, remote-controlled lifesaving buoy into the surf. Joanna Kakissis has the story. JOANNA KAKISSIS, BYLINE: It's a cold, rainy morning here on the coast. A first responder from the Hellenic Red Cross, Vassilis Hatzopoulos, points at the sea. Eight migrant rafts, including one that's not moving. VASSILIS HATZOPOULOS: OK, this boat up there - no engine - failure of the engine. That's it. So they asked for help from the Coast Guard. KAKISSIS: Two other rafts move closer to the shore. I'm walking with John Sims. Back home, he's a fire chief in Arizona. But here, he's teaching the Hellenic Red Cross to use a device called EMILY. And there she goes into the water. You might call her a boat. You might call her a buoy. She's about 4 feet long, weighs 25 pounds and looks like a cylinder wrapped in an orange life jacket. John Sims is steering EMILY with the remote. She's speeding toward the migrant rafts. JOHN SIMS: I'll keep her about 20, 30 meters behind her. KAKISSIS: Wow, she's going pretty fast. SIMS: Yeah. KAKISSIS: She rides waves really well. SIMS: She does - rides really, really well. The only thing that affects her sometimes over a wave is a little bit of wind. KAKISSIS: So somebody falls in the water, they can just, like, hug EMILY? SIMS: Yep, just jump onto it. And it gives enough time for a lifeguard then to get suited up and get out to them. KAKISSIS: The raft arrives onshore. Red Cross volunteers cover the shivering Afghan migrants in Mylar blankets. No one falls out. They did not need EMILY to help rescue anyone in this situation. Sims says she was standing by just in case she was needed. SIMS: EMILY is perfect as a floating life buoy or a floating life jacket. We can throw it in the water, and it doesn't take much time. We can go out there and we can escort the boat in. If anybody has a problem - they're hypothermic, they're sick, there's a problem with the boat and they happen to fall overboard - EMILY can be on site within seconds. KAKISSIS: Sims and I are now talking with Tony Mulligan, who invented EMILY. He owns a maritime robotics company and says he designed these rescue robots to be practically indestructible. TONY MULLIGAN: They're made out of Kevlar and aircraft-grade composites, so they can handle a 30-foot wave, they can be thrown out of a helicopter or off of bridges. KAKISSIS: And EMILY has saved lives. Her first rescue involved a father and son caught in rough surf off the coast of Oregon. MULLIGAN: The helicopter wasn't going to be able to get there for an hour, the water's 50 degrees, and it was too rough to put swimmers in. And the boat ran out with a line, they grabbed on, and they pulled them back. KAKISSIS: Since then, Mulligan has sent 260 EMILYs to first responders around the world. MULLIGAN: We've been told that she's done a lot of really cool things in Mongolia and Kazakhstan during floods. It's common in Indonesia for tsunami response. KAKISSIS: And he's part of this team that brought two EMILYs to Greece. MULLIGAN: We're Roboticists Without Borders. So the whole purpose is bring technology to the first responders, and make it safer for them and make them be able to do a better job. KAKISSIS: But it's more than a job for Mulligan. It's personal. He shows me the back of EMILY, which stands for Emergency Integrated Lifesaving Lanyard - at least officially. MULLIGAN: You'll see there's a little rose on the logo. And there's three initials, ERS, which stood for Emily Rose Shane. KAKISSIS: Mulligan named EMILY after his daughter's best friend, who was killed in a car accident. She was just 13. Mulligan remembers she loved helping people, and now EMILY the rescue robot is doing just that. For NPR News, I'm Joanna Kakissis on Lesbos.

Well, those questions are right up the alley of Paul Robinette, a roboticist at Georgia Tech Research Institute who joins us now. Welcome to the program. PAUL ROBINETTE: Hello. SIEGEL: You did a study for your Ph. D. dissertation called \"Overtrust Of Robots In Emergency Evacuation Scenarios. \" I'd just like you to describe in short what you did. ROBINETTE: Sure. We had people come into a building on campus, and they were introduced to our emergency guidance robot. SIEGEL: What does the robot look like, by the way? ROBINETTE: Robot has a red base with four wheels on it. On top of that is a lighted sign that says emergency guide robot. On top of that are two arms which each have wands in them that are lit up with LEDs. And they were told that the robot would take them to a meeting room. Sometimes it did a good job getting them there, sometimes it took a circuitous route getting there, so it took a little bit longer. And the participant went into the meeting room, and then we filled up the hallway outside with some artificial smoke. The participant left the meeting room when they heard the smoke detector, saw that the robot was providing guidance to a previously unknown exit towards a back door - wasn't marked with an exit sign. They could choose whether they wanted to go through the backdoor or go through the front door where they came in which was marked with an emergency exit sign. SIEGEL: So what was the score here? How did the robots generally do? How many people followed them despite a pretty obvious alternative? ROBINETTE: So we had 42 total participants, and of those 37 followed the robot, two people stood with the robot and didn't move towards either exit and then three people went to the front door and asked the experimenter up there what was going on. SIEGEL: (Laughter). Have you found out if there's anything different about those people? ROBINETTE: Nothing that we can tell so far. SIEGEL: What does this say about using robots in real life emergencies? Do you think we would look at the robot the same way we often listen to an alarm that goes off and say, oh, it's just the alarm going off again or it's probably some fire drill that I'm going to ignore? ROBINETTE: I think the reason we're conditioned to not pay too much attention to fire alarms is because they go off as false alarms so often. That could happen with robots definitely. But it's a little bit harder to ignore something that comes up to you and tells you that you should evacuate. SIEGEL: If robots were all around us, do you think we'd develop the same kind of indifference to the robotic warnings? ROBINETTE: It's a good question. People still tend to follow their GPS, even though we've all got stories of where it's led us the wrong direction. So we have a lot of technology in our lives already that we have a lot of experience with that we still tend to trust maybe a little bit more than it should be trusted. SIEGEL: How does this finding change you as a roboticist? ROBINETTE: Well, a couple of things, for one, it tells me that if the robot says it can do something, people will generally believe that it will do something. Also, it tells me that we need to build in programs into the robot that will allow it to help the users to get the appropriate level of trust in it at the right moment. It has to be able to tell them when it might not be working perfectly or maybe when it's doing a task that isn't the task the person thinks it's doing like. . . SIEGEL: You have to program some humility. You have to program some. . . ROBINETTE: Yeah. SIEGEL: . . . humility into the robot. ROBINETTE: Yeah, let it tell people when it's made a mistake and whether or not it should be trusted in the future. SIEGEL: Yes. And then you can program people to do the same thing, and it'll be a very successful project. Dr. Paul Robinette, thanks a lot for talking with us today. ROBINETTE: Thank you.

AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  That's Cpl. Steve Case. He commands the police bomb squad in St. Charles County, Mo. His team recently spent a couple of days wiring up special Easter eggs for children who are visually impaired - plastic eggs that chirp. (SOUNDBITE OF BEEPING)CASE: If they can't see the eggs, they can't find them, so we make them beep. And when they find the eggs - there's a switch on the outside. They turn it off, it stops beeping, and then we give them another egg with toys or some candy inside of it. SIEGEL: The bomb squad has been making eggs chirp since 2010. They picked up the idea at a national bomb technician conference. Lots of bomb squads around the country run similar projects, and Steve Case says that their professional expertise does help. CASE: You can actually wire these things up wrong and they won't work. So through trial and error and a few soldering iron burns, we got it all done. And we're actually pretty good at it now. CORNISH: This past weekend, the police and the county held Easter egg hunts for kids with special needs. Besides the beeping eggs for visually impaired kids, they held a special hunt for kids with mobility challenges and another for children with sensory issues or autism. Steve Case has an 18-year-old son with autism. CASE: I know what it means when a family has to not do things because their kids are just a little bit different. So yeah, it's been kind of the driving force on my end, too, working with these special needs families. SIEGEL: He said watching the hunts was one of the best days he'd had, and he wants to make them an annual event.

The government has put its case on hold. Up until the 11th hour, prosecutors claimed they needed Apple to help them get into the phone. Now, apparently, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no longer true, and a hearing that had been set for today was cancelled. It may seem like a mutually agreeable conclusion, but this standoff exposed a deep conflict over privacy and security that is by no means over. Here to discuss this is NPR's Aarti Shahani, and Aarti, help us understand this. Prosecutors say they can't get into the phone without Apple's help now. AARTI SHAHANI, HOST: Yeah. It's actually a point many experts in cryptography had been making. As secure as the iPhone may be, it's not foolproof. Apple's working to make it so, but they're not there yet. Suddenly, this past Sunday, the government claims some outside party came by and demonstrated a concrete way to get in. So Apple isn't the only one with kings to the kingdom. And I'd note - if this method works, it could mean the FBI has a way to break into every iPhone running on the specific operating system, iOS 9, or even others, which makes this kind of mixed news for Apple. It doesn't have to write software to bypass its own security, as the federal court had ordered, but its hardware isn't so strong after all. CORNISH: Who is this mysterious outside party? SHAHANI: (Laughter) Law enforcement officials say it is not the national security agency which many were also speculating. They say this case triggered an outpouring around the entire world with all sorts of security experts offering help. So it could be a private company and/or a foreign one. And they are cautiously optimistic - that's their exact words - that while they haven't cracked open the iPhone phone yet, they'll be able to. And this is a total 180 from their position in their prior briefs. CORNISH: So I said at the top that this case is sort of on hold. I mean, this larger fight isn't over, correct? SHAHANI: No, no, not in the least. I mean, I think this is - you know, this fight about the iPhone, how it's unfolded over the last few weeks - it signals two things - one, the cyber arms race, the cat-and-mouse game to break encryption, the code used to scramble data and make it illegible - it's on not just for the NSA, not just for the U. S. , you know, Russia, China. The FBI has come under a lot of criticism, like, hey, instead of complaining about Apple, why don't you guys learn how to hack phones for yourself? Now, that could sound unsettling to some. Suddenly, police - cops working on garden-variety crimes - they can have spy powers like intelligent agencies, like nation-state actors do, but that is definitely a takeaway. CORNISH: OK, you said there are two lessons. What's number two? SHAHANI: You know, it's more a set of questions. Who gets to decide how much encryption is good? Do we let Apple, the biggest company on Earth, decide, or do police get to call the shots? Or will Congress actually weigh in and manage to pass a law? And if lawmakers do that, will they talk to other countries to figure out some common rules? The FBI chose a test case that looked really compelling - not a burglar, not a tax evader - a man who, with his wife, killed 14 people. CORNISH: And yet, the backlash against the FBI was loud, right? And critics were essentially arguing that they were trying to make some sort of power grab. SHAHANI: That's right, and I think it's because people have iPhones, so they feel a connection to this debate. It's not totally theoretical. You know, the iPhone is one of the very first products to bring strong encryption to consumers around the world. Plenty of other tech companies are moving in that direction, and you know, we're learning probably the iPhone isn't perfect. But again, that is the corporate goal. You know, Apple CEO, Tim Cook - he made a point yesterday of saying that that's the point of his product during his launch. So we have to figure out if that actually makes us safer because now my phone and my Gmail and my WhatsApp are so strong no criminal can break in or if it makes us weaker because criminals and terrorists can go dark, so to speak.

The former CEO of Intel died on Monday. His personal story is woven into the history of Silicon Valley. NPR's Laura Sydell reports on what he left behind. LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE: Andy Grove was tough in life and work. By the time he was 20 years old, Grove, who was Jewish, had survived the Nazi occupation of his native Hungary in hiding. He'd fled on foot to Austria after the Soviet invasion in 1956 and emigrated to New York City. Even though Grove barely spoke English, he completed an undergraduate degree in chemical engineering from the City University of New York. And then, Grove told NPR in a 2012 interview, he happily fled New York City. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)ANDY GROVE: I hated New York. It's ugly. It was uglier then, dirty. People are flowing on the street like rivers. SYDELL: Grove got his Ph. D. in chemistry from UC Berkeley. And he applied for a job at Fairchild Semiconductor in Palo Alto, the place where the first commercially successful silicon chips were made. Gordon Moore, one of the founders, remembers getting this note from Grove's graduate adviser. GORDON MOORE: This is a truly outstanding individual. Whoever hires him will be very fortunate. SYDELL: It turned out to be very fortunate. When Moore and his co-founder Robert Noyce decided to leave Fairchild in 1968 to form Intel, Moore says Grove invited himself along. MOORE: I told him that I was going to leave. And he says, I want to come too. SYDELL: The three men would turn Intel into the world's largest chip maker. Noyce saw where tech was going. Moore knew the right people to get it done. And Grove. . . LESLIE BERLIN: Andy Grove was the person who made the day-to-day functioning happen, the guy who actually made the products roll off the line. SYDELL: Leslie Berlin is the project historian at Stanford's Silicon Valley Archives. Berlin says Grove was tough, with a sense of humor. If you sent him a memo, he'd respond with stamps. Some were happy, but. . . BERLIN: He had what today we would call an emoji, with the little squinty eyes and the tongue sticking out. You could just picture it going bleh (ph. ). He would use that if he didn't like what he saw. SYDELL: Intel's first business was in memory chips. But by the 1980s, cheap Japanese chips were flooding the market. Intel was in trouble. Grove, then its president, recalled a pivotal moment with then-CEO Gordon Moore. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)GROVE: And I asked Gordon, you know, what would happen if somebody took us over? What would the new guy do? To which Gordon said. . . MOORE: You're out of the memory business. GROVE: He would get rid of us (laughter) and get out of the memory business. SYDELL: Intel began to focus on microprocessors. The company struck a deal with IBM. And it was Intel Inside that fueled the personal computer revolution, which fueled the game industry and the social media revolution and on and on. Grove would eventually become Intel's CEO and go on to make the company one of the world's most profitable. GROVE: We fostered a style of being that is interactive, collaborative but argumentative, that is really good for a technical company. SYDELL: A style that would be emulated by new tech managers, including the late Apple founder Steve Jobs, who became a close friend of Grove's.

MICHAEL SMITH: These are popular applications like Telegram Messenger, Threema, Kik, Surespot, and they can help to achieve a level of encryption, in text messaging in particular, that's very difficult for authorities to intercept in the first place and, secondly, to decrypt, unwind the message and ascertain what it is that's being conveyed. SIEGEL: But you're not describing extremely sophisticated stuff that's being written specifically for the Islamic State or ISIS, but rather stuff that's off the shelf. SMITH: That's correct. They want to ensure that there is ease of access. That's crucial for this organization. They are very rigorously involved in recruitment activities, incitement activities online. And what we're also seeing is that they are literally coordinating operations from inside the so-called caliphate in Europe and elsewhere in the West. SIEGEL: What you're saying is that to be part of a network in a European city that's involved in plotting a few attacks doesn't require having an expert hacker among the group. SMITH: That's correct, it does not. All of this technology is very user-friendly. It's very easy to find online. You can find it in app stores like Apple's and other places for Android devices. SIEGEL: But even so, there has to be some level of coordination. There has to be some level of instruction. I mean - you know, the image of, there'll be a jihadi terror plot workshop on how to communicate with your cell phone comes to mind, but what happens? How are people trained? Where are they trained? SMITH: They're being traded in places like Raqqa, where they're undergoing training that is overseen by Abu Mohammad al-Adnani, who is typically referred to as the Islamic State's chief spokesperson, but he's also the manager of the group's external operations. So in addition to receiving training in the use of weaponry, training in tactics, training that entails strategic thinking about targets where particular guidance is not provided remotely to strike a certain target, the training also includes the uses of encryption software so that people can continue to coordinate things with their handlers. And that really plays into the larger theater of terrorism. It amplifies the fear factor when we realize that this group can communicate with people around the world in ways that intelligence services cannot quickly identify and ascertain what is contained in the correspondence. SIEGEL: You've mentioned among the apps a Telegram Messenger. Do the makers of the app - do you know of how they've responded to the identification of their - their product with keeping terror plots secret? SMITH: I think the creator of Telegram has certainly expressed that he obviously had no intention of his technology being utilized in this manner. The extent to which he has cooperated with authorities in terms of helping them to access actual correspondence, that I'm unaware of. But what we have seen is that Telegram has been especially effective in trying to disrupt things, like the uses of its channels feature. I think they've been much more aggressive than twitter has in terms of trying to block Islamic State content on their platform. But at the same time, all of that is tantamount to a game of whack-a-mole. You close an account, they open another accountSIEGEL: Mr. Smith, thanks for talking with us today about it.

The company's trying to change its image by rolling out the new Acura NSX, the most expensive car being built by a major manufacturer in the U. S. From member station WOSU in Columbus, Mandie Trimble checks it out. MANDIE TRIMBLE, BYLINE: The Honda Performance Manufacturing Center is a new 184,000 square foot plant built in Marysville, Ohio, 45 miles northwest of Columbus. Honda already has a huge presence here, mass-producing safe, family-friendly Accords. But this is something different. Here, mechanics are using electric wrenches to help install an engine into a low, sleek body of a two-seat sports car. The hybrid will be marketed as the Acura NSX and it'll make its public debut in late April. Clement D'Souza is the project's chief engineer. CLEMENT D'SOUZA: You have three motors, a V6 six engine and a 9DCT transmission. (SOUNDBITE OF ENGINE REVVING)TRIMBLE: In other words, a whole lot of power. The Acura NSX can go from zero to 60 in three seconds. D'SOUZA: You have instant acceleration from the time you hit the gas pedal. The engine kicks in and the turbo backs it up so you're thrown in the back of your seat. TRIMBLE: That's the thrill of a supercar, which can leave a Tesla in the dust. Wealthy customers pay hundreds of thousands of dollars - millions even, for an exotic ride few others own. But at about $160,000, the Acura NSX is cheap compared with the supercars made in other countries. D'SOUZA: It's all this technology that you're adding to the car that brings it in that range, the same technology you'll see in a LaFerrari or a 918. JIM GILLETTE: The only downside that I would say that's potential is the proliferation of competing vehicles in the marketplace right now. TRIMBLE: Jim Gillette is an independent automotive analyst in Michigan. With names like Ferrari, Porsche and McLaren building hybrids too, Honda will face fierce competition. But, then again, it's got that big price advantage. GILLETTE: You're going to see a lot of people in the marketplace at the lower prices that may dream about a 918 or a LaFerrari but are going to be just as happy if not happier with the NSX. TRIMBLE: The biggest problem may be Honda's image. Gillette says Japanese cars are known for dependability, not high-performance. The first-generation NSX designed in the late 1980s didn't create much enthusiasm and Honda killed it off in 2005. GILLETTE: People have migrated to the German cars more in terms of excitement so I think that there clearly needs to be a move now on the part of Honda. TRIMBLE: Analyst Eric Lyman with truecar. com agrees. ERIC LYMAN: As the luxury market has gone more towards performance in the last decade or so, Acura's missed out on that. TRIMBLE: Honda's D'Souza says NSX's goal is to become a superstar, shining so brightly it acts like a halo. D'SOUZA: It will definitely help the brand. The technology in the supercar can be cascaded down to the rest of the Acura brand. TRIMBLE: Honda is hoping the hype will get people talking about Acura and then visiting dealerships.

Microsoft unveiled its latest version of artificial intelligence last week. It's a kind of software, kind of like Siri and Apple's iPhones or like M on Facebook, except Microsoft designed their software with a different goal. They named her Tay, and they designed her to tweet and engage people on other social media pretty much like a 19-year-old girl might do it. But Tay developed a mind of her own - sort of. And she became a hateful racist monster. We reached out Alex Kantrowitz. He's a tech reporter with BuzzFeed News. And we asked him do these bots work? ALEX KANTROWITZ: So this is one of the more fascinating things about artificial intelligence. The more data it ingests, the smarter it becomes. And then it's supposed to be able to learn unsupervised, so without a programmer hovering over them. And so as people started programming more and more terrible things in to Tay, it started to take on that personality. ZWERDLING: OK, so now I have an iPhone, and I say to Siri - you know, I ask her outrageous questions just to laugh at her answers. So how was Tay different? KANTROWITZ: So Tay is different because unlike Siri and maybe Facebook's M, those two other virtual systems, their purpose is to help you get things done or find something out. Tay wanted to engage its users, make them feel like they're having a good time and so had to be designed with significantly more personality to achieve its goal. What happened with Tay was that Microsoft programmed it with a repeat-after-me game. So you could get Tay to repeat anything after you. So people who got frustrated trying to get Tay to answer questions with, you know, terrible bigoted undertones ended up saying, so why don't we just have it repeat after us? And then that's how some of the most awful things that Tay said ended up getting put out there. ZWERDLING: Speaking of awful, we tried to find some tweets that showed the racist ugly things that Tay was saying to people. And we can't find one that we can even, you know, play with beeps on the air. But can you characterize them without being too vile? KANTROWITZ: There are many denying the Holocaust, many calling for genocide. There's pictures of Hitler saying swag alert. They run across the board and are all pretty horrific. ZWERDLING: You know, we tried to engage with Tay in the social media world, and she's appeared. Microsoft has yanked her (laughter) - you know, you yanked her off. What do you think is the moral of this whole episode? KANTROWITZ: So I think there are two morals. One is if you release a bot on Twitter, you can never underestimate how terrible some of the folks on that platform are going to be. Second moral is when you do release a bot, you've got to make you have some filters on it. Make sure it doesn't say heil Hitler. Make sure it doesn't use racial slurs. And that should put you in a better place than Microsoft found it in - itself in this week. ZWERDLING: Alex Kantrowitz is a tech reporter for BuzzFeed News. Thanks so much for joining us today.

I think we've known for a long time that there are people that can hack into anything, and we're just always trying to make technology better. CORNISH: One thing that happened - with all the publicity drawn to this cases, does it seem like it was basically an open invite to hackers everywhere to try and break into the iPhone? Is that what happened, essentially (laughter), and you know, how do people deal with this? SELL: Yeah, I think it is. And that's a great thing. An open invitation to hackers is something that we have a Wickr and many technology companies have in the form of bug bounties. And really the idea is everyone knows that there's holes in their system. And the idea of a bug bounty is that you're engaging the entire global community to say, hey, we value your research, and we couldn't do this alone; come to us if you find flaws so that we can fix the system and make it better for everyone. And this is something that many technology companies do and one thing that Apple could do better. CORNISH: But there was this big fear from the tech industry - you and others - about, you know, if the government, if the FBI got a kind of way into the iPhone or forced the company to help them crack into this phone, that privacy and security would be in danger.

And what's great about the fact that this conversation has made it to the mainstream is that I think we - you know, we've learned that as a community, and there will be more effort spent on security in fixing these holes, which is fantastic. CORNISH: In a way, the courts never did answer this question, though - right? - of whether the government can compel a company to crack open its security technology. Do you see this as the end of the discussion? SELL: It's definitely not the end of the discussion. But how I see it is that as of today, there is no legal authority in the United States to make me or any other technology company change their code and change it in a way that they think is devastating to not only their customers but national world security.

This, after the FBI announced earlier this week it had exactly broken into the iPhone of one of San Bernardino attackers using an unnamed third party. Yesterday on this program, NPR's Aarti Shahani looked at another such cold case in Louisiana. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: The question of who shot Brittney Mills is wide open. And the answer could be locked up in an iPhone - her iPhone phone. Unlike the San Bernardino shooter, she's the victim and not the perpetrator. But like that case, investigators are not able to enter into the phone. It's running on the iOS 8 operating system. East Baton Rouge District Attorney Hillar Moore. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)HILLAR MOORE: No gun left, no gun found. We really are desperate to try to get into the phone just to see if there's anything else there. MONTAGNE: That Louisiana district attorney may or may get the help he wants from the FBI. But there's certainly lots of interest in those working on cases like Brittney Mills' across the country. The FBI has not said in the Arkansas case, where it is helping out, whether it will use the same third-party method that it used with Apple. For more on the significance of all of this, we turned to Philip Mudd. He's analyst formerly with the CIA and FBI. Good morning. PHILIP MUDD: Good morning. MONTAGNE: Now, there's an offer to Arkansas by the FBI following its tangle with Apple. Seems like a bit - like a poke in the eye. What do you make of that decision? MUDD: I don't see it as a poke in the eye. Look, anytime you want to understand what happens in a terrorism case or a criminal case, you have very basic questions, pattern of life questions - who did the subject speak to? Did they take photographs that are of interest? Who's on their list of contacts? - for example, simple questions you would get in any case. And I think what the FBI is suggesting is that in the 21st century, those answers are on an iPhone. And they need access to that iPhone to get the most basic of answers about what your pattern of life is in a criminal or terrorism case. MONTAGNE: Well, a moment ago, we heard about the case of 29-year-old Brittney Mills whose locked cell - iPhone may contain clues to her murder. There will be others. Is this a technology the FBI - and I'm guessing from what you've just said - should share? MUDD: I think they should. I don't think that's the right question at the moment. Remember, we have a third-party entity - a private entity that was paid by the FBI for the capability to get into the phone. If I were that third-party entity, I would say - to the FBI - you don't have the right to give what we just told you to Apple. If Apple wants this, they'll have to approach us and pay us a lot of money to realize how we broke into their phone. So I don't think it's as simple as asking whether the FBI should share it. I wouldn't share it if I were them because I'm not sure they own it. MONTAGNE: Well, this gets us to the big mystery here - who is the third party? And it's been floated - everything from an Israeli company to Apple itself. MUDD: (Laughter). MONTAGNE: What do you think? Or what do you know, if anything? MUDD: I don't know anything. But I think this solution about third parties is not a long-term answer. Look, there's going to be different operating systems, different devices, different phones in the future. To anticipate that in every criminal case and every terrorism case as time progresses and new devices come on the market, that a new entity will come forward and say - we can break it - is not an efficient way to access these phones. I think we're still getting around the basic issue. How do you develop a relationship between Silicon Valley firms and the FBI so that this can be done by the firms that actually develop the technology and that we don't anticipate that individual firms simply come forward in the future and come up with solutions for how to get into the these devices? MONTAGNE: Well, do you think that that is possibly where we are headed next, just briefly? MUDD: I do. I think that eventually there's going to be either an agreement between the companies or congressional legislation to solve this because the FBI can't be relying on people coming forward to solve this for Apple and for the FBI. MONTAGNE: Just sort of randomly, hopefully. MUDD: That's correct. Yeah, I don't think that's a solution going into the future. MONTAGNE: All right. Well, thank you very much for joining us. MUDD: My pleasure. MONTAGNE: Philip Mudd is a former FBI, CIA and National Security Council counterintelligence official. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:   The FBI has agreed to assist prosecutors in Arkansas in gaining access to an iPhone and another device believed to contain evidence in a murder trial. This, after the FBI announced earlier this week it had exactly broken into the iPhone of one of San Bernardino attackers using an unnamed third party. Yesterday on this program, NPR's Aarti Shahani looked at another such cold case in Louisiana. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: The question of who shot Brittney Mills is wide open. And the answer could be locked up in an iPhone - her iPhone phone. Unlike the San Bernardino shooter, she's the victim and not the perpetrator. But like that case, investigators are not able to enter into the phone. It's running on the iOS 8 operating system. East Baton Rouge District Attorney Hillar Moore. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HILLAR MOORE: No gun left, no gun found. We really are desperate to try to get into the phone just to see if there's anything else there. MONTAGNE: That Louisiana district attorney may or may get the help he wants from the FBI. But there's certainly lots of interest in those working on cases like Brittney Mills' across the country. The FBI has not said in the Arkansas case, where it is helping out, whether it will use the same third-party method that it used with Apple. For more on the significance of all of this, we turned to Philip Mudd. He's analyst formerly with the CIA and FBI. Good morning. PHILIP MUDD: Good morning.

I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, ideas about Crisis and Response. So far on the show, we've been talking about how we humans respond to crises. But what if technology could help us respond better and faster? NANCY LUBLIN: The number is 741741, and you text it like you're texting your best friend. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: I can't take my family. LUBLIN: There's real pain out there. RAZ: Nancy Lublin. . . LUBLIN: And we're seeing it every day. RAZ: . . . Founded Crisis Text Line. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: I'm so nervous, and it's making me nauseous. RAZ: Crisis Text Line is just what it sounds like, and they get messages from every area code in the U. S. And every day, people use it to connect with counselors to ask for help with anxiety or depression or worse. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: I want to die or run away. LUBLIN: Before starting this interview, I looked down at my phone - 'cause I have the live stats on my phone - and there are 12 suicidal people right now texting with us while you and I are talking. RAZ: Wow. And Nancy can use every text that comes in. . . UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: I feel completely invisible. RAZ: . . . To better understand moments of crisis. . . UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: I feel like all my friends and leaving me. What do I do? RAZ: . . . What triggers them and how to respond. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #4: I kept saying stop. I don't like this. LUBLIN: And it's so amazing to see how just someone being there for them and responding and caring and asking questions and validating can take the heat out of that moment. RAZ: If any text to Crisis Text Line comes from a suicidal person who suggests they might try something, Nancy's counselors trigger something called an active rescue which alerts the local police. And that's what happened to one girl Nancy mentioned in her TED Talk. She sent in a text saying, I want to die. I have a bottle of the pills on the desk in front of me. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)LUBLIN: And so the crisis counselor says, how about you put those pills in the drawer while we text? And they go back and forth for a while, and the crisis counselor gets the girl to give her her address because if you're texting a text line, you want help. So she gets the address, and the counselor triggers an active rescue while they're texting back and forth. And then it goes quiet, 23 minutes with no response from this girl. And the next message that comes in says, it's the mom. I had no idea, and I was in the house. We're in an ambulance on our way to the hospital. As a mom, that one just - that just - the next message comes a month later. I just got out of the hospital. I was diagnosed as bipolar, and I think I'm going to be OK. (APPLAUSE)LUBLIN: Now, I would love to tell you that that's an unusual exchange, but we're doing on average 2. 41 active rescues a day. The beautiful thing about Crisis Text Line is that these are strangers counseling other strangers on the most intimate issues. It's exciting. And I will tell you that we have done a total of more than 6. 5 million text messages in less than two years. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: That number is now more than 15 million. And with all those messages coming in, Nancy and her team saw an opportunity. They thought, maybe we could turn those text messages into data, data that could be the difference between life and death. LUBLIN: We decided that we wanted to take people based on severity and not chronology. So when you call most customer service places or when you call other phone hotlines, you're taken chronologically. . . RAZ: Right. LUBLIN: . . . In the order that you come in. But shouldn't it work more like a hospital emergency room. . . RAZ: Yeah. LUBLIN: . . . Where the gunshot wound is taken before, you know, the kid with a funny rash. . . RAZ: Yeah. LUBLIN: . . . Or the sprained ankle? Well, that's how we operate. If you text in, I want to die, I want to kill myself, we code you orange, and you are number one in the queue. RAZ: So what Nancy and her team can do is feed every text into a database and then a computer algorithm can start to make sense of things that at first seem nonsensical, like a few months ago when the algorithm started identifying people as suicidal when they texted in #KMS. LUBLIN: I had no idea what that was. Apparently, it became shorthand for kill myself, and people have been using that on the Internet. The algorithm picked that up and made those people number one in the queue. RAZ: Wow. LUBLIN: And so those people are then getting a human eye and a human response in 1. 8 minutes. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)LUBLIN: We have the data to know what makes a great counselor. We know that if you text the words numbs and sleeve, there's a 99 percent match for cutting. We know that if you text in the words MG and rubber band, there's a 99 percent match for substance abuse. And we know that if you text in sex, oral and Mormon you're questioning if you're gay. Now, that's interesting information that a counselor could figure out. But that algorithm in our hands means that an automatic pop-up says, 99 percent match for cutting. Try asking one of these questions to prompt the counselor. Or 99 percent match for substance abuse  - here are three drug clinics near the texter. It makes us more accurate. I can tell you that the worst day of the week for eating disorders - Monday. The worst time of day for substance abuse - 5 a. m. And that Montana is a beautiful place to visit but you do not want to live there because it is the number one state for suicidal ideation. And we've made this data public and free and open. We've pulled all the personally identifiable information, and it's in a place called CrisisTrends. org because I want schools to be able see. . . (APPLAUSE)LUBLIN: . . . I want schools to be able to see that Monday is the worst day for eating disorders, so that they can plan meals and guidance counselors to be there on Mondays. And I want families to see that substance abuse questions spike at 5 a. m. And I want somebody to take care of those Native American reservations in Montana. RAZ: I'm amazed, like, that you've been able to sort of find out, like, these moments - right? - like 5 a. m. is the worst time for substance abuse, and, you know, depending on the day of the week people can behave - are more likely to behave in certain ways. LUBLIN: Yeah. It's illuminating. And you can just go down a rabbit hole on that website and it - because it's all real time, it changes. So in October, I turned to our chief data scientist when some of the anti-Muslim rhetoric was really heating up in the presidential campaign. And I said, you know what? Just pull conversations where someone indicates that they're Muslim and see what's happened since this. And there was a 600 percent increase in October, and I think it was a 900 percent increase in November in people saying that they were Muslim and either were experiencing anxiety, bullying, depression, any number of those issues. It's just really exciting to have the data sets and put them out there and ask the questions. But there are people who will then research and find out, why is this or change policies based on this data. You know, information can save lives. RAZ: Nancy Lublin is the founder of the Crisis Text Line. You can see her full talk at ted. com. And if you need help, the Crisis Text Line number is 741741.

The hijacker has what looks like a suicide vest of explosives strapped to his chest. Ben Innes is grinning. I'm not sure why I did it, Mr. Innes told the Sun, I just threw caution to the wind while trying to stay cheerful in the face of adversity. I figured if his bomb was real, I had nothing to lose anyway. So I took a chance to get a closer look at it. The bomb was not real. The hijacker who took over EgyptAir MS181 turned out to be a troubled man who wanted to attract the attentions of his ex-wife, not a terrorist from ISIS or al-Qaida. He's now in custody. But any person who hijacks an airplane terrorizes people. The hijacking lasted six hours. The plane, bound for Cairo, was diverted to Cyprus.

Those of us who've never been on a hijacked plane with a man who looks like he has a bomb strapped to his chest should probably be slow to criticize, but it's hard not wonder why someone would pose for a smiling selfie with a hijacker instead of, say, the highly professional flight attendants who worked to keep their passengers from harm. Is it just because the hijacker was famous, no matter what hideous thing he did to become so, for a few minutes in the middle of a news cycle? Ben Innes posed with the hijacker and became briefly famous himself. But his brief fling with stardom may follow him for the rest of his life.

We wondered when that phrase - virtual reality - first showed up on NPR. It's the perfect candidate for our series. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MEN: First Mention. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  This is when we try to track down in our archives the first time a person or concept was heard on our air. Now, the search for virtual reality took us to August 8, 1989. That's when our co-host Robert Siegel introduced a story this way. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)ROBERT SIEGEL, BYLINE: What science fiction writers have dreamt of for decades, scientists now say is possible, to simulate reality to create with the aid of a computer a lifelike world of the imagination, a place not bound by physical laws or reason. Computer scientists call the concept virtual or artificial reality. SHAPIRO: He was introducing a piece by WBUR reporter David Baron on a new virtual reality computer system and the man behind that technology. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)DAVID BARON, BYLINE: One of the greatest proponents of virtual reality is 29-year-old Jaron Lanier. Lanier holds no bachelor's degree or high school diploma, yet some call him a visionary. CORNISH: Now four years earlier, according to Baron, Lanier had started VPL Research, a California company that builds virtual reality systems. Here's Lanier describing it. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)JARON LANIER: It's basically this new kind of reality. It feels as real as the physical world, but you can change it and you can make it anything you like. SHAPIRO: The reporter David Baron found it took more than just a computer to create this virtual world. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)BARON: Making it appear real to people requires special equipment. Most importantly a device Lanier calls an EyePhone. SHAPIRO: That's an E-Y-E - EyePhone, oversized goggles with two miniature video monitors inside that produce 3-D images. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)LANIER: What happens is as you move your head, the images that you see create this illusion that you're moving around inside an imaginary world that's really there, and the illusion is completely compelling. CORNISH: Lanier's VR system also included a data glove. The glove allowed users to move objects in the virtual environment. But there were problems with what Lanier said the system could do. Baron tried it out and reported that the images were blurry and cartoonlike. He also found a noticeable delay between when he turned his head and when the image turned before his eyes. Also people were advised to stop the experience after 45 minutes. David Baron couldn't even take it that long. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)BARON: After about 15 minutes, I'm feeling disoriented and a tinge queasy. This condition sometimes called simulator sickness. SHAPIRO: Back in 1989, there was another big issue with virtual reality, the cost. The whole rig - headset, computer - it ran a whopping $250,000. Jaron Lanier's venture into the business of virtual reality did not take off. His company filed for bankruptcy the following year in 1990. But Lanier has continued pushing the bounds of science and technology, and in 2010 Time magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:   Virtual reality headsets have finally hit the consumer market. We wondered when that phrase - virtual reality - first showed up on NPR. It's the perfect candidate for our series. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MEN: First Mention. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:   This is when we try to track down in our archives the first time a person or concept was heard on our air. Now, the search for virtual reality took us to August 8, 1989. That's when our co-host Robert Siegel introduced a story this way. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) ROBERT SIEGEL, BYLINE: What science fiction writers have dreamt of for decades, scientists now say is possible, to simulate reality to create with the aid of a computer a lifelike world of the imagination, a place not bound by physical laws or reason. Computer scientists call the concept virtual or artificial reality. SHAPIRO: He was introducing a piece by WBUR reporter David Baron on a new virtual reality computer system and the man behind that technology. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) DAVID BARON, BYLINE: One of the greatest proponents of virtual reality is 29-year-old Jaron Lanier. Lanier holds no bachelor's degree or high school diploma, yet some call him a visionary.

Costs are way down. Of course, the sun doesn't always shine, and the wind doesn't always blow when we need it to. It's All Tech Considered. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SHAPIRO: Today the race to store energy - as our three stories point out, it is going far beyond the typical battery. Lauren Sommer from member station KQED in California starts us off. LAUREN SOMMER, BYLINE: Like a lot of solar companies in California, things have been have extremely busy for Recurrent Energy and its vice president, Michael Wheeler. In his San Francisco office, he points to a screen showing how all their solar farms are doing. MICHAEL WHEELER: Pretty much every day, we hit peak output. SOMMER: But earlier this spring, something happened that at first doesn't seem to make any sense. It was the middle of the day when one of their solar farms was cranking out electricity, and they got a message. WHEELER: The grid operator is telling us they don't need all of it. SOMMER: There was too much electricity on the grid. The folks managing the grid were telling solar farms to shut down. WHEELER: Project went from almost peak output to zero for about two hours. SOMMER: This often happens in the spring when Californians aren't using a lot of air-conditioning yet, and it's only expected to get worse as solar keeps growing. The state plans to get fully half of its electricity from renewable sources in just 15 years. WHEELER: We built these solar projects, and to the extent that we have to turn them off more and more often doesn't make a lot of sense. It would be a lot better to figure out uses for that electricity. SOMMER: And there's a really obvious way to use it. California needs lots of power in the evening right after the sun goes down, so a solar farm could store the extra electricity it generates during the daytime. WHEELER: And then use it later in the evening. SOMMER: Storing energy isn't a new idea, but building massive banks of batteries - that's expensive. California regulators don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to see solar go to waste, so now they're requiring utilities to build energy storage. And that's launched startup companies looking for a different way to do it. STEVE CRANE: So what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking at really is best described as a giant scuba tank. SOMMER: Steve Crane is pointing to a huge, 25-foot tank in the warehouse of his company, LightSail Energy, in Berkeley, Calif. A scuba tank really is the inspiration for his technology. It compresses air. CRANE: The electrical energy is hard to hold onto. Compressed air is relatively easy to store for hours or even days. SOMMER: Here's how it works. When there's extra electricity, Crane turns on a giant air pump. It fills the tank, compressing the air by 200 times. Then when electricity is needed, the air is released to drive an electric generator. The hard part has been dealing with all the heat this makes. CRANE: Any air compressor that's used, even a bicycle pump, creates heat. You know, a bicycle pump will feel warm after you've used it for a while. SOMMER: Crane's technology uses water to capture some of the heat so the energy isn't lost. The technology is still in the early stages, but Crane says it could have an edge over batteries. It's cheaper, and it lasts longer. CRANE: If you have a laptop or cell phone, you know that after two to three years, you start to see significant deterioration. SOMMER: But Crane's company isn't the only one trying to beat batteries. JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: Another company is one state over in Nevada. I'm Jeff Brady, and on the Las Vegas strip, a lot of electricity is needed at night to power all those casinos and lights. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Experience this hot show in its new home in Paris Las Vegas. BRADY: To use solar energy after the sun goes down, you have to store it. That's being done at a new power plant in the desert more than 200 miles north. We're at the gate of facility, and we're just outside a little town called Tonapah, Nev. Kevin Smith is CEO of SolarReserve, the company behind the very unique Crescent Dunes Solar Energy Plant. Instead of neat rows of solar panels, it has more than 10,000 billboard-sized mirrors arranged in concentric circles. The whole thing stretches a mile and three quarters across. The mirrors reflect heat from the sun to a tower that's twice as tall as the Statue of Liberty. High up, it's glowing white-hot. KEVIN SMITH: At the top of that tower is a heat exchanger which is where kind of all of the energy collection happens, and through that heat exchanger flows molten salt. BRADY: Molten salt - that's the key to this project. The salt is liquid. Smith says it looks like water. It's heated to 1,050 degrees in that white-hot section of the tower. Then the molten salt travels down pipes to an insulated tank. SMITH: And then when we want to generate electricity, we utilize that heat in molten salt to generate steam through a conventional steam turbine on the back end. BRADY: Smith says this plant can generate electricity for 75,000 Nevada homes, and it can do that for up to 10 hours after the sun goes down. Probably the biggest barrier to building more plants like this is money. This facility cost nearly a billion dollars. The electricity has to be sold well above market rate, but Smith says future plants like this will get cheaper. So that's an example of storing energy with heat. My colleague Leigh Paterson says you can also store energy with ice. LEIGH PATERSON, BYLINE: I'm here to meet Greg Miller. GREG MILLER: We're in downtown Fort Collins, Colo. It's a beautiful downtown area. PATERSON: He works for company called Ice Energy. MILLER: Let's go this way. We'll go the alleyway. PATERSON: We walk behind buildings, passing dumpsters and air-conditioners. Then we come across a large box covered in a brightly painted mural. MILLER: How do you like the Bears (laughter)? We've got the polar bear. We've got the honey bear and the panda bear. PATERSON: The panda is munching on bamboo. The honey bear is licking up honey. It's all very snuggly and cute, but the art is meant to disguise an industrial, practical piece of equipment called the Ice Bear. MILLER: This is a thermal energy storage battery. PATERSON: Regular battery stores energy in chemical form. A thermal battery uses temperature. MILLER: This unit stores energy at night. It freezes 450 gallons in the tank. PATERSON: Four-hundred-fifty gallons of water - that gigantic block of frozen ice is then used to cool down the building next door during the hottest time of the day and into early evening. MILLER: So essentially what we're doing is we're shutting air conditioners off during the day, consuming energy at night and displacing that peak load for the utility company. PATERSON: Peak load - that's the time of day or year when we're using the most electricity. In Fort Collins, that's in the summer between the hours of 2 p. m. and 7 p. m. The Ice Bear brings down the total amount of electricity needed during those busy peaks. But there's an important limitation to all of this. In Colorado, it's still practically winter. The city building that this Ice Bear services doesn't need AC right now. MILLER: It's really just - it's sitting idle, waiting for that cooling demand to hit. PATERSON: The Ice Bear, unlike compressed air or molten salt storage, saves up energy for temperature control but can't feed electricity back onto the grid. But when temperatures soar in the summer and it's 80 degrees instead of 8, the Ice Bear goes to work. For NPR News, I'm Leigh Paterson in Fort Collins, Colo.

I'm Terry Gross. My guest Dan Lyons has reported on and satirized the tech industry. He reported on the industry for Newsweek and Forbes, he wrote the satirical fake Steve Jobs blog and has been a member of the writing team for the HBO comedy series \"Silicon Valley. \" He was laid off from Newsweek shortly before it discontinued its print edition. Nine months later in April 2013, when he was 52, he took a job in the world he'd long written about and became the marketing fellow at a startup called HubSpot, which sells a marketing software platform designed to help companies attract visitors and turn them into customers. At this startup, Lyons was the old guy, twice the age of many of the people he worked with. He stayed less than two years. He's written a new memoir called \"Disrupted: My Misadventure In The Start-Up Bubble. \" He describes the book as the story of what it's like to reinvent yourself and start a new career in your 50s in an industry that is by and large hostile to older workers. He also wanted to puncture some of the popular mythology about startups by providing a look inside one. He wasn't expecting the FBI to investigate whether there had been an attempt to prevent his book's publication, but that's a story for later in our interview. Dan Lyons, welcome to FRESH AIR. So describe the predicament you found yourself in as a suddenly out of work 52-year-old journalist. DAN LYONS: Well, it's a tough market right now in journalism and the media business. And I, on the one hand, found myself - well, I just was working at Newsweek, so it should be easy for me to get a job. But then you look around and realize, God, there really aren't that many jobs left in journalism and there are fewer and fewer every year. And it was kind of like wasn't just that I had lost my job, it's that my industry was kind of going away, and there were not many jobs. There are some but they're fewer and fewer. So that was the real panic was that not just that I had lost my job but that my entire industry was kind of vanishing. GROSS: A couple of years before you were laid off from Newsweek - and this was not long before they just basically went under - Newsweek had a cover story back in 2011 headlined \"The Beached White Male. \" And describe what was on the cover and. . . (LAUGHTER)LYONS: It was a hilarious cover. It was very controversial. It was a picture of a guy in a business suit face down on a beach, you know, and the wave has just washed him - he's just been washed ashore. And it was a story about how the downturn in 2008 and 9 had disproportionately hit white males in, say, their 40s and 50s - white men of a certain age who had attained sort of high-level jobs got washed out and then found themselves unable to find anything else. And there's this whole generation of guys about my age who found themselves in this terrible predicament sort of shuffling around their houses in bathrooms. They were like zombies. And I read it at the time and I was gainfully employed at Newsweek thinking, well, that's interesting, but it's not going to be me. And then, yeah, two years later, I got the ax and I thought, oh, my God, I've become a beached white male, you know? I'm that guy. GROSS: And, you know, journalism wasn't likely to have a lot of opportunities for you 'cause so many journalistic organizations have been downsizing. People have been taking buyouts, you know, the staffs are shrinking. So you turned to the tech industry. Why did you decide to make that kind of turn? LYONS: Well, I had been covering tech for my whole career. I was a technology reporter. And I think everybody who covers tech at some point or another feels like a little kid with their face pressed against the glass looking in at the candy shop and going, wow, it looks so cool and so much fun. And you see all these people that you cover and you get to know them because you have relationships with them and they're all becoming wildly rich and just having the time of their lives. And so I think most of us who cover tech at some point dabble with the idea of what it would be like to go work at one of these companies. And a lot of people do actually cross over. It's not unheard of. It's the akin to being, like, a sportswriter covering pro baseball but you know, in that case, you can never - you're never going to play for the Yankees. You just can't do it. But in tech, you could do it. You know, there are people who do things in tech that have the same skill sets that journalists have. They write, they edit, they put out press releases. So I've had a lot of friends over the years who have crossed over. One was a woman back in the '80s. She and I went to Microsoft together on a story - came back, wrote a big package of stories for this computer trade magazine we worked for. And then she turned right around and flew right back out and got a job at Microsoft in, say, 1988 and by the late '90s was retired. And so you hear - you know, you know people like that who have done this and you think, why am I not doing this? Why am I not getting in on this? GROSS: So in addition to the thought of maybe I'll get rich, what were some of the things that you thought would be cool about working in the tech industry? When you had your nose pressed against the glass, what were some of the things you saw that you thought, I'd like to do that? LYONS: Well, there's a lot of energy. There's a lot of people having fun. The companies are growing. I remember thinking when I first took this job that this is the first job I've had in about 10 years where I'm working at a company that's actually getting bigger every year rather than getting smaller every year. And, you know, there's a kind of depression that sets in institutionally at big magazines and media companies where it's - you're just kind of waiting for next year and the next round of layoffs and downsizing and you're going to lose some friends who take a package. It was just great to be at a place that's booming, that's growing, that's adding people. And also, there's a sense in the media business - and I share this sentiment - that technology is really reshaping the media business. And I kind of thought, I want to get in on that. I want to get in on how the media business is changing, how people are telling stories in new ways. And the tech guys, in many ways, are doing a better job of that. Microsoft has a thing called Microsoft Stories now that is really a phenomenal publication, and it just happens to be funded by Microsoft. So there's that too. You realize that if you're in the media business, technology is fundamentally what's driving the change in that business. And so I thought it would be a way to learn that. GROSS: OK, so you - and you really needed a job because your wife had left her job because of chronic migraines, you had two twins that were about to turn 7, you needed health insurance, you needed a job. And so you got a job at a marketing tech company in Boston near where you lived. And you were going to be the marketing fellow. So describe, like, what the company did and what your job within that company was going to be. LYONS: It's a software company. They make software that's delivered over the cloud. So you don't actually buy the software in a package and install it on your computer. You just get a subscription and you use the computer on the cloud - on Internet service. So it's Internet-delivered software. And it's aimed at marketing people, so it helps you find customers. You can send email, you can write blog post, you can track who's visiting your website and then contact those people. So it's essentially software that helps companies find customers by sending email or writing blog posts. It's software for marketing people. And my job was going to be to help sort of build brand awareness by writing articles that would make people in the industry - or potential customers - aware of this company and their offerings not really by touting their products but just by writing articles that people would find interesting and then they would see that that article had been brought to them or sponsored by this company and somehow build a link in their minds that they should start thinking about buying this software. GROSS: Is that what you ended up doing? LYONS: Not really. I ended up being put in a room they called the content factory and just told to sort of crank out blog posts that would generate leads. And so yes and no in terms of whether it's what I ended up doing. I think what I ended up doing was very low-level blog posts that were - for example, I might write a blog post that says, what is HTML? And it just explains a primer of what HTML is. And then you hope that Google will surface that article. When someone does a search, what is HTML? They'll find that article. They'll click through to it and then at the end of it, they might click another button that says click here to learn more about our software. So it was very low-level kind of how-to information. It wasn't very fun to write. GROSS: So you were in your early 50s. You join this, you know, startup. Can I call it a startup? LYONS: Yeah. GROSS: And the staff is - what? - mostly in their 20s and 30s? LYONS: Average age was 26, a lot of people right out of college, a smaller number of people in their 30s. And then the people in their '30s were really the grown-ups. Very few in their 40s. I think I was the only one in their 50s, and there was one guy who was older than me. He was in his 60s. But, yeah, very, very much a culture of people all in their '20s. GROSS: And that was uncomfortable for you. So what made you most uncomfortable about that? LYONS: Well, it wasn't uncomfortable at first. At first, I actually really liked it 'cause I thought it reminded me of a place where I worked right out of college at a computer trade magazine where I was right out of college and everybody else was.  And we had a blast. And we were - our magazine was growing and booming and it was very exciting and we had a lot of new ideas and we had a lot of fun. And at first, I really liked it. I didn't realize the company skewed so young. I thought there would be a greater diversity of people. It's just hard to fit in sometimes when you have, you know - if you're married, you have kids and you want to go home and you don't want to build your life around a company. You don't want to go to parties, you don't want to go kayaking or do team-building exercises. But I don't think the age thing was so much of an issue. I sort of really learned a lot and enjoyed working with young people. I just think it would have been more fun to have a few people my age around. GROSS: So can you remember back when you were working for that magazine -or the publication - and everybody was really young, including you when you were right out of college, what did you think then of people who were 52 (laughter)? LYONS: Oh, I thought they were ancient, you know? That's the thing. I remember exactly being that age. And I remember thinking, go, just leave, you know? And then I (laughter) - then I'd become that guy, right? I've become the grumpy old man kind of thing, yeah. GROSS: Did you feel like you were seen as the grumpy old man or that you were becoming the grumpy old man? LYONS: Yeah, I think - it was funny, people - like, when I first started, people would, you know, when you come to a doorway and you're going out and someone else is going in, they were very nice kids. And a lot of them would hold the door and call me sir. They'd be like, oh, Sir, please, you go first. GROSS: (Laughter). LYONS: It was kind of like - and I was like (laughter) you know what I mean? Like, oh, - they almost looked like they saw a ghost, you know, like, oh, my parents are here, you know? And so that was awkward. But, no, I didn't feel like a grumpy old man. There were little sort of comments a lot all the time about - I think just - I never felt old before this. GROSS: So one of the things that seemed to bother you was, like, language differences like, you know, expressions that were used, too many exclamation points (laughter). . . LYONS: Yeah (laughter). GROSS: . . . In emails. Talk a little bit about what you saw as the language differences between what you were used to as a journalist and as someone who was 52 and a lot of the writing and emails and texts that you were getting. LYONS: Yeah, and I think that's not so much a generational thing as it is sort of a cultural thing. I think journalists tend to be very skeptical and cynical and we kind of have a dark sense of humor. And we also don't like jargon. We sort of see jargon and it makes our skin crawl. And we see it as our mission in life to sort of undo jargon and put it back into English. And in a world of marketing, it's kind of the opposite. You're the ones making the jargon and embracing it and promoting it. GROSS: So what's an example of the kind of jargon that really irritated you? LYONS: Well, there's two. One is a word called delightion (ph), which was like a made up word which they would use a lot very seriously without any irony. Like, we engage in delightion (ph), which really meant delighting your customers, making them happy, doing anything you can to make the customers love your product and have a great experience. They would talk about delightion (ph). And, yeah, that kind of makes your skin crawl, I think, when you are someone who works with words. There's another one they came up with which was this expression, one plus one equals three. That, you know, our software is so magical that one plus one equals three. And then they would use that as kind of an adjective. Like, you'd say, well, how about if we try this? And they'd be like, I like that idea, but it's not one-plus-one-equals-three enough. And I was like, what does that even mean? It doesn't really mean anything. And - but it was just, yeah - there were lots of terms that were just - there was like its own language. The company had kind of its own language and its own words for everything. And a lot of it was about obfuscation and euphemizing things that were sometimes unsavory. GROSS: So when you became a part of what's called, like, corporate journalism, did you fear that you were part of the problem now blurring the line between journalism and marketing or between journalism and advertising? LYONS: Absolutely, it was really, really uncomfortable. And I had - yeah - I had - I didn't feel good about it. And I rationalized and said, well, this'll be OK and it's - I'm still going to be doing something legitimate or worthwhile. But it - that was a rationalization. There are some examples of corporate journalism that I think are good and respectable and people are doing a good job. And some of them are run by friends of mine, and I like what they're doing. But in the particular situation that I found myself in, no. There was nothing really legitimate about it. It was just a sellout, and that didn't make me happy. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Dan Lyons. He's written a new memoir called \"Disrupted: My Misadventure In The Start-Up Bubble. \" And it's about how after he was laid off from Newsweek, he joined a tech startup, and it didn't work out how he hoped. (LAUGHTER)GROSS: And he's written for the past two seasons of \"Silicon Valley. \" That's season two and season three. Season three's the one that's about to actually start on HBO. So we're going to take a short break, then we'll be back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, my guest is Dan Lyons, who covered the tech industry for Forbes and then for Newsweek. When he was laid off from Newsweek at the age of 52, he decided to cross over and work for a tech startup, where he was in the marketing department doing what's often described as corporate journalism. Things did not work out as he planned. His memoir is called \"Disrupted: My Misadventures In The Startup Bubble. \" He's also been a writer for \"Silicon Valley,\" the HBO series, for season two and for season three, the season that's about to start later this month. You describe the company that you work for as a cross between a frat house and a cult compound. LYONS: Yeah, the frat house culture was - they had every year on Cinco de Mayo had this big party and brought in all this tequila and Mexican food. And the CEO would run around wearing this giant sombrero and kind of getting loaded. And everybody would just party it up. And there were refrigerators stocked with beer all the time. And people would be at their desk like - people can - a lot of the sales guys would just come to work in shorts and flip-flops and T-shirts and backward baseball hats. And they'd be drinking beer. I mean, there were literally frat guys who had just left college and, like, just continued for them. And this was like a corporate frat house for them. They could go grab a beer, start hitting the phones, calling people. They'd party, you know, at night and stuff in the kitchen. And there'd be a lot of just life that was very much like a frat house. And people literally had just come from frats and sororities. And the cult compound stuff would be - I think the best example that I remember is in training. Ostensibly, you're in training to learn how to use the product. And you do get training on that. But you also get this big dose of how great the company is, how lucky you are to be here, how hard it is to get a job here. It's harder to get a job here than is to get into Harvard. And - but boy, now that you're in, that's just the first step.  Now you have to cut it, and most of you aren't going to make it because this place is only the best and the brightest. And then you start learning the language. You start learning all the various kind of language shifts that they use. In a way, that's very much like what cults do. Cults sort of change - they invent their own ways of describing things. If you look at Scientology - it's weird, I was reading Lawrence Wright's book \"Going Clear\" when I was working here. And it was scary to me to see some of the parallels. And I don't think it's necessarily somebody sits down and plans it out like, let's do what the Scientologists do, but I think they use some of the same techniques. Like, this company isn't just about selling software. This is about changing people's lives. This is about making people better at achieving your goals and conquering fear and, you know, personal empowerment and being the best you can be. So there's a lot of talk about that - sort of the rhetoric about personal growth and how amazing it is. But to get there, you have to buy in and you have to stay on the ladder and keep going up. And so that gets baked in very quickly, right, in training - we're the best and you just buy in. And if you do that, things go really, really well for you. GROSS: And that works for a lot of people. I mean, that's a good thing for a lot of people, right? LYONS: It does, yeah. And there are even people who are kind of aware of the cultiness (ph) of it, but they still like it. I had a friend there whose sister - I got to know her pretty well and then I got to know her sister. And her sister was a little bit cynical and would always refer to it as the cult, and so would my friend. She'd be like, yeah, yeah, I've got to go in to the cult tomorrow. But she kind of liked it even though it was - she knew - she was self-aware enough to know what it was like. But she also knew that she liked it, and she fit in, and she had friends there, and she enjoyed it. So yeah, it works for a lot of people. GROSS: So one of the things on HBO's comedy series, you know, \"Silicon Valley,\" which is set at a startup - it's about startups, and it's about startups seeking venture-capital and going for their IPO. One of the things that's satirized in that series, which you've written for for two seasons, is how this collision of the utopian idealism that everybody preaches in the startups and the cutthroat competition that's actually happening between them - that kind of ruthless competition behind the scenes. LYONS: Right, yeah, yeah. GROSS: And I'm wondering if you've observed that both as a reporter and as somebody who worked in the tech industry? LYONS: Absolutely. And the funny thing to me is that I think - when I first started covering technology, I was covering places like Intel and Microsoft and Google. But let's say the early, early days - the personal computer guys. They never really talked about having this big mission to change the world or make the world a better place or describing themselves like, you know, Mother Teresa or Nelson Mandela. They didn't see themselves that way. They were pretty much - you know, the Microsoft guys especially were just - we're going to build a company, we're going to sell a lot of stuff, we're going to make a lot of money. But ironically, they actually did make things that kind of did change the world. I mean, the microprocessor that Intel invented - that whole family of microprocessors - really did change the world. But I don't think Andy Grove ever talked in that kind of sappy, syrupy way about how he wanted to change the world. Andy Grove wanted to make chips and make money. The new guys, ironically, have much less interesting companies in a lot of ways, and much less meaningful companies, and are making much easier things that aren't really even technically challenging. But they talk a lot about changing the world and being on a mission. And it's almost like there should be a meter. And the more someone - or a company - talks about changing the world and being on a mission, the probably less important their stuff really is. I think they're disproportionately related to each other. So that's what I saw happening from the '90s onward. As the companies became sillier, the rhetoric became more grandiose. GROSS: My guest is Dan Lyons. His new memoir is called \"Disrupted: My Misadventure In The Startup Bubble. \" After a break, we'll talk about how the FBI investigated whether there was an attempt to prevent his book's publication, and we'll talk about how he became the fake Steve Jobs in a satirical blog. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross back with Dan Lyons. His new memoir, \"Disrupted: My Misadventure In The Start-up Bubble,\" is about his experiences in his less than two years working for a tech startup after having covered the tech industry for Forbes and Newsweek. He was laid off from Newsweek when he was in his early 50s. At the startup, he was considered the old guy. Lyons has also written for the HBO comedy series \"Silicon Valley,\" and wrote a popular satirical blog as fake Steve Jobs. So let me just ask you this point-blank. You say you wrote the memoir to entertain, but since some people at your company probably are wondering about this, did you also want to get even with some of the people who you feel treated you unfairly or didn't understand you? LYONS: I think I felt pretty hurt when I left - when I first left there. By the time I was writing and rewriting the book, I think I actually had less of that feeling. I kind of feel that people do the best that they can do in whatever circumstance. So for example, I had a boss who was my friend - or I thought we were friends, we were very close for a while - who then - I think it was basically given to him as a mission to get rid of me by making me unhappy. And I, at the time, thought, boy, that was a crummy thing to do. Looking back now, I think in a way, he was maybe caught in a bad spot, too, that he had to - he was given the assignment of getting rid of me. The other thing that happened is when I first sold the book and start to write it, it was meant to be sort of a modern-day \"Office Space,\" which is the other famous Mike Judge project other than \"Silicon Valley\" and \"Beavis and Butthead. \" But I wanted to write just a funny story about being in a kooky company. It was just a comedy. And then as I started writing and rewriting, I started doing the thing where you ask yourself, why is it like this? Why are there these kooky cultures and these frat houses and these sort of culty (ph) aspects? And that led me to a much bigger story, I think. And that became much more interesting to me and remains much more interesting to me than whatever kind of things happened at my particular job. GROSS: So your memoir about your life at a tech startup - your memoir, \"Disrupted\" - has had one really major unplanned-for consequence, which is that there was an FBI investigation because the company you worked for apparently tried to - correct me if I'm wrong here - get a hold of an advance copy of the book or prevent the book from being published. And the CMO was fired for violating the company's code of business conduct and ethics in his attempts to get a manuscript of the book before publication, someone else resigned from the company before the company could determine whether to terminate him for similar reasons. And then a third person, the CEO, was fined for failing to promptly alert the company's board of directors in a timely fashion after finding out about this incident. What was the FBI experience like for you? How did you first find out that this is being investigated? LYONS: It was so weird. I literally found out when the company put out a press release saying all the things that you just said about a person being fired and the CEO being sanctioned. I had no idea that any of this is was going on, and someone sent me a link to the press release - it was July 29, I think. And it didn't even say that was my book, but I kind of figured it must be my book unless someone else is also writing a book about the same place. But they didn't explain what they had done. They also said that they had turned everything over to legal authorities or appropriate legal authorities, something like that. And so shortly after that, I got a call from the FBI, and I went in and I was interviewed by them for about an hour. And they asked me a bunch of questions, but they wouldn't answer any questions of mine because I just wanted to know what happened, what was done. Did they hack my email? Did they break into my house or what - you know, did they get the book? Because the book, at that point, wasn't finished. It was just a very rough draft. And the FBI and the U. S. attorney would answer any of my questions. They said, well, we know it's frustrating for you, but we can't really tell you what we know. And that was it. And about a month after I talked to them, they called and told us that well, we're not going to pursue any criminal charges, so just so you know that's - it's all dropped now. I then filed a Freedom of Information Act request, a FOIA request, trying to get any kind of documents that would try to explain what it was. I also reached out to the company just to ask them, could you guys tell me what these people did? Could - I know some of the board members, and I thought they might just tell me oh, it's X, Y and Z and, you know, you need to get a new router or get new locks on your house or you don't need to do anything that would - you know? But they - nobody would tell me, so I filed this Freedom of Information Act request. And I found myself back - being like a reporter trying to find what happened, find out - get to the bottom of the story. And the FOIA documents came back and said that it wasn't about actually trying to get the book, or it wasn't just about that. It was also about trying to extort people and dig up dirt on some people and then manipulate or extort them to try to stop the publication of the book, which was really surprising to me. GROSS: Do you worry that you'll be seen as somebody too dangerous to be hired? People, I think, on the whole don't like the possibility that someone will write a book about the workplace when they leave and that they'll be a character in that book (laughter). That maybe something they said that was impolitic in a meeting will be mentioned, or something that wasn't meant as a slight but was taken as a slight will be mentioned and they'll look bad, or things far worse than that. So do you worry that people will be afraid to touch you now? LYONS: Yes, I do worry. I worry that - that was another concern I had when I thought about whether I should write the book, was what would that mean for my career? And again, I decided that I thought the - some of the points were important enough to make that I would take that chance. GROSS: My guest is Dan Lyons, author of the new memoir \"Disrupted: My Misadventure In The Start-up Bubble. \" We'll talk more after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Dan Lyons. His new memoir, \"Disrupted: My Misadventure In The Start-Up Bubble,\" is about his experience going to work at a tech startup after having covered the tech industry for Forbes and Newsweek. Let me ask you about the fake Steve Jobs blog that you wrote for a while. It was a satirical blog in which you wrote as if you were Steve Jobs. And you lampooned him and the whole tech industry in that, but, you know, him a lot (laughter). Why did you decide to do it? LYONS: It was 2000. . . GROSS: . . . And I should say it was a very popular blog while lasted. LYONS: It was, yeah. It had - and that was part of the reason I kept doing it, 'cause I thought, wow, for once I've done something and there's actually an audience for it. It was the first time in my life that ever happened, you know? GROSS: (Laughter). LYONS: So I was like, this is great. I didn't expect this to turn into anything - but I had written a couple books that nobody bought or read. It's like, wow. Finally, I'm writing this stupid blog that I did in my spare time, and this of all things gets an audience. Like, why would that happen? But back in 2006, there was this big push. Blogging was sort of new, and there were these people saying, oh, every CEO should have a blog now. We're all going to be radically transparent, and you won't need to have PR people. Just every CEO will just write a blog and tell the world what's going on at their company. And I remember thinking that is the craziest, stupidest thing ever, right? GROSS: (Laughter). LYONS: Like, that is - if I worked in PR, that's the last thing I would want, is my crazy CEO writing a blog and showing the world just how awful he really is when he's unfiltered, right? And the other thing is I was just trying to learn about the - there were three different big blog platforms at the time, and I was really literally just trying to learn how to use blog software because I thought, I'm print journalist. I have to learn how to blog, I have to learn how to use HTML and develop this new skill. So I wasn't really thinking about the content. I went to shut it down and then it - found out it had an audience. I didn't even know how to put a meter on it. Then I put a meter on it and found out, oh, I have, like, a thousand people reading this and they're all over the world. So it started off as that, and then it became kind of fun to write satire. And then it became this weirder thing where I didn't know what to write about, and you needed material, so I started writing about how would Steve Jobs cover news in tech? Like, there were all these stories happening in tech that I couldn't write about at Forbes because I covered enterprise computing like IBM and Sun and kind of boring, big computer company stuff. So I thought, oh, Steve Jobs could riff on that. So then he would do it, and sometimes I think I got pretty close to how he would really feel about something. And the more I learned about him, the more I learned what a fascinating character he was. And I think it just started building on itself that way until I got to the point where I thought I should stop and I just couldn't. It was just so much fun to write, and the audience was so engaged. People would send me ideas every day and they would make up little images for me to use and tell me stories or send me links to some Apple story from a remote part of the world. It became like a comedy show. It was like having your own show, but it wasn't on TV. GROSS: Did Steve Jobs ever say anything about it? LYONS: There was a famous summit where he and Bill Gates appeared on stage at a conference together, at a Re/code Conference. And Gates came out, and his opening line was before we begin, I just want to say I'm not fake Steve Jobs. I'm not the one doing that. That was the moment where I knew, like, oh my God, this blog has really made its -GROSS: (Laughter). LYONS: Bill Gates knows what this is. And the whole audience cracked up. And then Walt Mossberg, who was hosting, said to Steve Jobs, well, yeah, it's funny, but that does raise interest. Do you - are you aware of this blog? And Jobs - sort of, like, through clenched teeth - was like, yes, I am, like, forcing a smile. And then he said, what do you think of it? He said, oh, I think it's kind of funny sometimes. And he said, well, the guy's got a book coming out. Are you going to read the book? And Jobs said, no. GROSS: (Laughter). LYONS: And so I don't think he was entirely amused. I once asked Guy Kawasaki about it 'cause he knew Jobs pretty well. I said, I thought Jobs has a really good sense of humor. And he said, he does, but not when he's the one being made fun of. Like, if he's making fun of you, he has a really good sense of humor. But I also heard stories from people at Apple saying that Jobs, in an aside to someone, said, I don't know who's writing this thing, but this is kind of scary. Like, sometimes it's psycho how close they are to what I was really thinking about something. So that made me feel good. Essentially, it was - I was a big fan of his and was - I admired him a lot. And it was almost like an attempt by someone who really likes him to try to be his voice and be him a little bit and virtually. And think - I hope, anyway, that he took it that way. GROSS: So you shut down the fake Steve Jobs blog when he got sick. You started up again when he seemed to be better after the liver transplant, and then ended it when he got really sick toward the end. LYONS: Yeah. GROSS: It must have been awkward for you to know that you were satirizing him as he got sick. And then, you know, obviously you stopped out of respect. But I mean, to know - like, where's the line? Like, when do you stop? LYONS: Yeah, that was a really interesting question to ask of myself. I mean, where is that line? And I thought - when he first came out looking really gaunt and thin, I thought - and they would say, oh, no, he's just got a cold. He's got the flu. He's fine, he just had a little stomach bug. I kind of just - just, like, my spider sense when I was just like, I'm just - no, that's not that. And I just said, I'm stopping. Then when he came back, I thought, oh, good, he's back, I'm back, let's come back together. And then it became very - well, I don't know how long I ran then, but it was not too long that it became clear to me that that wasn't really going well, there wasn't a turnaround, 'cause they were trying to say, oh, everything's cool now. I'm fine. And I just stopped. I just couldn't do it anymore. And I don't know if my timing - if I got it right. I've always wondered if maybe I should have stopped even sooner or not come back or - I don't know. GROSS: So having covered the tech industry and then worked in it, do you think that age bias is a serious issue? And outside of your own personal experiences, what are some of the things that you think older people are up against either in getting hired or in keeping a job? LYONS: Well, I think that the tech industry is open about it. There's not even a secret. With racial bias and gender bias, they at least sort of pay lip service to saying well, we're going to do better and we're going to start this initiative and we've put some money over here to create this and that. But with older workers, they just say, no, we don't really want the older workers. It's fine. And they don't bother to even kind of lie. I think those forms of discrimination all go hand in hand. GROSS: Do you think that that culture's changing a little bit in the sense that some of the tech founders have aged, some of the venture capitalists have probably aged because the tech industry isn't as new now as it was, say, in the '90s? LYONS: Yes, and I think - so Mark Zuckerberg once famously said, when he was, like, 20 or 22, young people are just smarter. That was the famous quote, right? And I wonder as Mark Zuckerberg gets to be - I think he's 30 now, but when he gets to be 40 or 50, will he feel differently about that? You know, the Google guys are now probably well into their 40s. So, yeah, I think as some of these people - the young Turks become the old guard, maybe they start to realize, oh, we could have a greater diversity of workers around here. GROSS: Do you think that some of the emphasis on being young, too, is kind of drawing the line between people who are digital natives and people who aren't? You know, like, people who grew up with computers and so a lot of things are just second nature to them in a way that older people had to learn from scratch because it was introduced to them. It wasn't something they grew up with. LYONS: I think there's validity to that. But there's also this - the way it's described is almost like everybody born after 1980 has a gene that the rest of us don't have, that they were with born with this thing that somehow they can understand this. Now I do know my kids are very good at picking up new things, and they're learning how to code in Python. And I am not a coder at all, but I'm pretty sure I could learn to write code in Python pretty quickly if I had to. And I think it's not just that. It's people who have been working as coders, as programmers, as engineers who get kicked out when they turn 40 or 45. They have tech skills, they have degrees in computer science. It's not believable to me that they couldn't learn whatever the new programming language is. Also, they - they've put in those 10,000 hours that Malcolm Gladwell talks about to gain expertise in a skill. Why would you not want them? They've learned their skills on someone else's dime, and now you can hire them and get the benefit of all that experience. So yeah, there's a trade-off in that younger workers maybe are digital natives and they probably have more energy and they don't have spouses and kids, so they're less distracted. But I think there's a real value to the experience and the wisdom and the knowledge that older workers have. And I just don't think we're a genetically different species. I don't think we're a different being than people who were born in 1980 or 1990. GROSS: Dan Lyons, thank you so much for talking with us. LYONS: Well, thank you for having me. GROSS: Dan Lyons' new memoir is called \"Disrupted: My Misadventure In The Start-up Bubble. \" Coming up, Maureen Corrigan reviews a new novel that's based on the author's nightmarish experience after his wife was diagnosed with leukemia. This is FRESH AIR. TERRY GROSS, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. My guest Dan Lyons has reported on and satirized the tech industry. He reported on the industry for Newsweek and Forbes, he wrote the satirical fake Steve Jobs blog and has been a member of the writing team for the HBO comedy series \"Silicon Valley. \" He was laid off from Newsweek shortly before it discontinued its print edition. Nine months later in April 2013, when he was 52, he took a job in the world he'd long written about and became the marketing fellow at a startup called HubSpot, which sells a marketing software platform designed to help companies attract visitors and turn them into customers. At this startup, Lyons was the old guy, twice the age of many of the people he worked with. He stayed less than two years. He's written a new memoir called \"Disrupted: My Misadventure In The Start-Up Bubble. \" He describes the book as the story of what it's like to reinvent yourself and start a new career in your 50s in an industry that is by and large hostile to older workers. He also wanted to puncture some of the popular mythology about startups by providing a look inside one. He wasn't expecting the FBI to investigate whether there had been an attempt to prevent his book's publication, but that's a story for later in our interview. Dan Lyons, welcome to FRESH AIR. So describe the predicament you found yourself in as a suddenly out of work 52-year-old journalist. DAN LYONS: Well, it's a tough market right now in journalism and the media business. And I, on the one hand, found myself - well, I just was working at Newsweek, so it should be easy for me to get a job. But then you look around and realize, God, there really aren't that many jobs left in journalism and there are fewer and fewer every year. And it was kind of like wasn't just that I had lost my job, it's that my industry was kind of going away, and there were not many jobs. There are some but they're fewer and fewer. So that was the real panic was that not just that I had lost my job but that my entire industry was kind of vanishing. GROSS: A couple of years before you were laid off from Newsweek - and this was not long before they just basically went under - Newsweek had a cover story back in 2011 headlined \"The Beached White Male. \" And describe what was on the cover and. . . (LAUGHTER) LYONS: It was a hilarious cover. It was very controversial. It was a picture of a guy in a business suit face down on a beach, you know, and the wave has just washed him - he's just been washed ashore. And it was a story about how the downturn in 2008 and 9 had disproportionately hit white males in, say, their 40s and 50s - white men of a certain age who had attained sort of high-level jobs got washed out and then found themselves unable to find anything else. And there's this whole generation of guys about my age who found themselves in this terrible predicament sort of shuffling around their houses in bathrooms. They were like zombies. And I read it at the time and I was gainfully employed at Newsweek thinking, well, that's interesting, but it's not going to be me. And then, yeah, two years later, I got the ax and I thought, oh, my God, I've become a beached white male, you know? I'm that guy. GROSS: And, you know, journalism wasn't likely to have a lot of opportunities for you 'cause so many journalistic organizations have been downsizing. People have been taking buyouts, you know, the staffs are shrinking. So you turned to the tech industry. Why did you decide to make that kind of turn? LYONS: Well, I had been covering tech for my whole career. I was a technology reporter. And I think everybody who covers tech at some point or another feels like a little kid with their face pressed against the glass looking in at the candy shop and going, wow, it looks so cool and so much fun. And you see all these people that you cover and you get to know them because you have relationships with them and they're all becoming wildly rich and just having the time of their lives. And so I think most of us who cover tech at some point dabble with the idea of what it would be like to go work at one of these companies. And a lot of people do actually cross over. It's not unheard of. It's the akin to being, like, a sportswriter covering pro baseball but you know, in that case, you can never - you're never going to play for the Yankees. You just can't do it. But in tech, you could do it. You know, there are people who do things in tech that have the same skill sets that journalists have. They write, they edit, they put out press releases. So I've had a lot of friends over the years who have crossed over. One was a woman back in the '80s. She and I went to Microsoft together on a story - came back, wrote a big package of stories for this computer trade magazine we worked for. And then she turned right around and flew right back out and got a job at Microsoft in, say, 1988 and by the late '90s was retired. And so you hear - you know, you know people like that who have done this and you think, why am I not doing this? Why am I not getting in on this? GROSS: So in addition to the thought of maybe I'll get rich, what were some of the things that you thought would be cool about working in the tech industry? When you had your nose pressed against the glass, what were some of the things you saw that you thought, I'd like to do that? LYONS: Well, there's a lot of energy. There's a lot of people having fun. The companies are growing. I remember thinking when I first took this job that this is the first job I've had in about 10 years where I'm working at a company that's actually getting bigger every year rather than getting smaller every year. And, you know, there's a kind of depression that sets in institutionally at big magazines and media companies where it's - you're just kind of waiting for next year and the next round of layoffs and downsizing and you're going to lose some friends who take a package. It was just great to be at a place that's booming, that's growing, that's adding people. And also, there's a sense in the media business - and I share this sentiment - that technology is really reshaping the media business. And I kind of thought, I want to get in on that. I want to get in on how the media business is changing, how people are telling stories in new ways. And the tech guys, in many ways, are doing a better job of that. Microsoft has a thing called Microsoft Stories now that is really a phenomenal publication, and it just happens to be funded by Microsoft. So there's that too. You realize that if you're in the media business, technology is fundamentally what's driving the change in that business. And so I thought it would be a way to learn that. GROSS: OK, so you - and you really needed a job because your wife had left her job because of chronic migraines, you had two twins that were about to turn 7, you needed health insurance, you needed a job. And so you got a job at a marketing tech company in Boston near where you lived. And you were going to be the marketing fellow. So describe, like, what the company did and what your job within that company was going to be. LYONS: It's a software company. They make software that's delivered over the cloud. So you don't actually buy the software in a package and install it on your computer. You just get a subscription and you use the computer on the cloud - on Internet service. So it's Internet-delivered software. And it's aimed at marketing people, so it helps you find customers. You can send email, you can write blog post, you can track who's visiting your website and then contact those people. So it's essentially software that helps companies find customers by sending email or writing blog posts. It's software for marketing people. And my job was going to be to help sort of build brand awareness by writing articles that would make people in the industry - or potential customers - aware of this company and their offerings not really by touting their products but just by writing articles that people would find interesting and then they would see that that article had been brought to them or sponsored by this company and somehow build a link in their minds that they should start thinking about buying this software. GROSS: Is that what you ended up doing? LYONS: Not really. I ended up being put in a room they called the content factory and just told to sort of crank out blog posts that would generate leads. And so yes and no in terms of whether it's what I ended up doing. I think what I ended up doing was very low-level blog posts that were - for example, I might write a blog post that says, what is HTML? And it just explains a primer of what HTML is. And then you hope that Google will surface that article. When someone does a search, what is HTML? They'll find that article. They'll click through to it and then at the end of it, they might click another button that says click here to learn more about our software. So it was very low-level kind of how-to information. It wasn't very fun to write. GROSS: So you were in your early 50s. You join this, you know, startup. Can I call it a startup? LYONS: Yeah. GROSS: And the staff is - what? - mostly in their 20s and 30s? LYONS: Average age was 26, a lot of people right out of college, a smaller number of people in their 30s. And then the people in their '30s were really the grown-ups. Very few in their 40s. I think I was the only one in their 50s, and there was one guy who was older than me. He was in his 60s. But, yeah, very, very much a culture of people all in their '20s. GROSS: And that was uncomfortable for you. So what made you most uncomfortable about that? LYONS: Well, it wasn't uncomfortable at first. At first, I actually really liked it 'cause I thought it reminded me of a place where I worked right out of college at a computer trade magazine where I was right out of college and everybody else was.  And we had a blast. And we were - our magazine was growing and booming and it was very exciting and we had a lot of new ideas and we had a lot of fun. And at first, I really liked it. I didn't realize the company skewed so young. I thought there would be a greater diversity of people. It's just hard to fit in sometimes when you have, you know - if you're married, you have kids and you want to go home and you don't want to build your life around a company. You don't want to go to parties, you don't want to go kayaking or do team-building exercises. But I don't think the age thing was so much of an issue. I sort of really learned a lot and enjoyed working with young people. I just think it would have been more fun to have a few people my age around. GROSS: So can you remember back when you were working for that magazine -or the publication - and everybody was really young, including you when you were right out of college, what did you think then of people who were 52 (laughter)? LYONS: Oh, I thought they were ancient, you know? That's the thing. I remember exactly being that age. And I remember thinking, go, just leave, you know? And then I (laughter) - then I'd become that guy, right? I've become the grumpy old man kind of thing, yeah. GROSS: Did you feel like you were seen as the grumpy old man or that you were becoming the grumpy old man? LYONS: Yeah, I think - it was funny, people - like, when I first started, people would, you know, when you come to a doorway and you're going out and someone else is going in, they were very nice kids. And a lot of them would hold the door and call me sir. They'd be like, oh, Sir, please, you go first. GROSS: (Laughter). LYONS: It was kind of like - and I was like (laughter) you know what I mean? Like, oh, - they almost looked like they saw a ghost, you know, like, oh, my parents are here, you know? And so that was awkward. But, no, I didn't feel like a grumpy old man. There were little sort of comments a lot all the time about - I think just - I never felt old before this. GROSS: So one of the things that seemed to bother you was, like, language differences like, you know, expressions that were used, too many exclamation points (laughter). . . LYONS: Yeah (laughter). GROSS: . . . In emails. Talk a little bit about what you saw as the language differences between what you were used to as a journalist and as someone who was 52 and a lot of the writing and emails and texts that you were getting. LYONS: Yeah, and I think that's not so much a generational thing as it is sort of a cultural thing. I think journalists tend to be very skeptical and cynical and we kind of have a dark sense of humor. And we also don't like jargon. We sort of see jargon and it makes our skin crawl. And we see it as our mission in life to sort of undo jargon and put it back into English. And in a world of marketing, it's kind of the opposite. You're the ones making the jargon and embracing it and promoting it. GROSS: So what's an example of the kind of jargon that really irritated you? LYONS: Well, there's two. One is a word called delightion (ph), which was like a made up word which they would use a lot very seriously without any irony. Like, we engage in delightion (ph), which really meant delighting your customers, making them happy, doing anything you can to make the customers love your product and have a great experience. They would talk about delightion (ph). And, yeah, that kind of makes your skin crawl, I think, when you are someone who works with words. There's another one they came up with which was this expression, one plus one equals three. That, you know, our software is so magical that one plus one equals three. And then they would use that as kind of an adjective. Like, you'd say, well, how about if we try this? And they'd be like, I like that idea, but it's not one-plus-one-equals-three enough. And I was like, what does that even mean? It doesn't really mean anything. And - but it was just, yeah - there were lots of terms that were just - there was like its own language. The company had kind of its own language and its own words for everything. And a lot of it was about obfuscation and euphemizing things that were sometimes unsavory. GROSS: So when you became a part of what's called, like, corporate journalism, did you fear that you were part of the problem now blurring the line between journalism and marketing or between journalism and advertising? LYONS: Absolutely, it was really, really uncomfortable. And I had - yeah - I had - I didn't feel good about it. And I rationalized and said, well, this'll be OK and it's - I'm still going to be doing something legitimate or worthwhile. But it - that was a rationalization. There are some examples of corporate journalism that I think are good and respectable and people are doing a good job. And some of them are run by friends of mine, and I like what they're doing. But in the particular situation that I found myself in, no. There was nothing really legitimate about it. It was just a sellout, and that didn't make me happy. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Dan Lyons. He's written a new memoir called \"Disrupted: My Misadventure In The Start-Up Bubble. \" And it's about how after he was laid off from Newsweek, he joined a tech startup, and it didn't work out how he hoped. (LAUGHTER) GROSS: And he's written for the past two seasons of \"Silicon Valley. \" That's season two and season three. Season three's the one that's about to actually start on HBO. So we're going to take a short break, then we'll be back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, my guest is Dan Lyons, who covered the tech industry for Forbes and then for Newsweek. When he was laid off from Newsweek at the age of 52, he decided to cross over and work for a tech startup, where he was in the marketing department doing what's often described as corporate journalism. Things did not work out as he planned. His memoir is called \"Disrupted: My Misadventures In The Startup Bubble. \" He's also been a writer for \"Silicon Valley,\" the HBO series, for season two and for season three, the season that's about to start later this month. You describe the company that you work for as a cross between a frat house and a cult compound. LYONS: Yeah, the frat house culture was - they had every year on Cinco de Mayo had this big party and brought in all this tequila and Mexican food. And the CEO would run around wearing this giant sombrero and kind of getting loaded. And everybody would just party it up. And there were refrigerators stocked with beer all the time. And people would be at their desk like - people can - a lot of the sales guys would just come to work in shorts and flip-flops and T-shirts and backward baseball hats. And they'd be drinking beer. I mean, there were literally frat guys who had just left college and, like, just continued for them. And this was like a corporate frat house for them. They could go grab a beer, start hitting the phones, calling people. They'd party, you know, at night and stuff in the kitchen. And there'd be a lot of just life that was very much like a frat house. And people literally had just come from frats and sororities. And the cult compound stuff would be - I think the best example that I remember is in training. Ostensibly, you're in training to learn how to use the product. And you do get training on that. But you also get this big dose of how great the company is, how lucky you are to be here, how hard it is to get a job here. It's harder to get a job here than is to get into Harvard. And - but boy, now that you're in, that's just the first step.  Now you have to cut it, and most of you aren't going to make it because this place is only the best and the brightest. And then you start learning the language. You start learning all the various kind of language shifts that they use. In a way, that's very much like what cults do. Cults sort of change - they invent their own ways of describing things. If you look at Scientology - it's weird, I was reading Lawrence Wright's book \"Going Clear\" when I was working here. And it was scary to me to see some of the parallels. And I don't think it's necessarily somebody sits down and plans it out like, let's do what the Scientologists do, but I think they use some of the same techniques. Like, this company isn't just about selling software. This is about changing people's lives. This is about making people better at achieving your goals and conquering fear and, you know, personal empowerment and being the best you can be. So there's a lot of talk about that - sort of the rhetoric about personal growth and how amazing it is. But to get there, you have to buy in and you have to stay on the ladder and keep going up. And so that gets baked in very quickly, right, in training - we're the best and you just buy in. And if you do that, things go really, really well for you. GROSS: And that works for a lot of people. I mean, that's a good thing for a lot of people, right? LYONS: It does, yeah. And there are even people who are kind of aware of the cultiness (ph) of it, but they still like it. I had a friend there whose sister - I got to know her pretty well and then I got to know her sister. And her sister was a little bit cynical and would always refer to it as the cult, and so would my friend. She'd be like, yeah, yeah, I've got to go in to the cult tomorrow. But she kind of liked it even though it was - she knew - she was self-aware enough to know what it was like. But she also knew that she liked it, and she fit in, and she had friends there, and she enjoyed it. So yeah, it works for a lot of people. GROSS: So one of the things on HBO's comedy series, you know, \"Silicon Valley,\" which is set at a startup - it's about startups, and it's about startups seeking venture-capital and going for their IPO. One of the things that's satirized in that series, which you've written for for two seasons, is how this collision of the utopian idealism that everybody preaches in the startups and the cutthroat competition that's actually happening between them - that kind of ruthless competition behind the scenes. LYONS: Right, yeah, yeah. GROSS: And I'm wondering if you've observed that both as a reporter and as somebody who worked in the tech industry? LYONS: Absolutely. And the funny thing to me is that I think - when I first started covering technology, I was covering places like Intel and Microsoft and Google. But let's say the early, early days - the personal computer guys. They never really talked about having this big mission to change the world or make the world a better place or describing themselves like, you know, Mother Teresa or Nelson Mandela. They didn't see themselves that way. They were pretty much - you know, the Microsoft guys especially were just - we're going to build a company, we're going to sell a lot of stuff, we're going to make a lot of money. But ironically, they actually did make things that kind of did change the world. I mean, the microprocessor that Intel invented - that whole family of microprocessors - really did change the world. But I don't think Andy Grove ever talked in that kind of sappy, syrupy way about how he wanted to change the world. Andy Grove wanted to make chips and make money. The new guys, ironically, have much less interesting companies in a lot of ways, and much less meaningful companies, and are making much easier things that aren't really even technically challenging. But they talk a lot about changing the world and being on a mission. And it's almost like there should be a meter. And the more someone - or a company - talks about changing the world and being on a mission, the probably less important their stuff really is. I think they're disproportionately related to each other. So that's what I saw happening from the '90s onward. As the companies became sillier, the rhetoric became more grandiose. GROSS: My guest is Dan Lyons. His new memoir is called \"Disrupted: My Misadventure In The Startup Bubble. \" After a break, we'll talk about how the FBI investigated whether there was an attempt to prevent his book's publication, and we'll talk about how he became the fake Steve Jobs in a satirical blog. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross back with Dan Lyons. His new memoir, \"Disrupted: My Misadventure In The Start-up Bubble,\" is about his experiences in his less than two years working for a tech startup after having covered the tech industry for Forbes and Newsweek. He was laid off from Newsweek when he was in his early 50s. At the startup, he was considered the old guy. Lyons has also written for the HBO comedy series \"Silicon Valley,\" and wrote a popular satirical blog as fake Steve Jobs. So let me just ask you this point-blank. You say you wrote the memoir to entertain, but since some people at your company probably are wondering about this, did you also want to get even with some of the people who you feel treated you unfairly or didn't understand you? LYONS: I think I felt pretty hurt when I left - when I first left there. By the time I was writing and rewriting the book, I think I actually had less of that feeling. I kind of feel that people do the best that they can do in whatever circumstance. So for example, I had a boss who was my friend - or I thought we were friends, we were very close for a while - who then - I think it was basically given to him as a mission to get rid of me by making me unhappy. And I, at the time, thought, boy, that was a crummy thing to do. Looking back now, I think in a way, he was maybe caught in a bad spot, too, that he had to - he was given the assignment of getting rid of me. The other thing that happened is when I first sold the book and start to write it, it was meant to be sort of a modern-day \"Office Space,\" which is the other famous Mike Judge project other than \"Silicon Valley\" and \"Beavis and Butthead. \" But I wanted to write just a funny story about being in a kooky company. It was just a comedy. And then as I started writing and rewriting, I started doing the thing where you ask yourself, why is it like this? Why are there these kooky cultures and these frat houses and these sort of culty (ph) aspects? And that led me to a much bigger story, I think. And that became much more interesting to me and remains much more interesting to me than whatever kind of things happened at my particular job. GROSS: So your memoir about your life at a tech startup - your memoir, \"Disrupted\" - has had one really major unplanned-for consequence, which is that there was an FBI investigation because the company you worked for apparently tried to - correct me if I'm wrong here - get a hold of an advance copy of the book or prevent the book from being published. And the CMO was fired for violating the company's code of business conduct and ethics in his attempts to get a manuscript of the book before publication, someone else resigned from the company before the company could determine whether to terminate him for similar reasons. And then a third person, the CEO, was fined for failing to promptly alert the company's board of directors in a timely fashion after finding out about this incident. What was the FBI experience like for you? How did you first find out that this is being investigated? LYONS: It was so weird. I literally found out when the company put out a press release saying all the things that you just said about a person being fired and the CEO being sanctioned. I had no idea that any of this is was going on, and someone sent me a link to the press release - it was July 29, I think. And it didn't even say that was my book, but I kind of figured it must be my book unless someone else is also writing a book about the same place. But they didn't explain what they had done. They also said that they had turned everything over to legal authorities or appropriate legal authorities, something like that. And so shortly after that, I got a call from the FBI, and I went in and I was interviewed by them for about an hour. And they asked me a bunch of questions, but they wouldn't answer any questions of mine because I just wanted to know what happened, what was done. Did they hack my email? Did they break into my house or what - you know, did they get the book? Because the book, at that point, wasn't finished. It was just a very rough draft. And the FBI and the U. S. attorney would answer any of my questions. They said, well, we know it's frustrating for you, but we can't really tell you what we know. And that was it. And about a month after I talked to them, they called and told us that well, we're not going to pursue any criminal charges, so just so you know that's - it's all dropped now. I then filed a Freedom of Information Act request, a FOIA request, trying to get any kind of documents that would try to explain what it was. I also reached out to the company just to ask them, could you guys tell me what these people did? Could - I know some of the board members, and I thought they might just tell me oh, it's X, Y and Z and, you know, you need to get a new router or get new locks on your house or you don't need to do anything that would - you know? But they - nobody would tell me, so I filed this Freedom of Information Act request. And I found myself back - being like a reporter trying to find what happened, find out - get to the bottom of the story. And the FOIA documents came back and said that it wasn't about actually trying to get the book, or it wasn't just about that. It was also about trying to extort people and dig up dirt on some people and then manipulate or extort them to try to stop the publication of the book, which was really surprising to me. GROSS: Do you worry that you'll be seen as somebody too dangerous to be hired? People, I think, on the whole don't like the possibility that someone will write a book about the workplace when they leave and that they'll be a character in that book (laughter). That maybe something they said that was impolitic in a meeting will be mentioned, or something that wasn't meant as a slight but was taken as a slight will be mentioned and they'll look bad, or things far worse than that. So do you worry that people will be afraid to touch you now? LYONS: Yes, I do worry. I worry that - that was another concern I had when I thought about whether I should write the book, was what would that mean for my career? And again, I decided that I thought the - some of the points were important enough to make that I would take that chance. GROSS: My guest is Dan Lyons, author of the new memoir \"Disrupted: My Misadventure In The Start-up Bubble. \" We'll talk more after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Dan Lyons. His new memoir, \"Disrupted: My Misadventure In The Start-Up Bubble,\" is about his experience going to work at a tech startup after having covered the tech industry for Forbes and Newsweek. Let me ask you about the fake Steve Jobs blog that you wrote for a while. It was a satirical blog in which you wrote as if you were Steve Jobs. And you lampooned him and the whole tech industry in that, but, you know, him a lot (laughter). Why did you decide to do it? LYONS: It was 2000. . . GROSS: . . . And I should say it was a very popular blog while lasted. LYONS: It was, yeah. It had - and that was part of the reason I kept doing it, 'cause I thought, wow, for once I've done something and there's actually an audience for it. It was the first time in my life that ever happened, you know? GROSS: (Laughter). LYONS: So I was like, this is great. I didn't expect this to turn into anything - but I had written a couple books that nobody bought or read. It's like, wow. Finally, I'm writing this stupid blog that I did in my spare time, and this of all things gets an audience. Like, why would that happen? But back in 2006, there was this big push. Blogging was sort of new, and there were these people saying, oh, every CEO should have a blog now. We're all going to be radically transparent, and you won't need to have PR people. Just every CEO will just write a blog and tell the world what's going on at their company. And I remember thinking that is the craziest, stupidest thing ever, right? GROSS: (Laughter). LYONS: Like, that is - if I worked in PR, that's the last thing I would want, is my crazy CEO writing a blog and showing the world just how awful he really is when he's unfiltered, right? And the other thing is I was just trying to learn about the - there were three different big blog platforms at the time, and I was really literally just trying to learn how to use blog software because I thought, I'm print journalist. I have to learn how to blog, I have to learn how to use HTML and develop this new skill. So I wasn't really thinking about the content. I went to shut it down and then it - found out it had an audience. I didn't even know how to put a meter on it. Then I put a meter on it and found out, oh, I have, like, a thousand people reading this and they're all over the world. So it started off as that, and then it became kind of fun to write satire. And then it became this weirder thing where I didn't know what to write about, and you needed material, so I started writing about how would Steve Jobs cover news in tech? Like, there were all these stories happening in tech that I couldn't write about at Forbes because I covered enterprise computing like IBM and Sun and kind of boring, big computer company stuff. So I thought, oh, Steve Jobs could riff on that. So then he would do it, and sometimes I think I got pretty close to how he would really feel about something. And the more I learned about him, the more I learned what a fascinating character he was. And I think it just started building on itself that way until I got to the point where I thought I should stop and I just couldn't. It was just so much fun to write, and the audience was so engaged. People would send me ideas every day and they would make up little images for me to use and tell me stories or send me links to some Apple story from a remote part of the world. It became like a comedy show. It was like having your own show, but it wasn't on TV. GROSS: Did Steve Jobs ever say anything about it? LYONS: There was a famous summit where he and Bill Gates appeared on stage at a conference together, at a Re/code Conference. And Gates came out, and his opening line was before we begin, I just want to say I'm not fake Steve Jobs. I'm not the one doing that. That was the moment where I knew, like, oh my God, this blog has really made its - GROSS: (Laughter). LYONS: Bill Gates knows what this is. And the whole audience cracked up. And then Walt Mossberg, who was hosting, said to Steve Jobs, well, yeah, it's funny, but that does raise interest. Do you - are you aware of this blog? And Jobs - sort of, like, through clenched teeth - was like, yes, I am, like, forcing a smile. And then he said, what do you think of it? He said, oh, I think it's kind of funny sometimes. And he said, well, the guy's got a book coming out. Are you going to read the book? And Jobs said, no. GROSS: (Laughter). LYONS: And so I don't think he was entirely amused. I once asked Guy Kawasaki about it 'cause he knew Jobs pretty well. I said, I thought Jobs has a really good sense of humor. And he said, he does, but not when he's the one being made fun of. Like, if he's making fun of you, he has a really good sense of humor. But I also heard stories from people at Apple saying that Jobs, in an aside to someone, said, I don't know who's writing this thing, but this is kind of scary. Like, sometimes it's psycho how close they are to what I was really thinking about something. So that made me feel good. Essentially, it was - I was a big fan of his and was - I admired him a lot. And it was almost like an attempt by someone who really likes him to try to be his voice and be him a little bit and virtually. And think - I hope, anyway, that he took it that way. GROSS: So you shut down the fake Steve Jobs blog when he got sick. You started up again when he seemed to be better after the liver transplant, and then ended it when he got really sick toward the end. LYONS: Yeah. GROSS: It must have been awkward for you to know that you were satirizing him as he got sick. And then, you know, obviously you stopped out of respect. But I mean, to know - like, where's the line? Like, when do you stop? LYONS: Yeah, that was a really interesting question to ask of myself. I mean, where is that line? And I thought - when he first came out looking really gaunt and thin, I thought - and they would say, oh, no, he's just got a cold. He's got the flu. He's fine, he just had a little stomach bug. I kind of just - just, like, my spider sense when I was just like, I'm just - no, that's not that. And I just said, I'm stopping. Then when he came back, I thought, oh, good, he's back, I'm back, let's come back together. And then it became very - well, I don't know how long I ran then, but it was not too long that it became clear to me that that wasn't really going well, there wasn't a turnaround, 'cause they were trying to say, oh, everything's cool now. I'm fine. And I just stopped. I just couldn't do it anymore. And I don't know if my timing - if I got it right. I've always wondered if maybe I should have stopped even sooner or not come back or - I don't know. GROSS: So having covered the tech industry and then worked in it, do you think that age bias is a serious issue? And outside of your own personal experiences, what are some of the things that you think older people are up against either in getting hired or in keeping a job? LYONS: Well, I think that the tech industry is open about it. There's not even a secret. With racial bias and gender bias, they at least sort of pay lip service to saying well, we're going to do better and we're going to start this initiative and we've put some money over here to create this and that. But with older workers, they just say, no, we don't really want the older workers. It's fine. And they don't bother to even kind of lie. I think those forms of discrimination all go hand in hand. GROSS: Do you think that that culture's changing a little bit in the sense that some of the tech founders have aged, some of the venture capitalists have probably aged because the tech industry isn't as new now as it was, say, in the '90s? LYONS: Yes, and I think - so Mark Zuckerberg once famously said, when he was, like, 20 or 22, young people are just smarter. That was the famous quote, right? And I wonder as Mark Zuckerberg gets to be - I think he's 30 now, but when he gets to be 40 or 50, will he feel differently about that? You know, the Google guys are now probably well into their 40s. So, yeah, I think as some of these people - the young Turks become the old guard, maybe they start to realize, oh, we could have a greater diversity of workers around here. GROSS: Do you think that some of the emphasis on being young, too, is kind of drawing the line between people who are digital natives and people who aren't? You know, like, people who grew up with computers and so a lot of things are just second nature to them in a way that older people had to learn from scratch because it was introduced to them. It wasn't something they grew up with. LYONS: I think there's validity to that. But there's also this - the way it's described is almost like everybody born after 1980 has a gene that the rest of us don't have, that they were with born with this thing that somehow they can understand this. Now I do know my kids are very good at picking up new things, and they're learning how to code in Python. And I am not a coder at all, but I'm pretty sure I could learn to write code in Python pretty quickly if I had to. And I think it's not just that. It's people who have been working as coders, as programmers, as engineers who get kicked out when they turn 40 or 45. They have tech skills, they have degrees in computer science. It's not believable to me that they couldn't learn whatever the new programming language is. Also, they - they've put in those 10,000 hours that Malcolm Gladwell talks about to gain expertise in a skill. Why would you not want them? They've learned their skills on someone else's dime, and now you can hire them and get the benefit of all that experience. So yeah, there's a trade-off in that younger workers maybe are digital natives and they probably have more energy and they don't have spouses and kids, so they're less distracted. But I think there's a real value to the experience and the wisdom and the knowledge that older workers have. And I just don't think we're a genetically different species. I don't think we're a different being than people who were born in 1980 or 1990. GROSS: Dan Lyons, thank you so much for talking with us. LYONS: Well, thank you for having me.

This time it's not an iPhone, but an app. WhatsApp is a popular platform to share messages, pictures and videos. Now it's turned on full-data encryption. NPR's Aarti Shahani reports. AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: WhatsApp has a billion users - that is about 1 in 7 people on planet Earth. And if you have the latest version of WhatsApp, you get full end-to-end encryption by default. That means only the sender and intended recipient can read messages - nobody else. MOXIE MARLINSPIKE: WhatsApp can't read them. Nobody that hacks WhatsApp can read them. No governments that come to WhatsApp can read them. SHAHANI: Moxie Marlinspike is founder of Open Whisper Systems. MARLINSPIKE: No attackers who are watching the network can read them. SHAHANI: Marlinspike designed the encryption technology that WhatsApp is now using. He says people don't realize their messages can be read by outsiders, and this change is getting the product aligned with consumer expectation. MARLINSPIKE: You know, when celebrities take naked pictures of themselves and, you know, they have them on their phone, their expectation is that other people aren't going to be able to access those images. And, you know, people are, I think, justifiably angry when that turns out not to be the case. SHAHANI: Marlinspike says this move does make WhatsApp a warrant-proof space. The company can't hand over data for a criminal investigation, even if a U. S. court tells them to. It also challenges other messaging platforms to follow suit. Facebook, the parent company of WhatsApp, runs Facebook messenger. Google has Google Hangouts. Neither uses end-to-end encryption, so the data stored in private chats is open to police and hackers.

And end-to-end encryption is really the only thing that is going to prevent that from happening in the future. SHAHANI: The Justice Department declined to comment.

The competition rewards students for designing stuff that can benefit older adults. NPR's Ina Jaffe was there. She watched the finalists present their projects. Ina, of course, covers aging. And she joins us occasionally for a conversation that we call 1 in 5 for the one-fifth of the population that will be 65 years old or more by 2030. Ina's in our studios at NPR West. Ina, thanks for being with us. INA JAFFE, BYLINE: Hi, good to be with you, Scott. SIMON: What was there? I'm going to imagine Stanford University, it must have been cutting-edge, high-tech gadgets. JAFFE: Well, you know, Scott, if you're hoping for a little robot that follows you around the house and always knows where you left your glasses - no. That's not what was going on there. In fact, what was really interesting was how low-tech some of these ideas were. For instance, there was a category for entries that help people with mobility problems. And the winner was something called City Cart. It's a cool-looking thing on fat rubber tires that functions as a shopping cart and as a walker without really looking like one. It folds up for storage, it has brakes for dealing with hills. It even has a cup holder. And the designers, Eric Renard and Brandon Lopez from San Francisco State, got a $10,000 prize. SIMON: Ina, any idea what inspired them? JAFFE: Yeah, they were inspired by Dr. June Fisher. She's 82 years old and has severe arthritis and it forces her to walk using two hiking sticks, one in each hand. And that means she can't go to the farmers market, for example, something she really loves to do. But she can't bring anything back. So Dr. Fisher happens to work with the students in this industrial design class at San Francisco State. And they were inspired to create something that would help her take home those heirloom tomatoes she's so crazy about. At the finals this week, she talked to me about being City Cart's beta tester. JUNE FISHER: I can go into small stores. I can go into boutiques. I can go into my bookstore and buy 10 books. One of my mantras for many years is that the user needs to be involved. Don't design for us. Design with us. And this is an example of it. I want that cart. It will liberate me (laughter). SIMON: What were some of the other big winners? JAFFE: Well, there were two categories. One was mobility, which I talked about, and the other was mind. And in the mind category, something called Memoir Monopoly won first place. It's a game designed for people with Alzheimer's or other dementias. And it's a little hard to describe, but it's sort of a computerized board game except instead of Park Place or Baltic Avenue, you land on a spot where family members have loaded in an old photograph, for instance, that you can talk about or you land on another spot on the board that plays favorite music and so forth. It's completely customizable, and it's intended to stimulate memory and social interaction between a person with dementia and his or her family. The lead designer was Cho Szu-Yang from Taiwan. SIMON: I wonder, though, you go to a high-tech show these days and you see a lot of cool things that never really make it into general use. Is there any reason to think that a lot of these designs are going to be something people can purchase one day? JAFFE: Well, I don't know if a lot of them will. That always depends on raising money and if someone thinks they can make money off of marketing them. But it has happened. The winner the first year that they had the contest did raise some money. She's now selling tableware called EatWell. It helps people with dementia feed themselves. The utensils have curved handles. You can just grip them with your fist. EatWell was designed by Sha Yao and inspired by her grandmother who had Alzheimer's. SIMON: Ina Jaffe covers aging for NPR. Thanks so much. JAFFE: You're welcome, Scott.

But these days, digital enhancement is done in places you might not expect - faces and bodies themselves. How else do you think Pee-wee Herman remains ageless in that playhouse? Reporter Logan Hill dug into the bizarre world of digital manipulation for New York magazine, and he told us just how deep it goes. LOGAN HILL: You know, I'd known about certain things, like the idea that could remove wrinkles from someone's eyes. I didn't know that you could actually replace their eyes with somebody else's eyes, delete their blinks, change their expression, animate their mouth so they're speaking different words when you want to rewrite the script after the fact. Now you can make someone slimmer, stronger, give them bigger muscles, stitch their chest onto somebody else's legs, replace a body part, cover up a pregnant belly - it just goes on. And literally the options are nearly endless. MARTIN: Wow. One example of this that stood to me is the idea of reverse Botox, right? Like, there are now so many actors and actresses who just get plastic surgery or Botox in their life and it actually makes their faces more static and not as dynamic as studios want them to be. And so they use CGI to actually make them look more normal. HILL: Exactly, and it's ironic because some of the biggest companies that do this digital retouching work actually learned their techniques by hiring plastic surgeons, bringing them into their offices and working with their visual effects artists to learn how to do digital face-lifts and dermabrasions, the same kind of techniques that plastic surgeons use. MARTIN: So why do we need these people anymore, actors, if we can make them however we want them to look on the screen? And you're telling me that CGI can actually change their acting ability, right? Like, if someone didn't emote properly in a scene, you're telling me CGI can get them to be, you know, a little sadder in one moment or display some more nuanced expression of angst. HILL: Well, one thing I'd say is actors have always, you know, done all kinds of different takes that are edited together in the final film. And so, you know, performances have always been stitched together. There's just a level of control that never existed before. Right now I'd say one reason that actors are still going to be in business is they're still cheaper than CGI. It's really hard to be human, and I think they're better at being human than computer programs for now. But the creepiness kind of comes in when I watch an online tutorial of a VFX artist changing an actress' smile and saying, well, see, now I've edited her smile and replaced her mouth with another mouth, and now it looks more genuine, doesn't it? MARTIN: Weird. HILL: And I look at that final product and I say, actually it does. MARTIN: Oh. HILL: That was one of the most unsettling moments of reporting this whole story. MARTIN: You're like, yes, I'm in. I support this manipulation of this woman's emotion. So this must mean that acting contracts are way more complicated than they used to be, right? Like, if you're talking about ways that actors have to protect their image, I mean, CGI just opens up a whole other Pandora's box. HILL: Yeah, I talked to a couple of attorneys and they're really struggling with this. Now when you've got a digital double of somebody and these digital doubles, three years ago they looked rubbery and waxy in \"Spider-Man\" and things like that. Now you can get up real close to them and they look very, very realistic in dialogue. Those digital doubles that you often have seen and not even known you were looking at can then be used in other films. And so now the question is once that software's there, once your body, once your movements, once your intonations are in the machine, who controls how those are used? I had one actress say, you know, I'll be disturbed if 20 years from now I end up in pornography not even knowing it. Like, who knows what's going to happen with my bits?

In New Jersey, a college student decided that he was tired of his crooked teeth. So he fixed them all by himself using a 3-D printer and some other digital fabrication tools. Jon Kalish reports. JON KALISH, BYLINE: Twenty-four-year-old Amos Dudley is about to graduate with a degree in digital design. He's a self-described hard-core geek with a passion for 3-D printing. So it was this technology he turned to when he decided he wanted to straighten his teeth. That's the sound of a 3-D printer at the New Jersey Institute of Technology where Dudley is a student. Dudley had the idea to make a series of dental devices known as aligners using one of the 3-D printers at the college. After consulting a couple of orthodontics texts, he got started. First, he took some old school impressions of his teeth with a putty-like material he bought online. AMOS DUDLEY: I pretty much read the instructions on the back of the bag. KALISH: Then he got seriously high-tech. Dudley used a laser scanner to turn the plaster model he'd made into a digital replica. He used 3-D modeling software and mathematical calculations to figure out how to move his problematic teeth into place. Finally, he made a dozen aligners by melting thin sheets of plastic over the 3-D models of his teeth. DUDLEY: I basically would wear them between one and three weeks each. I sort of knew to stop wearing a retainer when they no longer felt like they were exerting pressure on my teeth. KALISH: How do orthodontists feel about this? RICHARD BLOOMSTEIN: I was both shocked and impressed. KALISH: Richard Bloomstein is a professor of orthodontics at Rutgers Dental School. BLOOMSTEIN: Did it work as well as an orthodontist might have done it? Maybe. KALISH: But Dr. Bloomstein says the outcome of this amateur orthodontics may have been different if there was decay or bone disease near the teeth Dudley was manipulating. BLOOMSTEIN: Certain things are not a bargain even if they're cheaper. I would not look for bargains in parachutes, likewise bargains in health care. KALISH: But traditional orthodontic care is expensive, often thousands of dollars, a reason online services that don't require office visits seem to be gaining popularity. A quick Internet search turned up two companies that offer budget dental aligners. Patients need only to send in impressions and smartphone photos of their teeth. Dudley didn't realize he tapped into a market, but he's pretty happy with the way things have turned out. DUDLEY: I had no idea if this was going to work. It probably only worked in a large part because of luck and good initial conditions. But if there's an idea you have, you just have to try it out. I mean, I had the idea, and I went with it so the outcome was sort of the best I could hope for, I guess. KALISH: Dudley says he's received hundreds of requests to make dental aligners and one suggestion from an orthodontist that they go into business together. But he says he has no interest in any of that. Instead, he's going to work for a 3-D printer manufacturer. The company offered him a job after hearing of his dental handiwork.

I sort of knew to stop wearing a retainer when they no longer felt like they were exerting pressure on my teeth. KALISH: How do orthodontists feel about this? RICHARD BLOOMSTEIN: I was both shocked and impressed. KALISH: Richard Bloomstein is a professor of orthodontics at Rutgers Dental School. BLOOMSTEIN: Did it work as well as an orthodontist might have done it? Maybe. KALISH: But Dr. Bloomstein says the outcome of this amateur orthodontics may have been different if there was decay or bone disease near the teeth Dudley was manipulating. BLOOMSTEIN: Certain things are not a bargain even if they're cheaper. I would not look for bargains in parachutes, likewise bargains in health care. KALISH: But traditional orthodontic care is expensive, often thousands of dollars, a reason online services that don't require office visits seem to be gaining popularity. A quick Internet search turned up two companies that offer budget dental aligners. Patients need only to send in impressions and smartphone photos of their teeth. Dudley didn't realize he tapped into a market, but he's pretty happy with the way things have turned out. DUDLEY: I had no idea if this was going to work. It probably only worked in a large part because of luck and good initial conditions. But if there's an idea you have, you just have to try it out. I mean, I had the idea, and I went with it so the outcome was sort of the best I could hope for, I guess. KALISH: Dudley says he's received hundreds of requests to make dental aligners and one suggestion from an orthodontist that they go into business together. But he says he has no interest in any of that. Instead, he's going to work for a 3-D printer manufacturer. The company offered him a job after hearing of his dental handiwork.

Right now, most people rent the boxes from their providers. The Federal Communications Commission wants to make it easier for viewers to buy them. NPR's Brian Naylor reports. BRIAN NAYLOR, BYLINE: The FCC estimates it costs subscribers $231 a year on average to rent the bulky boxes that enable them to watch cable or satellite TV. Earlier this year, the agency proposed a way to make it easier for viewers to buy the boxes outright. In essence, it would require TV channels to provide their content to third-party groups like Google and others, who would sell their own devices. In an interview with Yahoo News, President Obama says a little competition is a good idea. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BARACK OBAMA: The cable or satellite box is just one example of an area where, because it's been tied to the provider and you rent it and consumers spend billions of dollars on this every single year, there hasn't been much innovation. And so the FCC is looking, independently of anything we do here at the White House, at whether it makes sense to open that up to competition. NAYLOR: The president's backing of the FCC proposal is part of a broader White House initiative to spur competition. In the interview, Obama compared the cable box issue to earlier moves by the government to open up the telephone system in the 1980s. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)OBAMA: Across the board, if we have more players who can potentially participate, fewer barriers to entry, the rules aren't rigged, then you get more people trying to get your business, and you get better products at cheaper prices. NAYLOR: The cable TV industry denounced the president's endorsement of the FCC action. Former FCC Chairman Michael Powell now heads the National Cable and Telecommunications Association. He accused the White House of injecting politics and inflammatory rhetoric into a regulatory proceeding by what is supposed to be an independent agency.

Thanks so much for being with us. PAM MUELLER: Thanks for having me. MARTIN: Your study shows that writing notes by hand makes you focus your attention in some way that just typing it doesn't. MUELLER: So when people type their notes, they have this tendency to try to take verbatim notes and write down as much of the lecture as they can. The students who were taking longhand notes in our studies were forced to be more selective because you can't write as fast as you can type. And that extra processing of the material that they were doing benefited them. MARTIN: That's so interesting. So you're saying that if you're typing notes, you're really, like, taking dictation, whereas if you're doing it by longhand, there's no way you can keep up that way. And so you're inevitably synthesizing information and that's a kind of learning? MUELLER: Exactly, particularly when you're asked a question that involves conceptual understanding of the material. We found that on factual questions, the students did approximately equivalently. But when it came to the deeper understanding of material, that's where the longhand note takers really shown. MARTIN: Do you want to out yourself? Are you a longhand note taker or were you, in college, a computer note taker? MUELLER: So when I was in college, nobody really had a laptop. (LAUGHTER)MARTIN: (Imitating whispers) Me either. But we won't tell. MUELLER: (Laughter) When I was in law school, it was a huge debate about laptop versus longhand. And I wished maybe that I'd taken longhand notes there. MARTIN: But what about for all the college students out there in the throes of exams, probably right now, who are frantically taking notes? Is it just unrealistic to think that people would switch it up and go old school? MUELLER: I think it is a hard sell to get people to go back to pen and paper. But they are developing lots of technologies now like Livescribe and various stylus-and-tablet technologies that are getting better and better. And I think that could be sort of an easier sell to college students and people of that generation. I think that these results resonate a lot with people who are a little older. But as we showed in our studies, even when we told people they shouldn't be taking these verbatim notes, they were not able to overcome that instinct. So that frantic note taking you were talking about is actually really, really bad. MARTIN: Pam Mueller is lead author of a study about note taking. Pam, I've been listening carefully and writing things down, all in longhand of course. Now this means I need to work on my penmanship, by the way. MUELLER: Yeah, it helps if the notes are comprehensible later. But even if they're not, the content is in your brain better than it would be otherwise. MARTIN: Oh, good. Wait, before I let you go, do you know who we're talking to next on the show? MUELLER: I heard that Alex Trebek is on this week. MARTIN: Alex Trebek is on. And I hear that this matters to you. You were on \"Jeopardy! \"? MUELLER: Yeah. So I was on the college tournament a long while ago and then on the \"Tournament Of Champions\" and then the \"Ultimate Tournament Of Champions. \" And then two years ago, they had a 30th anniversary tournament where they brought a bunch of us back.

EMIL IVAN: Hi, guys. How are you? SIEGEL: And I want you to tick through a few of the items here. We're not just talking about phone chargers. There are all kinds of interesting gadgets you can buy for your car. IVAN: Yeah, well, actually there are a couple of very cool dash cams which can record your trips. They are very useful if you get into an accident or if something is happening in front of your car. For trip lovers, there's a couple of items that you can use in your car in order to make your life easier while in the world, like, for example, a road shower. SIEGEL: Emil, explain that one to us 'cause I saw it. The water is - and it looks like a pretty small tank on top of your car. How much water do you put in it? IVAN: Well, obviously, you wouldn't do that like at home like staying two hours in your bath with the water turned on. But it's enough for about two showers. It's fixed in the same way you would fix your skis when you go skiing. It heats from the sun, and it simply allows you to stop anywhere and just take a shower or use the heated water to wash your car or do anything else that requires hot water. SIEGEL: You have a few gadgets on your site that you tell people about that are called HUD, heads-up display. These are projections that you see on the windshield. IVAN: Those are very nice gadgets. You're right about it. They look like a little device that you put on your dashboard, and they project it on the screen. And they make it look virtual just like airplane pilot seats. You can still take a look at the road, see your directions. Let's say if it says turn right, you can see the actual arrows helping you drive around the city, and all this without taking your eyes from the road. SIEGEL: There's a car gadget you have which to me it's a sort of a good news, bad news gadget. IVAN: OK. SIEGEL: It's the easy quick jumper where instead of having jumper cables that connect from one battery to another, you connect from one lighter jack to another, which on the one hand is very simple on the other hand it says it takes five to 10 minutes to recharge that way. IVAN: Well, this one, you see here, it came to me as a necessity. Like my wife - she's driving a car, and we were in Montreal in the middle of the winter. You know, Montreal is around minus 30, minus 40 degrees Celsius. So when we saw the issue, I was looking on the Internet to find something a lot more simpler, something to use for guys or girls who don't have a lot of technical knowledge. You simply plug it in, wait five to 10 minutes. You start your engine. SIEGEL: Here's one - the handpresso auto espresso maker. Like several other devices, it actually uses the cup holders that are built into the cars as a natural place, I guess. IVAN: Well, this is especially cool if you're a coffee lover. I am a coffee lover, and it has a specific form. You can keep it in the cup holder. Obviously, I wouldn't advise you to use it while you're driving. But. . . SIEGEL: For that you'd probably need the heads-up display camera focused on the espresso maker to project it into the windshield so you could look straight ahead while making the espresso next to it as you are driving. IVAN: Well, you would need that, and there's another gadget that you would need. And that's called the man with the four hands which was not invented yet so. . .

It's a deal that was designed for China to come in as they always do through the back door and totally take advantage of everyone. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TED CRUZ: We're getting killed in international trade right now. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)HILLARY CLINTON: We've learned a lot about trade agreements in the past years. Sometimes they look great on paper. Now looking back on it, it doesn't have the results we thought it would have. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BERNIE SANDERS: The TPP is just a new easy way for corporations to shut down in America and to send jobs abroad. MARTIN: That was Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump and Ted Cruz and Democratic candidates Hilary Clinton and Bernie Sanders all talking about the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and free trade in general. We wanted to talk about why international free trade has struck such a nerve with Americans this year. So all this week, a group of NPR stations around the country participated in a coordinated conversation called A Nation Engaged. We're closing it out with NPR senior business editor Marilyn Geewax. Hi Marilyn. MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE: Hi Michel. MARTIN: And from the studios of Colorado Public Radio Megan Verlee. Megan, welcome to you as well. MEGAN VERLEE, BYLINE: Hi there. MARTIN: So let me just start out, Marilyn, by pointing out that actually for decades, the political parties have by and large supported big trade agreements that you hear about in the news. People will have heard about NAFTA. They will have heard about the TPP. Why has it turned around seemingly so much, and why is China such a focus of all of this anger? GEEWAX: Right. Let me just say that in the past, Republicans liked it because they tend to be pro-business, Democrats tended to like it because they tend to be internationalists. They see the world as being globalized, so you had a lot of support for it. But then we slammed into the Great Recession. A lot of the popularity of trade went down. Then when it comes to China, there's a lot of deep feeling about that because we all go into the store and we see those things made in China, and it seems like gosh, aren't they making everything these days? Well, China is not part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. It's not one of the 12 nations involved. It's the United States, Japan, Australia - all these countries that are around the Pacific Rim but specifically not China. MARTIN: But the anger is real. Marilyn, could you talk a little bit more about this? GEEWAX: That individual anger is certainly real and justifiable. I mean, if you're one of the people that lost their jobs, you really hurt and your community is devastated. For example, this year we've had this kind of well-known case about Carrier. It's a company that makes air conditioning. And they announced they were closing a plant back in February, and they're moving all these jobs to Mexico. Well holy cow, if you're one of those people that just lost their job, this hurts a lot. The intense downside of trade is felt very much by people, and it makes it easy to point to examples like that if you're a political candidate. The thing that's tricky about trade is that this is a very large economy. It's almost a $19 trillion economy with 323 million people. A lot happens at once. The gains can be very diffused and they're spread out over the economy. For example, air conditioning is really cheap now. A lot of that is because of overseas production. MARTIN: You know, it's interesting because when a lot of our reporters, as we mentioned, across the country have been digging into this over the course of the week, they experienced that kind of mixed bag of opinion themselves. For example, in Los Angeles, Saul Gonzales from member station KCRW talked with truck drivers in California. They're delivering goods from one of the busiest ports in the U. S. Here's Brian Spencer making the case for how trade helps him personally. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)BRIAN SPENCER: How I pay my bills, how I take care of my family, etc. , etc. , is for the simple source of our trade system. You know, if nothing's coming and going, I'm sitting still, therefore I'm not making any money. I'm not making - you know, so I can't live. MARTIN: And here's another trucker Dennis Roach, who had a different opinion, less of a fan. Here it is. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)DENNIS ROACH: Jobs are going to foreign countries. We're shipping more product in from overseas. You know, I'd bet you go to anybody's house and look in their closet and it says Indonesia, China, Japan, Taiwan. There's very few things that'll say made in the U. S. A. MARTIN: Let's go to Megan Verlee now. You had a piece that ran on member station Colorado Public Radio. Tell us a little bit about it. Well, let's play it a bit from the piece then Megan you can tell us more. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)VERLEE: It's a quintessential Colorado scene. Grant Bledsoe's family has owned this Yuma County operation since the 1940's. This is what hungry calves sound like? GRANT BLEDSOE: They're just getting ready to go to grass for the summer time. VERLEE: These steers will eventually be going a lot further than that, or at least parts of them will. BLEDSOE: It's just amazing some of the products that get sold around the world, big demand for the diaphragm, the stomach, tripe to Mexico. MARTIN: So Megan, tell us a little bit more about your reporting. What were the opinions of the people that you interviewed? VERLEE: Well, like you've been saying, mixed from, you know, very traditional industries like beef production, which was shaped by NAFTA opening markets and now stands to really expand under the TPP into more Asian markets. On the one hand, we have people for whom the breaking down the barriers through trade deals is going to be a big plus. And I talked to workers who've been displaced because I think probably anywhere in the country you can find people who know that their jobs have moved overseas. MARTIN: You met two women at Starbucks, for example. You want to tell us about that? VERLEE: Yes. Venice Romero and Vanessa Abdurahman are really good friends. They met working at a T-Mobile call center, and they worked at that call center for more than a decade. And then a couple years ago, T-Mobile closed that center, moved the jobs over to the Philippines. And suddenly, these women who have families, have responsibilities, realize they only had high school diplomas and no way to make as much money as they had before. So they used a federal program called the Trade Adjustment Assistance program. It pays for two years of retraining to workers whose jobs have been lost to trade. And they went back to school, became respiratory techs. They're making about as much now as they did before, and they're both a lot more satisfied with their work. So they're kind of - they're how trade is supposed to work - you know, these low-skill, low-paying jobs move overseas. They're replaced by higher-skill, higher-wage jobs. And in an ideal system, the same people get trained for those new jobs. What I found though is that very few people actually get to take advantage of this retraining opportunity. MARTIN: Marilyn, is this an issue where you stand depends on where you sit because you're in an area where your livelihood depends on trade, then you tend to be for it, but if you're in an area where you think that you've been harmed by it, you tend to be against it? Or. . . GEEWAX: Well. . . MARTIN: . . . Is that not so much the case anymore? GEEWAX: Economists will say that generally speaking, there's something like a ratio of 16 to 1 of benefits to losses to trade. They find the data shows that ultimately it's good. But as I say, if you were that Carrier worker who just found out your job's going to Mexico, it's pretty tough to sit there, you know, thumbing through some academic studies saying that somebody else is winning when you know you're losing. And one other thing I just want to point out is that going forward, these deals are not going to be that much about manufacturing because that's sort of in the rearview mirror. We have lost a lot of manufacturing jobs already. What's happening in the future is how do these trade deals affect things like intellectual property, pharmaceuticals, much more sophisticated products. MARTIN: That's NPR's Marilyn Geewax and also with us Megan Verlee from Colorado Public Radio. Thank you both so much. GEEWAX: Oh, you're welcome. VERLEE: Thank you.

I'm Shankar Vedantam. I was on Facebook the other day when a friend request came in. I don't have a great memory for faces and names, so I found myself trying to figure out if I had met this person somewhere. But then at the back of my mind, I remembered a study. It said my friendship choices on Facebook might be shaped by biases outside of my conscious awareness, in my hidden brain. Michelle Hebl is a psychologist at Rice University who ran the Facebook study. She designed fictitious profiles for two men and two women. Both men were named Michael Davis. Both women were Jennifer Davis. All the characters were African-American. The only real difference between the profiles were the photos. One Photoshopped version of Michael Davis and Jennifer Davis had lighter skin. The other had darker skin. Mikki Hebl sent out friend requests on Facebook on behalf of these fictitious characters to more than a thousand people in a big American city. Since these were invented characters, most of the requests were declined. But there was a big disparity in how often whites accepted friend requests from the darker-skinned Michaels and Jennifers. MICHELLE HEBL: People were less likely to friend them. They were less likely particularly to friend the dark black males. VEDANTAM: If you follow these kinds of experiments, this finding is disappointing but not surprising. Using similar experimental methods, researchers have found disparities in the way professors spend time with students, how companies select job applicants for interviews, even how legislators respond to constituents. But something new is happening today. The bias decisions we once made in interpersonal settings are now being made on giant online platforms, where our actions have the potential to affect many more people. Think about the way you might look for a roommate. Once upon a time, you may have put up a flyer on a bulletin board and talked to people who responded. Today, you might turn to sites such as roommates. com or Craigslist. Raj Ghoshal, a sociologist at Goucher College in Baltimore, recently conducted a roommate study on Craigslist using a technique similar to the one Mikki Hebl used on Facebook. RAJ GHOSHAL: We definitely found a pattern of preference or bias in favor of white-sounding names. So for every 100 replies that a white-sounding name got, a Latina name got about 75, and an African-American name got about 65 or something like that. VEDANTAM: That is a huge difference. GHOSHAL: It's a pretty big difference, right? So if you were African-American, you'd have to spend about one and a half times as much time applying for housing as would somebody with a white name. VEDANTAM: On today's podcast, we're going to delve into what happens when age-old biases rear their heads in a new and growing part of our lives, what's sometimes called the sharing economy. HEBL: It's one thing if I want to discriminate about who I'm going to have over on Friday night to have for dinner or who I want to have sleep over. But it's another thing when my private house starts to become my business. VEDANTAM: The sharing economy, platforms that allow you to hail a taxi, call a babysitter, find a room on Airbnb, rely on making what used to be business exchanges into semi-personal transactions. Your Uber driver sees your name and photograph. You see your driver's name and photo. It's supposed to increase trust, and there's every reason to think it does. But it also does something else. HEBL: When you give people names, then you give people information about your ethnicity. You give people information that they can use to look you up and figure out more cues about you, and that becomes problematic. VEDANTAM: Mikki was on a ship when I interviewed her. She's teaching a semester at sea. During the long voyage, she says, her students tell her about the many online platforms that they are using. HEBL: There's a website called care. com, and it's a babysitting website where people advertise themselves as babysitters. And they have to put a picture of themselves on. So you can think about how, again, maybe I don't want a babysitter that is of that race. Maybe I don't want a babysitter that is of that gender. And so you begin to see where this very subtle type of discrimination can be very systemic. VEDANTAM: The sharing economy is unleashing new possibilities in our lives. These platforms allow us to meet more people, visit more places, get more connected. I'm personally a fan of many apps. But it also seems clear to me that these platforms provide a mechanism to amplify our collective bias. What's especially insidious about the biases on these platforms is that their consequences are largely hidden. If your request to be a babysitter gets turned down, you have no way of knowing if this was driven by racial bias. So I asked HIDDEN BRAIN producers Maggie Penman and Max Nesterak to take a few weeks and try to find people who were personally affected by such biases. They decided to focus on an important new part of the sharing economy, Airbnb. MAGGIE PENMAN, BYLINE: Imagine you're going on vacation with some friends. You do a quick search online, find a few hotels in the city you'd like to stay in. You pick one, ideally with a hot tub, and enter your credit card information. Great, you think, all set. MAX NESTERAK, BYLINE: But then you get an email. We're sorry, but the dates you just booked aren't available after all. They were listed by mistake. PENMAN: Now if this happened to you once, you might chalk it up to a weird website glitch. But if it happened to you over and over, something would start to feel funny. You might start to feel like it's something about you that's making these hotels suddenly unavailable. NESTERAK: This is exactly how could Quirtina Crittenden felt when she would try to use Airbnb to book vacations with her friends. She would find a house that was listed as available, send a booking request. QUIRTINA CRITTENDEN: And I would get declined all the time. PENMAN: Quirtina got a bunch of similar responses. CRITTENDEN: The host would always come up with excuses like, oh, someone actually just booked it or, oh, some of my regulars are coming in town, and they're going to stay there. I just haven't updated my calendar. But I got suspicious when I would check back, like, days later and see that those dates were still available. NESTERAK: Quirtina's black. And this is relevant because on Airbnb, both hosts and guests have their names and photos prominently displayed on their profiles. PENMAN: And this is actually one of the platform's selling points. It's supposed to make these transactions between strangers feel less anonymous and less scary. NESTERAK: But it also made Quirtina start to wonder if these rejections had something to do with her race. CRITTENDEN: My name is Quirtina. I have a very black-sounding name. And I also had my photos, so I'm very clearly a black woman. NESTERAK: And when she looked at the reviews that previous guests had left for these hosts. . . CRITTENDEN: I never saw anybody who looked like me. PENMAN: So, Quirtina did what any good millennial does when they're frustrated. She took to Twitter. CRITTENDEN: And I was just venting my frustrations, and I just included a lot of screenshots of the messages that I was getting from people. And I put the #AirbnbWhileBlack. NESTERAK: She started hearing from lots of friends who had similar experiences. . . CRITTENDEN: The most common response that I got was, oh, yeah, that's why I don't use my photo. Like, duh (laughter), like, I was the late one. NESTERAK: . . . And one friend who hadn't. CRITTENDEN: One of my friends who is actually black, he responded to me and said, well, I've never had an issue. And then he went back and checked his profile, and I guess he'd never wanted to use his photo. So he realized that the whole time he had been using a photo of some random white guy from our school, and so he's like, oh, maybe this is why I've never had an issue. PENMAN: So, Quirtina decided to tweak her profile. CRITTENDEN: I shortened my name to just Tina, which is a name that I go by in work and in other settings. And I changed my photo to a landscape. Ever since I changed my name and my photo, I've never had any issues on Airbnb. PENMAN: Now it's impossible to say exactly why Quirtina was rejected by those specific hosts. NESTERAK: But a recent study shows racial discrimination on Airbnb is widespread. MICHAEL LUCA: I'm Michael Luca. I'm a faculty member at Harvard Business School. I'm an assistant professor of business administration. PENMAN: Michael Luca and his colleagues, Benjamin Edelman and Dan Svirsky, sent out fake Airbnb requests to real-life hosts. LUCA: So we sent out 6,400 requests to stay with people, and we kept every request the same. NESTERAK: The only thing that was different about the requests, the profiles attached to them either had African-American-sounding names or white-sounding names. PENMAN: So, like, does Brad get the same number of responses on Airbnb as Jamaal? NESTERAK: And unfortunately. . . LUCA: We could see that there was a very different response rate and acceptance rate for African-American guests relative to white guests. Having an African-American name leads to roughly a 15 percent lower chance of being accepted as a guest on Airbnb relative to having a distinctively white name, holding all else constant. NESTERAK: To put this in perspective, Airbnb isn't some little startup anymore. PENMAN: It's one of the largest players in the hotel industry worldwide. In 2015, more than 2 million listings were offered on the platform from hosts around the world. That's nearly four times as many rooms as the Marriott hotel chain. NESTERAK: You can even rent a castle. PENMAN: You can even rent a castle. And it's not just vacation rentals. People are finding housing on this platform for months at a time. So discrimination on Airbnb is discrimination in the housing market. NESTERAK: Michael Luca and his colleagues think people could be discriminating without even knowing it. LUCA: Bias for a lot of people is something that is accidental. NESTERAK: What Michael Luca is talking about is unconscious bias, these hidden associations we have that affect our behavior without us realizing it. It's unlikely that most hosts are saying to themselves, I'm going to reject this person because I don't want to rent to a black person. PENMAN: I mean, maybe some people are intentionally discriminating. NESTERAK: There are probably some people like that. But, Michael Luca suspects the way Airbnb's platform is designed is triggering the associations people have of some racial groups. So because names and photos are the first thing people see, it may also be one of the first things they consider, consciously or unconsciously, when choosing a place to stay. He and his colleagues looked at five major cities in the U. S. , and discrimination was happening across the board. LUCA: We saw that there was discrimination among cheap listings, expensive listings, in diverse neighborhoods, in homogenous neighborhoods, among white hosts and among African-American hosts. DAVID KING: I actually spoke to Mike Luca last week. PENMAN: That's David King, the brand-new director of diversity and belonging at Airbnb. He knows this is a problem, and he wants Airbnb to be a leader on fixing it. KING: There is a racial bias in platforms, and we are working with Mike Luca and any other external interested parties into how do we address and fix this problem. NESTERAK: One thing that could fix the problem is just getting rid of names and photos or making them less prominent. But Airbnb doesn't think that would improve their platform. KING: The photos are on the platform for a reason. Number one, it really does help to aid in the trust between the guest and the host. And then secondary to that is safety. You want to make sure that that guest that shows up at your door is the person that you've been communicating with. PENMAN: But, David King also pointed out there's a lot of opportunity for Airbnb to do good. They're bringing together people from all different backgrounds who wouldn't normally meet. KING: We've done some recent reports in Chicago and New York, pointing out that undeserved communities, especially African-American communities, have benefited quite a bit from our platform, usually in neighborhoods where there are few hotels. NESTERAK: One of those neighborhoods with few hotels is Washington, D. C. 's Anacostia. The neighborhood is on the edge of city limits on the other side of the Anacostia River from the capital and the Washington Monument. It's a neighborhood with a lot of big box stores and empty lots but also rowhouses and families that go back generations. We went there to visit Airbnb host Synta Keeling. SYNTA KEELING: Hi, how are you? NESTERAK: Hi, how are you? PENMAN: Synta owns a three-story townhouse in a new development. She rents out two rooms on Airbnb. There's a fitness room, cable and high-speed Internet, solar panels and slippers for all of her guests. PENMAN: I love the slippers, first of all. KEELING: (Laughter) Ikea. NESTERAK: Synta is a super host, and we're not just saying that because of the slippers. It's an official designation she's earned from Airbnb based on positive reviews from her guests, her responsiveness to booking requests and the fact that she's never canceled a booking. It shows Airbnb travelers she's been verified as a good person to stay with. Synta says as a black host in a black neighborhood, that's important. She feels like she gets held to a higher standard than other hosts. KEELING: This neighborhood's called Capital View, and it's 98 percent African-American, double-digit unemployment. PENMAN: We asked Synta whether her race and the racial composition of her neighborhood made it harder to get guests. And she said. . . KEELING: Absolutely (laughter). Yeah, no, I had one - I've had some instances where people will ask me all these questions about is it unsafe and this, and I'll say, you know, I'm a black Filipino woman. I take - we take great pride in our community. This is absolutely a good place for you to stay. And I'll say those things, and then there will be crickets. They'll just not book. PENMAN: But, Synta also said there were great things about Airbnb. For one thing, it brings her a steady second income. NESTERAK: Airbnb brings business to the stores and restaurants that don't typically benefit from the tourism industry. It might even help change people's perceptions of Anacostia. Airbnb's slogan is belong anywhere, and there's some truth to it. PENMAN: Synta Keeling told us a story about one of her guests that drove this message home. He came back from being out for the day and told her. . . KEELING: I took the bus back, and I was the only white person on the bus, and it was all these black people. And I asked myself, were they going to hurt me? Am I unsafe? And then I realized they weren't hurting me, and nothing was going to happen to me. Like, they were just sitting there normal. And he was saying this in a way that he was like he mentally realized the horridness of what he was saying, where at the same time, he was just being honest about what he was thinking and that he arrived at the stop and just had come off. And, like, nothing had happened to him, and it was just this shock. NESTERAK: Synta says she knows that some people won't rent from her because she's a black host in a predominantly black neighborhood. PENMAN: But here's the thing. She's glad those people don't book with her. KEELING: The strange thing about Airbnb that makes it tough is I really don't want a racist guest in my house because I don't - I live here in this space, so I don't need to feel uncomfortable, you know, the other way. But if you just feel like, well, you know, maybe I'll give this a shot, then I'm willing to be open-minded. PENMAN: The fact is Airbnb is not the same thing as a major hotel chain. Hosts have discretion on the platform, but guests don't have the same legal recourse as hotel customers if they feel they've been discriminated against. NESTERAK: We spoke to a couple lawyers for this story, and the legal picture is a little murky here. It isn't clear who, if anyone, is liable for discrimination on a web-based platform. PENMAN: So Airbnb does offer this opportunity to experience different cultures, to meet people you wouldn't normally meet. But sometimes hidden bias is getting in the way. NESTERAK: And people like Quirtina and Synta are paying the price. VEDANTAM: That's Maggie Penman and Max Nesterak, reporting on people who feel they have personally experienced bias in the sharing economy. When we come back, Maggie, Max and I will discuss potential solutions to the problem. VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. We're exploring the many ways in which the sharing economy might allow hidden biases to flourish. As apps in the sharing economy become an increasingly large part of our lives, they have the potential to create great disparities. Producers Maggie Penman and Max Nesterak are in the studio with me now to talk about potential solutions. Hi, Max. NESTERAK: Hi, Shankar. VEDANTAM: Hey, Maggie. PENMAN: Hey, Shankar. VEDANTAM: Maggie, if I understand correctly, Airbnb actually gives hosts a mechanism to avoid this problem. PENMAN: It's true. There is this feature called Instant Book, and it's exactly what it sounds like. Basically, as a guest, you can book a room just like you would a hotel without waiting to be accepted by the host. VEDANTAM: Why would hosts want to offer this option? PENMAN: Well, it's much more convenient for guests, so I think you're more likely to get bookings if you offer Instant Book. And then it's also easy for hosts because if you're renting out your whole house and you don't really care who stays there, you can just offer this option and not deal with it. VEDANTAM: And is there any evidence that this feature is actually being used to avoid discrimination on Airbnb? PENMAN: Yeah, Max and I actually talked to this guy, Reid Kennedy (ph). He's African-American, and his experience with Airbnb was very similar to Quirtina's. REID KENNEDY: And so after being rejected and I think in that case four times within the same day for reasons again that weren't specified, I started to see a pattern. PENMAN: So, Reid complained to Airbnb, and Airbnb gave him a credit. But he was struggling to use this credit because he was still having trouble booking a place. So he used Instant Book. KENNEDY: And ironically, the host was a black man, who may have been using the Instant Book feature for the same reason I was. VEDANTAM: So, Max, what I'm hearing Maggie say is that there might be a designed solution for the psychological problem of bias. NESTERAK: Yeah, and this is similar to a solution that Michael Luca came up with. He worked with a computer scientist, and they developed this Google Chrome app called Debias Yourself. It removes photos and names from people's profiles so you can't discriminate even by accident. PENMAN: And didn't Michael Luca say he actually got this idea from orchestras? NESTERAK: He did. So it used to be that back in the day, orchestras were overwhelmingly male, and people may have thought, oh, there's just more male musicians, or maybe they're just better. But then there started to be a shift in orchestras where there were more women. And researchers went back and looked at this, and they found that there had been a change to the audition process, where there was now a screen in between the judges and the person auditioning. And Mike Luca says this is something that Airbnb should be doing only on a larger scale. LUCA: One of the things that I love about the digital world is that it gives us the opportunity to choose exactly where to put screens and where not to put screens. So I think we have a host of new decisions that we can make as market designers that will decide how inclusive a society we have or how much discrimination we want to encourage or allow. VEDANTAM: I have to say, it might not all be about the information that you're hiding. It could also be about the information that you're emphasizing. Raj Ghoshal - this is the sociologist at Goucher College who did the study on Craigslist - suggested that we might want to be playing up certain kinds of information. GHOSHAL: Perhaps colleges and universities can play a role in this, and perhaps websites like Craigslist or roommates. com could do more to actually, like, frontload information about people's living habits or cultural identities, what time people get up and go to bed, what level of messy they are, that sort of thing rather than immediately hitting people over the head with somebody's name just because, you know, all of the evidence we have, evidence from other studies just suggests that, like, race and names is such a powerful signal to people that we probably don't actually want it to be the first thing or the immediate thing that the people see in our deciding bias. PENMAN: Yeah, that's a really interesting idea. Another option would be to offer trainings about unconscious bias to hosts. So Airbnb has actually already taken the step of training their employees and some hosts in recognizing and combating unconscious bias. And maybe if they make that information available on a larger scale, hosts will start to check their own biases. NESTERAK: Another idea that we've heard is to provide feedback to hosts. So Airbnb could send hosts an email saying, here are the requests you received, and here are the guests you accepted. Now if someone doesn't want to host people from certain racial groups, this feedback wouldn't do much. But for those who might not mean to discriminate, it could be enough to nudge them in the right direction. VEDANTAM: Well, that's interesting stuff. Thanks so much, Max. NESTERAK: Thank you. VEDANTAM: Thanks, Maggie. PENMAN: Thanks, Shankar. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: The HIDDEN BRAIN podcast is produced by Kara McGuirk-Alison, Maggie Penman and Max Nesterak. If you like this episode, consider giving us a review on iTunes. It will help other people find the podcast. We're going to be talking about this episode on social media using the #AirbnbWhileBlack. Do join the conversation. I'm Shankar Vedantam, and this is NPR. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. I was on Facebook the other day when a friend request came in. I don't have a great memory for faces and names, so I found myself trying to figure out if I had met this person somewhere. But then at the back of my mind, I remembered a study. It said my friendship choices on Facebook might be shaped by biases outside of my conscious awareness, in my hidden brain. Michelle Hebl is a psychologist at Rice University who ran the Facebook study. She designed fictitious profiles for two men and two women. Both men were named Michael Davis. Both women were Jennifer Davis. All the characters were African-American. The only real difference between the profiles were the photos. One Photoshopped version of Michael Davis and Jennifer Davis had lighter skin. The other had darker skin. Mikki Hebl sent out friend requests on Facebook on behalf of these fictitious characters to more than a thousand people in a big American city. Since these were invented characters, most of the requests were declined. But there was a big disparity in how often whites accepted friend requests from the darker-skinned Michaels and Jennifers. MICHELLE HEBL: People were less likely to friend them. They were less likely particularly to friend the dark black males. VEDANTAM: If you follow these kinds of experiments, this finding is disappointing but not surprising. Using similar experimental methods, researchers have found disparities in the way professors spend time with students, how companies select job applicants for interviews, even how legislators respond to constituents. But something new is happening today. The bias decisions we once made in interpersonal settings are now being made on giant online platforms, where our actions have the potential to affect many more people. Think about the way you might look for a roommate. Once upon a time, you may have put up a flyer on a bulletin board and talked to people who responded. Today, you might turn to sites such as roommates. com or Craigslist. Raj Ghoshal, a sociologist at Goucher College in Baltimore, recently conducted a roommate study on Craigslist using a technique similar to the one Mikki Hebl used on Facebook. RAJ GHOSHAL: We definitely found a pattern of preference or bias in favor of white-sounding names. So for every 100 replies that a white-sounding name got, a Latina name got about 75, and an African-American name got about 65 or something like that. VEDANTAM: That is a huge difference. GHOSHAL: It's a pretty big difference, right? So if you were African-American, you'd have to spend about one and a half times as much time applying for housing as would somebody with a white name. VEDANTAM: On today's podcast, we're going to delve into what happens when age-old biases rear their heads in a new and growing part of our lives, what's sometimes called the sharing economy. HEBL: It's one thing if I want to discriminate about who I'm going to have over on Friday night to have for dinner or who I want to have sleep over. But it's another thing when my private house starts to become my business. VEDANTAM: The sharing economy, platforms that allow you to hail a taxi, call a babysitter, find a room on Airbnb, rely on making what used to be business exchanges into semi-personal transactions. Your Uber driver sees your name and photograph. You see your driver's name and photo. It's supposed to increase trust, and there's every reason to think it does. But it also does something else. HEBL: When you give people names, then you give people information about your ethnicity. You give people information that they can use to look you up and figure out more cues about you, and that becomes problematic. VEDANTAM: Mikki was on a ship when I interviewed her. She's teaching a semester at sea. During the long voyage, she says, her students tell her about the many online platforms that they are using. HEBL: There's a website called care. com, and it's a babysitting website where people advertise themselves as babysitters. And they have to put a picture of themselves on. So you can think about how, again, maybe I don't want a babysitter that is of that race. Maybe I don't want a babysitter that is of that gender. And so you begin to see where this very subtle type of discrimination can be very systemic. VEDANTAM: The sharing economy is unleashing new possibilities in our lives. These platforms allow us to meet more people, visit more places, get more connected. I'm personally a fan of many apps. But it also seems clear to me that these platforms provide a mechanism to amplify our collective bias. What's especially insidious about the biases on these platforms is that their consequences are largely hidden. If your request to be a babysitter gets turned down, you have no way of knowing if this was driven by racial bias. So I asked HIDDEN BRAIN producers Maggie Penman and Max Nesterak to take a few weeks and try to find people who were personally affected by such biases. They decided to focus on an important new part of the sharing economy, Airbnb. MAGGIE PENMAN, BYLINE: Imagine you're going on vacation with some friends. You do a quick search online, find a few hotels in the city you'd like to stay in. You pick one, ideally with a hot tub, and enter your credit card information. Great, you think, all set. MAX NESTERAK, BYLINE: But then you get an email. We're sorry, but the dates you just booked aren't available after all. They were listed by mistake. PENMAN: Now if this happened to you once, you might chalk it up to a weird website glitch. But if it happened to you over and over, something would start to feel funny. You might start to feel like it's something about you that's making these hotels suddenly unavailable. NESTERAK: This is exactly how could Quirtina Crittenden felt when she would try to use Airbnb to book vacations with her friends. She would find a house that was listed as available, send a booking request. QUIRTINA CRITTENDEN: And I would get declined all the time. PENMAN: Quirtina got a bunch of similar responses. CRITTENDEN: The host would always come up with excuses like, oh, someone actually just booked it or, oh, some of my regulars are coming in town, and they're going to stay there. I just haven't updated my calendar. But I got suspicious when I would check back, like, days later and see that those dates were still available. NESTERAK: Quirtina's black. And this is relevant because on Airbnb, both hosts and guests have their names and photos prominently displayed on their profiles. PENMAN: And this is actually one of the platform's selling points. It's supposed to make these transactions between strangers feel less anonymous and less scary. NESTERAK: But it also made Quirtina start to wonder if these rejections had something to do with her race. CRITTENDEN: My name is Quirtina. I have a very black-sounding name. And I also had my photos, so I'm very clearly a black woman. NESTERAK: And when she looked at the reviews that previous guests had left for these hosts. . . CRITTENDEN: I never saw anybody who looked like me. PENMAN: So, Quirtina did what any good millennial does when they're frustrated. She took to Twitter. CRITTENDEN: And I was just venting my frustrations, and I just included a lot of screenshots of the messages that I was getting from people. And I put the #AirbnbWhileBlack. NESTERAK: She started hearing from lots of friends who had similar experiences. . . CRITTENDEN: The most common response that I got was, oh, yeah, that's why I don't use my photo. Like, duh (laughter), like, I was the late one. NESTERAK: . . . And one friend who hadn't. CRITTENDEN: One of my friends who is actually black, he responded to me and said, well, I've never had an issue. And then he went back and checked his profile, and I guess he'd never wanted to use his photo. So he realized that the whole time he had been using a photo of some random white guy from our school, and so he's like, oh, maybe this is why I've never had an issue. PENMAN: So, Quirtina decided to tweak her profile. CRITTENDEN: I shortened my name to just Tina, which is a name that I go by in work and in other settings. And I changed my photo to a landscape. Ever since I changed my name and my photo, I've never had any issues on Airbnb. PENMAN: Now it's impossible to say exactly why Quirtina was rejected by those specific hosts. NESTERAK: But a recent study shows racial discrimination on Airbnb is widespread. MICHAEL LUCA: I'm Michael Luca. I'm a faculty member at Harvard Business School. I'm an assistant professor of business administration. PENMAN: Michael Luca and his colleagues, Benjamin Edelman and Dan Svirsky, sent out fake Airbnb requests to real-life hosts. LUCA: So we sent out 6,400 requests to stay with people, and we kept every request the same. NESTERAK: The only thing that was different about the requests, the profiles attached to them either had African-American-sounding names or white-sounding names. PENMAN: So, like, does Brad get the same number of responses on Airbnb as Jamaal? NESTERAK: And unfortunately. . . LUCA: We could see that there was a very different response rate and acceptance rate for African-American guests relative to white guests. Having an African-American name leads to roughly a 15 percent lower chance of being accepted as a guest on Airbnb relative to having a distinctively white name, holding all else constant. NESTERAK: To put this in perspective, Airbnb isn't some little startup anymore. PENMAN: It's one of the largest players in the hotel industry worldwide. In 2015, more than 2 million listings were offered on the platform from hosts around the world. That's nearly four times as many rooms as the Marriott hotel chain. NESTERAK: You can even rent a castle. PENMAN: You can even rent a castle. And it's not just vacation rentals. People are finding housing on this platform for months at a time. So discrimination on Airbnb is discrimination in the housing market. NESTERAK: Michael Luca and his colleagues think people could be discriminating without even knowing it. LUCA: Bias for a lot of people is something that is accidental. NESTERAK: What Michael Luca is talking about is unconscious bias, these hidden associations we have that affect our behavior without us realizing it. It's unlikely that most hosts are saying to themselves, I'm going to reject this person because I don't want to rent to a black person. PENMAN: I mean, maybe some people are intentionally discriminating. NESTERAK: There are probably some people like that. But, Michael Luca suspects the way Airbnb's platform is designed is triggering the associations people have of some racial groups. So because names and photos are the first thing people see, it may also be one of the first things they consider, consciously or unconsciously, when choosing a place to stay. He and his colleagues looked at five major cities in the U. S. , and discrimination was happening across the board. LUCA: We saw that there was discrimination among cheap listings, expensive listings, in diverse neighborhoods, in homogenous neighborhoods, among white hosts and among African-American hosts. DAVID KING: I actually spoke to Mike Luca last week. PENMAN: That's David King, the brand-new director of diversity and belonging at Airbnb. He knows this is a problem, and he wants Airbnb to be a leader on fixing it. KING: There is a racial bias in platforms, and we are working with Mike Luca and any other external interested parties into how do we address and fix this problem. NESTERAK: One thing that could fix the problem is just getting rid of names and photos or making them less prominent. But Airbnb doesn't think that would improve their platform. KING: The photos are on the platform for a reason. Number one, it really does help to aid in the trust between the guest and the host. And then secondary to that is safety. You want to make sure that that guest that shows up at your door is the person that you've been communicating with. PENMAN: But, David King also pointed out there's a lot of opportunity for Airbnb to do good. They're bringing together people from all different backgrounds who wouldn't normally meet. KING: We've done some recent reports in Chicago and New York, pointing out that undeserved communities, especially African-American communities, have benefited quite a bit from our platform, usually in neighborhoods where there are few hotels. NESTERAK: One of those neighborhoods with few hotels is Washington, D. C. 's Anacostia. The neighborhood is on the edge of city limits on the other side of the Anacostia River from the capital and the Washington Monument. It's a neighborhood with a lot of big box stores and empty lots but also rowhouses and families that go back generations. We went there to visit Airbnb host Synta Keeling. SYNTA KEELING: Hi, how are you? NESTERAK: Hi, how are you? PENMAN: Synta owns a three-story townhouse in a new development. She rents out two rooms on Airbnb. There's a fitness room, cable and high-speed Internet, solar panels and slippers for all of her guests. PENMAN: I love the slippers, first of all. KEELING: (Laughter) Ikea. NESTERAK: Synta is a super host, and we're not just saying that because of the slippers. It's an official designation she's earned from Airbnb based on positive reviews from her guests, her responsiveness to booking requests and the fact that she's never canceled a booking. It shows Airbnb travelers she's been verified as a good person to stay with. Synta says as a black host in a black neighborhood, that's important. She feels like she gets held to a higher standard than other hosts. KEELING: This neighborhood's called Capital View, and it's 98 percent African-American, double-digit unemployment. PENMAN: We asked Synta whether her race and the racial composition of her neighborhood made it harder to get guests. And she said. . . KEELING: Absolutely (laughter). Yeah, no, I had one - I've had some instances where people will ask me all these questions about is it unsafe and this, and I'll say, you know, I'm a black Filipino woman. I take - we take great pride in our community. This is absolutely a good place for you to stay. And I'll say those things, and then there will be crickets. They'll just not book. PENMAN: But, Synta also said there were great things about Airbnb. For one thing, it brings her a steady second income. NESTERAK: Airbnb brings business to the stores and restaurants that don't typically benefit from the tourism industry. It might even help change people's perceptions of Anacostia. Airbnb's slogan is belong anywhere, and there's some truth to it. PENMAN: Synta Keeling told us a story about one of her guests that drove this message home. He came back from being out for the day and told her. . . KEELING: I took the bus back, and I was the only white person on the bus, and it was all these black people. And I asked myself, were they going to hurt me? Am I unsafe? And then I realized they weren't hurting me, and nothing was going to happen to me. Like, they were just sitting there normal. And he was saying this in a way that he was like he mentally realized the horridness of what he was saying, where at the same time, he was just being honest about what he was thinking and that he arrived at the stop and just had come off. And, like, nothing had happened to him, and it was just this shock. NESTERAK: Synta says she knows that some people won't rent from her because she's a black host in a predominantly black neighborhood. PENMAN: But here's the thing. She's glad those people don't book with her. KEELING: The strange thing about Airbnb that makes it tough is I really don't want a racist guest in my house because I don't - I live here in this space, so I don't need to feel uncomfortable, you know, the other way. But if you just feel like, well, you know, maybe I'll give this a shot, then I'm willing to be open-minded. PENMAN: The fact is Airbnb is not the same thing as a major hotel chain.

It posted its first quarterly revenue drop since 2003, and for the first time ever, falling iPhone sales. And now the billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn says he's dumping all his shares in the company. Here to discuss Apple's woes is NPR\u2019s Aarti Shahani. Welcome back to the program, Aarti. AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: Hi. CORNISH: So first start with this news about this investor saying goodbye to Apple. SHAHANI: Yeah, Icahn was talking yesterday on CNBC, and that's where he dropped the news. Let's have a quick listen. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CARL ICAHN: We no longer have a position in Apple. We - to start, I think Tim Cook did a great job. I have a great relationship with him. I called him this morning to tell him that, and he was a little sorry, obviously. SHAHANI: But Icahn goes on to explain, he pulled out because of a huge external threat from his perspective, China. Apple is really dependent on China. It's the second-largest market after the U. S. , and Icahn says the Chinese government could suddenly change its mind, close the doors and make it very difficult for Apple to sell there. Earlier this month, China decided to shut down the iBook store and iTunes movies just like that. In the interview, Icahn said China could do something else erratic, so he's cutting loose, and he said he made about $2 billion in Apple, which is not bad. CORNISH: All right, so you're saying Apple is dependent on China, in what way? What's the extent of that? SHAHANI: Well, the company's overall game plan is to grow all around the world. For example, right now they're betting big on India, but so far it's not clear if that market will pan out. And in the past, China was Apple's go-to. This last quarter, though, lower sales in China and Hong Kong were responsible for much of Apple's revenue decline. And so, you know, to be clear, there are two separate issues here. One is Icahn's take on the Chinese government, the other is just the smartphone market and how well Apple will perform against competitors like Samsung. CORNISH: What is Apple doing in response to all of this? I know it's not admitting defeat. SHAHANI: No, no, they're not taking this lying down. They're not admitting defeat. You know, right after Apple released its weak quarterly numbers, CEO Tim Cook got on this earnings call. An investor - she asked about the future. Does Apple even think of itself as a growth company anymore, or is it a mature tech company - that is, you know, heyday's gone? That's a very loaded question for the largest company on earth. And here's what Tim Cook says on the call. One, yes, it is a problem that the smartphone market is not growing right now, but the market is tough for - everyone competitors too - and it's a temporary situation. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TIM COOK: My view that is - that's an overhang up through the macroeconomic environment omitting many different places in the world. And we're very optimistic that this too shall pass and that the market and particularly us will grow again. CORNISH: This too shall pass. What did the investors say? SHAHANI: Well, it wasn't a great week for Apple on Wall Street. But, you know, a lot of tech stocks were down because of disappointing results. Google or, you know, I should say Alphabet, the parent company of Google, also didn't do too well. On the other hand, Facebook and Amazon, they both reported great earnings and their shares are up. Wall Street is happy with them for the moment. CORNISH: That's NPR's Aarti Shahani, thanks so much. SHAHANI: Thank you. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  Apple had a lousy week. It posted its first quarterly revenue drop since 2003, and for the first time ever, falling iPhone sales. And now the billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn says he's dumping all his shares in the company. Here to discuss Apple's woes is NPR\u2019s Aarti Shahani. Welcome back to the program, Aarti. AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: Hi. CORNISH: So first start with this news about this investor saying goodbye to Apple. SHAHANI: Yeah, Icahn was talking yesterday on CNBC, and that's where he dropped the news. Let's have a quick listen. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CARL ICAHN: We no longer have a position in Apple. We - to start, I think Tim Cook did a great job. I have a great relationship with him. I called him this morning to tell him that, and he was a little sorry, obviously. SHAHANI: But Icahn goes on to explain, he pulled out because of a huge external threat from his perspective, China. Apple is really dependent on China. It's the second-largest market after the U. S. , and Icahn says the Chinese government could suddenly change its mind, close the doors and make it very difficult for Apple to sell there. Earlier this month, China decided to shut down the iBook store and iTunes movies just like that. In the interview, Icahn said China could do something else erratic, so he's cutting loose, and he said he made about $2 billion in Apple, which is not bad. CORNISH: All right, so you're saying Apple is dependent on China, in what way? What's the extent of that? SHAHANI: Well, the company's overall game plan is to grow all around the world. For example, right now they're betting big on India, but so far it's not clear if that market will pan out. And in the past, China was Apple's go-to. This last quarter, though, lower sales in China and Hong Kong were responsible for much of Apple's revenue decline. And so, you know, to be clear, there are two separate issues here. One is Icahn's take on the Chinese government, the other is just the smartphone market and how well Apple will perform against competitors like Samsung. CORNISH: What is Apple doing in response to all of this? I know it's not admitting defeat. SHAHANI: No, no, they're not taking this lying down. They're not admitting defeat. You know, right after Apple released its weak quarterly numbers, CEO Tim Cook got on this earnings call. An investor - she asked about the future. Does Apple even think of itself as a growth company anymore, or is it a mature tech company - that is, you know, heyday's gone? That's a very loaded question for the largest company on earth. And here's what Tim Cook says on the call. One, yes, it is a problem that the smartphone market is not growing right now, but the market is tough for - everyone competitors too - and it's a temporary situation. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TIM COOK: My view that is - that's an overhang up through the macroeconomic environment omitting many different places in the world. And we're very optimistic that this too shall pass and that the market and particularly us will grow again. CORNISH: This too shall pass. What did the investors say?

Those are the people behind \"Sesame Street. \" The new channel lives not on television but online, on YouTube. And this news is the starting point for a series of reports on Sesame Workshop by NPR's David Folkenflik. DAVID FOLKENFLIK, BYLINE: It all starts with a big musical number, kids dancing on a street as they surround a big friendly figure familiar to millions. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"SESAME STREET THEME\")THE KIDS: (Singing) Sunny day sweeping the clouds away. FOLKENFLIK: Not that one with Big Bird, this one. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"SESAME STUDIOS THEME\")TODRICK HALL: (Singing) I want to go where the sunny days chase the clouds away and my favorite songs play. FOLKENFLIK: Today marks the launch of the Sesame Studios channel on YouTube. And this is from its new theme song there. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"SESAME STUDIOS THEME\")HALL: (Singing) But if you want to be smarter, stronger and kinder let me hear you say oh-a-oh. Oh-a-oh. FOLKENFLIK: Smarter, stronger, kinder, that's Sesame Workshop's long-time motto. \"Sesame Street's\" YouTube channel already boasts nearly 2 million subscribers and gathers more than a billion video views a year. It's not going away. Sesame Studios, the new channel, will present original digital shorts. JEFF DUNN: We don't want to just be a one-trick pony. FOLKENFLIK: That's Sesame Workshop CEO Jeff Dunn. DUNN: We need to expand the intellectual property. We need to figure out how different kids engage. All of that suggests that opening the doors to new creators, new content is the way to go. FOLKENFLIK: So Sesame Studios won't rely on familiar figures such as Elmo or Abby Cadabby. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG \"TOTEMS FAMILY SONG\")UNIDENTIFIED SINGERS: (Singing) Maybe you've got one mom plus you makes two. Maybe you've got three sisters or maybe there's only you.

KAY WILSON STALLINGS: We're trying to be really nimble. You know, we want to be able to have this ability to make content pretty quickly. But at the same time, we are not compromising on the quality. FOLKENFLIK: Kay Wilson Stallings is the workshop's senior vice president for creative development. She says segments with digital puppets can be turned around in as little as three days, though CGI animation can take three months. Todrick Hall, who wrote that theme song, is already a star viral video performer with 2 million subscribers to his YouTube channel alone. Stallings says it took him just three hours to turn around his song - the second time around. STALLINGS: And honestly, the first pass at the song, you know, wasn't great because he thought - because it was for kids - that we were looking for this very sacrony, very gentle, very cliche piece of music. And we were like, no, Todrick we want you. We want the kind of music that you do, you know, to appeal to the kids and their millennial parents. FOLKENFLIK: Back in the 1970s, \"Sesame Street\" reached between 5 and 6 million preschoolers each week on PBS. Four decades later, it reaches that same figure. But that's across all platforms, including public TV, HBO, video-on-demand, streaming, the Sesame website and apps.

Money, titles, deeds can be stored and moved and managed securely and privately. And this is achieved through some clever code and through mass collaboration. SIEGEL: Give us a real-world example of how blockchain might or already has improved the world. TAPSCOTT: Well, Anna Lee Domingo (ph) is a Filipino housekeeper and nanny in Toronto. She gets her paycheck. She goes to the Filipino mall where there's a Western Union office, and she sends her remittances to her mom in Manila. And this takes her about five hours a month. She gets charged 10, 11 percent. Six months ago, Anna Lee Domingo started using a tool called Abra, and she types in $200 and her mom's ID. And the money is transferred in a millisecond. The fees are a quarter of a percent. SIEGEL: Now, where was her $200 before it was transmitted to the Philippines? TAPSCOTT: It's on her mobile phone, and she got it there by going to a bitcoin teller or to a bank or on the Internet. And this has now changed her world a lot. SIEGEL: I understand the incentive to pay a much smaller commission for a transfer than you have to pay now. On the other hand, I was trying to think, in reading a little bit about this, whether I really mistrust my bank that much apart from issues of cost. Do we need this if we feel fairly confident about the bank we use? TAPSCOTT: Well, overall, these intermediaries do a pretty good job, but there are limitations. They all take a fee, but there are other problems. They capture our data. And here we have this biggest asset from the digital age, data. But we create it, but we don't get to keep it. And it's not just that we can't monetize it, but this data is often used to undermine our privacy. SIEGEL: Does somebody own blockchain? How would you describe that? TAPSCOTT: No, it's open source. First of all, there are many blockchains. The bitcoin blockchain is the biggest. There's one called Ethereum that uses a currency called Ether. And I was in London recently, and I was speaking to the Ethereum developers group. Ethereum has a whole suite of software development tools. And in that room were people creating companies to replace the stock market, to replace the audit function of corporations, to build a whole new model of identity so that we can each own our own identity rather than governments, big social media companies and others. There was a company creating an alternative to Uber. And most of what Uber does can be replaced by what are called smart agents and smart contracts on a blockchain.

NPR's John Ydstie reports. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: This SWIFT network is used to send payment instructions between 11,000 banks around the world. In the Bangladesh attack, hackers used the system to move $81 million from the Bangladesh Bank's account at the New York Fed to an account in the Philippines. The cyber security unit at BAE Systems in Britain is investigating that attack. It says the computer code in that theft has many similarities with code used in the massive data breach at Sony Pictures in 2014. The U. S. blamed North Korea for that attack. SWIFT said today another bank has been attacked using its system, but it didn't give the bank's name or location. Bill Nelson, CEO of FS-ISAC, which focuses on the security of the global financial services industry, says the use of the SWIFT system is what makes these recent hacks unique and troubling.

YDSTIE: Some analysts have speculated that the thieves may have enlisted bank employees to provide the credentials needed to access the SWIFT system. Nelson thinks it's far more likely that a bank employee clicked on a link in a phishing email that allowed the thieves to download malware into the bank's computer system. Then, they monitored activity and learned the passwords and authenticators needed to access SWIFT. Nelson says the simple defense is to have a computer for payments that's not connected to the web.

Laura Sydell reports on digital culture for NPR. Thanks very much for being with us, Laura. LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE: You are welcome. SIMON: So does Apple Music steal anybody's music? SYDELL: No. No, it doesn't steal anybody's music, at least not on purpose. But there are a lot of features that could potentially go wrong with this software. For one thing, they have something called iTunes Match. So if you have something in your old collection on your computer, it finds a match on its servers. This way when you go use other devices, it will reach into its Cloud and say, oh, Laura owns that song. We can play it back from our server. This can be confusing and create problems, I think, because iTunes does go into your computer, look for these matches. And there is some possibility that there could be some kind of glitch which maybe erased some songs on this gentleman's computer by accident. But I would not say that Apple in any way would intentionally delete something on your computer. SIMON: But, I mean, if a lot of unintentional deletions occur, it's the same thing, isn't it? SYDELL: Well, (laughter) I suppose it is. I want to say that part of the issue may simply be what we're talking about when we're talking about iTunes. This is a piece of software that first came out in 2001. And it has been built upon and built upon and built upon. Initially, all it did was organize the collection, right, on your computer. And most recently, they introduced a subscription service. So this is this $10-a-month service. And this service has a different kind of music file. So when you buy the service, you can download stuff onto your computer as long as you pay the subscription. If you decide you no longer want to pay that $10 a month for Apple Music, everything you downloaded from the music service will disappear because you didn't own it. You rented it. SIMON: Is there also a generational difference in that people of a certain age figure they can buy a piece of music and it's theirs versus people of a new generation who are comfortable with the fact that they're only renting it? SYDELL: You know, I want to say yes and no (laughter). We should remember that right now, one of the things that is coming back with a vengeance, Scott, is vinyl (laughter) good old LPs. SIMON: Yeah. SYDELL: You remember those, right? You're old enough. But young people are buying them. So obviously there is some desire to own something. Yet at the same time, you have young people who've been used to going out on the Internet, going to YouTube and hearing any song they want. SIMON: What's the moral? SYDELL: (Laughter) Backup, backup, backup. You can get yourself a spare hard drive. And if you want to make sure that, you know, the music you actually purchase, say, from the iTunes store or from CDs you ripped, I would back them up on a hard drive.

The latest incarnation of the late-night TV talk show wars is being fought on a variety of fronts, most notably on YouTube and social media. Our TV critic David Bianculli says this new talk show battlefield not only is changing the content of existing shows, it's starting to create some new exciting ones. DAVID BIANCULLI, BYLINE: That late-night TV talk show wars aren't what they used to be. Success in that realm used to be measured by who got the most viewers after the late local news. For decades it was \"The Tonight Show. \" Whether it was Steve Allen, Jack Paar, Johnny Carson or for most of his run Jay Leno. But the current host of NBC's \"The Tonight Show,\" Jimmy Fallon, was one of the first to anticipate that you didn't need viewers watching you late at night, just watching any time on YouTube or social media. And viewers didn't have to watch the whole show. You just had to get buzz. And Fallon's way of doing it has been with music. He staged lip-synch battles with his guests, which eventually led to a spinoff series still running on Spike TV. He imitated rock stars, singing very improbable cover versions of songs, like the late Jim Morrison singing a soulful rendition of the theme from \"Reading Rainbow. \"(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JIMMY FALLON\")JIMMY FALLON: (Imitating Jim Morrison, singing) Butterfly in the sky, I can go twice as high. Take a look, it's in a book, a reading Rainbow, a reading Rainbow, a reading Rainbow, a reading Rainbow, yeah. BIANCULLI: And most successfully of all, he invited guests to sit down with him and his house band The Roots, and in a single take photographed by a single camera, used kindergarten musical instruments to do acoustic versions of their hit songs, as Robin Thicke did when he came by to sing a childishly charming version of \"Blurred Lines. \"(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JIMMY FALLON\")ROBIN THICKE AND JIMMY FALLON AND THE ROOTS: (Singing) If you can't hear what I'm trying to say, if you can't read from the same page,  maybe I'm going deaf, maybe I'm going blind, maybe I'm out of my mind. OK, now he was. . . BIANCULLI: There's a sense of joy in these performances. But if it's pure joy you want, nothing beats James Corden and his carpool karaoke segments on \"The Late Late Show\" on CBS. With Fallon, all you get are infectious musical performances. When Corden drives singers around town in is high-tech equipped car, photographing and recording them as they sing along with his car stereo music selections, you get fantastic performances. But you also get genuine conversation and some very, human moments. Corden's drive along 15-minute trip with Adele is the most viewed late-night TV clip in social media history - more than 102 million views and counting. And its appeal is totally understandable. The moment Adele gets into the passenger seat of his car, James Corden compliments her on her hair, which starts a very casual conversation. Then as he starts playing an Adele song on his car radio and she starts singing along, he slides in some pitch-perfect harmony. And she shoots a glance in his direction that basically says, who is this guy? Indeed. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE LATE LATE SHOW WITH JAMES CORDEN\")JAMES CORDEN: I mean, it is more manageable. . . ADELE: Yeah. . . CORDEN: . . . Than the. . . ADELE: It dries quickly also. . . CORDEN: . . . Than the hive. . . ADELE: Yeah. CORDEN: . . . You know. . . ADELE: On tour I'm just going to wear a wig. I'm going to use me hairline. And I can't work out if I should wear a wig wig or have a weave. CORDEN: I mean, what I like is that you're coming to me for this advice. (LAUGHTER)ADELE AND JAMES CORDEN: (Singing) Hello, can you hear me? I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be. It's no secret that the both of us are running out of time. ADELE: That was amazing. ADELE AND JAMES CORDEN: (Singing) So hello from the outside. . . BIANCULLI: You can't watch that clip and not smile. Just like you can't help choking up a bit watching him drive around with Stevie Wonder and saying that his wife, a huge Stevie Wonder fan, won't even believe that they're together. So James gets out his cellphone, calls his wife and hands the phone to Stevie Wonder, who improvises a one-woman serenade so sweet, it makes James cry on the spot. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE LATE LATE SHOW WITH JAMES CORDEN\")STEVIE WONDER: (Singing) I just called to say James loves you. I just called to say how much he cares. I just called (playing harmonica) to say he loves you. And he promises to me that he'll let me be on his show for an hour. (LAUGHTER)BIANCULLI: By taking his show on the road, James Corden has preserved and condensed the very essence of the TV talk show. He's onto something big. Another impressive and even earlier pioneer in the same regard has been Jerry Seinfeld, whose show on Sony's Crackle streaming site, \"Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee,\" started its eighth season next month. What talk show hosts Fallon and Corden and Jimmy Kimmel and the others are doing is finding discrete bits of their shows to present and disseminate on shared social media. What Seinfeld is doing is reducing the show to those pieces alone. It's still a talk show, a very smart and clever one, but boiled down to a very focused absolute essence. Last season, Jerry picked up Garry Shandling for a ride, and it turned out to be one of the comedian's last interviews before his death. And coincidentally, some of their conversation was about death. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"COMEDIANS IN CARS GETTING COFFEE\")JERRY SEINFELD: You know, David Brenner passed away last year. Do you ever think about, like, all that material? GARRY SHANDLING: (Laughter) I'm sorry - so I'm at a stage in my life where I actually care about the person. Here's what I thought you were going to say - did you ever realize when David Brenner died and Robin, the actual impermanence of life? I never thought God, there goes a lot of material. That's hilarious that you think that way. SEINFELD: Well, that was the hard part. BIANCULLI: It's a tender little show, and I'm certain Seinfeld feels fortunate to have captured it when he did. He and Garry are two old hands, both of them getting their big breaks doing a few minutes of standup comedy on Johnny Carson's \"Tonight Show. \"Both Seinfeld and Shandling subsequently changed TV comedy more than any of their peers with their respective sitcoms and could talk about it all these years later in ways that were both wise and funny. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"COMEDIANS IN CARS GETTING COFFEE\")SHANDLING: You know, I was an electrical engineering major at the University of Arizona, and that taught me the discipline of working out formulas and having no other life because you had to work so hard to get that stuff right.

The latest incarnation of the late-night TV talk show wars is being fought on a variety of fronts, most notably on YouTube and social media. Our TV critic David Bianculli says this new talk show battlefield not only is changing the content of existing shows, it's starting to create some new exciting ones. DAVID BIANCULLI, BYLINE: That late-night TV talk show wars aren't what they used to be. Success in that realm used to be measured by who got the most viewers after the late local news. For decades it was \"The Tonight Show. \" Whether it was Steve Allen, Jack Paar, Johnny Carson or for most of his run Jay Leno. But the current host of NBC's \"The Tonight Show,\" Jimmy Fallon, was one of the first to anticipate that you didn't need viewers watching you late at night, just watching any time on YouTube or social media. And viewers didn't have to watch the whole show. You just had to get buzz. And Fallon's way of doing it has been with music. He staged lip-synch battles with his guests, which eventually led to a spinoff series still running on Spike TV. He imitated rock stars, singing very improbable cover versions of songs, like the late Jim Morrison singing a soulful rendition of the theme from \"Reading Rainbow. \" (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JIMMY FALLON\") JIMMY FALLON: (Imitating Jim Morrison, singing) Butterfly in the sky, I can go twice as high. Take a look, it's in a book, a reading Rainbow, a reading Rainbow, a reading Rainbow, a reading Rainbow, yeah. BIANCULLI: And most successfully of all, he invited guests to sit down with him and his house band The Roots, and in a single take photographed by a single camera, used kindergarten musical instruments to do acoustic versions of their hit songs, as Robin Thicke did when he came by to sing a childishly charming version of \"Blurred Lines. \" (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JIMMY FALLON\") ROBIN THICKE AND JIMMY FALLON AND THE ROOTS: (Singing) If you can't hear what I'm trying to say, if you can't read from the same page,  maybe I'm going deaf, maybe I'm going blind, maybe I'm out of my mind. OK, now he was. . . BIANCULLI: There's a sense of joy in these performances. But if it's pure joy you want, nothing beats James Corden and his carpool karaoke segments on \"The Late Late Show\" on CBS. With Fallon, all you get are infectious musical performances. When Corden drives singers around town in is high-tech equipped car, photographing and recording them as they sing along with his car stereo music selections, you get fantastic performances. But you also get genuine conversation and some very, human moments. Corden's drive along 15-minute trip with Adele is the most viewed late-night TV clip in social media history - more than 102 million views and counting. And its appeal is totally understandable. The moment Adele gets into the passenger seat of his car, James Corden compliments her on her hair, which starts a very casual conversation. Then as he starts playing an Adele song on his car radio and she starts singing along, he slides in some pitch-perfect harmony. And she shoots a glance in his direction that basically says, who is this guy? Indeed. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE LATE LATE SHOW WITH JAMES CORDEN\") JAMES CORDEN: I mean, it is more manageable. . . ADELE: Yeah. . . CORDEN: . . . Than the. . . ADELE: It dries quickly also. . . CORDEN: . . . Than the hive. . . ADELE: Yeah. CORDEN: . . . You know. . . ADELE: On tour I'm just going to wear a wig. I'm going to use me hairline. And I can't work out if I should wear a wig wig or have a weave. CORDEN: I mean, what I like is that you're coming to me for this advice. (LAUGHTER) ADELE AND JAMES CORDEN: (Singing) Hello, can you hear me? I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be. It's no secret that the both of us are running out of time. ADELE: That was amazing. ADELE AND JAMES CORDEN: (Singing) So hello from the outside. . . BIANCULLI: You can't watch that clip and not smile. Just like you can't help choking up a bit watching him drive around with Stevie Wonder and saying that his wife, a huge Stevie Wonder fan, won't even believe that they're together. So James gets out his cellphone, calls his wife and hands the phone to Stevie Wonder, who improvises a one-woman serenade so sweet, it makes James cry on the spot. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE LATE LATE SHOW WITH JAMES CORDEN\") STEVIE WONDER: (Singing) I just called to say James loves you. I just called to say how much he cares. I just called (playing harmonica) to say he loves you. And he promises to me that he'll let me be on his show for an hour. (LAUGHTER) BIANCULLI: By taking his show on the road, James Corden has preserved and condensed the very essence of the TV talk show. He's onto something big. Another impressive and even earlier pioneer in the same regard has been Jerry Seinfeld, whose show on Sony's Crackle streaming site, \"Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee,\" started its eighth season next month. What talk show hosts Fallon and Corden and Jimmy Kimmel and the others are doing is finding discrete bits of their shows to present and disseminate on shared social media. What Seinfeld is doing is reducing the show to those pieces alone. It's still a talk show, a very smart and clever one, but boiled down to a very focused absolute essence. Last season, Jerry picked up Garry Shandling for a ride, and it turned out to be one of the comedian's last interviews before his death. And coincidentally, some of their conversation was about death. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"COMEDIANS IN CARS GETTING COFFEE\") JERRY SEINFELD: You know, David Brenner passed away last year. Do you ever think about, like, all that material? GARRY SHANDLING: (Laughter) I'm sorry - so I'm at a stage in my life where I actually care about the person. Here's what I thought you were going to say - did you ever realize when David Brenner died and Robin, the actual impermanence of life? I never thought God, there goes a lot of material. That's hilarious that you think that way. SEINFELD: Well, that was the hard part. BIANCULLI: It's a tender little show, and I'm certain Seinfeld feels fortunate to have captured it when he did. He and Garry are two old hands, both of them getting their big breaks doing a few minutes of standup comedy on Johnny Carson's \"Tonight Show. \" Both Seinfeld and Shandling subsequently changed TV comedy more than any of their peers with their respective sitcoms and could talk about it all these years later in ways that were both wise and funny. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"COMEDIANS IN CARS GETTING COFFEE\") SHANDLING: You know, I was an electrical engineering major at the University of Arizona, and that taught me the discipline of working out formulas and having no other life because you had to work so hard to get that stuff right. SEINFELD: But of course that was not as difficult as writing comedy. SHANDLING: No because there's ultimately an answer. (LAUGHTER) SHANDLING: . . . To an equation. SEINFELD: There's an answer to a joke. SHANDLING: Well, I don't think Einstein bounced it off a crowd. (LAUGHTER) BIANCULLI: I suspect that Jerry Seinfeld and James Corden, by getting away from the studio and doing something so laser-focused and enjoyable, are changing the landscape again. James Corden doesn't need \"The Late Late Show\" to keep doing carpool karaoke.

I'm Shankar Vedantam. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: My guest today is Keith Chen. He's a behavioral economist at UCLA. He's also the head of economic research at Uber, the ride-sharing company. Keith's going to talk about some of the behavioral anomalies that Uber has observed, and we're then going to talk about some of Keith's earlier work which explored the evolutionary and cultural origins of certain biases and heuristics. Keith Chen, welcome to HIDDEN BRAIN. KEITH CHEN: Thank you so much for having me. I'm a big fan of the podcast. VEDANTAM: I want to start by talking about surge-pricing. Uber charges more when demand is high based on the idea that this is going to draw more drivers into the pool and increase the supply of rides. Now, this makes perfect sense from the point of view for traditional economists, but you're a behavioral economist and you must know there's something about charging different prices for the same products that rubs customers the wrong way. They say, hey, five minutes ago this ride was 10 dollars. Now it's 20. CHEN: So as you can imagine, I hear over and over again, you know, both at my dinner table and at family gatherings. . . (LAUGHTER)CHEN: . . . That surge-pricing can feel very unfair to customers. But it's been a really integral part of Uber's success, precisely because, you know, the whole kind of goal of the company was to replace a really frustrating experience with taxi with a service that's just ultimately reliable - right? And the only way to do that, the only way to be able to get basically everyone who lives in a dense part of a city a car within five minutes was to do that through dynamic pricing, through giving drivers a very, very strong incentive to want to get to the places where they're needed the most, and also to get riders who could afford to wait a little longer - say they're at a bar - to say, well, you know, if it's more expensive to take a ride right now, go ahead and relax and sit back. If you can wait 15 minutes, the drink's on the person who's got to go now. VEDANTAM: Right (laughter). The interesting thing, Keith, is that when I think about my own behavior, when Uber tells me that the price is now 1. 8 times the regular price, I notice that and I factor that in, and there's a part of me that feels it's a little unfair. When I'm waiting for just a taxicab and now the taxicab doesn't show up, I don't actually think of someone whom I can blame or someone whom I hold responsible, even though it actually has a bigger effect on me that now I actually have to wait two hours or I can't get a cab at all. CHEN: Yeah, that's absolutely right. And, you know, this basic question of how psychologically painful kind of the experience of paying a price is is something that I worry about every day, especially because I actually think that it's one of the reasons that we've grown so fast. It's one of the reasons that we've been able to displace taxi so quickly is because in a taxi, you sit in the car and when you're trapped in traffic, you literally watch your money ticking away like in front of you. (LAUGHTER)CHEN: You're just kind of forced to watch it. There's nothing else to see except this. VEDANTAM: It's hypnotic, absolutely. CHEN: It's hypnotic and it's the worst possible psychological experience - you know? Taxis and gas pumps - right? - are the two places where you just watch your money tick away. And the typical Uber experience, you know, you just hit a button, get in the car and if it's not surging, you don't even need to know what you paid until tomorrow morning if you want to open the email. And if you kind of trust that Uber's the kind of cheapest possible of option, you don't even need to look. VEDANTAM: So you found that psychology plays a role in how surge-pricing works because there are places where it works in the way that a traditional economist would predict it would work and there are places where it breaks down. CHEN: Definitely. So just like traditional economics would predict, as you raise the price, you know, surge-pricing starts to dampen demand. You know, when you go from kind of a surge of 1X, meaning no surge, to 1. 2, you actually see a very, very large drop in demand - OK? And that initial drop in demand - actually early on when we first started surge-pricing at Uber, going from 1X to 1. 2X, you would see a 27 percentage points drop in people who would request. After sometime though, like both after a surge has been in the city for a while and after people have gotten a little used to it, that drops to 7 percent. So people start getting used to - it's not such an alien experience anymore. They may not love you - right? - at the company because of it, but they're not quite as kind of put off by it as normal. And then as you tick up the price further and further, you see further and further drops in demand - so 1. 2, 1. 3, 1. 4. You know, people like surge less and less because they understand that they're paying more. The surprising thing is there is a very, very strong round number effect which we detect. So when you go from 1. 9 to 2. 0, you see six times larger of a drop in demand than you saw from going from 1. 8 to 1. 9. So the amount more that you're paying for the trip is the same between those two steps, but 2. 0 just feels viscerally larger to people - right? It just seems a lot like - it's very easy to understand. Everyone understands I'm paying twice as much for this trip as I would have. VEDANTAM: I saw a paper that came out on National Bureau of Economic Research a couple of months ago. This is by Matthew Backus, Tom Blake and Steven Tadelis where they looked at pricing on eBay. And they found something that sounds similar, which is they found that when you price things with round numbers, those things tend to sell faster, partly because people believe that sellers who price things at round numbers aren't really wedded to those prices. . . CHEN: That's right. VEDANTAM: . . . That they basically put those prices on because they want to move something quickly. CHEN: Yeah. VEDANTAM: And therefore they're actually willing to negotiate with you because they actually don't care so much about what the actual prices is, whereas, when you pick a very specific price point. . . CHEN: Yeah. VEDANTAM: . . . People say, this couch costs 74 dollars and 26 cents - some thought must have gone into this and I don't have much room to negotiate. CHEN: (Laughter) And there is no back and forth. Where if somebody prices their couch at a hundred. . . VEDANTAM: Right. CHEN: . . . You think, well, why don't I just counter with 50? VEDANTAM: Right. CHEN: And then the conversation gets starting from there - right? VEDANTAM: Yeah. CHEN: Actually, you know, we see exactly the same thing at Uber. And I think that's the main explanation for something really, really puzzling, and that is more people will take a ride at a surge multiplier of 2. 1 than would take a ride and 2. So I described to you how between 1. 9 and 2, a lot of people stopped taking rides. If anything, people take more rides at 2. 1 than they did at 2. VEDANTAM: When it's more expensive? CHEN: When it's more expensive. It's as if they're telling you, I would rather pay you 2. 1 times the normal price than I would 2. And I think just like your intuition on negotiations on eBay, that's exactly the same intuition I think that drives the behavior here. You know, people, when you tell someone, your trip is going to be two times more than it normally costs, they think, wow, that's capricious and unfair. VEDANTAM: Someone just made that up. CHEN: Somebody just made that up. Like, you know, they must have seen it was raining and just decided to mess with me - right? Whereas if you say, oh, you know, your trip is going to be 2. 1 times more than it normally does - wow, you know, there must be some smart algorithm in the background here that's at work. It doesn't seem quite as unfair. VEDANTAM: We had the behavioral economist Richard Thaler on the podcast some time ago. And one of the thinks he was talking about is why it's often hard to find a cab on a rainy evening. And his theory is that this had something to do with what he calls mental accounting, which is the cab driver has a number in his or her head about how much money he wants to make on a given day. So the cab driver says, you know, my expenses are going to be a hundred bucks a day. I want to make a hundred dollars over that. And so when I hit 200, I go home. And on a rainy day, demand is higher, so you hit 200 faster. CHEN: Yeah. VEDANTAM: And so the cab driver goes home. And so you end up with fewer cabs with more demand. CHEN: Exactly. VEDANTAM: Now, you have done some work looking at dynamic pricing and surge pricing. And you're finding that actually that isn't the case with Uber driver. Uber drivers do not necessarily go home when it's actually a smart time to be driving. CHEN: Yeah, exactly right. I find very different results than Dick does with New York City cab drivers. And I think I understand a little bit of the psychology as to why we're finding different things. All right, so exactly as you said. If you're a New York City cab driver, you know, you're going to get the same amount for every trip no matter what. It's a regulated fare. So when it's raining, the only thing that's really changing is you're just picking up more people - right? So in that world, it does feel very salient. You know, many of them are collecting cash. You can just see, you know, once there's a pile of 200 dollars in the front seat, I'm just going to call it a day - right? Whereas, on Uber, you know, the main way that we incentivize drivers to move to the places that riders need them and to stay out a little longer if they can afford to is through surge pricing. And so I think that's - I think that's very, very salient. So if you're an Uber driver, and say you were planning to do about a two-hour shift this afternoon - you know, you're driving around but all of a sudden, unexpectedly, it starts to surge 2. 1 times - all right? Like, every trip you're going to make, you know, (laughter) - I can't believe my mind just went to 2. 1(LAUGHTER)CHEN: But, you know, you're an Uber driver, and it's surging, you're going to get twice as much. . . VEDANTAM: Right. CHEN: . . . For every additional trip you do. What I actually see in our Uber data is that even compared to yourself a week ago in exactly this situation, Uber drivers will double, triple the length of the shift that they were planning to do if it's surging 2X, if it's surging 3X. They're just going to stay out because, well, they can make a lot of money right now. You know, they can take the whole weekend off if they put in another few hours today. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: When you yourself use Uber as a rider, what is it you pay attention to? I mean, do you use your own trips as sort of research into how the company is working? You must at some level. CHEN: Oh, my god, I do all of the time. VEDANTAM: Right. CHEN: And it frustrates me because I kind of see so many kind of psychological biases in my own life. VEDANTAM: Like what? CHEN: So, for example, partially because I think it's just one of our most exciting products, I take UberPool a lot. So UberPool is this service by which now up to three passengers can share the same Uber car. And, you know, when you're in the car, you know, you can just - somebody just kind of two blocks ahead just happens to be going, you know, along the exact same route that you are, you know, will just suddenly tell your Uber driver, pull over and, you know, take in this new person. And then because that we can get people to share rides and get more people into seats, we can like reduce the price. And on average, like, UberPool can save up to 50 percent for most people's rides. VEDANTAM: Not to mention saving on gas and emissions and all the environmental issues. CHEN: Not to mention saving on gas, emissions and increases driver pay because, you know, literally now drivers can be constantly utilized. They can be constantly making money and they don't have any of that downtime of driving to someone or sitting idle somewhere. But a big part of making UberPool work is minimizing the amount of psychological frustration that people have with that experience. And so, for example, I find for myself that initially when we were writing those kind of UberPool algorithms, we took a very rational view. You know, we want to pass people the most amount of savings that we can and inconvenience them as little as possible, with inconvenience usually being kind of just really, really focused on how much time is it going to get you from your point A to your point B? One of the things that we have started to discovered is that - and that I feel very viscerally when I'm in an UberPool - is that there's something really, really psychologically painful about going backwards - right? So even if this is an amazing match for you - right? - forcing your car to kind of, you know, make three right turns and circle around the block and for a short period drive backwards - right? - drive away from your destination. . . VEDANTAM: Yeah. CHEN: . . . Is just like three times more painful than you would have expected just from the added time. VEDANTAM: Yeah. CHEN: So, you know, so we try and avoid that as much as possible. And that's something (unintelligible). VEDANTAM: You know, I feel there have been times that I miss an exit on the freeway, and you know that you have to wait, go to the next exit and then turn around and come back. And every inch of the way, as you're going to the next exit, you're reminding yourself, I'm going to have to retrace this inch. I'm going to have to retrace this inch. I made a mistake. And you really - it's true, you really beat up on yourself when you feel like you're doing something that's taking you in the wrong direction. CHEN: Yeah, I'll do crazy things, like I realized the other day that - you know, there's two airports that I can fly out of. I have to fly south and there's two airports I can fly out of. One of them is north of me and one of them is south of me. I can't bring myself to book a flight out at the airport that's north of me because I feel like I'll spend the whole drive, like, going in the wrong direction. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). One of the things I wanted to talk to you about this Uber is collecting massive amounts of information on what people are doing. And I think a lot of people don't quite realize how powerful this information is. I remember doing a story some months ago looking at some social science research, analyzing how people were using cell phones in a poor country and how the way people use their cell phones and whether they kept their cell phones topped off - so this is a country where you sort of prepay your cell phone - whether you keep your cell phone prepaid. And whether you have a lot of incoming calls or you have a lot of outgoing calls, how wide your network is - all these things can predict, with a remarkable degree of accuracy, your credit worthiness. And so if a bank sort of just looks at your cell phone usage data, it can make remarkably accurate predictions about whether you are likely to repay a loan or not repay a loan. And, I mean, who would think that just the way that you're using your cell phone could tell a bank that, you know, they should give you a loan to start a new business? And I feel like Uber has sort of similar access to vast amounts of data. I mean, there have been reports for example of, you know, so Uber broadly knows where I live and where I work because I'm often taking cabs back and forth between those two locations. But let's say one day I leave work, and instead of going home I go to another location, which is known to be the address of a bar. CHEN: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: And then a few hours later I go to another location, which is not my home address. CHEN: Sure. VEDANTAM: And then I come to work the next morning, you know, you can draw the conclusion of what I was doing that evening. And it feels like you actually know more about people's lives than perhaps they realize they are letting you know. CHEN: We do have access to a tremendous amount of data. And because of that we have kind of a privacy officer, you know, within the firm. Because of that, kind of even as an employee of the firm, I have to be very, very careful about what kinds of queries and what I look at in people's data. Yeah, precisely because this is people's lives. And you're right that, you know, we have to take very seriously this responsibility that we're becoming a big part of how people move around the world. And we just want to be very careful with that. VEDANTAM: Have you ever been concerned about the way you are using these services that might reveal things about you? I mean, as someone who sees things from the point of view of the institution of the company and knows how powerful this information is, has it changed your own behavior and how you interact with any number of these sites? CHEN: Well, now that you're talking about it, I'm getting even more worried, but. . . (LAUGHTER)CHEN: But, you know, I - and this might be naive, but I have often thought to myself that - you know, so my experience inside of large companies that have access to these huge kind of treasure troves of data is that, you know, you almost always just look at these like broad, broad aggregates. And I guess I've always just taken comfort in the fact that I'm boring enough of a person that no one would ever (laughter) - I mean, it's almost like - you know, so, for example, like, some people I know, like my sister, kind of shreds all of her credit card statements and kind of does everything before she tosses paper in the trash. And I always just throw everything in the trash because I figure, like, I just don't feel important enough for, like, someone to rummage through my trash. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). CHEN: We do though, you know, in the Uber data, see a lot of really, really interesting patterns. So, for example, a data scientist named Peter at Uber discovered somewhat accidentally this really, really kind of interesting fact. And that is one of the strongest predictors of whether or not you are going to be sensitive to surge - in other words, whether or not you are going to kind of say, oh, 2. 2, 2. 3, I'll give it a 10 to 15 minutes to see if surge goes away - is how much battery you have left on your cell phone. VEDANTAM: Oh, that's fascinating. Of course, yeah. CHEN: Yeah, like when your cell phone is like down to like below 5 percent battery and that little icon on the iPhone turns red, you know, then people start saying, well, I better get home, like, because I don't quite know how I'm going to get home otherwise. And we absolutely don't use that to kind of like push you a higher surge price, but it's an interesting kind of psychological fact of human behavior. VEDANTAM: I'm talking with Keith Chen. He's a behavioral economist at UCLA. And heads up economic research at Uber. When we come back, I'm going to ask Keith about some of his earlier work, which explores the origin of some very interesting biases. Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Keith, in your life before Uber, you conducted different experiments into the origins of various human biases, including some issues that often come up in behavioral economics. Some of your most fascinating early work was with monkeys. And I understand to conduct these experiments, you first trained the monkeys to become economic actors. CHEN: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: How did you go about doing that? CHEN: Oh my gosh, this feels like a lifetime ago. But with a bunch of colleagues at Yale University, we set out to answer this kind of somewhat ill-defined question but one that we were kind of obsessed with, which was, if monkeys were taught to use money - well, one, could monkeys be taught to use money? And two, if monkeys could be taught to use money, would they behave in the same way that humans do in all of the kind of psychologically rich ways that we interact with kind of prices and think about wealth and think about how we spend our own money? So basically what we did was, you know, we just - we had a small colony of Capuchin monkeys that were living with us at Yale. I also did some work with a colony of Tamarin monkeys back at Harvard. And my Yale students were thrilled to hear that the Yale monkeys were much smarter than the Harvard monkeys. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). CHEN: I didn't tell them it was because it was a different species. VEDANTAM: Right. CHEN: They attributed it to the school. VEDANTAM: Right (laughter). CHEN: But basically what you do to teach a monkey to use money is you hire a bunch of Yale undergrads to basically just live with the monkeys for a long time. So, you know, these Yale undergraduates were typically psychology majors. They were studying the monkeys for various other things. You know, the monkeys live in a big, spacious, comfortable habitat. You know, they typically ignore the kind of humans that are moving around. But you'd have a Yale undergraduate every now and then just drop a coin on the floor - OK? And we had chose these kind of large, metal washers to kind of stand in for a coin. Now, a monkey thinks that's fascinating, runs over, grabs the coin, kind of chews on it, like, you know, bangs it on the floor, every now and then would throw it around, kind of almost a little dangerously, but would eventually kind of lose interest in this metal disc. Then you'd have the Yale undergraduates stand there and stare at the monkey with an open hand outstretched - OK? - and just stare at that monkey uncomfortably, just kind of setting this uncomfortable situation. And every now and then, the monkey would actually pick up the coin and just put it in the undergraduates' hand, like give it back to the student. And what we did was we trained the students to say, why thank you in a really exaggerated tones and then like hand the monkey a piece of food - OK? - so like a little apple slice. One undergraduate came to be known to the monkeys as like the apple undergraduate. If you gave that person a coin, they would always, like, hand you an apple slice. Another person was the pineapple undergraduate. And another person was the orange slice undergraduate. Now, what's amazing is you do this for about six months - all right? - nonstop for about six months. And eventually you start to realize that the monkeys understand that this is Fiat money - right? Now, what does that mean? Well, what that means is, you know, the monkeys had been very familiar with, like, basic ideas, like there's a lever on the wall. If I pull this lever, an apple slice falls from the ceiling. But money is something fundamentally different. When I find this coin - all right? - it's not just an apple lever. It's actually a choice between an apple lever, an orange lever, and a pineapple lever because I can take this coin, I can carry it around with me, and I can wait until the - if I feel like having an apple, I've got to run over to the apple person and I can spend it there - right? Money is kind of fungible across different kinds of food that I can purchase. So we started to see that. We saw that monkeys started to use these with each other, and to save them, to kind of hide them from other monkeys and then to make very, very rational decisions, rational-looking decisions. When the price of apple doubled, you know, when that apple undergraduate started only giving one piece of apple, not two, when you handed him a coin, you know, demand for apples went down and demand for oranges and for pineapples went up. VEDANTAM: How did the monkeys protect their money? CHEN: A fascinating component of the monkeys starting to understand money was that they displayed signs that they realized not only that they understood the value of this disc but that they understood other monkeys recognized the value of this disc. So, for example, you know, early on when the money that we were using was these physical disks, it's a little bit hard to shield from other monkeys - right? And you don't want to be kind of carrying all of these things around. So you would see monkeys, like, hide the discs, like, you know, over in the corner, under a pile of, like, wood shavings - right? They'd kind of hide the discs. Later, actually, we taught these monkeys to use touchpads. And so, like, then kind of in some sense, like, monkeys learned, you know, to use currency as if it's just kind of an ATM, as if it just gets, like, Venmoed or transferred to other players, to the apple guy. . . VEDANTAM: So this is like an Apple wallet basically? CHEN: Yeah, basically. They are ahead of us on this dimension. You know, they are a completely cashless economy at this point. VEDANTAM: You eventually got to the point where you would also introduce to the monkeys the idea that sometimes when they would give a certain amount of money to an experimenter, the experimenter might give the monkey three things. And sometimes the experimenter might give the monkey one thing. So in other words, it was unpredictable what the reward was going to be. You taught the monkeys to gamble. CHEN: Yeah, that's basically exactly what we did. So we introduced them to two new undergraduates. So one undergraduate would always approach a monkey with three pieces of apple in their outstretched hand. Let's call this undergraduate Adam - OK? - would show three, and either give over all three or would it take two back and would only give one. Then we introduced him to another undergraduate, Ben, - all right? - who always showed one - OK? But if you gave Ben a coin, Ben would half the time hand over just that one, half the time would add two apple pieces to his hand and hand over three - all right? So now the fascinating thing is both Adam and Ben are presenting you exactly the same deal. They are a 50-50 gamble between three apple pieces and one apple piece - right? And you can give the monkeys  a lot of experience trading only with Adam and a lot of experience training only with Ben. So they kind of get that this is a 50-50 gamble. The interesting thing is what the monkeys showed us through their preferences between Adam and Ben is that they experience something just like humans do. And that's this very powerful psychological force called loss aversion - all right? And that's the idea that it's more than twice as painful to experience a loss than it is to experience a similar sized gain - right? Now, what does that have to do with Adam and Ben? Well, Adam half the time gives you, in some sense, what he's shown - right? - the three apple pieces. But half the time he delivers you a loss. He takes away two and then hands over only one - all right? So half the time, he delivers you a loss of two. Ben half the time just hands you the one that he is showing you and half the time delivers you a gain. He gives - he puts an extra two pieces of apple there and hands you an extra two apple pieces. What we find is that when given the choice between Adam and Ben, monkeys vastly prefer Ben, - all right? - the guy who initially only shows one apple piece but half the time gives you a gain, than they preferred Adam, who initially shows you three apple pieces and then half the time delivers you a loss. They - you know, 6 to 1 preferred trading with Ben to Adam. And that's fascinating because that cuts against their very, very core instinct, which is, well, if I have got a coin, why don't I go trade it with the guy who is showing me three instead of the guy who is showing me one - right? Like every kind of fiber in their body tells them that they should be going for more food, not less. And yet because of loss aversion and because they actually feel this very viscerally in the same way that people do, they actually prefer the guy who promises less but delivers more. VEDANTAM: I have to say that I am thinking about what I would do in that situation. And I have to say I'm clearly no smarter than a monkey because I would definitely prefer to trade with Ben because you are getting something that seems like it's a surprise. It's a gift. It's like - it's wonderful. It's unexpected. It's happy. And at the worst it's only going to be what he's promised you in the first place. But with Adam, he's taking away something that you thought was yours. CHEN: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And interestingly, we see in our Uber data this loss aversion at work as well. And you can even just feel it psychologically. Like when you are a rider and, you know, surge pricing hits, like that's a loss - right? And that feels very, very bad. We have often been asked, well, why didn't you frame surge pricing as discounts instead of as - instead of surcharges? Why isn't Uber's standard price twice as high as it is and then most of the time you're getting a discount - right? Why not kind of frame it that way? VEDANTAM: Because behavioral economics would predict that you would actually make people much happier if you did it that way. CHEN: Well, behavioral economics would predict that you would make riders happier if you did that. I mean, the critical thing to notice is that we are a two-sided market. That move, which would make riders happier, would also make drivers feel less well. So, I mean, so we had thought for a while, why not just frame Uber's pricing as how much cheaper we are than a taxi? Because in many major cities in the United States, we're up to 60 percent cheaper than taxi fares when we're not surging. And, you know, what that means is that, you know, you can surge like 2. 1 and still be coming basically out even if you had instead just taken a taxi. But even though because Uber drivers are in such an efficient system, they constantly have a paying rider in the back of the car, they are actually making more than they would have if they had been working as a taxi driver, framing this to them - oh, you're making 60 percent less per mile than you would if you were driving a taxi, that's - that would be a cost of this pricing system.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: My guest today is Keith Chen. He's a behavioral economist at UCLA. He's also the head of economic research at Uber, the ride-sharing company. Keith's going to talk about some of the behavioral anomalies that Uber has observed, and we're then going to talk about some of Keith's earlier work which explored the evolutionary and cultural origins of certain biases and heuristics. Keith Chen, welcome to HIDDEN BRAIN. KEITH CHEN: Thank you so much for having me. I'm a big fan of the podcast. VEDANTAM: I want to start by talking about surge-pricing. Uber charges more when demand is high based on the idea that this is going to draw more drivers into the pool and increase the supply of rides. Now, this makes perfect sense from the point of view for traditional economists, but you're a behavioral economist and you must know there's something about charging different prices for the same products that rubs customers the wrong way. They say, hey, five minutes ago this ride was 10 dollars. Now it's 20. CHEN: So as you can imagine, I hear over and over again, you know, both at my dinner table and at family gatherings. . . (LAUGHTER) CHEN: . . . That surge-pricing can feel very unfair to customers. But it's been a really integral part of Uber's success, precisely because, you know, the whole kind of goal of the company was to replace a really frustrating experience with taxi with a service that's just ultimately reliable - right? And the only way to do that, the only way to be able to get basically everyone who lives in a dense part of a city a car within five minutes was to do that through dynamic pricing, through giving drivers a very, very strong incentive to want to get to the places where they're needed the most, and also to get riders who could afford to wait a little longer - say they're at a bar - to say, well, you know, if it's more expensive to take a ride right now, go ahead and relax and sit back. If you can wait 15 minutes, the drink's on the person who's got to go now. VEDANTAM: Right (laughter). The interesting thing, Keith, is that when I think about my own behavior, when Uber tells me that the price is now 1. 8 times the regular price, I notice that and I factor that in, and there's a part of me that feels it's a little unfair. When I'm waiting for just a taxicab and now the taxicab doesn't show up, I don't actually think of someone whom I can blame or someone whom I hold responsible, even though it actually has a bigger effect on me that now I actually have to wait two hours or I can't get a cab at all. CHEN: Yeah, that's absolutely right. And, you know, this basic question of how psychologically painful kind of the experience of paying a price is is something that I worry about every day, especially because I actually think that it's one of the reasons that we've grown so fast. It's one of the reasons that we've been able to displace taxi so quickly is because in a taxi, you sit in the car and when you're trapped in traffic, you literally watch your money ticking away like in front of you. (LAUGHTER) CHEN: You're just kind of forced to watch it. There's nothing else to see except this. VEDANTAM: It's hypnotic, absolutely. CHEN: It's hypnotic and it's the worst possible psychological experience - you know? Taxis and gas pumps - right? - are the two places where you just watch your money tick away. And the typical Uber experience, you know, you just hit a button, get in the car and if it's not surging, you don't even need to know what you paid until tomorrow morning if you want to open the email. And if you kind of trust that Uber's the kind of cheapest possible of option, you don't even need to look. VEDANTAM: So you found that psychology plays a role in how surge-pricing works because there are places where it works in the way that a traditional economist would predict it would work and there are places where it breaks down. CHEN: Definitely. So just like traditional economics would predict, as you raise the price, you know, surge-pricing starts to dampen demand. You know, when you go from kind of a surge of 1X, meaning no surge, to 1. 2, you actually see a very, very large drop in demand - OK? And that initial drop in demand - actually early on when we first started surge-pricing at Uber, going from 1X to 1. 2X, you would see a 27 percentage points drop in people who would request. After sometime though, like both after a surge has been in the city for a while and after people have gotten a little used to it, that drops to 7 percent. So people start getting used to - it's not such an alien experience anymore. They may not love you - right? - at the company because of it, but they're not quite as kind of put off by it as normal. And then as you tick up the price further and further, you see further and further drops in demand - so 1. 2, 1. 3, 1. 4. You know, people like surge less and less because they understand that they're paying more. The surprising thing is there is a very, very strong round number effect which we detect. So when you go from 1. 9 to 2. 0, you see six times larger of a drop in demand than you saw from going from 1. 8 to 1. 9. So the amount more that you're paying for the trip is the same between those two steps, but 2. 0 just feels viscerally larger to people - right? It just seems a lot like - it's very easy to understand. Everyone understands I'm paying twice as much for this trip as I would have. VEDANTAM: I saw a paper that came out on National Bureau of Economic Research a couple of months ago. This is by Matthew Backus, Tom Blake and Steven Tadelis where they looked at pricing on eBay. And they found something that sounds similar, which is they found that when you price things with round numbers, those things tend to sell faster, partly because people believe that sellers who price things at round numbers aren't really wedded to those prices. . . CHEN: That's right. VEDANTAM: . . . That they basically put those prices on because they want to move something quickly. CHEN: Yeah. VEDANTAM: And therefore they're actually willing to negotiate with you because they actually don't care so much about what the actual prices is, whereas, when you pick a very specific price point. . . CHEN: Yeah. VEDANTAM: . . . People say, this couch costs 74 dollars and 26 cents - some thought must have gone into this and I don't have much room to negotiate. CHEN: (Laughter) And there is no back and forth. Where if somebody prices their couch at a hundred. . . VEDANTAM: Right. CHEN: . . . You think, well, why don't I just counter with 50? VEDANTAM: Right. CHEN: And then the conversation gets starting from there - right? VEDANTAM: Yeah. CHEN: Actually, you know, we see exactly the same thing at Uber. And I think that's the main explanation for something really, really puzzling, and that is more people will take a ride at a surge multiplier of 2. 1 than would take a ride and 2. So I described to you how between 1. 9 and 2, a lot of people stopped taking rides. If anything, people take more rides at 2. 1 than they did at 2. VEDANTAM: When it's more expensive? CHEN: When it's more expensive. It's as if they're telling you, I would rather pay you 2. 1 times the normal price than I would 2. And I think just like your intuition on negotiations on eBay, that's exactly the same intuition I think that drives the behavior here. You know, people, when you tell someone, your trip is going to be two times more than it normally costs, they think, wow, that's capricious and unfair. VEDANTAM: Someone just made that up. CHEN: Somebody just made that up. Like, you know, they must have seen it was raining and just decided to mess with me - right? Whereas if you say, oh, you know, your trip is going to be 2. 1 times more than it normally does - wow, you know, there must be some smart algorithm in the background here that's at work. It doesn't seem quite as unfair. VEDANTAM: We had the behavioral economist Richard Thaler on the podcast some time ago. And one of the thinks he was talking about is why it's often hard to find a cab on a rainy evening. And his theory is that this had something to do with what he calls mental accounting, which is the cab driver has a number in his or her head about how much money he wants to make on a given day. So the cab driver says, you know, my expenses are going to be a hundred bucks a day. I want to make a hundred dollars over that. And so when I hit 200, I go home. And on a rainy day, demand is higher, so you hit 200 faster. CHEN: Yeah. VEDANTAM: And so the cab driver goes home. And so you end up with fewer cabs with more demand. CHEN: Exactly. VEDANTAM: Now, you have done some work looking at dynamic pricing and surge pricing. And you're finding that actually that isn't the case with Uber driver. Uber drivers do not necessarily go home when it's actually a smart time to be driving. CHEN: Yeah, exactly right. I find very different results than Dick does with New York City cab drivers. And I think I understand a little bit of the psychology as to why we're finding different things. All right, so exactly as you said. If you're a New York City cab driver, you know, you're going to get the same amount for every trip no matter what. It's a regulated fare. So when it's raining, the only thing that's really changing is you're just picking up more people - right? So in that world, it does feel very salient. You know, many of them are collecting cash. You can just see, you know, once there's a pile of 200 dollars in the front seat, I'm just going to call it a day - right? Whereas, on Uber, you know, the main way that we incentivize drivers to move to the places that riders need them and to stay out a little longer if they can afford to is through surge pricing. And so I think that's - I think that's very, very salient. So if you're an Uber driver, and say you were planning to do about a two-hour shift this afternoon - you know, you're driving around but all of a sudden, unexpectedly, it starts to surge 2. 1 times - all right? Like, every trip you're going to make, you know, (laughter) - I can't believe my mind just went to 2. 1 (LAUGHTER) CHEN: But, you know, you're an Uber driver, and it's surging, you're going to get twice as much. . . VEDANTAM: Right. CHEN: . . . For every additional trip you do. What I actually see in our Uber data is that even compared to yourself a week ago in exactly this situation, Uber drivers will double, triple the length of the shift that they were planning to do if it's surging 2X, if it's surging 3X. They're just going to stay out because, well, they can make a lot of money right now. You know, they can take the whole weekend off if they put in another few hours today. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: When you yourself use Uber as a rider, what is it you pay attention to? I mean, do you use your own trips as sort of research into how the company is working? You must at some level. CHEN: Oh, my god, I do all of the time. VEDANTAM: Right. CHEN: And it frustrates me because I kind of see so many kind of psychological biases in my own life. VEDANTAM: Like what? CHEN: So, for example, partially because I think it's just one of our most exciting products, I take UberPool a lot. So UberPool is this service by which now up to three passengers can share the same Uber car. And, you know, when you're in the car, you know, you can just - somebody just kind of two blocks ahead just happens to be going, you know, along the exact same route that you are, you know, will just suddenly tell your Uber driver, pull over and, you know, take in this new person. And then because that we can get people to share rides and get more people into seats, we can like reduce the price. And on average, like, UberPool can save up to 50 percent for most people's rides. VEDANTAM: Not to mention saving on gas and emissions and all the environmental issues. CHEN: Not to mention saving on gas, emissions and increases driver pay because, you know, literally now drivers can be constantly utilized. They can be constantly making money and they don't have any of that downtime of driving to someone or sitting idle somewhere. But a big part of making UberPool work is minimizing the amount of psychological frustration that people have with that experience. And so, for example, I find for myself that initially when we were writing those kind of UberPool algorithms, we took a very rational view. You know, we want to pass people the most amount of savings that we can and inconvenience them as little as possible, with inconvenience usually being kind of just really, really focused on how much time is it going to get you from your point A to your point B? One of the things that we have started to discovered is that - and that I feel very viscerally when I'm in an UberPool - is that there's something really, really psychologically painful about going backwards - right? So even if this is an amazing match for you - right? - forcing your car to kind of, you know, make three right turns and circle around the block and for a short period drive backwards - right? - drive away from your destination. . . VEDANTAM: Yeah. CHEN: . . . Is just like three times more painful than you would have expected just from the added time. VEDANTAM: Yeah. CHEN: So, you know, so we try and avoid that as much as possible. And that's something (unintelligible). VEDANTAM: You know, I feel there have been times that I miss an exit on the freeway, and you know that you have to wait, go to the next exit and then turn around and come back. And every inch of the way, as you're going to the next exit, you're reminding yourself, I'm going to have to retrace this inch. I'm going to have to retrace this inch. I made a mistake. And you really - it's true, you really beat up on yourself when you feel like you're doing something that's taking you in the wrong direction. CHEN: Yeah, I'll do crazy things, like I realized the other day that - you know, there's two airports that I can fly out of. I have to fly south and there's two airports I can fly out of. One of them is north of me and one of them is south of me. I can't bring myself to book a flight out at the airport that's north of me because I feel like I'll spend the whole drive, like, going in the wrong direction. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). One of the things I wanted to talk to you about this Uber is collecting massive amounts of information on what people are doing. And I think a lot of people don't quite realize how powerful this information is. I remember doing a story some months ago looking at some social science research, analyzing how people were using cell phones in a poor country and how the way people use their cell phones and whether they kept their cell phones topped off - so this is a country where you sort of prepay your cell phone - whether you keep your cell phone prepaid. And whether you have a lot of incoming calls or you have a lot of outgoing calls, how wide your network is - all these things can predict, with a remarkable degree of accuracy, your credit worthiness. And so if a bank sort of just looks at your cell phone usage data, it can make remarkably accurate predictions about whether you are likely to repay a loan or not repay a loan. And, I mean, who would think that just the way that you're using your cell phone could tell a bank that, you know, they should give you a loan to start a new business? And I feel like Uber has sort of similar access to vast amounts of data. I mean, there have been reports for example of, you know, so Uber broadly knows where I live and where I work because I'm often taking cabs back and forth between those two locations. But let's say one day I leave work, and instead of going home I go to another location, which is known to be the address of a bar. CHEN: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: And then a few hours later I go to another location, which is not my home address. CHEN: Sure. VEDANTAM: And then I come to work the next morning, you know, you can draw the conclusion of what I was doing that evening. And it feels like you actually know more about people's lives than perhaps they realize they are letting you know. CHEN: We do have access to a tremendous amount of data. And because of that we have kind of a privacy officer, you know, within the firm. Because of that, kind of even as an employee of the firm, I have to be very, very careful about what kinds of queries and what I look at in people's data. Yeah, precisely because this is people's lives. And you're right that, you know, we have to take very seriously this responsibility that we're becoming a big part of how people move around the world. And we just want to be very careful with that. VEDANTAM: Have you ever been concerned about the way you are using these services that might reveal things about you? I mean, as someone who sees things from the point of view of the institution of the company and knows how powerful this information is, has it changed your own behavior and how you interact with any number of these sites? CHEN: Well, now that you're talking about it, I'm getting even more worried, but. . . (LAUGHTER) CHEN: But, you know, I - and this might be naive, but I have often thought to myself that - you know, so my experience inside of large companies that have access to these huge kind of treasure troves of data is that, you know, you almost always just look at these like broad, broad aggregates. And I guess I've always just taken comfort in the fact that I'm boring enough of a person that no one would ever (laughter) - I mean, it's almost like - you know, so, for example, like, some people I know, like my sister, kind of shreds all of her credit card statements and kind of does everything before she tosses paper in the trash. And I always just throw everything in the trash because I figure, like, I just don't feel important enough for, like, someone to rummage through my trash. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). CHEN: We do though, you know, in the Uber data, see a lot of really, really interesting patterns. So, for example, a data scientist named Peter at Uber discovered somewhat accidentally this really, really kind of interesting fact. And that is one of the strongest predictors of whether or not you are going to be sensitive to surge - in other words, whether or not you are going to kind of say, oh, 2. 2, 2. 3, I'll give it a 10 to 15 minutes to see if surge goes away - is how much battery you have left on your cell phone. VEDANTAM: Oh, that's fascinating. Of course, yeah. CHEN: Yeah, like when your cell phone is like down to like below 5 percent battery and that little icon on the iPhone turns red, you know, then people start saying, well, I better get home, like, because I don't quite know how I'm going to get home otherwise. And we absolutely don't use that to kind of like push you a higher surge price, but it's an interesting kind of psychological fact of human behavior. VEDANTAM: I'm talking with Keith Chen. He's a behavioral economist at UCLA. And heads up economic research at Uber. When we come back, I'm going to ask Keith about some of his earlier work, which explores the origin of some very interesting biases. Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Keith, in your life before Uber, you conducted different experiments into the origins of various human biases, including some issues that often come up in behavioral economics. Some of your most fascinating early work was with monkeys. And I understand to conduct these experiments, you first trained the monkeys to become economic actors. CHEN: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: How did you go about doing that? CHEN: Oh my gosh, this feels like a lifetime ago. But with a bunch of colleagues at Yale University, we set out to answer this kind of somewhat ill-defined question but one that we were kind of obsessed with, which was, if monkeys were taught to use money - well, one, could monkeys be taught to use money? And two, if monkeys could be taught to use money, would they behave in the same way that humans do in all of the kind of psychologically rich ways that we interact with kind of prices and think about wealth and think about how we spend our own money? So basically what we did was, you know, we just - we had a small colony of Capuchin monkeys that were living with us at Yale. I also did some work with a colony of Tamarin monkeys back at Harvard. And my Yale students were thrilled to hear that the Yale monkeys were much smarter than the Harvard monkeys. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). CHEN: I didn't tell them it was because it was a different species. VEDANTAM: Right. CHEN: They attributed it to the school. VEDANTAM: Right (laughter). CHEN: But basically what you do to teach a monkey to use money is you hire a bunch of Yale undergrads to basically just live with the monkeys for a long time. So, you know, these Yale undergraduates were typically psychology majors. They were studying the monkeys for various other things. You know, the monkeys live in a big, spacious, comfortable habitat. You know, they typically ignore the kind of humans that are moving around. But you'd have a Yale undergraduate every now and then just drop a coin on the floor - OK? And we had chose these kind of large, metal washers to kind of stand in for a coin. Now, a monkey thinks that's fascinating, runs over, grabs the coin, kind of chews on it, like, you know, bangs it on the floor, every now and then would throw it around, kind of almost a little dangerously, but would eventually kind of lose interest in this metal disc. Then you'd have the Yale undergraduates stand there and stare at the monkey with an open hand outstretched - OK? - and just stare at that monkey uncomfortably, just kind of setting this uncomfortable situation. And every now and then, the monkey would actually pick up the coin and just put it in the undergraduates' hand, like give it back to the student. And what we did was we trained the students to say, why thank you in a really exaggerated tones and then like hand the monkey a piece of food - OK? - so like a little apple slice. One undergraduate came to be known to the monkeys as like the apple undergraduate. If you gave that person a coin, they would always, like, hand you an apple slice. Another person was the pineapple undergraduate. And another person was the orange slice undergraduate. Now, what's amazing is you do this for about six months - all right? - nonstop for about six months. And eventually you start to realize that the monkeys understand that this is Fiat money - right? Now, what does that mean? Well, what that means is, you know, the monkeys had been very familiar with, like, basic ideas, like there's a lever on the wall. If I pull this lever, an apple slice falls from the ceiling. But money is something fundamentally different. When I find this coin - all right? - it's not just an apple lever. It's actually a choice between an apple lever, an orange lever, and a pineapple lever because I can take this coin, I can carry it around with me, and I can wait until the - if I feel like having an apple, I've got to run over to the apple person and I can spend it there - right? Money is kind of fungible across different kinds of food that I can purchase. So we started to see that. We saw that monkeys started to use these with each other, and to save them, to kind of hide them from other monkeys and then to make very, very rational decisions, rational-looking decisions. When the price of apple doubled, you know, when that apple undergraduate started only giving one piece of apple, not two, when you handed him a coin, you know, demand for apples went down and demand for oranges and for pineapples went up. VEDANTAM: How did the monkeys protect their money? CHEN: A fascinating component of the monkeys starting to understand money was that they displayed signs that they realized not only that they understood the value of this disc but that they understood other monkeys recognized the value of this disc. So, for example, you know, early on when the money that we were using was these physical disks, it's a little bit hard to shield from other monkeys - right? And you don't want to be kind of carrying all of these things around. So you would see monkeys, like, hide the discs, like, you know, over in the corner, under a pile of, like, wood shavings - right? They'd kind of hide the discs. Later, actually, we taught these monkeys to use touchpads. And so, like, then kind of in some sense, like, monkeys learned, you know, to use currency as if it's just kind of an ATM, as if it just gets, like, Venmoed or transferred to other players, to the apple guy. . . VEDANTAM: So this is like an Apple wallet basically? CHEN: Yeah, basically. They are ahead of us on this dimension. You know, they are a completely cashless economy at this point. VEDANTAM: You eventually got to the point where you would also introduce to the monkeys the idea that sometimes when they would give a certain amount of money to an experimenter, the experimenter might give the monkey three things. And sometimes the experimenter might give the monkey one thing. So in other words, it was unpredictable what the reward was going to be. You taught the monkeys to gamble. CHEN: Yeah, that's basically exactly what we did. So we introduced them to two new undergraduates. So one undergraduate would always approach a monkey with three pieces of apple in their outstretched hand. Let's call this undergraduate Adam - OK? - would show three, and either give over all three or would it take two back and would only give one. Then we introduced him to another undergraduate, Ben, - all right? - who always showed one - OK? But if you gave Ben a coin, Ben would half the time hand over just that one, half the time would add two apple pieces to his hand and hand over three - all right? So now the fascinating thing is both Adam and Ben are presenting you exactly the same deal. They are a 50-50 gamble between three apple pieces and one apple piece - right? And you can give the monkeys  a lot of experience trading only with Adam and a lot of experience training only with Ben. So they kind of get that this is a 50-50 gamble. The interesting thing is what the monkeys showed us through their preferences between Adam and Ben is that they experience something just like humans do. And that's this very powerful psychological force called loss aversion - all right? And that's the idea that it's more than twice as painful to experience a loss than it is to experience a similar sized gain - right? Now, what does that have to do with Adam and Ben? Well, Adam half the time gives you, in some sense, what he's shown - right? - the three apple pieces. But half the time he delivers you a loss. He takes away two and then hands over only one - all right? So half the time, he delivers you a loss of two. Ben half the time just hands you the one that he is showing you and half the time delivers you a gain. He gives - he puts an extra two pieces of apple there and hands you an extra two apple pieces. What we find is that when given the choice between Adam and Ben, monkeys vastly prefer Ben, - all right? - the guy who initially only shows one apple piece but half the time gives you a gain, than they preferred Adam, who initially shows you three apple pieces and then half the time delivers you a loss. They - you know, 6 to 1 preferred trading with Ben to Adam. And that's fascinating because that cuts against their very, very core instinct, which is, well, if I have got a coin, why don't I go trade it with the guy who is showing me three instead of the guy who is showing me one - right? Like every kind of fiber in their body tells them that they should be going for more food, not less. And yet because of loss aversion and because they actually feel this very viscerally in the same way that people do, they actually prefer the guy who promises less but delivers more. VEDANTAM: I have to say that I am thinking about what I would do in that situation. And I have to say I'm clearly no smarter than a monkey because I would definitely prefer to trade with Ben because you are getting something that seems like it's a surprise. It's a gift. It's like - it's wonderful. It's unexpected. It's happy. And at the worst it's only going to be what he's promised you in the first place. But with Adam, he's taking away something that you thought was yours. CHEN: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And interestingly, we see in our Uber data this loss aversion at work as well. And you can even just feel it psychologically. Like when you are a rider and, you know, surge pricing hits, like that's a loss - right? And that feels very, very bad. We have often been asked, well, why didn't you frame surge pricing as discounts instead of as - instead of surcharges? Why isn't Uber's standard price twice as high as it is and then most of the time you're getting a discount - right? Why not kind of frame it that way? VEDANTAM: Because behavioral economics would predict that you would actually make people much happier if you did it that way. CHEN: Well, behavioral economics would predict that you would make riders happier if you did that. I mean, the critical thing to notice is that we are a two-sided market. That move, which would make riders happier, would also make drivers feel less well. So, I mean, so we had thought for a while, why not just frame Uber's pricing as how much cheaper we are than a taxi? Because in many major cities in the United States, we're up to 60 percent cheaper than taxi fares when we're not surging. And, you know, what that means is that, you know, you can surge like 2. 1 and still be coming basically out even if you had instead just taken a taxi. But even though because Uber drivers are in such an efficient system, they constantly have a paying rider in the back of the car, they are actually making more than they would have if they had been working as a taxi driver, framing this to them - oh, you're making 60 percent less per mile than you would if you were driving a taxi, that's - that would be a cost of this pricing system.

Or maybe it's something you look at in an art gallery. Well, that's the kind of design Joe Gebbia wanted to do in high school. JOE GEBBIA: I had this dream to be a painter, of all things. RAZ: Like fine art painting? GEBBIA: Yeah, like fine art painting. I had this dream to be a fine artist, you know, creating work in New York City and having gallery shows. And that was the life that I imagined for myself. RAZ: And Joe's dreams of being a fine artist took him to the Rhode Island School of Design. GEBBIA: Yeah, I was another kid doing design at RISD kind of learning my way, you know, making a lot of mistakes. And there was a very important principle that I learned at RISD, which was that anytime you see duct tape in the world, that's a design opportunity. RAZ: Hmm. Why? GEBBIA: Why? Because it's an indicator that something's broken - that something didn't perform the way that it was designed to, and that there's an opportunity to improve it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: So OK, fast forward a couple of years. Joe's painting career hadn't exactly worked out. But he got his own duct tape opportunity. And at the time, he was living in San Francisco, going through a pretty rough time, financially. Here's Joe on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)GEBBIA: I'm unemployed. I'm almost broke. My roommate moves out, and then the rent goes up. And then I learned there's a design conference coming to town, and all the hotels are sold out. So here's what I pitch my best friend and my new roommate Brian Chesky. Brian thought of a way to make a few bucks turning our place into designer's bed-and-breakfast, offering designers who come to town a place to crash, complete with wireless Internet, a small desk space, sleeping mat and breakfast each morning. Ha. (LAUGHTER)GEBBIA: We built a basic website, and Air Bed and Breakfast was born. Three lucky guests got to stay on a $20 airbed on the hardwood floor. But they loved it. And so did we. We took them on adventures around the city. And when we said goodbye to the last guest, the door latch clicked. Brian and I just stared at each other. Did we just discover it was possible to make friends while also making rent? The wheels had started to turn. My old roommate Nate Blecharczyk joined as engineering co-founder. And we buckled down to see if we could turn this into a business. Here's what we pitched investors. We want to build a website where people publicly post pictures of their most intimate spaces - their bedrooms, the bathrooms - the kinds of rooms you usually keep closed when people come over. And then over the Internet, they're going to invite complete strangers to come sleep in their homes. It's going to be huge. (LAUGHTER)GEBBIA: We sat back and we waited for the rocket ship to blast off. It did not. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: OK, if it's not clear by now, Joe Gebbia is one of the co-founders of Airbnb, a company literally changing the world of travel and lodging. Seven hundred fifty thousand people stay in an Airbnb-listed room every single night. And Joe says design is the key to their success - design not in a sense of a piece of art, where the goal is to make you feel a certain way about a painting or an object. But Joe's design is about making you feel a certain way about someone. But the idea that that was even possible was a hard sell back in 2008. And Joe and his co-founder Brian Chesky struggled to get investors interested in their idea. GEBBIA: We thought it was going to be huge, but then investors didn't quite think that. And we found that out the hard way. You know, we got introduced to 20 people in Silicon Valley. These are kind of the who's who. Ten returned our email. Five met us for coffee. Zero invested in Airbnb. RAZ: So you're, like, totally deflated. You guys have this, like, great idea, and nobody's interested in investing. Why? Why weren't they interested? GEBBIA: Well, I think that we came smack up against one of the deepest biases that we have - is that, you know, we've all been taught since we were kids that strangers equal danger. And so no one in their right minds would invest in a service that was all about letting strangers into people's homes. I mean, it kind of made sense that they didn't invest - right? - based on this deeply rooted bias that we've been taught since we were kids. RAZ: Yeah. GEBBIA: So we had a real problem on our hands. We had to not only get people to adopt our service, but to do so, we had to overcome a social bias in the world. And that's where design came into the picture. And I guess to me, like, design as a competitive advantage is the thing that can separate you because it used to be about processor speed and screen size and, like, all these kind of features. But, you know, the playing field for access to that kind - those kinds of technologies has largely leveled off. So what is the next thing that can differentiate you? And I think all things being equal - two comparable products side-by-side with the same technical features and components - you know, you'd be crazy to choose the one that was harder to use. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: That's Joe Gebbia. When we come back in just a minute, Joe explains how Airbnb's design decisions not only made their service easy to use, but also how it helped millions of complete strangers trust each other. I'm Guy Raz. More ideas about design in just a minute on the TED Radio Hour from NPR. RAZ: It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today - ideas about the power of design. And we were just hearing from Joe Gebbia. He's one of the founders of Airbnb. Joe was never a software designer by training. He'd actually gone to art school. He wanted to be a painter, which is why early on in the birth of Airbnb, he and his partners had an inkling that design could be their secret sauce - that millions of people would be more than happy to open their homes to complete strangers if Joe and his team could design their service to encourage trust. Here's Joe on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)GEBBIA: In art school, you learn that design is much more than the look and feel of something. It's the whole experience. And we wanted to do that for objects. But here we were aiming to build Olympic trust between people who had never met. Could design make that happen? Is it possible to design for trust? I want to give you a sense of the flavor of trust that we were aiming to achieve. I need you to take out your phones. Now that you have your phone out, I'd like you to unlock your phone. Now hand your unlocked phone to the person on your left. (LAUGHTER)GEBBIA: That tiny sense of panic you're feeling right now. . . (LAUGHTER)GEBBIA: . . . Is exactly how hosts feel the first time they open their home. . . (LAUGHTER)GEBBIA: . . . Because the only thing more personal than your phone is your home. People don't just see your messages. They see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet. Now, what if we changed one small thing about the design of that experiment? What if your neighbor had introduced themselves first with their name, where they're from, the name of their kids or their dog? Imagine that they had 150 reviews of people saying they're great at holding unlocked phones. (LAUGHTER)GEBBIA: Now how would you feel about handing your phone over? It turns out - a well-designed reputation system is key for building trust. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: So how did you do that? Like, how did you design a system that allowed people to trust each other? GEBBIA: I guess to me, like, we wanted our service to be as welcoming as our living room was. RAZ: Yeah. GEBBIA: And our design mantra at that time was fun and friendly. So anytime we could show a face in our service, we would - right? - in search results, on profiles, on the actual homepage. I think the tone of voice that we used also engendered trust - and even some, like, maybe subtle things like the color palette. RAZ: Yeah. I mean, as far as like the box where people type in the messages, like, you say it's just the right size and length. And then you want people to give just enough information - like, not too much information? GEBBIA: Right. So one of the important ways to build trust when two people are meeting for the first time is to encourage them to have the right amount of disclosure. And when a guest first sends a message to a host inquiring about their home, we can look at it and see what's too short and what's too long. RAZ: Yeah. GEBBIA: So if somebody writes and says - hey, yo - the acceptance rate typically goes down. RAZ: Right. GEBBIA: And if they write something that's too long - it's like a novella - their acceptance rates also go down. RAZ: Right. GEBBIA: And so there's a zone that's just right, which is the - hey, coming for vacation with my family, and man, I love the artwork in your place, et cetera, et cetera. RAZ: Did you guys face any competitors early on? GEBBIA: Oh, for sure. RAZ: Yeah. GEBBIA: Yeah. So this - you know, there were many websites like ours that did the exact same thing. I think the question is - why did ours eventually take off? RAZ: Yeah. GEBBIA: And the luck and timing aside, I think we were able to understand the components of trust and to design for that. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)GEBBIA: Now, things have been going pretty well. Obviously, there are times when things don't work out. Guests have thrown unauthorized parties and trashed homes. Hosts have left guests stranded in the rain. Thankfully, out of the 123 million nights we've ever hosted, less than a fraction of a percent have been problematic. Turns out people are justified in their trust. And when trust works out right, it can be absolutely magical. We had a guest stay with a host in Uruguay. And he suffered a heart attack. The host rushed him to the hospital. They donated their own blood for his operation. Let me read you his review. (LAUGHTER)GEBBIA: (Reading) Excellent house for sedentary travelers prone to myocardial infarctions. (LAUGHTER)GEBBIA: (Reading) The area is beautiful and has direct access to the best hospitals. (LAUGHTER)GEBBIA: (Reading) Javier (ph) and Alejandra (ph) instantly become guardian angels who will save your life without even knowing you. They will rush you to the hospital in their own car while you're dying and stay in the waiting room while the doctors give you a bypass. (LAUGHTER)GEBBIA: They don't let you feel lonely. They bring you books to read, and they let you stay at their house extra nights without charging you. Highly recommended. (LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)GEBBIA: Of course, not every stay is like that. But this connection beyond the transaction is exactly what the sharing economy is aiming for. The sharing economy is commerce with the promise of human connection. People share a part of themselves. And that changes everything. Thank you. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: Joe Gebbia is one of the co-founders of Airbnb. Check out his entire talk at ted. com. Today on the show - the power of design.

New York's attorney general accuses Domino's Pizza of systematically undercounting the hours worked by employees at its franchises. As NPR's Joel Rose reports, the case could deliver big changes in the fast food industry. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: When you own a Domino's franchise, there are some rules you just have to follow. ERIC SCHNEIDERMAN: Domino's does not only control how many pepperonis are on each pizza or how fast pizza should be delivered. Domino's exercises control over all key aspects of employment relationships. ROSE: New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman says Domino's parent company encourages its franchisees to use payroll software known as Pulse. SCHNEIDERMAN: But the Pulse system, which Domino's required all franchises to use, systematically under-calculates workers' wages. This is widespread, systemic illegality. And it victimizes some of the most vulnerable workers in our state. ROSE: In a lawsuit filed yesterday, Schneiderman alleges that Domino's has known about the problem since at least 2007 and done nothing to fix it. In a statement, Domino's says its franchisees are quote, \"solely responsible for the hiring, firing and payment of their own employees,\" unquote. Though, the company says it did propose a number of solutions that the attorney general's office apparently found lacking. The lawsuit contends that Domino's is actually a joint employer, and therefore, it is accountable for what its franchises are doing. And this isn't the only high-profile case to test that theory. Janice Fine is a professor of labor studies at Rutgers University. JANICE FINE: It's like going up the food chain to try to get to the responsible party. If you've got the key player walled away from taking any kind of responsibility, it's very difficult to change conditions. ROSE: A similar lawsuit against McDonald's went to trial earlier this year. And last year, the National Labor Relations Board broadened its standards for determining who is a joint employer. Peter Cappelli is a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. He says taken together, these cases could force big companies to rethink the franchisee model altogether. PETER CAPPELLI: I think it's kind of cheaper and easier to have people who are close to the local markets run things. So if they become, you know, effectively much more on the hook for what the franchisees do, then maybe you're asking yourself why do we bother with the franchise. ROSE: The lawsuit against Domino's does not involve a lot of money, just over $500,000 in alleged wage theft. But Cappelli says the legal stakes could be a lot higher. Joel Rose, NPR News, New York.

Researchers at the firm Symantec say these attacks have something in common with the one on Sony Pictures in 2014. That's the one the FBI tied to North Korea. Here to talk about all this is NPR's tech reporter Aarti Shahani. Hi there. AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: Hi. MCEVERS: So who do the Symantec researchers say hacked into these banks? SHAHANI: The name of the group is Lazarus, and apparently they're a very effective group of hackers. And, you know, they're not just breaking into networks and stealing emails. They're developing a strategy to hijack banks and take cash directly out. The group allegedly stole tens of millions of dollars from the Central Bank of Bangladesh back in February. The Central Bank chief actually had to resign over that. In Vietnam, Lazarus allegedly attempted to steal more than a million from a bank there too. Officials managed intercept it, though, before it happened. A bank in Ecuador was also hit. And now, according to Symantec - you know, the company that makes antivirus software - according to Symantec, this same group hit the Philippines and managed to break into desktop computers and a house. It's not clear, though, if they managed to steal money this time. MCEVERS: So what does all this have to do then with North Korea? SHAHANI: OK. So this is going to sound a little complicated or convoluted so just bear with me here, OK? First there are a bunch of attacks that are linked to Lazarus the hacking group, OK? According to multiple security experts, malicious software - the exact same lines of malware - keeps showing up in attacks against South Korean companies, against Sony Pictures, which you referenced earlier, and now in these bank attacks. And so the security experts say that cannot be a coincidence. Lines of malicious software don't just get copied and pasted magically. So they believe Lazarus is behind it. OK. That's part one. Now, part two is the North Korea connection. According to U. S. intelligence officials, North Korea was behind Sony. So the private sector experts who've studied the hack, they're saying by extension it could be North Korea is behind these other attacks using the same malware. MCEVERS: Did the researchers talk about why a country would want to get into the business of robbing banks? SHAHANI: You know, according to the researchers, it's strange behavior, and I mean, really significant because, you know, nation states don't typically rob each other's banks. Though I do want to temper it by saying that it is to some extent speculation. We don't know for a fact that North Korea is behind it. MCEVERS: And the banks targeted in these attacks are pretty small. I mean, these are not the Citibanks and the J. P. Morgans of the world. Is there a reason why hackers would target these small banks? SHAHANI: Yeah, you know, it is definitely the case that these smaller banks are weaker links in the global financial system. There's a global network for banks to talk to each other and complete transactions. It's called SWIFT. And in fact just this week, the CEO of SWIFT gave this big address in Brussels. He said, listen, our central system's not at fault, it hasn't been compromised, but it looks like these small banks in our networks are vulnerable. He called the attack against Bangladesh in particular a watershed event. Again, that was the Central Bank looted by cyberthieves who took lots of money. And he said it's not an isolated incident. To his knowledge, other banks are being similarly attacked, small banks in particular. Part of the problem is small banks don't have response teams and fancy detection software like the big banks do. So in his opinion, the attacks are part of a campaign that's going to continue. MCEVERS: That's NPR's Aarti Shahani. Thanks so much. SHAHANI: Thank you.

JACOB MCCLELAND, BYLINE: At the Myriad Botanical Gardens in downtown Oklahoma City, people push strollers, walk dogs and feed ducks. It's a gorgeous day, but it's springtime in Oklahoma, so the weather can change at any time. DEVONTE THIBODEAUX: When it starts raining is when I start looking at the messages. MCCLELAND: That's Devonte Thibodeaux. He's enjoying the garden's waterway with Michaela Schweiger. MICHAELA SCHWEIGER: Or if, like, iPhone does those alerts where it goes off - that's usually when we know something's actually happening. MCCLELAND: Oklahomans know severe weather, especially tornadoes. They use a lot of sources, mainly smartphone alerts, TV and social media. Brieana McPherson starts to believe the forecast is severe when she sees it on Instagram. BRIEANA MCPHERSON: So when people post, like, pictures with, like, captions or, like, text over it - like, everybody go park your cars in a garage or something like that - yeah. MCCLELAND: And it's here at the National Weather Service office where forecasters are trying to give people a heads up about the weather. RICK SMITH: This is the operations area of the forecast office in Norman. MCCLELAND: Meteorologist Rick Smith says the Tornado outbreak in Moore, Okla. , in 2013 that killed 47 people taught important communication lessons. Facebook isn't the perfect tool for sharing urgent information, and they learned that on Twitter, tweets need timestamps. SMITH: If we just say a tornado is moving into the city; take cover - if somebody retweets that two days later, two hours later, it can cause confusion. So we try to associate a time with it to make people aware how perishable it is and to - we hope people will use caution if they're sharing it. MCCLELAND: Social media brings other headaches. Smith says it can dispense information quickly, but what makes it useful also creates problems. The messages change as people translate it themselves. Uncertainty terms like possible, maybe and potential are lost. SMITH: In some ways, communicating severe weather information is more complicated than I think it's ever been. MCCLELAND: Smith says one of the most stressful decisions for forecasters is whether to issue a warning days in advance. If the normally measured National Weather Service is concerned, the public and the media take notice. Harold Brooks is a scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman. HAROLD BROOKS: One of the things that we really, really don't know about how people respond to extreme information is what the impact of false alarms are. MCCLELAND: In April, the Storm Prediction Center forecast a strong system six days ahead of time. It called for rain, hail and the potential for tornadoes in Oklahoma. The rain and hail came but not the large tornadoes. Brooks says too many false alarms raise the risk of a crying wolf effect. How far in the future do you warn people, and when do those alerts stop mattering? BROOKS: We have to find a way to figure out and come up with some way to identify best practices so that we can hopefully impact people's behavior in a positive way. MCCLELAND: Back at the garden in Oklahoma City, Michal Lusk doesn't let bad weather consume her. MICHAL LUSK: Typically if they close the office early for weather, I don't bother to leave.

The software giant said it is buying the career-focused site for $26. 2 billion. The deal is the largest acquisition ever for Microsoft and one of the biggest in the industry's history. In today's All Tech Considers, NPR's Aarti Shahani reports on Microsoft's push into the connected workplace. AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: First let's talk about the business news, and then let's delve into what it could mean, practically speaking, for you and me at work. On a call with investors, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella rattled off the deal's specifics. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SATYA NADELLA: Microsoft will acquire LinkedIn for $196 per share in an all-cash transaction. SHAHANI: That 196 per share is 50 percent above what LinkedIn stock was worth on Friday, so Microsoft is paying a lot. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)NADELLA: Reid Hoffman has stated his full support for the transaction. SHAHANI: Hoffman being the much-revered founder of LinkedIn. The two companies entered talks about the deal just this past February. They came to an agreement pretty quickly and got their respective boards to bless it all under the radar. They kept it impressively quiet until this morning, that is. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)NADELLA: And we expect this transaction to close by this calendar year. SHAHANI: Linkedin has come under scrutiny. In 2015, the number of people using it didn't grow that much. LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner assured investors his platform has north of 433 million members, and. . . JEFF WEINER: Worth calling out there - China remains our fastest growing and not surprising given the size of the addressable opportunity there. SHAHANI: That's a jargony a way of saying 1 in 5 of the world's knowledge workers and students on a professional track lives in China. And while U. S. tech companies constantly fret over how to penetrate that country, LinkedIn is there. Regulators in the U. S. have to approve the deal. Microsoft's top lawyer, Brad Smith, says he's confident it'll happen. BRAD SMITH: This merger is what antitrust lawyers would term highly complementary. There's not any significant overlap between the products and services of the two companies. SHAHANI: And therein lays the potential. Each company already dominates the, quote, unquote, \"productivity marketplace. \" But they don't already work together in a seamless way. Right after the investor call, the CEOs of both companies explained to NPR what that could look like. Microsoft's Nadella. . . NADELLA: So for example, today I go every day to the LinkedIn feed, and I already get a lot of information. It knows me. It knows my job. It knows my company. It knows my industry. SHAHANI: Now just imagine if that newsfeed talked to your Outlook calendar, if it knew all the meetings you were going to have in the next month, the customers you'd see. NADELLA: And it lit up news articles of those customers. SHAHANI: That's an example of efficiency, saving you the trouble of having to go to look things up yourself. The greatest technologies change human behavior, our relationship to the world and each other. Asked to talk about that - the things we may not already do that the new joint team is dreaming up - Nadella brings up the Microsoft personal assistant called Cortana. NADELLA: Just imagine a world where this wakes up just before I enter a new meeting with people I've never met before. SHAHANI: And Cortana is smarter because she has access to LinkedIn, so she can tell you. NADELLA: Oh, wow, you went to school with this person, or, you worked at the same company. One of your colleagues at my - in your company, in fact, knows this person. SHAHANI: At a minimum, we'll be better at feigning familiarity, and maybe, just maybe, we'll uncover deep, real-life connections faster. Weiner points out a brand new way to think about the help tab in PowerPoint or Excel. Maybe you used to go there for tips on exporting a file. Once Microsoft's Office 365 is integrated with your social network, it'll mean another kind of help. WEINER: The ability to connect with people in your network who can help with your question, the ability to connect with freelancers who are experts in that area.

C. sided with the Obama administration today on its so-called net neutrality rules. They require Internet providers to treat all web traffic equally. Critics like Texas Senator Ted Cruz have called the rules Obamacare for the Internet. NPR's tech blogger, Alina Selyukh, has been following the story and she's with us now. And we know this is kind of a complicated topic. Can you just tell us in a nutshell what these rules actually are? ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE: So there are two elements to it. And the first is the actual net neutrality principles, which is this fundamental philosophy that says phone and cable companies should not discriminate, block, slow down any competitive websites. And they shouldn't give fast lanes to any companies who pay extra. And the second layer to it is the underlying regulation that sort of turns those principles into policy. And what the FCC did last year is for the third time, they took on these net neutrality laws and they decided to adopt them by completely overhauling the way they regulate Internet. And they put Internet service providers into the same kind of bucket as an old telephone company. It's called a telecommunication service, which means they are now subject to much higher scrutiny and much higher levels of regulations, sort of similar what a public utility might experience. MCEVERS: OK, so what were the arguments in court in this case? SELYUKH: Well, as you can imagine, the telecom industry did not like this expansion of authority. Telecom, wireless, cable associations, and then AT&T, CenturyLink and a bunch of smaller broadband providers sued the FCC, arguing that it overstepped its authority. And one of the major arguments they make is that this approach is so outdated that it will stifle innovation and it will stop them from investing in these really important networks. MCEVERS: Now, these rules have been upheld. I mean, do these Internet providers plan to appeal that decision? SELYUKH: That's really widely expected. They've indicated that they will continue to continue to lobby Congress to change the laws fundamentally and that they will appeal either to the full panel of the D. C. circuit or to the Supreme Court. And this does seem to be likely to stretch into the next administration. MCEVERS: All right, so while all that's happening - I mean, in the meantime, what does this ruling mean for people who use the Internet, for you and me? SELYUKH: Practically not much is going to change immediately. The rules have been on the books for a year, and they will remain on the books. The main thing that changes is that going forward, the Federal Communications Commission now has this really wide-reaching authority to set new rules and regulations for the Internet providers, but also pursue any kind of violation of these rules or even a suggestion of a violation. They have set up a new process for complaints so both consumers and companies that feel like their websites aren't loading as fast or they're getting some kind of gate-keeping pressure from the telecoms, they can complain to the FCC. And the FCC said that going forward, they will investigate on a case-by-case basis any potential violations. MCEVERS: That NPR's Alina Selyukh. Thank you very much. SELYUKH: Thank you.

The Democratic Party today confirmed that its computer network here in Washington had been hacked sometime last summer, and the suspected culprits had ties to the Russian intelligence services. Their target was Democrats' opposition files on Donald Trump. NPR's Brian Naylor has the details. BRIAN NAYLOR, BYLINE: There were actually two separate hacks on the DNC's network, one last summer called COZY BEAR. It eavesdropped on the party's emails and communications. Then this past spring, a second hack occurred. Dmitri Alperovitch is co-founder of CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity firm the Democrats brought in to clean up their servers. DMITRI ALPEROVITCH: And the second actor, who we call FANCY BEAR, which we actually believe is the GRU - the military intelligence agency of the Russian government - infiltrated that network this April. And they went straight for the research department of the DNC and exfiltrated opposition materials on Mr. Trump. NAYLOR: Now, Alperovitch says neither of the two BEARs - COZY or FANCY - knew the other was lurking about because they were the work of separate spy groups - FANCY BEAR from military intelligence and COZY BEAR probably from the FSB, Alperovitch says, Russia's security intelligence agency. Both of the BEARs, he says, were competing for the attention of Russian leader Vladimir Putin. ALPEROVITCH: And this is actually not atypical of Russian intelligence agencies. They have a very adversarial relationship. They don't share information with each other. They don't cooperate. In fact, there's one-upsmanship that they're often involved in to show off to Putin who is better and to get more budget and more power. NAYLOR: DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said democratic officials moved as quickly as possible to kick out the intruders and secure the network. There's no indication there was any financial motive for the breach. Alperovitch says it's possible the hackers got into the system by spearfishing, sending a fake email and hoping the recipient will click on a link and let them in the door. He says the Russians are very good at this sort of thing. ALPEROVITCH: These are very, very sophisticated actors. Their tradecraft is absolutely superb. They're some of the best that we ever encounter in terms of cyber threats. So I think any organization would be highly vulnerable to this threat. NAYLOR: And in fact, Alperovitch says, Russian intelligence has targeted the White House, the State Department and the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the past. And political campaigns have been victims, too. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper warned a few weeks ago that the presidential campaigns would be likely targets. Frank Cilluffo directs the George Washington University's Center for Cyber and Homeland Security. FRANK CILLUFFO: It would be naive to suggest that other candidates and their campaigns aren't being targeted by foreign intelligence services as well. If you recall, Mitt Romney's campaign was allegedly hacked, as were others. So I think this is becoming a bit of a new norm. NAYLOR: Nor, says Cilluffo, is it surprising that Trump would be of special interest to Russians and other foreign powers. CILLUFFO: With Donald Trump in particular, since he's a relatively newcomer to the political scene, it's not surprising that they're trying to glean additional insight into his positions and policies not only with respect to Russia but beyond, and also to dig up political dirt - which in Russian is compromat - very consistent with Russian politics. NAYLOR: The Russian government has denied any involvement in the DNC hack, but cyber experts warn that this is unlikely to be the last attack on a political website and that they'll probably continue up until the November election.

Valore is captain of a three-person team that's getting ready to play. Here's team member Nick Verolla also known as CullTheMeek. NICK VEROLLA: Totally psyched up - you know, the event's only in a couple hours. You can feel the tension. You can feel the pressure. It's really intense. SYDELL: If they win, there's a $10,000 prize. Though, in the world of eSports, prizes have gone above $7 million, and athletes can make money doing commercials and getting endorsements.

We learned about the crash yesterday, but it happened back in May on a highway in Florida. The car was on a divided highway when a tractor trailer turned across the lanes up ahead. The car's autopilot system and the driver apparently failed to see the vehicle. According to Tesla, the brake was never applied before the crash. Alex Davies is with Wired magazine, and he's been writing about this. Welcome to the program, Alex. ALEX DAVIES: Thanks for having me. SIEGEL: And please describe this autopilot feature to us. How does it work? DAVIES: Sure. So Tesla's autopilot isn't actually all that different from an advanced cruise control you can buy in a new Mercedes or Audi or even cheaper cars. When you're in the car and you're on the highway, as long as you're going at least 18 miles an hour, you hit a little button on one of the stalks coming off the steering wheel. And from that point on, the car uses cameras in the front to pick up lane lines, and it uses radars to look for other cars. And its basic mission is to keep you in the middle of your lane and a safe distance from other cars. So if the semi in front of it slows down to 55 miles an hour, it will also slow down. SIEGEL: Well, based on what we've heard about this crash, it sounds like there's a blind spot in its capabilities. DAVIES: There certainly seems to have been some sort of glitch. Now, Tesla is saying that when the tractor trailer turned in front of this Tesla because the trailer was all white that the car didn't see it against a similarly white sky. That makes sense or that could make sense for the cameras, but it's harder to understand why the radar wouldn't pick up the tractor trailer because the radar doesn't see color. It sees objects. Tesla hasn't given a really clear explanation of that, but they are quick to say, hey, this is a beta system. You know, it's still technically in testing, even though we've given it out to the public. SIEGEL: I should add, by the way, that there are a great many white vehicles on the road, so that alone is not a small problem. This is one fatal car crash. It's estimated there were 35,000 motor vehicle deaths last year. But because it was a self-driving car at least a car in auto pilot, it raises some very interesting questions. I mean, does Tesla say, we don't guarantee that this car will miss a car turning in front of it, it's up to you, you'd better be sure to back-up the machine at all times? DAVIES: Oh, they definitely think that. When you get a car with autopilot, autopilot is automatically turned off. You have to turn it on and in doing so effectively sign a box that says, hey, I know this is a beta feature. I know that I, the driver, am ultimately responsible for the behavior of the car. I'm not going to take my eyes off the road. I'm not going to take my hands off the wheel. And this is purely a convenience feature and a safety aide. SIEGEL: Is there a possibility, though, here of a gap between what drivers formally signed onto and say they understand and what they're actually expecting the technology to do for them when they're at the wheel? DAVIES: Oh, absolutely. And I think you saw that within a week of this system being released which was in mid-October of last year. There is a whole new genre of YouTube videos of Tesla drivers playing around with autopilot. There's one video of a guy filming his car driving itself from the backseat. So I think as with anything, there's a difference between signing a user agreement and actually reading it, let alone obeying the entire thing. SIEGEL: Does that agreement that the driver makes, does that absolve Tesla of any of any liability here? I mean, is it all user error after that? DAVIES: You know, that's not entirely clear. And I spoke with one legal expert who told me that while, you know, it's good for Tesla that they did have people sign that agreement, that NHTSA, you know, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration which is investigating this accident, could look and say, well, hey, Tesla, like, you knew people were misusing this. You knew there was a serious risk that this was a feature that your customers were not using safely. And if Tesla didn't take adequate steps to remedy that, then maybe they're not quite as absolved as they would hope. SIEGEL: Can Tesla argue that its cars have prevented more accidents than they have caused? DAVIES: They certainly can argue that, and, in fact, they're already arguing it. That was the central argument of the blog post they put up yesterday in response to the crash. And I think it's a worthy argument it's just, you know, it's still hard for safety regulators to say, well, you prevented crashes. But if they don't deem this safe feature something that owners should have access to, then all of that's pulled into question. SIEGEL: And if I have a member of my family who's trusting in an autopilot mode in a Tesla and dies in a car crash, it's small solace that five other people didn't die in car crashes that week. DAVIES: Exactly. Small solace especially on the legal side if someone decides to press charges against Tesla. SIEGEL: Alex Davies of Wired magazine, thanks for talking with us. DAVIES: Thank you.

So if you happen to be heading to Jupiter, you better bring your own navigation tools. NPR's Joe Palca has been describing how inventions solve problems as part of his series, Joe's Big Idea. And today he has the story of a device that is critical for NASA's Juno spacecraft to navigate its way to Jupiter. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: Getting around on Earth is relatively straightforward. (SOUNDBITE OF NASA DOCUMENTARY)UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR: On Earth, we move between points which remain fixed relative to each other. PALCA: But as this 1967 NASA documentary pointed out, finding your way around in space presents a whole new set of challenges, challenges scientists and engineers were going to have to overcome. (SOUNDBITE OF NASA DOCUMENTARY)UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR: Eventually, man will set out toward another planet millions of miles distant. The instruments and techniques of modern science will guide his spacecraft with an accuracy and precision inconceivable to earthbound navigators. PALCA: John Leif Jorgensen has spent a career pursuing that kind of accuracy and precision. He's at the Technical University of Denmark. He says if you want to go to Jupiter, for example, you have to know exactly where Jupiter is, but you also have to figure out where you are. JOHN JORGENSEN: The problem in space is there's no up and down. So the only real reliable source to find your orientation is where's the sun. PALCA: But knowing where the sun is isn't enough. You need another reference point. And Jorgensen says fortunately, there are plenty of reference points out there - stars. There are two reasons stars are good for spacecraft navigation. One, they don't move around, and two -JORGENSEN: It's always night up in space, so we can always see stars. PALCA: To navigate by the stars, Jorgensen builds instruments called star trackers. A star tracker is essentially a camera with a built-in star catalog. It looks at a patch of sky and picks out stars it knows and tells the spacecraft which way it's pointing, its orientation. So now it knows that Jupiter is, say, ahead and to the right and Earth is below and to the left. And that's important information for a spacecraft like Juno. JORGENSEN: Know where to point the antenna, the telescopes and stuff like that. PALCA: But from a navigating standpoint, there's still a problem. JORGENSEN: It doesn't give you the position. PALCA: Position is different from orientation. Orientation tells you where you're pointed. Position tells you where you are in space, how far you are from the Earth and the Sun and Jupiter. JORGENSEN: To find the position when you go deep space, like on Juno, you need to have help from somewhere. PALCA: The help comes from something called the Deep Space Network. These are three large radio antennas, one in California, one in Australia and one in Spain. They receive radio signals from Juno and use those to figure out where the probe is and how fast it's moving. JORGENSEN: And that works beautifully for deep space spacecraft. It's just that it is relatively expensive to track a satellite with a big dish antenna. So people have been looking for different ways of navigating. That's a problem you also can solve with the star tracker. PALCA: Jorgensen is working on an advanced version of the star tracker that can navigate all on its own. That's for the future. NASA is still using the Deep Space Network to guide Juno on its path. There are actually four of Jorgensen's star trackers on Juno, but they aren't being used for navigation. His are extremely high-precision, and they're being used by one of Juno's instruments to know precisely where it's pointing as it maps the planet's magnetic field. After all, if you've gone all that way to Jupiter, you don't want to make an inaccurate map. Joe Palca, NPR News. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  In space, there are no road maps.

It's considered a hub for startups and investment. It's also a gateway to Europe for American tech companies. But as NPR's Laura Sydell reports, the vote to leave the EU could threaten all of this. LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE: The day after the vote wasn't an easy one for Tim Rea, the CEO of Palringo, a London-based startup that helps gamers play together. TIM REA: I was instantly bombarded the next day by 20 or so people in our company who come from other European countries and actually reside in the U. K. and work for our company. SYDELL: They wanted to know if they were going to be kicked out of England. Rea spoke to me from London via Skype. He told his employees to be calm and, well, carry on. But before the vote, Rea says engineers throughout Europe came to London for opportunity. REA: You set your sail to London. You go to London. You prove yourself there. You do, you know, amazingly well compared to what you could have done if you were, you know, a talented engineer set in France or set in Spain or set in Germany even. SYDELL: As Europe's banking capital, London is filled with startups that are creating new financial technologies and ways of using and sorting through data. Cambridge University leads the way in quantum computing. But key to the success has been how easy it is for European engineers to get to Britain. Rea says his biggest fear is that all this talent will get the wrong message from the vote. REA: Probably worst-case scenario is one where actually they leave of their own accord because they just don't feel welcome or they actually see the U. K. going in the wrong direction. SYDELL: Ray says the hardest part for him and his employees right now is the uncertainty. He's not alone in that. Robert Siegel is a partner in XSeed Capital, a venture firm. Siegel spoke to me over Skype from Vienna. He says venture capitalists don't like uncertainty. ROBERT SIEGEL: Because they know that their companies will have a harder time raising money, so they take their pool of capital to protect their existing investments. That's not a good thing for hiring. That's not a good thing for new companies getting started. So in the near-term, I think you'll see a slowdown. SYDELL: Siegel says, for many tech companies - from Google, to Facebook, to small startups - the U. K. is seen as a gateway to Europe because it's English-speaking and follows EU laws. Some companies keep servers there. But with Britain out of the EU, it could have very different rules. And Siegel says that creates unnecessary friction for entrepreneurs. SIEGEL: Having to comply with complex and hard-to-implement laws is the type of things that entrepreneurs either don't start their companies or they move into a different place. SYDELL: But downtimes for some can be good times for others. Zendesk, a software company based in San Francisco, has offices in the U. K. and other parts of Europe, including Copenhagen and Dublin. Its subscription software is used to communicate with customers. Marc Cabi, vice president of strategy at Zendesk, says, when times are tough - and they may be in the wake of the Brexit - Zendesk sells more software. MARC CABI: Companies in difficult economic times may look at how they retain their existing customers, and our software and lends itself for customer retention activities. SYDELL: But like many tech companies, Zendesk does have employees in the U. K. who are citizens from the rest of Europe. Cabi says if immigration laws tighten, they will simply move them out of Britain. CABI: London is a very important business center for us, but we can move people around, if required, to either Dublin or Copenhagen or maybe even our Montpellier office. SYDELL: And while that works fine for Zendesk, it may not bode as well for England's future as a tech center. Laura Sydell, NPR News.

TIM REA: I was instantly bombarded the next day by 20 or so people in our company who come from other European countries and actually reside in the U. K. and work for our company. SYDELL: They wanted to know if they were going to be kicked out of England. Rea spoke to me from London via Skype. He told his employees to be calm and, well, carry on. But before the vote, Rea says engineers throughout Europe came to London for opportunity. REA: You set your sail to London. You go to London. You prove yourself there. You do, you know, amazingly well compared to what you could have done if you were, you know, a talented engineer set in France or set in Spain or set in Germany even. SYDELL: As Europe's banking capital, London is filled with startups that are creating new financial technologies and ways of using and sorting through data. Cambridge University leads the way in quantum computing. But key to the success has been how easy it is for European engineers to get to Britain. Rea says his biggest fear is that all this talent will get the wrong message from the vote. REA: Probably worst-case scenario is one where actually they leave of their own accord because they just don't feel welcome or they actually see the U. K. going in the wrong direction. SYDELL: Ray says the hardest part for him and his employees right now is the uncertainty. He's not alone in that. Robert Siegel is a partner in XSeed Capital, a venture firm. Siegel spoke to me over Skype from Vienna. He says venture capitalists don't like uncertainty. ROBERT SIEGEL: Because they know that their companies will have a harder time raising money, so they take their pool of capital to protect their existing investments. That's not a good thing for hiring. That's not a good thing for new companies getting started. So in the near-term, I think you'll see a slowdown. SYDELL: Siegel says, for many tech companies - from Google, to Facebook, to small startups - the U. K. is seen as a gateway to Europe because it's English-speaking and follows EU laws. Some companies keep servers there. But with Britain out of the EU, it could have very different rules. And Siegel says that creates unnecessary friction for entrepreneurs. SIEGEL: Having to comply with complex and hard-to-implement laws is the type of things that entrepreneurs either don't start their companies or they move into a different place. SYDELL: But downtimes for some can be good times for others. Zendesk, a software company based in San Francisco, has offices in the U. K. and other parts of Europe, including Copenhagen and Dublin. Its subscription software is used to communicate with customers. Marc Cabi, vice president of strategy at Zendesk, says, when times are tough - and they may be in the wake of the Brexit - Zendesk sells more software. MARC CABI: Companies in difficult economic times may look at how they retain their existing customers, and our software and lends itself for customer retention activities. SYDELL: But like many tech companies, Zendesk does have employees in the U. K. who are citizens from the rest of Europe. Cabi says if immigration laws tighten, they will simply move them out of Britain. CABI: London is a very important business center for us, but we can move people around, if required, to either Dublin or Copenhagen or maybe even our Montpellier office. SYDELL: And while that works fine for Zendesk, it may not bode as well for England's future as a tech center.

It captured police officers struggling with, then shooting Sterling. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: He's got a gun. Gun. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: (Unintelligible). UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: (Unintelligible). (SOUNDBITE OF GUNSHOT)SHAPIRO: That video was filmed by a Baton Rouge activist group called Stop the Killing, Inc. The group's founder is Arthur Reed, who goes by Silky Slim, and he joins us now. How did your group get involved with the Alton Sterling shooting? ARTHUR REED: Basically, we gather video of violent footage all the time, and we listen to scanners every single day to find out where these violent acts are taking place. And when we listen to these scanners, when we hear certain codes, we will go to that location. We will go to the address that we hear on the scanners. However, with this particular video, we're not sure if they actually heard the call. We just know that the video was captured, and when it was turned over to me, I knew the importance of that video. SHAPIRO: Tell me why you decided not to release the video immediately after you obtained it. REED: We wanted to give the police department and the city a chance to be transparent with what was going on. Immediately after the killing, the police officers put the owner of the store in the back of a police car, confiscated his hard drive, took his cell phone and basically placed him under arrest for no charges. We wanted to see if they were going to release the store video. We wanted to see how transparent it was going to be. So they're saying, well, we have video. We have body cameras. We have everything that we need to do a thorough investigation. Then the next day, they come out and say, well, the body cameras fell off the officers, so we don't have that video. And then they didn't produce to store surveillance footage, so that let us know that we needed to release what we had nationally. And that's why we used social media through several outlets to make sure that we get this thing up and running. SHAPIRO: And, of course, after this incident in Baton Rouge, we've seen another killing in Minnesota. What do you make of the scenario there, where the incident was live-streamed on Facebook? REED: I think that was very smart of her to live-stream it. That way, if they would have told her to stop recording, it wouldn't have been one of those days where they could have just made her shut her phone off. It was already being recorded. I think that's a very, very sad incident right there, but the focus has been turned to what has taken place there. And this is - Alton is definitely yesterday's news because something new has happened now. And that shows you how fast these incidents are happening. We were praying and hoping that nothing would happen and that this wouldn't happen again in our country, but unfortunately less than 24 hours - when we were receiving the attention that we feel that this case should get, it's turned somewhere else. And I'm afraid to go to sleep tonight 'cause I'm thinking that we're going to hear something tomorrow. I mean, this is saddening. SHAPIRO: Obviously, technology has really become a powerful tool in these scenarios. What kinds of guidance do you offer people around the country about how best to use the technology at their disposal? REED: Film what you're filming, understand what you're filming, and don't over talk yourself on what you're filming. If you have to talk while you film, make sure that you use clean language so that this can be material that can be used for the media. This is important right now in this time. You have to thank God for iPhones, Samsung and all of the many brands that have offered us this type of technology. You have to thank God for social media. These stories are not new stories to the urban community. We've been saying that police are killing people and covering it up. But there's that other side of society that hasn't ever seen anything like this and will be quick to say, oh, man, no police officer is going to just kill you. These people are crazy. But now that we have footage, and we have video, we're showing you exactly what's going on and how it has been going on for so long. Right now, we just have a way of exposing it. And the sad part about it is that even though we are getting the video and we're getting the actual killings, there's still no accountability for what has taken place. SHAPIRO: That was Arthur Reed, a. k. a. Silky Slim. His Baton Rouge activist group is called Stop the Killing, Inc.

It's software that lets you search the web without revealing your identity or location. The Kilton Public Library in Lebanon, N. H. , has been running Tor on its public computers for about a year. It's also installed a Tor relay, which permits other people using Tor elsewhere to appear as though they are working out of the library. The library has heard from the local police, who are unhappy with the use of Tor. The police, in turn, had heard about it indirectly from the Department of Homeland Security. Even so, the library has persevered. And I asked librarian Chuck McAndrew why the library installed Tor on its computers. CHUCK MCANDREW: So libraries have, for a long time, been very concerned with intellectual freedom and the right to free inquiry. We refer to it as the right to read. Back in 2013, Penn-America did a study that showed 1 in 6 writers had avoided writing or speaking on a topic they thought would subject them to surveillance. For me, that's a pretty textbook case of the chilling effects on intellectual freedom of surveillance. So by working for digital privacy and teaching our patrons how to protect their digital privacy, we're actually protecting their intellectual freedom. SIEGEL: Tell us about your run-in via the local police with the Department of Homeland Security. MCANDREW: So when we first set up the relay, we got some press. And the Department of Homeland Security apparently saw one of the articles. And they forwarded it to another police department in New Hampshire, who forwarded it to our police department. They had some concerns. Police deal with some of the worst examples of humanity on a regular basis, and they wanted to make sure that we were aware of negative uses that the Tor network could be put to. So my library director and the president of our board of trustees agreed to put our project on hold until those concerns could be heard by the community and we could get the community input. We had more than 50 people show up to our trustees meeting. Of those, about 15 spoke. And every single one of them, without fail, was in favor. SIEGEL: And the risks they were told of were that some criminal might also use this or a child pornographer might use this. MCANDREW: Exactly - or terrorists. Yeah, there's a lot of negative stuff that can be done on the internet. And their argument was that we would essentially be enabling those folks. SIEGEL: And the response from your community in Lebanon, N. H. , was overwhelmingly no, the anonymity, the principle is more important than what might be the odd abuse of this privilege. MCANDREW: Correct. One person said, you know, a bank robber can use the road to get away, but we still want to be able to drive on it. SIEGEL: That's Chuck McAndrew. He's the IT librarian at the Kilton Public Library. Thanks for talking with us. MCANDREW: Thank you, Robert.

I got a text from a friend that said there's a Poke Stop right by your house. And I only knew what this meant because earlier in the day, I had read a post on NPR's pop-culture blog Monkey See by our own Glen Weldon who is here. Hi, Glen. GLEN WELDON, BYLINE: Hey, Ari. SHAPIRO: You downloaded it for a piece that ran on Friday. Here we are four days later. Have you played it since? WELDON: I was nearly level two then, Ari, and I am now level 11, thank you very much. SHAPIRO: OK. Enough said. WELDON: Yes. SHAPIRO: Tell me about what it's like to have this augmented reality experience on your phone superimposed on a real world with real people in it? WELDON: Well, you know, a lot of people are trading these photos back-and-forth of them interacting with one of these little cartoon Pokemon. And the technology has come so far that we're now doing what Gene Kelly was doing with Tom and Jerry back in \"Anchors Aweigh\" in 1945. That's. . . SHAPIRO: Oh, you mean real people dancing with cartoon characters. WELDON: Exactly. The weird thing is, though - is that these cartoon characters kind of bounce around right in front of you. You look through your phone, through the camera, and you see them. And so as you are walking around the streets, they just pop up, and you have to do a very not intuitive thing to capture them. I got out of my gym first thing in the morning, and I discovered that my street was teeming with Pokemon evidently. SHAPIRO: Who knew? WELDON: So the leaves were rustling - animated leaves were rustling telling me go. So I went, and I got really frustrated because the camera turned on as if there's a Pokemon nearby. And I kept looking around and finding nothing, so I just got really frustrated. And I thought this is - look at this dumb fountain and this dumb park and these women just doing their dumb yoga. And then I realized I am about 8 feet away from these women doing yoga with my camera pointed directly at them. SHAPIRO: Like some kind of creeper. WELDON: At their downward dogs, yeah. And so that's when I thought, OK, well, I'm going to put my phone away and walk out of this park as fast as I can. SHAPIRO: And you have a lot of experience with video games and comic books and other forms of entertainment. Do you see this to be - pardon the phrase - a game changer? WELDON: I don't know. I mean, there's certainly been some blowback. There's been lots of think pieces. You know, I think basic human decency has to prevail here. The same caveats applied playing a game like this as applied to, you know, life. Maybe, you know, a place where you might want to stop playing the game is, say, at the Holocaust Museum, for example. And the Holocaust Museum just came out with a thing saying, you know what? We'd love it if you didn't. So, again, basic human decency should prevail, but it is new. SHAPIRO: There have been police departments warning people about rustling around in the bushes late at night. There have been teenagers arrested for using this game to try to lure people somewhere to rob them. WELDON: Yeah. SHAPIRO: Is this a downfall of civilization? WELDON: (Laughter) You know, I - we went to the Lincoln Memorial which is a Pokemon gym for a Facebook Live piece yesterday looking for people playing this game. We looked for 45 minutes to find somebody who was actually doing it because instead, they were reading about Abraham Lincoln. This is not the downfall of society.

There's a view of the Pacific Ocean, a historic beach LA restaurant with a view of the water. Today, there are dozens of people that are in the restaurant parking lot. And they could care less about the ocean. They're looking down at their smartphones. Danielle Sheridon says she's searching for fictional monsters called Pokemon. Did you come all the way out here today to play? DANIELLE SHERIDON: Yeah. SYDELL: Well, how come? SHERIDON: Because we thought the beach might have a lot of Pokemon because they tend to be in, like, more public places like this. SYDELL: This is one of the hot spots in San Francisco for spotting Pokemon. Elliot Nicholson is also on the hunt. ELLIOT NICHOLSON: You can tell, there's usually a big group of people just clustered around a certain area. Or in my neighborhood, they're just taking night walks in places and at times that I usually don't see people out at night (laughter). So it's one of those, OK, I know what they're doing (laughter). SYDELL: Playing Pokemon Go. It's part of a genre of games that uses something called augmented reality. That's a mix between the virtual and the real world. The object is to catch Pokemon. On your phone screen is a map of where you're standing, courtesy of GPS. As you go off and search for the monsters, your phone's camera turns on and an animated Pokemon appears in your view of the real world. The key is you have to keep moving if you're going to catch one. You do that by moving your finger across the screen and throwing little animated balls at the guy. DEAN SPEER: So it's like a giant scavenger hunt. And it's all over the world, wherever you are, whenever you want to go. SYDELL: Dean Speer, 28-year-old personal trainer says Pokemon Go takes you places. You can't play it sitting down. And the search reveals more of the world, like the entrance to a trail you've never noticed. SPEER: I had walked by the entrance many times, never really realized it was an entrance. But then you're like, wait, that's a trail. And then you walk back there and suddenly there's creeks and trees. And I'm like, oh, there's more of this than just Golden Gate Park. SYDELL: And this is happening all over the country. It's topped the app charts for both iPhones and Android phones. CHELSEA STARK: People were walking around both floors of our office trying to catch Pokemon. A bunch of us left for lunch at the same time so we could do it. SYDELL: Chelsea Stark is the games editor for the tech site Mashable. There are other augmented reality games. But Stark says, hands down, this one is the most popular. STARK: I think it's the fact that it's Pokemon and the fact that it's the real world, the fact that maybe we kind of all need a distraction in this kind of horrible summer full of, like, really dire political events and social events. SYDELL: The game is making money from in-app purchases to the tune of $1. 6 million a day, according to the research firm SensorTower Inc. And it's only been out since last Thursday. Nintendo's stock is going gangbusters, though it only partially owns this version of Pokemon, which was produced by Niantic. Already, there are some downsides. There are reports of people getting so lost in the game, they trip in potholes or robbers using it to lure victims and concerns about privacy. The app collects a lot of personal data off your phone. So far, none of this is deterring players like Elliot Nicholson. How long do you think you can keep this up? NICHOLSON: Oh, I don't know, until I get bored of it (laughter). That could either take weeks, months, maybe a year. SYDELL: Or maybe until cold weather arrives. This could just be a summer fling. Laura Sydell, NPR News, San Francisco. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Most summers have a hit song that everybody knows. This summer, it may turn out to be a hit video game, the latest version of Pokemon. Twenty years ago, a version of Nintendo's game swept Japan. Now some Americans are obsessed with a video game that pushes people out into the real world so that they can ignore it.

Since his 2005 breakthrough, \"Enron: The Smartest Guys In The Room,\" Gibney has made over 25 documentaries, including such recent work as \"Steve Jobs: The Man In The Machine\" and \"Going Clear: Scientology And The Prison Of Belief. \"His latest film, \"Zero Days,\" focuses on the story and large-scale implications of computer malware. Our critic-at-large, John Powers, says even if you don't own a smartphone or ever go online, this movie will unsettle you. JOHN POWERS, BYLINE: When most of us think about computer hacking, we picture Julian Assange leaking government secrets or a shadowy, bad-shave crook in some former Soviet republic, hoovering up credit card info from a chain store. But while folks like these do stir up all manner of trouble, a much deeper danger lies elsewhere. That danger is the theme of \"Zero Days,\" a chilling new film by Alex Gibney, who sometimes seems to turn out documentaries as quickly as tweets. This latest one may be his finest and most important, for it doesn't merely tell an exciting story about using a computer virus to wage black ops against Iran. Filled with juicy historical tidbits, it keeps expanding its frame of reference to reveal one of the looming, but invisible threats of the digital age. Gibney begins in 2010 in Belarus, where a computer security guy comes across a highly infectious new kind of malware dubbed Stuxnet that is dazzling in its complexity. Soon, computer whizzes, journalists and even the Department of Homeland Security are working overtime to understand the self-replicating virus that takes over every PC it touches. Stuxnet is just too big, too perfect and too untraceable to be the work of anything less powerful than a national government. But who created Stuxnet and why? Even today, no country admits involvement, but following the lead of New York Times reporter David Sanger who broke the story, \"Zero Days\" establishes in thorough, sometimes groundbreaking detail that Stuxnet was a joint project of the United States and Israel designed to sabotage Iranian attempts to get the atomic bomb. Stuxnet took over computers at Iran's Natanz nuclear plant and directed its centrifuges, which create weapons-grade atomic material to self-destruct without its technicians being able to do anything about it. This operation was so secret that - well, just listen to Sean McGurk, America's then cybersecurity czar at Homeland Security talking about the Stuxnet virus. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"ZERO DAYS\")SEAN MCGURK: I've been asked on a number of occasions, did you ever think this was us? And at no point did that ever really cross our mind because we were looking at it from the standpoint of is this something that's coming after the homeland, you know, what's going to potentially impact, you know, our industrial control base here in the United States? You know, I liken it to, you know, field of battle. You don't think the sniper that's behind you is going to be shooting at you because you expect them to be on your side. POWERS: Stuxnet is a great story that brims with great talkers from Israeli intelligence bosses to NSA employees whose identities must be hidden for their protection. You've got Eric Chien, head of security for Symantec, who's so lucid and charismatic, you'll never call computer guys geeks again. You've got the entertaining Richard Clarke, former head of counterterrorism for Presidents Clinton and Bush, who specializes in smiling through his rage. And you have avuncular General Michael Hayden whose cheery, almost cute manner belies a heart that pumps iron filings. This dude ran both the NSA and the CIA. \"Zero Days\" would be worth seeing just for its account of the Stuxnet operation which boomerangs when Israel pushes things too far, much to American dismay. And Iran does some cyber mischief in the U. S. just to remind us that two can play this game. But Gibney doesn't stop there. He expands his focus showing that the implications of the story are far huger than one might think. You see, in launching this cyberattack on a foreign country, the U. S. and Israeli governments brought something new into the world. Just listen to General Hayden. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"ZERO DAYS\")MICHAEL HAYDEN: What I said to David Sanger was I understand the difference in destruction is dramatic, but this has the whiff of August 1945. Somebody just used a new weapon, and this weapon will not be put back into the box. POWERS: These days, many countries possess the capacity to wage cyber warfare, taking down the financial system a la \"Mr. Robot,\" sowing chaos by seizing control of transit systems, even weaponry or inflicting deadly damage by shutting down power grids and sabotaging water supplies. Naturally, America has programs in place to do this kind of thing, too, which doesn't exactly inspire restraint in our global enemies. If this isn't scary enough, there's no cyberwarfare equivalent to the treaties governing nukes and germ warfare. Although President Obama has talked of the need to negotiate international agreements, it's not clear how you monitor a digital weapon that can be hidden on something no larger than a thumb drive. And because all these cyber programs have grown up in the dark, which is how intelligence agencies like them, the public has had little knowledge of - much less influence over - their exact shape and purpose. But after \"Zero Days,\" we can no longer say that we haven't been forewarned. Gibney makes it clear that we must start pressing our leaders to negotiate treaties banning it and to do so before it's too late. After all, if history has taught us anything, it's that when a new kind of weapon is created, people will use it unless you find a way to stop them.

The company suspended the account of a technology editor at the conservative news site Breitbart. He allegedly incited a troll campaign against Leslie Jones. She stars in the new \"Ghostbusters\" movie. We're going to hear how this unfolded. And a warning to our listeners, this story includes offensive language. Here's NPR's Aarti Shahani. AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: Right before the attack, it looks like Leslie Jones was having a great day. She was invited to play on ABC's \"Match Game. \"(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MATCH GAME\")ALEC BALDWIN: Leslie, are you in? SHAHANI: The celebrity game show hosted by Alec Baldwin. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MATCH GAME\")LESLIE JONES: This is too much. SHAHANI: Jones was running around stage being a goofball doing one of her favorite things, making people laugh. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MATCH GAME\")JONES: (Yelling) Colleen. SHAHANI: And then it all went downhill. For a few months now, some have complained about the all-female \"Ghostbusters\" remake. But over the next few hours, Leslie Jones became the singular focus of an all-out trolling campaign in which Jones was called the N-word, a big-lipped coon, an orangutan. Monday morning, 9:12 a. m. , Jones spoke out publicly. She tweeted that some people here are disgusting and, quote, \"I'm blocking your filthy ass. \" Then she began retweeting attacks, posting as often as every minute. At 12:45 p. m. , she tweeted, \"OK, I've been called apes and even got a pic with semen on my face\". DAVID HACKETT: She was trying to bat off flies. Like, literally, she was trying to defend herself one tweet at a time. SHAHANI: David Hackett saw it unfold and decided to jump in, tweet back in her defense. HACKETT: She was just one person. And she was trying to keep pace with, you know, at first five, then 10, then 20. SHAHANI: Notably, a feature built into Twitter ended up drawing in more people, trending topics. Leslie Jones was trending. That's how Hackett stumbled in. By 6:38 p. m. , Jones tweeted, \"Twitter, I understand you got free speech. I get it. But there has to be some guidelines\". HACKETT: About five minutes later - maybe about 10 minutes later, Jack at Twitter said, hey, Leslie Jones, can you DM me? SHAHANI: Jack Dorsey is Twitter's CEO. What happened in that exchange is not clear. Jones did not respond to NPR's interview request. And Twitter released a statement, not about this attack but about abuse in general. The company admits it has not done enough in the past and says they're working on new procedures to reduce the burden on the person being targeted. The company also moved to suspend one user in particular, Milo Yiannopoulos of the conservative site Breitbart. David Hackett makes an interesting observation. HACKETT: On his own Twitter page was perfectly clean, right? He's talking about going to the prom. SHAHANI: But according to other users, Yiannopoulos was on two other platforms, 4chan and reddit, mobilizing against Jones, which means she and Twitter would have to go outside one social network to others to get a full picture. HACKETT: That's when I knew that this was, like, a larger thing. SHAHANI: Leslie Jones tweeted well into the next morning. At 4:13 a. m. , she had to explain trolls were making fake screenshots of her attacking others as, quote, \"faggots\" and that she was not the abuser here. Mary Numaire, who also tweeted in Jones' defense, flagged down dozens of accounts. When she's done that in the past, she says, Twitter gave her a stock reply, no terms violated. This time, she hasn't gotten a verdict yet, which she takes as a good sign. MARY NUMAIRE: I can only assume that they're handling this matter a little bit more in depth than they have with other issues. That's what I hope.

I'm Guy Raz. ASTRO TELLER: Right here? UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Yes. TELLER: Sweet. RAZ: So let's introduce a guy named Astro Teller. Hello. Is that Astro Teller? TELLER: It is. RAZ: Which is kind of a perfect name for someone with Astro Teller's job. TELLER: I'd like to think so. RAZ: Astro works at a place known only as X. TELLER: People ask a lot about secrecy and how much secrecy we have at X. And there are things that we're working on at X that we don't talk about publicly. And I think people misunderstand why we don't talk about them, and it's related to the issue of failure. RAZ: Failure. . . TELLER: One of my favorite topics. RAZ: . . . Is a big deal at X, but let's back up. X is run by Google, and when Astro first started working there, he sat down with Larry Page, one of the company's co-founders, and they tried to come up with a way to describe what they would do at X, what secret stuff they'd be working on. TELLER: So I said, well, are we taking research? Is that like basically what we're doing? And he said no. Are we making business units? And he said not really. Are we an incubator? Sort of not really. So I was just trying these things out on him, and when I said are we taking moonshots? He said, that's what we're doing. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK, VIDEO PLAYING)JOHN F KENNEDY: Why, some say, the moon? RAZ: Here's Astro. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK, VIDEO PLAYING)KENNEDY: Why choose this as our goal? TELLER: 1962 at Rice University. KENNEDY: We choose to go to the moon. TELLER: JFK told the country. . . KENNEDY: We choose to go to the moon. TELLER: . . . About a dream he had, a dream to put a person on the moon by the end of the decade. KENNEDY: We choose to go to the moon in this. . . TELLER: No one knew if it was possible to do, but he made sure a plan was put in place to do it if it was possible. That's how great dreams are. Great dreams aren't just visions. They're visions coupled to strategies for making them real. At X, I have the incredible good fortune to work at a moonshot factory. We use the word moonshots to remind us to keep our visions big, to keep dreaming. And we use the word factory to remind ourselves that we want to have concrete visions, concrete plans to make them real. But I have a secret for you. The moonshot factory is a messy place, but rather than avoid the mess, pretend it's not there. We've tried to make that our strength. We spend most of our time breaking things and trying to prove that we're wrong. That's it. That's the secret. Run at all the hardest parts of the problem first. Get excited and cheer. Hey, how are we going to kill our project today? RAZ: This philosophy of chasing after failure is what Google is using to build its driverless car which started development in X, but so did Google Glass. Remember that? Not exactly a huge success. So what makes the difference between success and failure? And when failure is what you wind up with, how do you learn from it? How do you recover from it? Well, today on the show, stories and ideas about learning from failure and how to think differently about what happens when you fall flat on your face. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JON FORTT: It's one of the most hyped tech products that most people couldn't actually buy. RAZ: So let's talk about Google Glass for a second. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)FORTT: A wearable computer that takes photos and video, searches the web and responds to voice commands. RAZ: Like we said, it was first developed at X. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: One of the most highly anticipated tech gadgets. RAZ: It was supposed to be a huge thing. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)FORTT: An estimated 10,000 people in a pilot program are already users. RAZ: But the features. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JAY WAXENBERG: I'm excited to have the GPS like right in my eye. I'm excited to be able to pull up the images. Like, if I can Google something. RAZ: These things were not enough to make it a success. And so Google quietly stopped production of the prototype and moved the project out of X. TELLER: I think there were some things about what we did that were fantastic, and there are things that we did that I don't think we should repeat. And we can appreciate the parts of it that were good and make clear notes to ourselves about the parts of it that we wish that we would do differently next time. RAZ: But failure is hard. It's not - it's not fun. I mean, this sounds really great and positive the way you're talking about it. But isn't it pretty hard to get people to be - you know, to become really excited about failing at something? I mean, how do you do that? TELLER: There are a lot of different ways to do it. But here's an example - the first time I stood a team at X up on stage in front of everyone at X and said, this team has done more to further innovation at X by ending their project than any one of you sitting in your seats has done in the last quarter. There was, like, an uncomfortable silence. So then I say, and we're giving them all bonuses for having ended their project. All those people sitting in the seats are feeling even more like wait, what? Then I say, hey, guys, take a vacation. And when you get back, the world is your oyster. Find some new project to jump into. And everyone thinks I've lost my mind. But the tenth time I did that, like, no one even thinks about it. They just get a standing ovation every time. I don't even have to say the speech anymore because it's part of the culture now. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)TELLER: I want to show you a few of the projects that we've had to leave behind on the cutting room floor and also a few of the gems that at least so far have not only survived that process but have been accelerated by it. Last year, we killed a project in automated vertical farming. Vertical farming uses 10 times less water and a hundred times less land than conventional farming. But unfortunately, we couldn't get staple crops, like grains and rice, to grow this way. So we killed the project. Here's another huge problem - we pay enormous costs in resources and environmental damage to ship goods worldwide. Economic development of landlocked countries is limited by lack of shipping infrastructure. The radical solution - a lighter-than-air variable buoyancy cargo ship. But it turned out that it was going to cost close to $200 million to design and build the first one. Two-hundred-million dollars is just way too expensive because X is structured with these tight feedback loops of making mistakes and learning and new designs. We can't spend $200 million to get the first data point about whether we're on the right track or not. If there's an Achilles' heel in one of our projects, we want to know it now, up front, not way down the road. So we killed this project, too. Discovering a major flaw in a project doesn't always mean that it ends the project. Sometimes it actually gets us on to a more productive path. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: You know, it sounds like a lot of this is about how you look at it, right? Like, you know, you guys didn't fail, but you hit a snag that then forced you to shift your perspective. TELLER: Yeah. I mean, I think - you're right, of course. It helps me that I've reframed what I think of as real failure. I think of real failure as the point at which you know what you're working on is the wrong thing to be working on or that you're working on it in the wrong way. You can't call the work up to the moment where you figure it out that you're doing the wrong thing failing. That's called learning. And once you frame it that way, there's this moment where if you stop now, if you course correct now, you can be shame free. But if you keep going forward, the shame starts to build. RAZ: How do you know when it's time to, like, pull the plug and say, you know what guys - this isn't going to work. Let's just, like, fail hard and move on. TELLER: That's the really, really tough part, of course. . . RAZ: Yeah. TELLER: . . . Because reasonable people often totally disagree. . . RAZ: I bet. TELLER: . . . About when that point has been reached. RAZ: They're like what are you doing to us, Astro? TELLER: So there are times when we're trying something and it doesn't work, and we try a different way to solve the same problem or de-risk the technology. And that doesn't work also. And then we try a third way. Should we try a fourth way? That's the hard part. That's what we spend a decent amount of time arguing over. There are frequently times where I will look at a project and be confident that it's going in the wrong direction. I will say gently that I think so. And then I will step away. First of all, I'm wrong a bunch of the time. And also, if we're expecting them to do these hard things, they need to own it. If it's done to them, it feels like a catastrophe. When they do it, it actually can be empowering. RAZ: One of the most ambitious projects to come out of X in the last few years is a project called Loon, as in balloon. And it started with this idea. . . TELLER: If you were to make what you could think of as a super-small, super-cheap satellite and tie it to a balloon and put it up into the stratosphere, you would have a couple huge benefits. RAZ: First benefit - such a device would not work like a satellite much higher up in space. It wouldn't need a cell tower. It could send data directly to your phone. TELLER: And the nice secondary effect, you can have an idea about what either the balloon would be like or this payload - the thing underneath it, which is like this little baby satellite - about how you could make it better, make a new version and have it up again in a week. The turnaround time for satellites is five to 10 years. RAZ: Wow. TELLER: Think about the learning loop of one week compared to five to 10 years. RAZ: Astro hopes that X's Loon project could be a way to get internet access to millions of people all over the world who don't have it and get it to them through a network of balloons floating around the world. So for years now Astro and his team have thrown themselves at the challenges of this idea, learning really fast and expecting, even hoping to fail. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)TELLER: So since 2012, the Loon team has prioritized the work that seems the most difficult and so the most likely to kill their project. And we're going to fly over places like Indonesia for real service testing this year. The only way to get people to work on big risky things, audacious ideas and have them run at all the hardest parts of the problem first is if you make that the path of least resistance for them. We work hard at X to make it safe to fail. They get applause from their peers, hugs and high-fives from their manager, me in particular. They get promoted for it. We have bonused every single person on teams that ended their projects, from teams as small as two to teams of more than 30. We believe in dreams at The Moonshot Factory. But enthusiastic skepticism is not the enemy of boundless optimism. It's optimism's perfect partner. It unlocks the potential in every idea. Thank you very much.

I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, ideas about failure and why failure can be good for us, even though when you're the one doing the failing, it can feel pretty horrible. And Tim, I should just mention here that I'm terrible with failure. You know, like, every time I've had a failure in life, I don't want to talk about it. TIM HARFORD: Yeah. Is that being terrible, though? It's perfectly natural for failure to really hurt. That's just being a human being. There's nothing wrong with that. RAZ: This is Tim Harford. He's an economist and a journalist who wrote a book about failure. HARFORD: To be terrible with failure is either to be so scared of it that you never do anything interesting, or alternatively to be so terrified of admitting it that you continue with a disastrous course of action and you just continue to fail because you keep telling yourself you're not failing. And that, to me, is what it means to be terrible with failure. RAZ: And Tim says people who are terrible at failure in this way suffer from something known as the God complex, this idea some people have that they're not fallible, that they're the experts. Here's Tim on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HARFORD: I see the God complex around me all the time in my fellow economists. I see it in our business leaders. I see it in the politicians we vote for, people who in the face of an incredibly complicated world are nevertheless absolutely convinced that they understand the way that the world works. And this man, Archie Cochrane, understood this as well as anybody. Archie was a doctor, so he hung around with doctors a lot. And doctors suffer from the God complex a lot. And there's this one trial he ran many years after World War II. He wanted to test out the question of where is it that patients should recover from heart attacks? Should they recover in a specialized cardiac unit in hospital, or should they recover at home? All the cardiac doctors tried to shut him down. They had the God complex in spades. They knew that their hospitals were the right place for patients, and they knew it was very unethical to run any kind of trial or experiment. Nevertheless, Archie managed to get permission to do this. He ran his trial. And after the trial had been running for a little while, he gathered together all his colleagues around the table, and he said, well, gentlemen, turns out you're right. It is dangerous for patients to recover from heart attacks at home. They should be in hospital. And there's this uproar and all the doctors start pounding the table and saying we always said you're unethical, Archie. You're killing people with your clinical trials. And there's all this huge hubbub. Archie lets it die down. And then he says, well, that's very interesting, gentlemen, because when I gave you the table of results, I swapped the two columns around. It turns out your hospitals are killing people, and they should be at home. Would you like to close down the trial now, or should we wait until we have robust results? Cochrane would do that kind of thing because he understood that uncertainty, that fallibility, that being challenged, they hurt. RAZ: I wonder if this God complex thing happens, like, less and less nowadays, you know, like, in science and technology because people seem to be better at embracing failure, like, what we just - we just heard from Astro Teller - right? - that in Silicon Valley, failure is like a badge of honor. HARFORD: Yeah, Silicon Valley typifies that, the idea of evolving a website or any of the other things you can evolve through trial and error. That feels quite safe. And some people embrace that and say great, we can fail 10,000 times before breakfast and find the perfect solution. And I think one of the wonderful opportunities we have in the world today is that in many areas, it's never been quicker or cheaper to run experiments, to fail on an incredible industrial scale. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HARFORD: Let's say you wanted to make detergent. Let's say you're Unilever, and you want to make detergent in a factory near Liverpool. How do you do it? Well, you have this great, big tank full of liquid detergent. You pump it at a high pressure through a nozzle. You create a spray of detergent. And the spray dries, it turns into powder. It falls to the floor. You scoop it up. You put it in cardboard boxes. You sell it at a supermarket. You make lots of money. How do you design that nozzle? Now, if you ascribe to the God complex, what you do is you find yourself a mathematician, you find yourself a physicist, somebody who understands the dynamics of this fluid, and he will or she will calculate the optimal design of the nozzle. Now, Unilever did this, and it didn't work - too complicated. But the geneticist professor Steve Jones describes how Unilever actually did solve this problem - trial and error, variation and selection. You take a nozzle and you create 10 random variations on the nozzle. You try out all 10. You keep the one that works best. You create 10 variations on that one. You try out all 10. You keep the one that works best. And after 45 generations, you have this incredible nozzle, looks a bit like a chess piece, functions absolutely brilliantly. We have no idea why it works, no idea at all. But the moment you step back from the God complex and you say let's just try a bunch of stuff, let's have a systematic way of determining what's working and what's not, you can solve your problem. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: Maybe the thing is that when you're in a situation where you can't test something over, over and over again, then the stakes seem so much higher - right? - because you don't get a do-over. HARFORD: Yeah. It's very common when you look at anything from people investing in the stock market to professional poker players to people who play the game show \"Deal Or No Deal. \" They all exhibit something called loss aversion. It's just this disproportionate anxiety that I'm losing this game. I went wrong somewhere. We hate admitting that and selling our shares in Lehman Brothers or whatever and getting out at a loss. We hate that out of all proportion to what the actual loss really is. And I think that is one of the reasons why people just keep on in a failing situation. RAZ: Which is pretty understandable - right? - because, I mean, a failure can be debilitating - right? - I mean, especially if it's a public failure like a career-damaging failure. HARFORD: Yes. And sometimes I think it really helps to try to to take the emotion out of the situation. I was really struck by the experience of the great choreographer Twyla Tharp who worked with Billy Joel and produced this musical called \"Moving Out\" about 10 years ago. It was 2003, I think. And it was a complete disaster. All the reviewers said it was awful, it was naive. She could have just curled up into the fetal position and said, oh, everybody hates me. But instead she said, OK. I've got to fix it. And so she just went through all the reviews, and she turned them into a spreadsheet, like, a checklist. How are we going to fix these things? Tick them off - one, two, three, four - just tick them off. And in a few weeks, the show was enormously better - ran for years, won two Tony Awards. And the critics couldn't believe it. But it was - she just viewed it almost as an engineering problem. And that was when she stopped the process of failing and started the process of fixing everything. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HARFORD: Now, I've been sort of banging on about this for the last couple of months. And people sometimes say to me, well, Tim, it's kind of obvious. Now, obviously, trial and error is very important. Obviously, experimentation is very important. Now, why are you just sort of wandering around saying this obvious thing? And I say, OK, fine. You think it's obvious. I will admit it's obvious when schools start teaching children that there are some problems that don't have a correct answer. Stop giving them lists of questions, every single one of which has an answer. And there's an authority figure in the corner behind the teacher's desk who knows all the answers. And if you can't find the answers, you must be lazy or stupid. When schools stop doing that all the time, I will admit that, yes, it's obvious that trial and error is a good thing. When a politician stands up campaigning for elected office and says, and I want to fix our health system. I want to fix our education system. I have no idea how to do it. I've got a half a dozen ideas. We're going to test him out. They'll probably all fail. Then we'll test some other ideas out. We'll find some that work. We'll build on those. We'll get rid of the ones that don't. When a politician campaigns on that platform, and, more importantly, when voters like you and me are willing to vote for that kind of politician, then I will admit that it is obvious that trial and error works and that. . . (APPLAUSE)HARFORD: Thank you. (APPLAUSE)HARFORD: Until then, I'm going to keep banging on about trial and error and why we should abandon the God complex. And since I started talking about this subject and researching this subject, I've been really haunted by something the Japanese mathematician said on the subject. So shortly after the war, this young man Yutaka Taniyama developed this amazing conjecture called the Taniyama\u2013Shimura conjecture. It turned out to be absolutely instrumental many decades later in proving Fermat's Last Theorem, prove one, you prove the other. But it was always a conjecture. Taniyama tried and tried and tried, and he could never prove that it was true. His friend, Goro Shimura, who worked on the mathematics with him many decades later reflected on Taniyama's life. He said he was not a very careful person as a mathematician. He made a lot of mistakes, but he made mistakes in a good direction. I tried to emulate him, but I realized it is very difficult to make good mistakes. Thank you. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: Tim Harford is an economist and an author. You can see his entire talk at ted. com. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GUY RAZ, HOST:  It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, ideas about failure and why failure can be good for us, even though when you're the one doing the failing, it can feel pretty horrible. And Tim, I should just mention here that I'm terrible with failure. You know, like, every time I've had a failure in life, I don't want to talk about it. TIM HARFORD: Yeah. Is that being terrible, though? It's perfectly natural for failure to really hurt. That's just being a human being. There's nothing wrong with that. RAZ: This is Tim Harford. He's an economist and a journalist who wrote a book about failure. HARFORD: To be terrible with failure is either to be so scared of it that you never do anything interesting, or alternatively to be so terrified of admitting it that you continue with a disastrous course of action and you just continue to fail because you keep telling yourself you're not failing. And that, to me, is what it means to be terrible with failure. RAZ: And Tim says people who are terrible at failure in this way suffer from something known as the God complex, this idea some people have that they're not fallible, that they're the experts. Here's Tim on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) HARFORD: I see the God complex around me all the time in my fellow economists. I see it in our business leaders. I see it in the politicians we vote for, people who in the face of an incredibly complicated world are nevertheless absolutely convinced that they understand the way that the world works. And this man, Archie Cochrane, understood this as well as anybody. Archie was a doctor, so he hung around with doctors a lot. And doctors suffer from the God complex a lot. And there's this one trial he ran many years after World War II. He wanted to test out the question of where is it that patients should recover from heart attacks? Should they recover in a specialized cardiac unit in hospital, or should they recover at home? All the cardiac doctors tried to shut him down. They had the God complex in spades. They knew that their hospitals were the right place for patients, and they knew it was very unethical to run any kind of trial or experiment. Nevertheless, Archie managed to get permission to do this. He ran his trial. And after the trial had been running for a little while, he gathered together all his colleagues around the table, and he said, well, gentlemen, turns out you're right. It is dangerous for patients to recover from heart attacks at home. They should be in hospital. And there's this uproar and all the doctors start pounding the table and saying we always said you're unethical, Archie. You're killing people with your clinical trials. And there's all this huge hubbub. Archie lets it die down. And then he says, well, that's very interesting, gentlemen, because when I gave you the table of results, I swapped the two columns around. It turns out your hospitals are killing people, and they should be at home. Would you like to close down the trial now, or should we wait until we have robust results? Cochrane would do that kind of thing because he understood that uncertainty, that fallibility, that being challenged, they hurt. RAZ: I wonder if this God complex thing happens, like, less and less nowadays, you know, like, in science and technology because people seem to be better at embracing failure, like, what we just - we just heard from Astro Teller - right? - that in Silicon Valley, failure is like a badge of honor. HARFORD: Yeah, Silicon Valley typifies that, the idea of evolving a website or any of the other things you can evolve through trial and error. That feels quite safe. And some people embrace that and say great, we can fail 10,000 times before breakfast and find the perfect solution. And I think one of the wonderful opportunities we have in the world today is that in many areas, it's never been quicker or cheaper to run experiments, to fail on an incredible industrial scale. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) HARFORD: Let's say you wanted to make detergent. Let's say you're Unilever, and you want to make detergent in a factory near Liverpool. How do you do it? Well, you have this great, big tank full of liquid detergent. You pump it at a high pressure through a nozzle. You create a spray of detergent. And the spray dries, it turns into powder. It falls to the floor. You scoop it up. You put it in cardboard boxes. You sell it at a supermarket. You make lots of money. How do you design that nozzle? Now, if you ascribe to the God complex, what you do is you find yourself a mathematician, you find yourself a physicist, somebody who understands the dynamics of this fluid, and he will or she will calculate the optimal design of the nozzle. Now, Unilever did this, and it didn't work - too complicated. But the geneticist professor Steve Jones describes how Unilever actually did solve this problem - trial and error, variation and selection. You take a nozzle and you create 10 random variations on the nozzle. You try out all 10. You keep the one that works best. You create 10 variations on that one. You try out all 10. You keep the one that works best. And after 45 generations, you have this incredible nozzle, looks a bit like a chess piece, functions absolutely brilliantly. We have no idea why it works, no idea at all. But the moment you step back from the God complex and you say let's just try a bunch of stuff, let's have a systematic way of determining what's working and what's not, you can solve your problem. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: Maybe the thing is that when you're in a situation where you can't test something over, over and over again, then the stakes seem so much higher - right? - because you don't get a do-over. HARFORD: Yeah. It's very common when you look at anything from people investing in the stock market to professional poker players to people who play the game show \"Deal Or No Deal. \" They all exhibit something called loss aversion. It's just this disproportionate anxiety that I'm losing this game. I went wrong somewhere. We hate admitting that and selling our shares in Lehman Brothers or whatever and getting out at a loss. We hate that out of all proportion to what the actual loss really is. And I think that is one of the reasons why people just keep on in a failing situation. RAZ: Which is pretty understandable - right? - because, I mean, a failure can be debilitating - right? - I mean, especially if it's a public failure like a career-damaging failure. HARFORD: Yes. And sometimes I think it really helps to try to to take the emotion out of the situation. I was really struck by the experience of the great choreographer Twyla Tharp who worked with Billy Joel and produced this musical called \"Moving Out\" about 10 years ago. It was 2003, I think. And it was a complete disaster. All the reviewers said it was awful, it was naive. She could have just curled up into the fetal position and said, oh, everybody hates me. But instead she said, OK. I've got to fix it. And so she just went through all the reviews, and she turned them into a spreadsheet, like, a checklist. How are we going to fix these things? Tick them off - one, two, three, four - just tick them off. And in a few weeks, the show was enormously better - ran for years, won two Tony Awards. And the critics couldn't believe it.

Thanks so much for joining us. RICHARD BEJTLICH: Thank you, Michel. MARTIN: So is what happened at the DNC this past week new in some way? And if so, what makes it new? BEJTLICH: What makes it new is the release of information. The fact that targets of interest are being compromised by a variety of actors - nation states, organized crime, activists - that has been happening for 15, possibly 20 years. What's different now is what intruders are doing with this data. Previously, they would seek to monetize it. They might seek to use it for their own geopolitical purposes. But privately, what's new, I think, about DNC is using this information publicly to influence an ongoing activity. MARTIN: Is there any particular entity at this point in our history that is most at risk? I'm thinking as a layperson. I'm assuming that intelligence agencies are most at - or most likely to be targets or our defense capabilities are most likely to be targets. But from your perspective, what do you think? BEJTLICH: Well, there are two types of targets in cyberspace. There are opportunistic targets, and there are directed targets, or targets that are selected because of who they are. If you're on the internet, you are at risk of being an opportunistic target, simply by the fact that you have a computer, that you have bandwidth. Someone at the very least could use your computer as a way to hide their identity when attacking someone else. On the other end of the spectrum, you have the military targets, the state targets. If you are doing something interesting in the world and you can think about people who would want to know what you're doing, there's a good chance that they're using some type of digital or cyber means to get access to that information. MARTIN: That is very disturbing. I want to go back to where we started our conversation. Is there anything about this whole story that particularly concerns you from a cybersecurity standpoint about a new level of intention or of capability? BEJTLICH: A line has been crossed here. The capability has been there forever. I guarantee you it was not that difficult to break into these various targets. They're not hardened like a military base. They're not hardened like a financial institution. What's different here is that someone is acting on this information. For so long, people have simply stolen information and they didn't want to be caught, so they wouldn't tell anybody about it. When you take that information and you publish it, that changes the game. We do need to take measures to explain to the other side that this is not acceptable. Just as we did in the Cold War, where if a physical, a human spy went too far, they'd be declared persona non grata and sent out of the country with maybe a sanction attached to it. We do need to have that sort of mechanism when people cross the line in cyberspace. MARTIN: That's Richard Bejtlich.

NPR's Pam Fessler reports. PAM FESSLER, BYLINE: A cyberattack on U. S. elections isn't as farfetched as you might think. Just a week and a half ago, Illinois election officials shut down the state's voter registration database after discovering it had been hacked. In June, Arizona took its voter registration system offline after the FBI warned it, too, might have been hacked, although no evidence was found. And in May, a security analyst in Florida, David Levin, was arrested after he gained access to the Lee County Elections website. Levin said in a YouTube video he was only trying to show how vulnerable the system is. DAVID LEVIN: Yeah, you could be in Siberia and still perform the attack that I performed on the local supervisor of election website. So this is very important. PAMELA SMITH: It's been our concern for a number of years that wherever you have a fully electronic system, there is a potential for tampering of some kind. FESSLER: Pamela Smith is president of Varified Voting, a group that's long called for more security. Smith says the recent Democratic Party hacks are another red flag that someone might be trying to interfere with election results, and there are many ways to do that. SMITH: If you can get at an election management system, you could potentially alter results or muddy up the results, or you could even just shed doubt on the outcome because you make it clear that there's been tampering. And the problem's exacerbated by the fact that U. S. elections are locally run with thousands of different systems and varying degrees of security. The good news is that a growing number of voters are using machines that have ways to double-check any suspicious results. Larry Norden is with the Brennan Center for Justice in New York. LARRY NORDEN: Today 80 percent of Americans will vote either on a paper ballot that's read by a scanner or on an electronic voting machine that has a paper trail that they can review. FESSLER: But that also means 20 percent of voters don't use a paperback system, including a large number in the key battleground states of Pennsylvania and Virginia. Security experts argue if those votes are hacked, it might be almost impossible to know. Norden thinks election officials have to take steps now to ensure it doesn't happen. NORDEN: Every single machine, before it's used, should get a thorough test to make sure that there aren't problems, that the machines are recording votes correctly, that nothing is missing, no names are missing from the ballot. FESSLER: And wherever possible, he says, there should be paper records to back up voter registration databases, which are increasingly online. Edgardo Cortes is the commissioner of elections in Virginia. He says his office has been spending a lot of time and resources trying to make sure the vote is secure. EDGARDO CORTES: We have somebody from outside come and take a look at our systems, look at access to those systems, look at how the data's stored, how it's housed, to come back and report to us and say, OK, here are the things that are working well; here's the things that you can improve upon. FESSLER: And Cortes knows how vulnerable voting can be. Last year the state quickly ordered some of its voting machines replaced after it was discovered they allowed for wireless access, which meant anyone could have tampered with the results.

And its Vacuum Cleaner Museum gets more than 2,000 visitors a year - that according to Tom Gasko. He's a former door-to-door vacuum salesman who now offers guided tours through nearly a century and a half of vacuum cleaner history. The oldest ones date back to just after the Civil War. GASKO: The original vacuum cleaners were developed before there were motors. The first ones used a crank - kind of like an egg beater. (VACUUM CRANKING)GASKO: It's an awesome machine. INSKEEP: Crank up the vacuum cleaner. Now, this museum houses more than 750 vacuum cleaners - or vacuum, as Tony Randall used to say. The first electric machines came out in the early 1900s, and Gasko has a few that still work. GASKO: One of my favorite machines in the museum was made in January of 1910 by the Royal company. He's 106 and a half years old. I'm going to start him now for you. (VACUUM RUNNING)GASKO: One of my favorites. MONTAGNE: He says vacuum cleaners were the first electrical appliances with a cord. Although, plugging them in was tricky. GASKO: So what you had to do was to get on a chair and unscrew the light bulb and connect the cord to the socket where the light bulb had been. It wouldn't be until the early 1920s when enough things that used electricity had been sold that we then had receptacles and plugs on the end of cords. MONTAGNE: For Gasko, vacuum cleaners do more than collect dust and dirt. They capture history. GASKO: For example, the 1950s vacuum cleaners would have tailfins. There was pinks and turquoise. Of course, the women in the ads, too, had 12-inch waists, high heels, pearls and diamonds, hair and makeup just done. INSKEEP: Tom Gasko of the Vacuum Cleaner Museum, where the collection sucks.

GASKO: The original vacuum cleaners were developed before there were motors. The first ones used a crank - kind of like an egg beater. (VACUUM CRANKING) GASKO: It's an awesome machine. INSKEEP: Crank up the vacuum cleaner. Now, this museum houses more than 750 vacuum cleaners - or vacuum, as Tony Randall used to say. The first electric machines came out in the early 1900s, and Gasko has a few that still work. GASKO: One of my favorite machines in the museum was made in January of 1910 by the Royal company. He's 106 and a half years old. I'm going to start him now for you. (VACUUM RUNNING) GASKO: One of my favorites. MONTAGNE: He says vacuum cleaners were the first electrical appliances with a cord. Although, plugging them in was tricky. GASKO: So what you had to do was to get on a chair and unscrew the light bulb and connect the cord to the socket where the light bulb had been. It wouldn't be until the early 1920s when enough things that used electricity had been sold that we then had receptacles and plugs on the end of cords. MONTAGNE: For Gasko, vacuum cleaners do more than collect dust and dirt. They capture history. GASKO: For example, the 1950s vacuum cleaners would have tailfins. There was pinks and turquoise. Of course, the women in the ads, too, had 12-inch waists, high heels, pearls and diamonds, hair and makeup just done. INSKEEP: Tom Gasko of the Vacuum Cleaner Museum, where the collection sucks.

Sure, you may have thought it was already gone. But last week, the Japanese Funai Corporation, the last factory maker of the VCR, announced it was stopping production. NPR's Alexi Horowitz-Ghazi looks back at the rise and fall of the machine that gave us control over what we watched. ALEXI HOROWITZ-GHAZI, BYLINE: First, let's hit the rewind button. (SOUNDBITE OF VCR REWINDING)HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Back before 1975, if you wanted to watch your favorite movie, say George Romero's \"Night Of The Living Dead,\" well, good luck. CAETLIN BENSON-ALLOTT: You could wait until it showed up on one of the few television stations. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: That's Caetlin Benson-Allott, a professor of Media Studies at Georgetown University. BENSON-ALLOTT: Or you also had the opportunity of waiting for your local revival theater to play \"Night Of The Living Dead\" again. But you had very little control. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Then, in 1975, Sony released the Betamax videocassette recorder. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: If you think network television is a little boring, start your own network. With the Sony Betamax, you can do just that. You can record what you want, when you want, and watch what you want, when you want. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: The next year, JVC released a competing and ultimately triumphant video format - VHS. BENSON-ALLOTT: Almost immediately, entrepreneurs realized that folks were really attached to their favorite movie that they wanted to watch them again and again just the same way they would re-read a favorite novel. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Hollywood Studios jumped quickly aboard the home video distribution bandwagon. But in the early 1980s, the technology was still expensive. BENSON-ALLOTT: Initially, VCRs were over $1,000 and cassettes were over $100. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: It wasn't until video rental stores started popping up that prices plunged and sales took off. (SOUNDBITE OF COMMERCIAL)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Nobody has the movie I want. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Hey, if it's on video, Blockbuster probably has it. I mean, we have over 10,000 videos. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Wow. UNIDENTIFIED SINGERS: (Singing) Blockbuster video. Wow. What a difference. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: In 1980, there were fewer than 2 million VCRs in American homes. And by the end of the decade, there were over 62 million. That led to an explosion in direct-to-video content, titles that would never have made it to the big screen or network TV. BENSON-ALLOTT: Opening up a huge market for horror movies and porn and kids videos were the genres that benefited the most from VCRs. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: And entirely new genres were created. Aaron Pratt, a co-founder of Yale's VHS Archives, says the adoption of the VCR by the middle class led to a content revolution. AARON PRATT: And so you start seeing how-to videos, video dating services and most notably, the glorious workout video. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)JANE FONDA: Ready and head right, and back, to the left, and down. Reverse it. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: For almost two decades, the VHS VCR ruled home entertainment, until the DVD arrived in 1997 with a slimmer box and a much better picture. Within five years, DVD sales and rentals had begun to eclipse VHS. And the last major studio VHS release was David Cronenberg's \"A History Of Violence\" in 2005. There are still enough video files and used VCRs floating around in thrift stores to keep the format alive for now. But even if the VCR does disappear along with the DVDs that replace them all in favor of streaming, Caetlin Benson-Allott says it was the VCR that started our love affair with on-demand content. So whether you're watching a YouTube clip on your phone or binge-watching the latest season of \"Game Of Thrones. . . \"BENSON-ALLOTT: That sense of access and entitlement - that's really a gift of the VCR. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: And that gift of choice, for better or worse, is here to stay. Alexi Horowitz-Ghazi, NPR News.

My colleague, social science correspondent Shankar Vedantam, is here to talk about the effects that social media has on our brains. Hi, Shankar. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: Hi, David. GREENE: Is this bad news you're about to give me? VEDANTAM: You know, it depends on your point of view. GREENE: All right. VEDANTAM: Researchers took teenagers, stuck them in the brain scanner and observed them as they engaged with social media. Lauren Sherman - she's a researcher at UCLA - she told me that she and her colleagues wanted to analyze the effects that social media has on young minds. They had the intuition that, besides all the conversations that happen on social media, there was something about mediums like Twitter and Instagram that was qualitatively different than interactions in the physical world. LAUREN SHERMAN: Suddenly, there are these interactions that have a little number on them, whether it's a like or a retweet or a favorite. And I was really curious how that quantifiable interaction was affecting the way that teens perceived information online. GREENE: I see. So we're looking specifically at, like, likes and numbers of likes. And, I guess, how much do they matter? VEDANTAM: Well, they matter a lot. Sherman and her colleagues, Ashley Payton, Leanna Hernandez, Patricia Greenfield and Mirella Dapretto, they scanned the brains of a few dozen adolescents as they watched what looked like an Instagram feed. The feed showed them photos that they had taken and photos supposedly taken by their friends. In reality, the other pictures were pictures the researchers had selected. Sherman and her colleagues found that when a photo had more likes, it generated greater activation in the reward centers of the brain. This was true of all photos, including photos the kids had taken themselves. SHERMAN: When teens saw their own pictures had received many likes, they showed a greater activation in an area of the brain called the nucleus accumbens. And this is an area that's part of the brain's reward circuitry. GREENE: Reward circuitry - that's the part of the brain that's making you feel good about yourself. VEDANTAM: Precisely. GREENE: Is this that surprising? I mean, if you see a photo and one of your photos that you took has a lot of likes, you're feeling good about yourself, so that part of the brain would be active. VEDANTAM: I think that is what you would intuitively expect to see, but the research also produced some really interesting nuances, David. Researchers manipulated the pictures supposedly taken by the friends of the teenagers so adolescents saw different pictures that were supposedly popular. So you might see a picture and see that it had 50 likes, and I might see the very same picture and see that it received only five likes. The brains of the teenagers responded very strongly to the pictures deemed popular, regardless of which pictures they were. In fact, the researchers asked the adolescents to themselves like photos that they admired. And they found that if a teen saw a picture with lots of likes, she tended to like it herself. If another teen saw the same picture with only a few likes, he tended not to like it himself. GREENE: Oh, interesting. So it really can have a snowballing effect. VEDANTAM: Exactly. And the remarkable thing is that this was also true of the photos that the teenagers had taken themselves. Rather than make up their own minds about which of their own pictures they liked, teens deferred to the opinions of their peers. So, you know, in some ways, this study is confirming what we've known - peer pressure matters a lot, especially when you're 14. GREENE: And probably when you're older, too. (LAUGHTER)VEDANTAM: That's right. GREENE: Shankar, thanks. VEDANTAM: Thank you, David. GREENE: That is Shankar Vedantam, who regularly comes on the program to talk about social science research.

TOVIA SMITH, BYLINE: When campers pulled up the driveway to the Cape Cod Sea Camps on opening day, they were greeted by a series of signs welcoming them and warning them. LILY HILDRETH: Send your last snap. Like, send your last text. SMITH: Sixteen-year-old old Lily Hildreth (ph) says going cold turkey was not easy.

WALLACE: They say when you hear your texts come in or your - a buzz, it's addictive (laughter). SMITH: Scientists continue to study what brain chemistry might be at work to make social media seem so irresistible. But meantime, Wallace says camps like his have been tweaking their rules, trying to find the right balance for kids who never disconnect. First the rule was phones for emergencies only on trip days. Then texts and calls were allowed on trips. But Wallace says the lure of social media proved too strong. WALLACE: It got to the point where it was just unmanageable. We were literally sinking, you know, in this morass of disciplinary situations. SMITH: Now kids are allowed a social media fix on trips.

AGIE CHAMLIN: This - I mean, this view - you definitely want your friends to see it. I mean how could you not want to brag about this? SMITH: But 17-year-old Agie Chamblin (ph) says when she's not worrying about selfies, she can actually be more herself. And she's made friends she otherwise wouldn't. CHAMLIN: Well, I think a cellphone's a virtual wall that you put up for yourself. You're on your phone, and it's, like, you don't need to communicate with this person. You just don't have to. SMITH: Sixteen-year-old Brooke Hackel (ph) agrees. What first felt restrictive now feels liberating, and it's completely cured her FOMO, or fear of missing out, that she gets from seeing everyone else's happy posts.

And today we have a couple who have been together for more than 50 years. The way they met so long ago is surprisingly modern. JOHN MATLOCK: We met through a computer dating service back in 1964. INSKEEP: That's John Matlock. In the early '60s, computer dating was a very new idea. Only a handful of services existed, and they used massive computers the size of an entire room to calculate compatibility. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: John and his future wife, Carol, both took a chance on the new technology. They filled out questionnaires about themselves and put them in the mail. Their answers were fed into the computer on a punch card, then they waited for a match. CAROL MATLOCK: You could have paid for just a year or two years, but I paid for life. MATLOCK: I don't remember how in the heck I joined, but I was kind of lonely. MATLOCK: You were in electronics, which is what I was working in, and that's why we were matched together. MATLOCK: Yeah. I got a packet which included pictures of three different ladies, and yours was one of them. I did call one of the girls - was not successful in getting a date with her. I don't know what her case was. But then I called and talked to you. MATLOCK: After we'd had several dates, I called the dating service. And I said, you know, I don't think you need to send John any more calls and I don't want any more either. I said, I think that we're for each other. But you didn't know I did this. So I. . . MATLOCK: I wondered why the well ran dry. MATLOCK: That's all that I cared about. It worked. You know, I was a single mother. And like most single mothers, you go to work. You come home. You take care of your child. And so one of the reasons I fell in love with you is because you loved my son and would be willing to accept him as your son. MATLOCK: I asked to adopt him, and he carries my name. MATLOCK: To me, that was the most important thing. And we've been together 52 years, December this year. MATLOCK: And who would have thought enrollment in a computer dating service. . . MATLOCK: (Laughter) Would lead to this. MATLOCK: . . . Would've worked out to that? MATLOCK: We've had a wonderful life together. MATLOCK: Yeah, we have. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"COMPUTER LOVE\")ZAPP: (Singing) Computer love. MONTAGNE: That's John and Carol Matlock in Portland, Ore. Their interview will be archived at the Library of Congress. Conversations like this one are also part of StoryCorps' new animated series, Who We Are. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  It's Friday when we hear from StoryCorps. And today we have a couple who have been together for more than 50 years. The way they met so long ago is surprisingly modern. JOHN MATLOCK: We met through a computer dating service back in 1964. INSKEEP: That's John Matlock. In the early '60s, computer dating was a very new idea. Only a handful of services existed, and they used massive computers the size of an entire room to calculate compatibility. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:  John and his future wife, Carol, both took a chance on the new technology. They filled out questionnaires about themselves and put them in the mail. Their answers were fed into the computer on a punch card, then they waited for a match. CAROL MATLOCK: You could have paid for just a year or two years, but I paid for life. MATLOCK: I don't remember how in the heck I joined, but I was kind of lonely. MATLOCK: You were in electronics, which is what I was working in, and that's why we were matched together. MATLOCK: Yeah. I got a packet which included pictures of three different ladies, and yours was one of them. I did call one of the girls - was not successful in getting a date with her. I don't know what her case was. But then I called and talked to you. MATLOCK: After we'd had several dates, I called the dating service.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"KUBO AND THE TWO STRINGS\")ART PARKINSON: (As Kubo) If you must blink, do it now. Pay careful attention to everything you see, no matter how unusual it may seem. If you look away, even for an instant, then our hero will surely perish. CORNISH: While the Disney and Pixar brands have become synonymous with Blockbuster animated films, the small Portland-based studio behind Kubo has been quietly making its mark. Since it was founded a decade ago, Laika Entertainment has earned three Oscar nods for animation for its films \"Coraline,\" \"ParaNorman\" and \"The Boxtrolls. \" The head of Laika is Travis Knight. He directed the film. Welcome to the program. TRAVIS KNIGHT: Thank you. Great to be here. CORNISH: So this character, as we mentioned, is a musician. He plays a kind of banjo. What is it? KNIGHT: Yeah, it's called a shamisen. It's a three-stringed instrument, kind of, like, the equivalent of a banjo, yeah. CORNISH: And when he plays, the characters from his stories come to life as animated origami figurines. KNIGHT: That's right. CORNISH: Give us some of the basics of stop-motion animation 101. Like, when I look at this little character of Kubo, is he a plastic model, a clay model? KNIGHT: Yeah, he's a little puppet. You know, the basic way it works is that you have a puppet. And they're typically made - they have a steel armature, which is, like, a little skeleton inside their body. And they're covered with a silicon skin. And, you know, they have cloth costumes. And in a lot of ways, it's like a live-action production house. It's just in miniature. We still have the same departments. We have, you know, costuming and hair, although in our hair department, we're actually creating the hair. And then we - you know, we move these things a frame at a time. And the thing that we've done differently at Laika is that we try to merge technology and forward-thinking innovation with this 100-year-old art and craft. And it's that fusion of those things that makes the productions look so interesting, I believe. CORNISH: The animation here is incredible. I mean, Kubo's journey takes him through, like, snowy, frostbitten landscapes. There's an ocean - a roaring ocean at the start of the film. And I've read that you've said that this isn't the kind of story typically people attempt to tell in stop animation. What are the challenges of, like, animating this range of landscapes? KNIGHT: I mean, where to begin? (LAUGHTER)CORNISH: Start with that water, for God's sake. I'm like, is this real water? Am I asking this question? Like, what am I looking at? KNIGHT: You know, at the beginning of the movie, you know, we recognized what this film was, which was it's a big, sweeping epic. And that's something that's really difficult to tell in animation, specifically in stop motion because the way we make these things, they're effectively shot on tabletops in a crummy warehouse in Portland, Ore. And, you know, we want to make it look like it's an endless, majestic vista, which is kind of absurd on its face. And so, you know, for things like the water, we ended up using panes of rippled shower glass that we would shoot, you know, a frame at a time. We had torn bits of paper that we'd use for cresting bits of water. One of my favorite things was we had this metal grid, and we covered it in garbage bags. And we moved it a frame at a time to give a sense of the motion of the waves going through the scene. And then we give that information to our visual effects department, and they start to blend that stuff with computers and with computer simulations. But when you see it on screen, it behaves like water, which is important for the audience to understand what they're looking at, but it has a stylized look driven by classic forms of Japanese art. CORNISH: I understand that the visual style is also influenced by the 20th-century artist Kiyoshi Saito of Japan. Can you talk about his style and how it influenced the look of the film? Like, what period, essentially, are you setting this in? KNIGHT: It is a period fantasy, so we're - we're blending a lot of different things. You know, we take elements from Edo-period Japan. We take elements from Heian-period Japan. In terms of the visual inspiration from Kiyoshi Saito, he comes from a tradition of, you know, woodblock printmaking that goes back hundreds and hundreds of years. And yet, he was always heavily influenced by Western thinkers, Western painters. And so he fused those things together in his art. And that's something that we try to weave into our environments as well. CORNISH: At the heart of the film is this little boy character, a character who's lost a parent, his father. And at one point, he embraces some new friends, one of which is a talking monkey played here Charlize Theron. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"KUBO AND THE TWO STRINGS\")CHARLIZE THERON: (As Monkey) We grow stronger. The world grows more dangerous. Life has a funny way of keeping things balanced. PARKINSON: (As Kubo) Monkey, do you ever say anything encouraging? THERON: (As Monkey) I encourage you not to die. CORNISH: Charlize Theron there and Art Parkinson playing the young boy. Now, how did you think about casting - because, as you said, this is set in fantasy Japan. Charlize Theron - not Japanese, obviously. KNIGHT: Also not a monkey. CORNISH: Also not a monkey. But other than, I think, George Takei, it is mostly white cast. And how did you kind of think about how you're going to put this together? KNIGHT: I think that, you know, we evaluate these things in a lot of different dimensions. But I think it's important to note that acting in live action and acting in animation are two very different things with very different considerations. You know, in a live-action film, an actor's, you know, gender or age or ethnic or racial background or physical appearance are - can be character-defining qualities. But in an animated film, that's not true at all. CORNISH: I ask because Western animation - I mean, cinema in general, frankly - doesn't have the best reputation in terms of representing Asian countries and cultures. And so, like, when you're trying to set a story in a place like Japan with these characters, how do you walk that line of kind of staying true to the atmosphere and the sense of place that you do so richly with the visuals without falling into stereotypes, right, without - without being neglectful about some of the aspects of the culture? KNIGHT: Oh, yeah. I mean, for the first two, three years of a project, all we're doing is developing the script, the story, the characters, the world. And as part of that process, you are, you know, diving really deep into regional and historical research to make sure that you're grounding your fairytale in the real world. You know, for me, I was 8 years old when I was first introduced to Japan. I tagged along with my dad on one of his business trips to Japan. And from the moment I set foot there, it was like I'd been transported to another world. It was so completely different than anything that I'd ever experienced. And so for me, that was the beginning of a love affair - a lifelong love affair with a great and beautiful culture. CORNISH: You mention your father being a businessman. How old were you when you first started working with any kind of crafts or doing art? KNIGHT: Oh, yeah, I've been doing it my whole life. You know, I was a fairly lonely kid growing up, actually. I made - I made friends slowly, when I made them at all. And so a lot of times I would spend alone. And, you know, a lot of that time spent alone I was creating. I was writing stories. I was making music. And it was just a way of expressing myself. It's something I've always been drawn to. CORNISH: Is it me, or do you and Kubo have a lot in common? KNIGHT: (Laughter). CORNISH: That childhood sounds oddly familiar. KNIGHT: We - we do have a lot in common. You know, he's - he's an artist. He's a musician. He's a storyteller. He's an animator, really, when you think about the way he brings these things to life. CORNISH: And lonely. KNIGHT: And lonely. And the - you know, the center of his universe is his mother, and that was true for me as well. And this film, you know, explores that time in our lives when those things begin to shift and then irrevocably change, when we cross the Rubicon from childhood to adulthood and the things that we gain and the things that we leave behind along the way, which can often be bittersweet. But it is a fundamental journey that we all go through. CORNISH: Travis Knight, director of \"Kubo And The Two Strings,\" thank you so much for talking with us. KNIGHT: My pleasure.

A few months ago, they found it, and it's nowhere near the ocean. For our summer series on waves of all kinds, NPR's Jon Hamilton looks at the science of creating perfect artificial surfing waves. JON HAMILTON, BYLINE: Forget Hawaii or Fiji. The spot surfers are talking about these days is a secluded pond in California's Central Valley. ROBERT WEAVER: It's just an amazing wave. HAMILTON: Robert Wingnut Weaver is a longborder from Santa Cruz. He is one of just a handful of people who have surfed this experimental manmade wave, which breaks 110 miles from the coast. WEAVER: And it was mind-blowing at how long the wave is, how big the wave is, and you can sense the power in it as it's rumbling at you. HAMILTON: Artificial surfing waves have been around since the 1960s at surf parks and resort pools. But most of them are weak and mushy compared to the natural kind. Weaver says the wave at this hidden surf lab is different. WEAVER: It's just like a normal wave. It really feels - I mean, you get that lift, that drop, and then you're starting to deal with performing with the wave as the wave is setting up in front of you. HAMILTON: Unlike an ocean wave, though, this one has an owner - the Kelly Slater Wave Company. Slater is an 11-time world champion surfer. He and his company aren't saying much about the technology used to create their wave, which they plan to market to surf parks around the world. But other wave-makers were happy to talk. Justin Enjo is an engineer at Surf Loch, an artificial wave company in San Diego. He shows me the pool where Surf Loch is fine-tuning its waves. JUSTIN ENJO: We're trying to carve water here. We're trying to make water exist in the shape of a ramp. HAMILTON: Kelly Slater's company does this by dragging a wing-shaped sled through the water. But that approach means surfers have to wait several minutes between waves. So Surf Loch is making waves with air pressure controlled by a computer. Enjo activates the device, which starts pumping out a wave every ten seconds. ENJO: As they hit the reef, they transform and they get that really hollow section. In the science realm, they call them plunging breakers. In surfing vernacular, it's referred to the tube or the barrel. HAMILTON: Surf Loch has yet to build a full-scale surfing wave with this technology, but it's founder, Tom Lochtefeld, has created hundreds of less sophisticated artificial waves for clients around the world. TOM LOCHTEFELD: One in particular was one of the sheik's palaces in Abu Dhabi. That one was definitely - and the wave itself was mammoth. I mean, it was a double, breaking left and right. HAMILTON: Even so, it didn't look or feel like a natural wave. Lochtefeld says that's because it's really hard to replicate an ocean swell in a small space. LOCHTEFELD: You don't have 75 miles or 100,000-200,000 miles to be able to generate the wave, so you got to compress that to the smallest possible footprint. That takes a lot of science. HAMILTON: Science that was out of reach just a few years ago. Lochtefeld says it takes a supercomputer to show precisely how a wave will interact with the underwater contours of a surf pool. LOCHTEFELD: When we do our really high resolution stuff, we're probably at 10,000 processors at 5 trillion calculations a second, you know, for a month (laughter). And it costs buku bucks just to run the thing. HAMILTON: Lochtefeld has big dreams for his artificial wave. LOCHTEFELD: We're going for the Olympics. HAMILTON: It's a dream shared by the Kelly Slater Wave Company. Both firms envision contests in which each surfer gets to ride an identical, flawless wave. Longboarder Wingnut Weaver has mixed feelings about that. WEAVER: You'll get to see the absolute best, who can do the best turn, the highest air because you'll have such a level playing field. But it'll never truly replace an open ocean competition. HAMILTON: The International Olympic Committee seems to agree. It's added surfing to the 2020 Olympics in Japan, but the competition will take place in the ocean, not a wave pool. Jon Hamilton, NPR News. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:  Surfers have long searched for the perfect wave. A few months ago, they found it, and it's nowhere near the ocean. For our summer series on waves of all kinds, NPR's Jon Hamilton looks at the science of creating perfect artificial surfing waves. JON HAMILTON, BYLINE: Forget Hawaii or Fiji. The spot surfers are talking about these days is a secluded pond in California's Central Valley. ROBERT WEAVER: It's just an amazing wave. HAMILTON: Robert Wingnut Weaver is a longborder from Santa Cruz. He is one of just a handful of people who have surfed this experimental manmade wave, which breaks 110 miles from the coast. WEAVER: And it was mind-blowing at how long the wave is, how big the wave is, and you can sense the power in it as it's rumbling at you. HAMILTON: Artificial surfing waves have been around since the 1960s at surf parks and resort pools. But most of them are weak and mushy compared to the natural kind. Weaver says the wave at this hidden surf lab is different. WEAVER: It's just like a normal wave. It really feels - I mean, you get that lift, that drop, and then you're starting to deal with performing with the wave as the wave is setting up in front of you. HAMILTON: Unlike an ocean wave, though, this one has an owner - the Kelly Slater Wave Company. Slater is an 11-time world champion surfer. He and his company aren't saying much about the technology used to create their wave, which they plan to market to surf parks around the world. But other wave-makers were happy to talk. Justin Enjo is an engineer at Surf Loch, an artificial wave company in San Diego. He shows me the pool where Surf Loch is fine-tuning its waves. JUSTIN ENJO: We're trying to carve water here. We're trying to make water exist in the shape of a ramp. HAMILTON: Kelly Slater's company does this by dragging a wing-shaped sled through the water. But that approach means surfers have to wait several minutes between waves. So Surf Loch is making waves with air pressure controlled by a computer. Enjo activates the device, which starts pumping out a wave every ten seconds. ENJO: As they hit the reef, they transform and they get that really hollow section. In the science realm, they call them plunging breakers. In surfing vernacular, it's referred to the tube or the barrel. HAMILTON: Surf Loch has yet to build a full-scale surfing wave with this technology, but it's founder, Tom Lochtefeld, has created hundreds of less sophisticated artificial waves for clients around the world. TOM LOCHTEFELD: One in particular was one of the sheik's palaces in Abu Dhabi. That one was definitely - and the wave itself was mammoth. I mean, it was a double, breaking left and right. HAMILTON: Even so, it didn't look or feel like a natural wave. Lochtefeld says that's because it's really hard to replicate an ocean swell in a small space. LOCHTEFELD: You don't have 75 miles or 100,000-200,000 miles to be able to generate the wave, so you got to compress that to the smallest possible footprint. That takes a lot of science. HAMILTON: Science that was out of reach just a few years ago. Lochtefeld says it takes a supercomputer to show precisely how a wave will interact with the underwater contours of a surf pool. LOCHTEFELD: When we do our really high resolution stuff, we're probably at 10,000 processors at 5 trillion calculations a second, you know, for a month (laughter).

NASA's next Mars rover mission isn't explicitly designed to look for life, but it will look for evidence life could have once existed on the red planet. And that poses a problem. Where could that evidence be? Ask six Mars experts, and you'll probably get seven answers. But right now, one of the leading suggestions for the next rover landing site comes from a teenager who hasn't yet finished high school. As part of his series Joe's Big Idea, NPR's Joe Palca has this story about a young man with some big ideas of his own. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: When I visited Alex Longo at his home in Raleigh, N. C. , the first thing I was curious to learn was when this precocious 16-year-old had become obsessed with Mars. ALEX LONGO: Well, it wasn't just really Mars. My first experience with space exploration was in 2005. I was just 5 years old, and Mom and Dad had me watch a space shuttle launch. PALCA: Watching that shuttle launch was the start. Alex decided not only did he want to go into space someday himself, he wanted to be the first person to walk on Mars. He began following NASA missions on the agency's website. And one day in 2014, he came across an announcement about the next rover mission to Mars. A. LONGO: I saw that they were looking for abstracts from scientists to suggest landing sites. And I decide, well, I'll write something up. PALCA: He figured - why not? He'd written to NASA before. A. LONGO: Each time, you know, they sent me cool space shuttle mission posters or patches or something like that. I was like, well, I'll write to them, and maybe they'll send me some cool stuff. PALCA: But then he thought, maybe he should tell his mom what he was planning. LAURA LONGO: He said, hey, Mom, can I send this in to NASA? PALCA: That's Laura Longo. L. LONGO: And I said, well, let's take a look at it. And I sat down, and it's this multi-page, like, scientific document. And I said, oh, honey, that's really cool, thinking he's going to get some more swag (laughter). It's going to be great. PALCA: Alex's proposal was to land in the same place NASA's rover called Spirit had landed, a place called Gusev crater. Spirit found some intriguing potential signs there was once life on Mars. Some scientists would surely say, been there, done that. But Alex argued Gusev was worth a second look. NASA apparently agreed because instead of swag, they sent him an email inviting him to attend the first landing-site planning meeting. A. LONGO: At first, I didn't believe it. I thought that it was a dream or something. And so I just got up, walked away. And a little while later, I came back, and that email was still there (laughter). I was like, wow, I actually just got invited to go to a NASA conference. How cool is that? PALCA: The meeting was in Washington, D. C. His mom and dad drove him there. Alex was scheduled to speak in the last session of the conference. A. LONGO: Honestly, I was a bit scared because there are a 125 Ph. D. s and grad students in that room. And I'm giving a presentation to all these people. L. LONGO: I was focused on breathing so I wouldn't fall out of the chair. PALCA: Laura Longo still beams when she recalls that day. L. LONGO: When he finished, the entire room burst into applause. Everybody recognized how special. . . A. LONGO: Yes. L. LONGO: . . . This was for this young person. PALCA: That was 2014. Alex has now teamed up with some more experienced Mars scientists who also favor going back to Gusev crater. Their proposal is one of eight finalists. Alex also wangled an invitation to a NASA-sponsored conference to pick a landing site for the first human landing on Mars. He figured he had to go to that. A. LONGO: Because if I really am going to be the first guy to go there, I want a say in where I'm going to be landing. PALCA: Well, makes sense to me. Joe Palca, NPR News, Raleigh, N. C.

Doing it while navigating U. S. immigration laws is even tougher. Some Silicon Valley business leaders have complained that immigration laws for foreign-born, high-tech workers effectively discourage them from starting new businesses or innovating here in the U. S. The Obama administration is trying to change that with a new proposal called the International Entrepreneur Rule, and we dig into that in today's All Tech Considered. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CORNISH: Nitin Pachisia is co-founder of Unshackled Ventures, a venture capital firm that exclusively funds immigrant entrepreneurs. And he is an immigrant from India. Welcome to the program. NITIN PACHISIA: Thank you. Glad to be here. CORNISH: Now, I understand that you came to the U. S. in 2005 on an HB1 (ph) visa for skilled employees. It's a popular visa in the tech industry. What happened when you tried to start your own company in the U. S. ? How difficult was that? PACHISIA: The first thing, when I spoke with immigration attorneys - I was told was I cannot do this because I'm - I cannot start my own company because I'm on the H-1B visa. That led me to talk to a number of other attorneys to find a way to be able to do it. And I had to stay in my day job and maintain that while working on my startup concept nights and weekends, until I was in a position to quit my job and be able to legally stay in the country. CORNISH: Now, 40 percent of Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or the children of immigrants. What do you say to Americans who are thinking, do immigrants really need help in this regard, seems like they're breaking into the business world just fine? PACHISIA: A lot of these companies were formed before the 2007 timeframe. What's shifted in 2007 was it took much longer to get to permanent residency, which when you get to permanent residency, you're free from the conditions of visa. I came to U. S. in 2005. I'm still on my H-1B, and I'm years away from becoming a permanent resident. CORNISH: So do you know anyone who's actually decided to open up their company in another country because of U. S. immigration laws? PACHISIA: I think one of the most popular examples is a company called Snapdeal, where the founders were at Microsoft and had to leave U. S. because they couldn't do this here and went to India and have created one of the largest e-commerce companies in the world. Personally, I know a number of founders who left U. S. to go to New Zealand or Singapore or Canada to start their companies because they were more welcome or the immigration policies there were more welcoming to entrepreneurs. And they all want to come back and do this in Silicon Valley. But they couldn't find a way to do this here. CORNISH: That was my next question. I mean, given the capital - the venture capital, given the culture of Silicon Valley and the market there, is the U. S. really going to lose business to other countries? It seems like part of it is kind of locked into the place itself. PACHISIA: There is a lot of attraction. And that's why I think we bring in the top talent from all over the world. The culture and the ecosystem that we have throughout the U. S. , not just Silicon Valley, is beyond comparison anywhere else in the world. But if the founder is forced to spend an inordinate amount of their time dealing with immigration policy, they will have to find an alternative way. And that's why some of these founders either left the country or they decided to stay as employees at big corporations. And what that does is, as a country, we end up losing opportunities of job creation because these talent people wanted to quit their jobs and start companies which create tons of jobs. CORNISH: Now, this startup rule from the White House - applicants have to show that they've raised at least $345,000 from U. S. investors. And they also have to have a certain amount of indication that they're going to hire X amount of workers - right? - show that they're going to grow. How do you think this rule is really going to make a difference? It has pretty narrow perimeters. PACHISIA: We don't think every startup will fall into meeting the criteria laid out by this International Entrepreneur Rule. But we think this is one more pathway that founders who meet the criteria can use. It's not a fix-all solution, but it's a step in the right direction.

FRANK FU: I thought it was a 3-D printer sales place. KELLY: Earlier this year, high school student Frank Fu stumbled upon Do Space, a technology library providing free access to powerful PCs loaded with software used by businesses and artists. There are 3-D printers and laser cutters. FU: It was exactly what I was looking for, and I never knew there was a place in - anywhere like it. And it turns out there's not. KELLY: There are no books in this library. But as director Rebecca Stavick tells visitors, it's a logical evolution from traditional libraries.

This vision of bringing technology to everyone in the community - it just gets people very excited. KELLY: This library was not funded by taxpayers, but by a coalition of Omaha philanthropists who donated $7 million to pay for computers, 3-D printers and bandwidth. Sue Morris speaks for the donors. SUE MORRIS: With one gig minimum to go up to 10 gig - to have that in a public building that's free, that's really amazing. That is unheard of anywhere. KELLY: That computing power also makes it a launch pad for entrepreneurs. MORRIS: Frankly, we know people run businesses out of this building, and we're OK with that.

Other public libraries are looking at this. The density of the technology and the scope and the ability for a variety of programming to be going on at the same time in one space is unique.

They say it's slimmer, sleeker and that the camera's better. And, yes, the rumors are true. There's no headphone jack. Users will have to use wireless headphones or Apple's lightning port instead. But the old plug-and-socket combination - the jack - has been around in one form or another for more than a hundred years. Jonathan Sterne of McGill University is here to tell us about it. He wrote the book \"The Audible Past: Cultural Origins Of Sound Reproduction. \" Jonathan Sterne, welcome to the program. JONATHAN STERNE: Thanks for having me. CORNISH: I gather the jack - it all started with the telephone, specifically switchboard operators in the 1880s. Is that right? STERNE: Yeah, 1888 is the first switchboard. And the idea basically is you'd pick up your phone at home. It would connect you to an operator who was wearing some kind of headset. And then you'd tell him who you wanted to call, and they'd plug a cable with two quarter-inch plugs on - one on each end. They'd plug one into a jack for your phone and one for the phone of the person you wanted to be connected to. CORNISH: Fast forward to the modern jack we all know about, which is even smaller than that, right? It's not that quarter-inch jack that we may know from, like, hi-fi sets or guitars or something like that. STERNE: No, no, it's a smaller jack. We don't know exactly when that was invented. The first widespread consumer use was transistor radios. The first one was 1954, I think. But it's likely that shape of the plug was in use in military uses before that and probably also for hearing aids, which is where a lot of advances in miniaturization happened. CORNISH: So what made it ubiquitous? What do you think it is about the technology that's helped it last for so long? STERNE: Well, I think it's a couple of things. One is with any kind of plugger jack - I mean, the same thing with the outlets in your wall - anything you can do to standardize is really useful unless you control the market. So if you want to make a new kind of transistor radio, and somebody's already invested in a good earphone, although they weren't very good, you'd want yours to work with their earphone. And that's why other formats, like USB, as well, because people want to be able to plug their stuff into the other stuff that they have. CORNISH: What are the odds that the headphones jack could finally go away? You know, whether it's rock musicians or your television, there are all kinds of places where this is the default technology. STERNE: I think it's highly unlikely in the near term that you're going to see it go away. But it is true that casual users who maybe only wear earbuds to go with their Apple products might eventually move away from them. CORNISH: Finally, Jonathan Sterne, why is this such a big deal? I mean, I know it's lasted a long time, but why do you think people are freaking out? STERNE: Well, I think it's a couple things. One is that the earbuds that come with originally iPod and the iPhone are still iconic in Apple's advertisement - so those little cables on the black figures that you see in the stores. The whole device has represented independence for people, I think - that you can do more on the go, that you're freer, that you're more flexible, that you're more available, that you're able to do different kinds of things. But at the same time, this freedom comes with a cost. And the cost is you're increasingly locked into the decisions of the company whose platform you use. And so the headphone jack, which - let's face it - is just another plug to plug things into, become symbolic of Apple's constantly changing products. And I think it's a little disturbing to people because it's a reminder that they're really not in control of their media lives. CORNISH: That's Jonathan Sterne.

You don't want to sit alone, but you also don't know who would be friendly, who might let you sit with them. Well, 16-year-old Natalie Hampton has been there. She's an 11th grader from Sherman Oaks, Calif. , and now the creator of a new app called Sit With Us. Natalie Hampton joins us now. Hey there, Natalie. NATALIE HAMPTON: Hi. CORNISH: So this is a great idea, but I understand it kind of comes from a sad place, right? I mean, essentially because you had a pretty lonely experience at lunchtime. HAMPTON: Yeah, I did. At my old school, I was completely ostracized by all of my classmates, and so I had to eat lunch alone every day. When you walk into the lunchroom and you see all the tables of everyone sitting there and you know that going up to them would only end in rejection, you feel extremely alone and extremely isolated, and your stomach drops. And you are searching for a place to eat, but you know that if you sit by yourself, there'll be so much embarrassment that comes with it because people will know and they'll see you as the girl who has nowhere to sit. So there's so many awful feelings that come along with it. CORNISH: You eventually changed schools, and you did make friends in this new school, but it sounds like you couldn't shake that feeling, right, that experience. HAMPTON: Well, I felt that if I was thriving in a new school but didn't do anything about the people who feel like this every single day, then I'm just as bad as the people who watched me eat alone. I felt like, with my story, it was my job to stand up and do something about all the kids who feel like this every day. And I wanted to create something that would address bullying, but in a positive way. CORNISH: So you get this idea for an app, and how did you want it to work? HAMPTON: The way that it works is it's a free lunch-planning app where kids can find lunch tables if they feel like they have nowhere to go. Pretty much, kids can sign up as ambassadors for a Sit With Us club and agree to post open lunches so that anyone who has the app and has nowhere to go can find a table and hopefully make some new friends. CORNISH: Now, it seems like the kind of kid who would do that would be the kind of person you could walk up to and say, hey, can I sit with you, so why have an app? Why not the low-tech version, which is just ask to sit down? HAMPTON: Because the way it was at my old school, I tried many times to reach out to someone, but I was rejected on many times. And you feel like you're labeling yourself as an outcast when you ask to join a table with someone you don't know. This way it's very private. It's through the phone. No one else has to know. And you know that you're not going to be rejected once you get to the table. CORNISH: So your app launched this week. Have you had a chance to see the app in action just yet? HAMPTON: So far, the results have been very, very positive. I had my first club meeting the other day, and everyone was very excited. And people are already posting open lunches at my school. So I'm very excited that things are already kicking off with a great start. CORNISH: Well, Natalie Hampton, thank you so much for speaking with us. HAMPTON: Thank you so much for having me.

I'm Guy Raz. So you probably don't think about this too much, but data is everywhere. SUSAN ETLINGER: Without even knowing it, we've sort of crept into this era where data all of a sudden is ambient. It's everywhere we go. RAZ: This is data analyst Susan Etlinger. ETLINGER: So as we walk around every single day, our locations are tracked. The apps that we use are being tracked. If you are on a website, anything that you do on that website is likely being tracked. If we walk by surveillance cameras, if we get in a car that has a GPS, you have any kind of medical device - run a red light, there's a camera, so data's everywhere. RAZ: Yeah. ETLINGER: Some people call this digital exhaust, you know, the idea that you're sort of walking around and these sort of particles of data are surrounding you all the time. RAZ: Just coming out of you, yeah. ETLINGER: That's right, everywhere we go. And I don't think it's possible for any individual person to truly understand everything that they are creating at any given time. RAZ: And, sure, we all kind of know this is going on. But increasingly, we don't have to understand it. As we'll explore this episode, technology is doing that for us. RICCARDO SABATINI: So in 10 years, the amount of information that you will have of yourself will be incomputable by a human being. RAZ: Which means we're learning more about our world. . . ANDREW CONNOLLY: These data will let us understand how we form. RAZ: . . . And beyond. CONNOLLY: . . . Our solar system formed, to understand our place in the universe. RAZ: But the trick is knowing the difference between a lot of data and too much information. KENNETH CUKIER: Data doesn't exist, OK? Information exists, and it's ephemeral. And when we capture it, it's data. RAZ: So this episode - Ideas About Big Data, taking huge amounts of information and making sense of it. ETLINGER: What's great about it is when we think about the ability, for example, to sequence the human genome or to look at the universe or the ways in which we could use data to look at epidemics and the spread of disease or even the spread of ideas, you know, that can make a tremendous difference. And so I do think we have this wonderful kind of tool at our fingertips. We just have to be, I think, a little bit careful with it. RAZ: Susan Etlinger returns later to describe why exactly we need to be careful. But first, let's just say big data is like - is like a super boring term, right? Like, I don't even know if people are going to, like, download this episode. CUKIER: It is the most vibrant thing happening in the world today. RAZ: This is Kenneth Cukier. He's a senior editor at The Economist and co-author of the book \"Big Data,\" where he wrote about how all that data flying off of us all the time, that kind of digital exhaust, is changing the way we live. CUKIER: If every aspect of living gets this shadow to it, this veneer of data, suddenly we can learn new things that we never could before. And I see it as part of this sort of timeless march that we've been on of improving our society by applying our reason to it and our technical skills to it. RAZ: And how our technical skills - they're really the skills we're building into our computers to process huge amounts of data in a way the human brain never could. Kenneth explained all this on the TED stage. CUKIER: So what is the value of big data? Well, think about it. You have more information. You can do things that you couldn't do before. One of the most impressive areas where this concept has taken place is in the area of machine learning, OK? Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence which itself is a branch of computer science. The general idea is that instead of instructing a computer what to do, we are going to simply throw data at the problem and tell the computer to figure it out for itself. And it'll help you understand it by seeing its origins. OK. In the 1950s, a computer scientist at IBM named Arthur Samuel liked to play checkers. So he wrote a computer program so he could play against the computer. He played. He won. He played. He won, because the computer only knew what a legal move was. So he wrote a small subprogram alongside it operating in the background, and all it did was score the probability that a given board configuration would likely lead to a winning board versus a losing board after every move. And then Arthur Samuel leaves the computer to play itself. It plays itself, it collects more data. It collects more data, it increases the accuracy of its prediction. And then Arthur Samuel goes back to the computer and he plays it, and he loses, and he plays it, and he loses, and he plays it, and he loses. And Arthur Samuel has created a machine that surpasses his ability in a task that he taught it. And this idea of machine learning is going everywhere. How do you think we have self-driving cars? We changed the nature of the problem from one in which we tried to overtly and explicitly explain to the computer how to drive to one in which we say here's a lot of data around the vehicle, you figure it out. You figure it out. That is a traffic light, that that traffic light is red and not green, that that means that you need to stop and not go forward. Big data is going to transform how we live, how we work and how we think. RAZ: OK, so, like, 50 years from now, what's something else that's going to improve our lives because of big data, like - you know, like something in our everyday routine? CUKIER: So an example will be I'll have a toilet, or I'll have a faucet that will be running water for me to wash my hands. When I do that, I'll probably have a sensor that will be taking a look at my cell follicles that come down. And it'll be analyzing my biochemistry. The toilet might turn out to be sort of the centerpiece of the home in terms of health care because you could actually monitor a stool sample on a daily basis. If we did it every day, we might learn something about the progression of disease that we didn't know before. And so where today that information doesn't help us because we can't spot the signal that predicts a pancreatic cancer two years out until symptoms exist, now we will be able to spot it because we'll actually have learned something new. We'll have done something at a different scale, in this case, analyzing people and their health. RAZ: That's amazing because that's just one small example. Right? So - I mean, are we talking about changes in the future on, like, a scale of the Industrial Age or the Information Age? CUKIER: OK. So it's a great question. The printing press was, in some ways, the first big data revolution because the time to produce a book and the cost of a book, you know, just fell through the floor. Immediately - the very first thing we started doing was we were printing Bibles, the same things that the scribes were writing. But it just cost a lot less. So we had more Bibles around. But when we had more Bibles in circulation, we had more people who could read it and more people who wanted to read the Bible. And therefore, we had a greater thirst for literacy. And there was a kind of a movement towards mass literacy. Soon thereafter, it wasn't about Bibles. It was the production of other works, new works, that we couldn't have ever even imagined. So the idea is that when we increase the amount of something - and here, the amount of printed works - we didn't just replicate what we were already doing and get the efficiency gain of lowering the price, increasing the volume. There was a state change. Likewise, I think, that we're in the very early stages of this same sort of revolution. You could consider it, if you will, the great Age of Discovery of machine learning and of big data. We're going to do entirely new things because of it. CUKIER: Now there are dark sides to big data as well. It will improve our lives, but there are problems that we need to be conscious of. And the first one is the idea that we may be punished for predictions - that the police may use big data for their purposes, a little bit like \"Minority Report. \" Now, it's a term called predictive policing, or algorithmic criminology. And the idea is that if we take a lot of data, for example, where past crimes have been, we know where to send the patrols. That makes sense. But the problem, of course, is that it's not simply going to stop on location data. It's going to go down to the level of the individual. Why don't we use data about the person's high school transcript? Maybe we should use the fact they're unemployed or not, their credit score, their web-surfing behavior, whether they're up late at night, their Fitbit, when it's able to identify biochemistries, will show that they have aggressive thoughts. We may have algorithms that are likely to predict what we are about to do, and we may be held accountable before we've actually acted. Privacy was the central challenge in a small-data era. In the big data age, the challenge will be safeguarding free will, moral choice, human volition, human agency. RAZ: So Kenneth, you're talking about things like my credit score and my sleep habits. And, I mean, all this is data that's being collected from me - from everyone. So I mean, is it even possible to opt out of any of this? CUKIER: I don't think you can. You could say, well, maybe this is similar to opting out of the internet. Well, you can do that. It's hard to live in the 20th century if you do, but it's possible. But I believe that big data, if you will, it's sort of like saying I want to opt out of the right angle or I want to opt out of mathematics. Life's already a complicated place. If you're going to be nervous about all of these features of living that are just going to be underneath the surface as the fabric of how things happen, life is going to become paralyzing. And I think we're in a transition, so I can appreciate why people are a bit nervous to it. But at the end of the day, if they wheel you on a gurney into the emergency ward and you have a choice - you can have the medical system of the Middle Ages, or you can have the medical system of the 21st century - you don't even have to know or care how this stuff works. You're probably just going to say yeah, give me the anesthesia and save my life because big data is going to transform so many features of our lives that we're all going to simply accept the modern because the outcomes, usually, will be far, far better than they ever could have been if we didn't. RAZ: I just wonder if big data is a gentler version of Big Brother. CUKIER: The true answer is maybe. The Snowden affair should give everyone pause. I mean, it was sad that it became politicized because what this fellow was saying was not that we were living in a turnkey totalitarian state but that we were laying the infrastructure for this to happen. Because if we're going to accept big data and all the benefits that we can use it for, we need limitations so that we can preserve our fundamental freedoms. And if we don't have that, then these technologies can absolutely be used to the detriment of human beings, and we can't let that happen. So to cap it, I completely respect the idea that big data seems like a repackaging of Big Brother. But we can certainly go beyond that simple dualism to deal with the real, substantive problems that we have. RAZ: You think that the benefits of this are so incredible that they just dwarf any downsides. CUKIER: No, I think that the benefits are just so incredible that we absolutely must address these downsides, or we can't unlock these benefits. And we would be a stupid society if we didn't get these benefits. RAZ: Kenneth Cukier is co-author of the book \"Big Data. \" You can see his entire talk at TED. com.

RAZ: And how our technical skills - they're really the skills we're building into our computers to process huge amounts of data in a way the human brain never could. Kenneth explained all this on the TED stage. CUKIER: So what is the value of big data? Well, think about it. You have more information. You can do things that you couldn't do before. One of the most impressive areas where this concept has taken place is in the area of machine learning, OK? Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence which itself is a branch of computer science. The general idea is that instead of instructing a computer what to do, we are going to simply throw data at the problem and tell the computer to figure it out for itself. And it'll help you understand it by seeing its origins. OK. In the 1950s, a computer scientist at IBM named Arthur Samuel liked to play checkers. So he wrote a computer program so he could play against the computer. He played. He won. He played. He won, because the computer only knew what a legal move was. So he wrote a small subprogram alongside it operating in the background, and all it did was score the probability that a given board configuration would likely lead to a winning board versus a losing board after every move. And then Arthur Samuel leaves the computer to play itself. It plays itself, it collects more data. It collects more data, it increases the accuracy of its prediction. And then Arthur Samuel goes back to the computer and he plays it, and he loses, and he plays it, and he loses, and he plays it, and he loses. And Arthur Samuel has created a machine that surpasses his ability in a task that he taught it. And this idea of machine learning is going everywhere. How do you think we have self-driving cars? We changed the nature of the problem from one in which we tried to overtly and explicitly explain to the computer how to drive to one in which we say here's a lot of data around the vehicle, you figure it out. You figure it out. That is a traffic light, that that traffic light is red and not green, that that means that you need to stop and not go forward. Big data is going to transform how we live, how we work and how we think. RAZ: OK, so, like, 50 years from now, what's something else that's going to improve our lives because of big data, like - you know, like something in our everyday routine? CUKIER: So an example will be I'll have a toilet, or I'll have a faucet that will be running water for me to wash my hands. When I do that, I'll probably have a sensor that will be taking a look at my cell follicles that come down. And it'll be analyzing my biochemistry. The toilet might turn out to be sort of the centerpiece of the home in terms of health care because you could actually monitor a stool sample on a daily basis. If we did it every day, we might learn something about the progression of disease that we didn't know before. And so where today that information doesn't help us because we can't spot the signal that predicts a pancreatic cancer two years out until symptoms exist, now we will be able to spot it because we'll actually have learned something new. We'll have done something at a different scale, in this case, analyzing people and their health. RAZ: That's amazing because that's just one small example. Right? So - I mean, are we talking about changes in the future on, like, a scale of the Industrial Age or the Information Age? CUKIER: OK. So it's a great question. The printing press was, in some ways, the first big data revolution because the time to produce a book and the cost of a book, you know, just fell through the floor. Immediately - the very first thing we started doing was we were printing Bibles, the same things that the scribes were writing. But it just cost a lot less. So we had more Bibles around. But when we had more Bibles in circulation, we had more people who could read it and more people who wanted to read the Bible. And therefore, we had a greater thirst for literacy. And there was a kind of a movement towards mass literacy. Soon thereafter, it wasn't about Bibles. It was the production of other works, new works, that we couldn't have ever even imagined. So the idea is that when we increase the amount of something - and here, the amount of printed works - we didn't just replicate what we were already doing and get the efficiency gain of lowering the price, increasing the volume. There was a state change. Likewise, I think, that we're in the very early stages of this same sort of revolution. You could consider it, if you will, the great Age of Discovery of machine learning and of big data. We're going to do entirely new things because of it. CUKIER: Now there are dark sides to big data as well. It will improve our lives, but there are problems that we need to be conscious of. And the first one is the idea that we may be punished for predictions - that the police may use big data for their purposes, a little bit like \"Minority Report. \" Now, it's a term called predictive policing, or algorithmic criminology. And the idea is that if we take a lot of data, for example, where past crimes have been, we know where to send the patrols. That makes sense. But the problem, of course, is that it's not simply going to stop on location data. It's going to go down to the level of the individual. Why don't we use data about the person's high school transcript? Maybe we should use the fact they're unemployed or not, their credit score, their web-surfing behavior, whether they're up late at night, their Fitbit, when it's able to identify biochemistries, will show that they have aggressive thoughts. We may have algorithms that are likely to predict what we are about to do, and we may be held accountable before we've actually acted. Privacy was the central challenge in a small-data era. In the big data age, the challenge will be safeguarding free will, moral choice, human volition, human agency. RAZ: So Kenneth, you're talking about things like my credit score and my sleep habits. And, I mean, all this is data that's being collected from me - from everyone. So I mean, is it even possible to opt out of any of this? CUKIER: I don't think you can. You could say, well, maybe this is similar to opting out of the internet. Well, you can do that. It's hard to live in the 20th century if you do, but it's possible. But I believe that big data, if you will, it's sort of like saying I want to opt out of the right angle or I want to opt out of mathematics. Life's already a complicated place. If you're going to be nervous about all of these features of living that are just going to be underneath the surface as the fabric of how things happen, life is going to become paralyzing. And I think we're in a transition, so I can appreciate why people are a bit nervous to it. But at the end of the day, if they wheel you on a gurney into the emergency ward and you have a choice - you can have the medical system of the Middle Ages, or you can have the medical system of the 21st century - you don't even have to know or care how this stuff works. You're probably just going to say yeah, give me the anesthesia and save my life because big data is going to transform so many features of our lives that we're all going to simply accept the modern because the outcomes, usually, will be far, far better than they ever could have been if we didn't. RAZ: I just wonder if big data is a gentler version of Big Brother. CUKIER: The true answer is maybe. The Snowden affair should give everyone pause. I mean, it was sad that it became politicized because what this fellow was saying was not that we were living in a turnkey totalitarian state but that we were laying the infrastructure for this to happen. Because if we're going to accept big data and all the benefits that we can use it for, we need limitations so that we can preserve our fundamental freedoms. And if we don't have that, then these technologies can absolutely be used to the detriment of human beings, and we can't let that happen. So to cap it, I completely respect the idea that big data seems like a repackaging of Big Brother. But we can certainly go beyond that simple dualism to deal with the real, substantive problems that we have. RAZ: You think that the benefits of this are so incredible that they just dwarf any downsides. CUKIER: No, I think that the benefits are just so incredible that we absolutely must address these downsides, or we can't unlock these benefits. And we would be a stupid society if we didn't get these benefits. RAZ: Kenneth Cukier is co-author of the book \"Big Data. \" You can see his entire talk at TED. com.

But sometimes, the conclusions we draw from data aren't perfect. SUSAN ETLINGER: A friend of mine tells a wonderful story about drowning deaths and ice cream consumption. RAZ: This is data analyst Susan Etlinger who we heard from earlier in the show. And she says, if you were to plot the data for drowning deaths and ice cream consumption over a given year. . . ETLINGER: Apparently, they correlate beautifully. RAZ: In other words, when deaths by drowning increase. . . ETLINGER: So does ice cream consumption. And when deaths by drowning decrease, so does ice cream consumption. And you start to think, well, do people tend to drown, you know (laughter), because they didn't listen to their grandma and they went into the water after they ate the ice cream? Do people tend to eat more ice cream to get over their grief about people drowning? You know, what's the story? RAZ: You can imagine the headline, right? - \"Ice Cream Causes Drowning. \" And just by looking at the data, you could plausibly come to that conclusion. But it would be the wrong conclusion because, of course, correlation doesn't always mean causation. There is something the data isn't considering. ETLINGER: The common factor is called summer (laughter), which both things happen. And so, if you don't have the context that there's a season and it's called summer in which it gets warm and people tend to like to swim and eat ice cream, then you miss the meaning. And that's a simple example, but imagine that compounded in everything that we know. RAZ: The idea here is that as we enter into this age where we rely more and more on machines to make decisions, Susan says we need to be more careful - that there's a lot that can go wrong in the space between gathering information and then interpreting it. ETLINGER: So in one view of the world, if the algorithm understands the concept of seasons - because we've trained it that there are seasons - and that January is in the winter and June is in the summer, then, yes, that would be fine. But, you know, we're in a world now where machines are learning with no previous context. And so we actually have to start from the very beginning and tell them all the things that we sort of know intuitively. RAZ: So does that mean that we're giving too much credit to data? Like, are we entering a future where people can say, hey, the data is telling us this? But actually, it's still so early in the data revolution that we're just ceding ground to people who say, well, here's the data - end of story. ETLINGER: See, I think we've always done that. We've always used data to kind of end the conversation (laughter). RAZ: It's like a blunt instrument. ETLINGER: It is. It's absolutely a blunt instrument. It can be used well. It can be used poorly. And we do need to be better critical thinkers so that people are responsible consumers of data and responsible producers of data because you can draw the wrong conclusions from a three-question survey (laughter) just as easily as you can from, you know, terabytes of data. And that's on us. You know, that's not about technology. That's not about the internet. That's on us. RAZ: Susan told another story about how the data doesn't always give all the details in her TED Talk. ETLINGER: My son Isaac, when he was 2, was diagnosed with autism. The metrics on his developmental evaluations, which looked at things like the number of words - at that point, none - communicative gestures and minimal eye contact, put his developmental level at that of a 9-month-old baby. And the diagnosis was factually correct, but it didn't tell the whole story. And about a year and a half later, when he was almost 4, I found him in front of the computer one day running a Google image search on women. . . ETLINGER: . . . Spelled W-I-M-E-N (laughter). And I did what any, you know, obsessed parent would do. I just immediately started hitting the back button to see what else he'd been searching for (laughter). And they were, in order, men, school, bus and computer. And I was stunned because we didn't know that he could spell, much less read. And so I asked him - Isaac, how did you do this? And he looked at me very seriously and said, typed in the box. He was teaching himself to communicate. But we were looking in the wrong place. And this is what happens when assessments and analytics overvalue one metric, in this case verbal communication, and undervalue others, such as creative problem-solving. RAZ: It's amazing because it really does speak to this idea that data can tell you things. But human understanding - human nuance is so different. ETLINGER: That's right. I mean - and I think, you know, in Isaac's case, you know, I'd say to my friends - you know, is he gaslighting us? Like, we feel like there's something going on that he's not able to express in, sort of, conventional ways. And the tests couldn't really detect that. But when he sat down with Google that very first time, it became clear that he was doing some problem-solving that was not what people would normally have expected. And therefore, it didn't show up on a test. And so, once we had this sort of different perspective on him - that, in fact, he was solving problems, just not in a conventional way, we thought, well, OK. What other problems can we solve in an unconventional way? And that kind of led us to a way of supporting him that we might not have come to otherwise. RAZ: So how do we approach data with a healthy amount of skepticism but still use it for good? More from data analysts Susan Etlinger in just a moment and more Ideas About Big Data. I'm Guy Raz, and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. RAZ: It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, Ideas About Big Data. There is so much of it in the world, and our technology can collect more of it than ever before. But we've been hearing from data analyst Susan Etlinger who argued in her TED Talk that data doesn't create meaning; people do. And that's where things get tricky. ETLINGER: So as businesspeople, as consumers, as patients, as citizens, we have a responsibility, I think, to spend more time focusing on our critical thinking skills. Why? Because at this point in our history, as we've heard, we can process exabytes of data at lightning speed. And we have the potential to make bad decisions far more quickly, efficiently and with far greater impact than we did in the past. And so, what we need to do instead is spend a little bit more time on things like the humanities and sociology and the social sciences - rhetoric, philosophy, ethics - because they give us a context that is so important for big data and because they help us become better critical thinkers. Because, after all, if I can spot a problem in an argument, it doesn't much matter whether it's expressed in words or in numbers. And this means teaching ourselves to find those confirmation biases and false correlations and being able to spot and make an emotional appeal from 30 yards because something that happens after something doesn't mean it happened because of it. As my high school algebra teacher used to say, show your math because (laughter) if I don't know what steps you took, I don't know what steps you didn't take. And if I don't know what questions you asked, I don't know what questions you didn't ask. And it means asking ourselves, really, the hardest question of all - did the data really show us this? Or does the result make us feel more successful and more comfortable? RAZ: I mean, speaking with Ken earlier - right? - with Ken Cukier, what he's basically saying is that this is where we're heading. We are heading to a world of massive amounts of data that will be processed and used to make our lives better. And yes, there may be some downsides. But the upsides of it will just vastly outweigh any potential fallout. ETLINGER: I hope so. But I also think that it isn't as simple as just saying, if we have more data, it's going to be better. And I'll give you an example. So in the U. K. , there was an app developed by the Good Samaritans called Samaritan Radar. This was about a year or so ago. And the idea was that if you're on Twitter, if one of the people that you follow tweets something to the effect that they're depressed or they feel hopeless, that it would send you an alert. And the alert would say, you know, your friend so-and-so is having a rough day today. You might want to reach out to them, see if they're OK. And so that's now available somewhere on a server. Well, what if their employer sees that? What if their insurer sees that, and they lose their insurance? What if a cyberbully sees that? What-if, what-if, what-if, what-if, right? And so I'm not saying that we don't do good things with data just because something bad might happen. But I do think we need to start thinking about the scenarios as we continue to automate the ways in which we make these decisions or we build these systems. RAZ: Yeah, I mean you could imagine data being totally manipulated to intentionally harm people. Right? Like, changing someone's data to frame them for a crime. ETLINGER: Yeah. And this is, I think, what makes this conversation so important. Any time we have new technology - you know, any time in history, whether it's the radio, which was, you know, at the time, some people thought it was the downfall of civilization (laughter) or it's television for the same thing - or the internet, back, probably, to the Gutenberg press. We stop and we worry that something is going to happen - something essential is being taken from humanity. And I think what we need to do, though, is to think about the ways in which the technology can serve us, but also, you know, be mindful of, you know - and have a set of principles that govern the way that we will and we won't use data. RAZ: Susan Etlinger - she's a data analyst. You can see her entire TED Talk at TED. com.

I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, ideas about how big data is helping us understand our world and ourselves. Do you think it's fair to say that human beings are basically, like, the equivalent of ones and zeros? RICCARDO SABATINI: Well, we are - I guess many people will say that we are a little more. But in a way, we are an expression of how nature is playing his own game. We are, in a way, a biological representation of an underlying set of rules that works with numbers. And for me, it's one of the most beautiful complexities that you can ever think of. It's mesmerizing. RAZ: This is Riccardo Sabatini. And by training, he is a physicist. SABATINI: Yep. I'm a theoretical physicist by training, indeed. RAZ: Riccardo works at a company called Human Longevity. And there, he applies physics to process, manage and understand one of the most complicated data sets out there, the human genome. SABATINI: That's the most amazing thing that happened at the beginning of this millennia. We started to have access to the digital representation of our genome. We started to digitalize matter. We have digital representation of atoms and proteins. We are starting to digitalize life. RAZ: And digitizing life, understanding the data that makes up our genome, means that we can study how to make our lives better and healthier. And it's something Riccardo has been working on for years now, as he explained on the TED stage. SABATINI: So for me, everything started many, many years ago when I met the first 3-D printer. The concept was fascinating. A 3-D printer need three elements - a bit of information, some raw material, some energy - and it can produce any object that was not there before. Then I realized that I actually always knew a 3-D printer - and everyone does - it was my mom. SABATINI: So my mom takes three elements - a bit of information is between my father and my mom, in this case; raw elements and energy in the same media - that is food - and after several months, produces me. And I was not existing before. Well, what amount of information takes to build and assemble a human? Is it much? Is it a little? How many thumb drives you can fill? OK. Now, you can run some numbers, and that happens to be quite an astonishing number. So the number of atoms - the file that I will save in my thumb drive to assemble a little baby, it will actually feel an entire Titanic of thumb drives multiplied 2,000 times. This is the miracle of life. Every time you see, from now on, a pregnant lady, she's assembling the biggest amount of information that you will ever encounter. Forget big data. Forget anything you heard off. This is the biggest amount of information that exists. RAZ: This is unbelievable. I mean, the amount of data it takes to create each human being - each and every single one of us will be the equivalent to 2,000 Titanics filled with thumb drives. Exactly. So could you even begin to compare the amount of data that we generate versus the amount of data that a computer generates? SABATINI: Oh, no, I think. I mean, the order of magnitude of how complicated we are is something that will eat every single database that we know. RAZ: Wow. SABATINI: In year 2020, we believe that we will have sequenced several hundred million genomes. And at that point, YouTube will look like a small hard drive of a kid. I mean, the amount of data that we will require to map the human diversity will overrun every single database that we ever encountered before. It's the biggest data that you can ever think of. RAZ: Yeah. So if each human is 2,000 Titanic ships filled with hard drives, how do you process that? SABATINI: Yeah, the nice thing is that nature is much smarter than than a theoretical physicist, so he found a language to embed and compress this complexity in a much compact form. And that's what is the DNA, the very fundamental part that give the instructions to make the 2,000 Titanic work. RAZ: I got you. So the DNA is like a compressed version of those 2,000 Titanics? SABATINI: So the DNA is much shorter, much more complex and much more compact. And in February, we decided to print it to actually show, in books, how large is an instruction manual, and it's about 3 billion letters. RAZ: Wow. SABATINI: And if you print them at character 6, happens to be 262,640 pages, the precise instruction manual to rebuild Craig Venter. RAZ: Craig Venter, the famous geneticist, who was, I guess, one of the first to map the human genome. SABATINI: Yes. RAZ: So you actually printed out the 3 billion letters of Craig Venter's DNA? SABATINI: Exactly. RAZ: And, like, how many volumes did it take? SABATINI: (Laughter) A hundred and seventy-five volumes of a 1,600 pages. RAZ: Like encyclopedia-sized. SABATINI: So welcome on stage Dr. Craig Venter. RAZ: And you wheeled these out, Craig Venter's genome. . . SABATINI: Yeah, yeah. RAZ: . . . Onto the TED stage. SABATINI: Exactly. SABATINI: Not the man in his flesh. But for the first time in history, this is the genome of a specific human printed page-by-page, letter-by-letter, 262,000 pages of information, 450 kilogram. And now for the first time I can do something funny. I can actually poke inside it and read. So let me take some interesting book, like this one. Chromosome 14, book 132. SABATINI: A-T-T-C-T-T-G-A-T-T. This human is lucky because if you will miss just two letters in this position, two letters over 3 billion, he will condemned to a terrible disease - cystic fibrosis. We have no cure for it. We don't know how to solve it, and it's just two letter of difference for what we are. So now that I have your attention, the next question is how do I read it? How do I make sense out of it? Well, for how good you can be assembling Swedish furnitures, this instruction manual is nothing you can crack in your life. And so. . . SABATINI: . . . We're going to use a technology called machine learning, OK? We build a machine and we train a machine - well, not exactly one machine, many, many machines - to try to understand what are the letters and what do they do. So we asked, can we read the books and predict your height? Well, we actually can with 5 centimeters of precision. Can we predict the eye color? Yeah, we can, 80 percent accuracy. RAZ: OK, just to break in for a sec - by using big data, Riccardo and his team can take a random sample of DNA, pick through billions of letters of genetic code and then predict the height, the eye color, all kinds of physical traits of the person that that DNA came from. They can even assemble those traits into a biologically accurate human face. SABATINI: It's a little complicated because a human face is scattered around million of these letters. We had to learn and teach a machine what is a face and embed and compress it. So we take the real face of a subject and we run it in our algorithm, OK? The results that I show you right now, this is the prediction we have. RAZ: So, Riccardo, you are showing this face on the TED stage. I was there. This computer-generated face of a woman, and it's side-by-side with her real face. And it was amazingly accurate. SABATINI: Yeah. That's what we are up to, to trace the information from the books to the body. And this is the biggest challenge of the millennium. SABATINI: So why do we do this? We do it because the same technology and the same approach, the machine learning off this code is helping us to understand how we work, how your body work, how your body ages, how disease generate in your body, how your cancer grow and develop, how drugs work and if they work on your body. It's called personalized medicine. It is a particularly complicated challenge. The more we will learn, every time we will be confronted with decisions that we never had to face before about life, about death, about parenting. This must be a global conversation. We must start to think the future we're building as a humanity without fear but with the understanding that the decisions that we will take in the next year will change the course of history forever. RAZ: In the future, Riccardo says, the same technology that can predict a face from a DNA sample today could be used to predict and treat disease. In fact, some of that future is already here. You might have even heard about technology that allows anyone to sequence their genome and identify potential health problems. But as with any massive data set, interpreting that information is pretty tricky. So you've had your genome sequenced, right? You've done this. SABATINI: I did. I did. And it was an interesting time. RAZ: What happened? SABATINI: So, I mean, I had a couple of interesting results, some cardiovascular complications that are, let's say, present in my family but we've never been able to explain. And so there is this information, even for a professional. It's not something you should read by yourself because. . . RAZ: Yeah. SABATINI: . . . At the beginning, I was, oh, my God, I'm going to die tomorrow. RAZ: You freaked out. SABATINI: (Laughter) Yeah. RAZ: Yeah, it's understandable, right? I mean, there's all this information staring you right in the face. SABATINI: But in reality, when you chat with the doctor and you are in a clinic, you discover that it's something that medicine developed lots of therapeutics around it. And I would rather prefer to know it than not because not means not taking actions and letting the roll of the dice know when or how your complications are growing. Now I have control of it. RAZ: Yeah. So when you look down the road, like, five or 10 or 20 years from now - right? - how will the world be different? Because humans will finally have unlocked the ability to read and analyze and maybe even change the biggest source of data in the world, which is our genome. SABATINI: So we survive and we have medicine that is amazing today and what we believe is amazing. But in 20 years, personalized medicine will really take the lead. It means every doctor and every pill that we will ever take, we'll know exactly if it will work or not for our genome, for our body. And it will be so embedded in the mind of our future generation, that our kids will laugh at us on how we survive on a medicine that is not based on these assumptions. And it will be a cultural moment where precision medicine will be the verb and the past will look like we're in the caves, trying to understand how to switch on the fire. RAZ: Data scientist Riccardo Sabatini. You can see his entire talk and how his team can predict faces from DNA at TED. com. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)(SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)(APPLAUSE)(SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)(LAUGHTER)(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)(SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)(SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) GUY RAZ, HOST:  It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, ideas about how big data is helping us understand our world and ourselves. Do you think it's fair to say that human beings are basically, like, the equivalent of ones and zeros? RICCARDO SABATINI: Well, we are - I guess many people will say that we are a little more. But in a way, we are an expression of how nature is playing his own game. We are, in a way, a biological representation of an underlying set of rules that works with numbers. And for me, it's one of the most beautiful complexities that you can ever think of. It's mesmerizing. RAZ: This is Riccardo Sabatini. And by training, he is a physicist. SABATINI: Yep. I'm a theoretical physicist by training, indeed. RAZ: Riccardo works at a company called Human Longevity. And there, he applies physics to process, manage and understand one of the most complicated data sets out there, the human genome. SABATINI: That's the most amazing thing that happened at the beginning of this millennia. We started to have access to the digital representation of our genome. We started to digitalize matter. We have digital representation of atoms and proteins. We are starting to digitalize life. RAZ: And digitizing life, understanding the data that makes up our genome, means that we can study how to make our lives better and healthier. And it's something Riccardo has been working on for years now, as he explained on the TED stage. SABATINI: So for me, everything started many, many years ago when I met the first 3-D printer. The concept was fascinating. A 3-D printer need three elements - a bit of information, some raw material, some energy - and it can produce any object that was not there before. Then I realized that I actually always knew a 3-D printer - and everyone does - it was my mom. SABATINI: So my mom takes three elements - a bit of information is between my father and my mom, in this case; raw elements and energy in the same media - that is food - and after several months, produces me. And I was not existing before. Well, what amount of information takes to build and assemble a human? Is it much? Is it a little? How many thumb drives you can fill? OK. Now, you can run some numbers, and that happens to be quite an astonishing number. So the number of atoms - the file that I will save in my thumb drive to assemble a little baby, it will actually feel an entire Titanic of thumb drives multiplied 2,000 times.

(SOUNDBITE OF ENGINE CRANK)AREHART: John Hopkins has been working on antique cars here for nearly 20 years. He starts a 1914 gas car, the classic black Ford Model T. He turns a crank at the front of the car. It takes a couple of tries and some elbow grease. JOHN HOPKINS: But you don't want to push down because then if it decides to come up, that's when it can break your arm. (SOUNDBITE OF ENGINE IGNITION)AREHART: For buyers who want a car that's a little less dangerous to start, there's the long, green 1913 Stanley steam car. It has its own drawbacks, Hopkins says, as he grabs a blowtorch to spark the igniter fuel under the hood. (SOUNDBITE OF STEAM HISSING)AREHART: It's like a kettle on a stove top. The water in the tank has to heat up before the steam can power the engine. This takes 45 minutes, sometimes longer.

S. products safety authorities are now recalling Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phones over exploding batteries - this after Samsung tried a voluntary recall for 2. 5 million devices worldwide. NPR's Alina Selyukh reports that that process left some customers winding through a maze of stores, company representatives and unclear guidelines. ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE: For almost two weeks, Samantha Cannariato has been trying to return her potentially combustible phone. SAMANTHA CANNARIATO: So we're talking about eight attempts, five store visits, three - no, we're on four phone calls now. And that doesn't count all the time that I've spent on Facebook, on Twitter, in email. SELYUKH: She has spent more than 16 hours trying to take part in Samsung's recall of the Galaxy Note 7. It's been a dance between a phone carrier store and the authorized retailer that actually sold her the phone. CANNARIATO: Every time I go in there, there is a brand-new reason why they can't do it this time. SELYUKH: The first one came just a few days after Samsung said it would exchange the smartphones over reports of batteries catching fire. Cannariato rushed her phone to the first of what will be a series of store clerks. CANNARIATO: He asked me, well, is your phone experiencing the issue? And I was like, no; It hasn't exploded yet (laughter). SELYUKH: From here, you can imagine how the story spirals out. CANNARIATO: I went Sunday afternoon. He said that I could not return it there. I kind of pushed back a little bit because. . . They can't access my account. I've been on the phone for an hour during lunch, and their system was down. Can you come back tomorrow? SELYUKH: And meanwhile, you're still using the Samsung Galaxy Note 7. CANNARIATO: Yeah. When I charge it, I put it in a metal meatloaf pan (laughter) on the floor. SELYUKH: There have been at least 92 reports in the United States of Note 7 batteries overheating. More than a quarter of the incidents caused burns, and almost two-thirds damaged property. That's why Cannariato is frustrated. Other users' stories shared online run the gamut from completely smooth exchanges to small hiccups to utter confusion. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ELLIOT KAYE: It's not a recipe for a successful recall for a company to go out on on its own. SELYUKH: This is Elliot Kaye, and he sounds frustrated because he's the head of the Consumer Product Safety Commission. It's the agency that facilitates U. S. recalls. And for almost two weeks, Samsung's recall was not coordinated with the commission. (SOUNDBTIE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KAYE: Anybody who thinks that a company going out on its own is going to provide the best recall for that company and, more importantly, for the consumer needs to have more than their phone checked. SELYUKH: This comment came during a press conference where the government announced the recall. This means there is now a streamlined process to report incidents and return the phones. Also, users are now offered both an exchange or a refund, and it's now illegal to sell the phone. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TIM BAXTER: And we will work every day to earn back your trust. SELYUKH: Samsung has now released this video with an apology for the battery defects and says a revamped, safer Note 7 will be on sale next week.

That's why Cannariato is frustrated. Other users' stories shared online run the gamut from completely smooth exchanges to small hiccups to utter confusion. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ELLIOT KAYE: It's not a recipe for a successful recall for a company to go out on on its own. SELYUKH: This is Elliot Kaye, and he sounds frustrated because he's the head of the Consumer Product Safety Commission. It's the agency that facilitates U. S. recalls. And for almost two weeks, Samsung's recall was not coordinated with the commission. (SOUNDBTIE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KAYE: Anybody who thinks that a company going out on its own is going to provide the best recall for that company and, more importantly, for the consumer needs to have more than their phone checked. SELYUKH: This comment came during a press conference where the government announced the recall. This means there is now a streamlined process to report incidents and return the phones. Also, users are now offered both an exchange or a refund, and it's now illegal to sell the phone. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TIM BAXTER: And we will work every day to earn back your trust. SELYUKH: Samsung has now released this video with an apology for the battery defects and says a revamped, safer Note 7 will be on sale next week. And Cannariato says, after all of her trouble, she's still excited to get a new one. Alina Selyukh, NPR News.", "section": "Technology", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.

We wanted to find out more about the future of this technology and the risks, so we've called on Timothy Carone. He's a professor at the University of Notre Dame, and he wrote the book \"Future Automation: Changes To Lives And To Businesses. \" and he's with us now. Thank you so much for joining us. TIMOTHY CARONE: Thank you for having me, Michel. MARTIN: So people might have a picture in their mind about self-driving cars. Before we get into the details, can you just tell us a little bit about where the technology is now compared to what people might imagine? CARONE: Well, the technology is at a - I'll call it a hyper cruise control, where cars can control their driving and their movement down basic, you know, either highways or streets with traffic lights and kind of the normal pedestrian traffic. So you think about kind of the normal traffic patterns you encounter, say, driving to work. The cars are getting good enough to handle those situations. What they don't do is they're not capable of true autonomous operations. They cannot - you cannot get into a car today and tell it where to go and then sit back, fall asleep for three hours when it takes you to work. That kind of capability is not present. MARTIN: You know, to that end, Alex Davies from wired. com rode in one of these test-run vehicles on Wednesday. We talked to him earlier, and he talked about, you know, what the guy in the front - or person in the front seat - actually does. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)ALEX DAVIES: Throughout our ride, the engineer would take over maybe every three, four or five minutes. They're taking over in the parts where they're not completely confident in the car's ability to drive safely or to even drive intelligently at points. MARTIN: Well, you know, taking over, I have to say, every three, four or five minutes - you're kind of doing a lot of driving there. That doesn't seem very driverless to me. CARONE: Right. And I think this is a great way for people to see how far the driverless technology truly is. You know, for example, the Uber cars cannot change lanes, so that three to four minutes could potentially be changing lanes in various turns in difficult situations that, you know, we find simple, but the Uber technology isn't quite prepared to do so. You know, the cars aren't quite there yet, so having the driver in the car is absolutely key, I think, for the evolution of driverless cars to go to that next level. MARTIN: So when do you think - and I - forgive me. I'm asking you to speculate now. When do you think this all comes to fruition? When will getting that driver's license cease to be a rite of passage? CARONE: I would start to look in about five to eight years to start to see demonstrable changes in that. You know, just like people, you know, the millennials and the younger generation they no longer opt for land phone lines when they get an apartment for the first time. They have their cell phone. They don't need a landline anymore. And that's what's going to start to show up are people who eventually, you know - when people come to that age, their parents are going to say, you know what? You got an app on your phone to get whatever car you need. Let's save on insurance and let's save on everything and you just - you can get the car you need when you need it. And I think we'll start to see that, say, five years out. MARTIN: That's Timothy Carone. He teaches at the University of Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business.

On Capitol Hill this week, the House Intelligence Committee wrapped up a two-year investigation of Snowden and concluded he is, quote, \"a serial exaggerator who caused tremendous damage to national security. \" That's one view. The other comes from the director Oliver Stone. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"SNOWDEN\")JOSEPH GORDON-LEVITT: (As Edward Snowden) The NSA is really tracking every cellphone in the world. SIMON: \"Snowden,\" the movie, opened this weekend, and it portrays Mr. Snowden as a hero. NPR's Mary Louise Kelly got to wondering how all of this plays out at the NSA. So she called the man who became the public face of the agency when the Snowden story broke. MARY LOUISE KELLY, BYLINE: Chris Inglis has never actually met Edward Snowden, which is the first of many bones he has to pick with the new movie. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"SNOWDEN\")GORDON-LEVITT: (As Edward Snowden) The deputy director of the NSA offered me a new position. KELLY: That's the actor playing Snowden. There's a scene where the NSA Deputy Director asks Snowden to go to Hawaii and lead a big project. The deputy director at the time, in real life, was Chris Inglis. CHRIS INGLIS: It's preposterous on its face for many reasons. KELLY: Among them, says Inglis. . . INGLIS: . . . That a deputy director would reach down to a contractor who is performing an important but relatively low-level function and ask them to take on a Jason Bourne-like activity. It simply exceeds all propriety. KELLY: Chris Inglis allows that \"Snowden\" the movie will shape public perceptions about Snowden the man, that it can shift public opinion on who's the hero and who's the villain in the ongoing drama over the top-secret files Snowden leaked and what damage they may have caused. The movie never claims to be a documentary. Inglis points out, one of the opening shots announces it's a dramatization of actual events. INGLIS: Dramatization, to me, means you add the occasional exclamation point, you bring in a musician to perhaps add some background music, but you don't tell a story that is fiction. KELLY: Asked what other aspects of the movie strike him as fiction, Inglis says it portrays NSA staffers as cavalier and uncaring about people's right to privacy, which he says is not true. Inglis also points to this scene. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"SNOWDEN\")RHYS IFANS: (As Corbin O'Brian) We're going to start with an aptitude test. KELLY: Snowden and his fellow recruits at the CIA - yes, Snowden worked there, too - are assigned to build a covert communications network. Average time to complete the test - five hours - not Snowden. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"SNOWDEN\")GORDON-LEVITT: (As Edward Snowden) I finished the whole thing. IFANS: (As Corbin O'Brian) It's been 40 minutes. GORDON-LEVITT: (As Edward Snowden) Thirty-eight. IFANS: (As Corbin O'Brian) What? GORDON-LEVITT: (As Edward Snowden) Thirty-eight minutes. KELLY: Former NSA number two, Chris Inglis, rolls his eyes at this scene. INGLIS: Clearly, a clever person, but NSA makes a habit of hiring smart people, extremely smart people, also principled people. So he was clearly the former. It turns out he wasn't the latter. KELLY: OK, by now, you've gathered where Inglis lands in the is Snowden a patriot or a traitor debate. Chris Inglis served 28 years at the NSA. He is the first to admit he's not impartial. His is one of many voices NPR is airing this week, supporters and critics, weighing in both on the new movie and a new campaign for Snowden to be granted a presidential pardon. Snowden declined our request for an interview, as did the current leaders of the NSA. Inglis says, he can't speak for them, but he says he is open to viewing Snowden and his motives as complicated. INGLIS: I do see him as a more nuanced character somewhere, you know, there was an attempt - or perhaps an intent on his part to do something noble. KELLY: Chris Inglis acknowledges the NSA should have been more transparent about its domestic surveillance activities since 9/11. INGLIS: But we've listened to Edward Snowden. We've heard what he had to say. We took that moment to kind of examine, to be introspective about, you know, what is it that he might be talking about that we need to take heed of and do something about. And then, having considered all of that, as we must, we've moved on. And so NSA is looking forward. KELLY: In real life, Snowden remains in exile in Moscow. He communicates via Twitter and video link. This week he weighed in, via video, saying he hopes the film will reach a new audience on, quote, \"the issues that matter the most. \" He also said, I love my country.

We were both, I mean, at that point, like, running on zero sleep for two days, just devastated. And I was like, this is it. We built this great thing, and we totally messed it up. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GUY RAZ, HOST: From NPR, it's HOW I BUILT THIS, a show about innovators, entrepreneurs, idealists and the stories behind the movements they built. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: On today's show - how a walk along the beach sparked an idea that turned all of us into good photographers and made Instagram one of the fastest-growing apps of all time. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: OK, it's 2009 and Kevin Systrom is just a few years out of Stanford and doing the Silicon Valley thing. He's working at a travel startup by day and teaching himself to code at night. And a friend from college, Mike Krieger, is also in the area, pretty much doing the same thing. And after a few months of experimenting, Kevin builds an app. He calls it Burbn, and it's a check-in app where you can tell your friends you're at a coffee shop or a bar or wherever. And Kevin thinks this app has, you know, some potential. KEVIN SYSTROM: I mean, at that time, there were so many check-in apps. There was foursquare. There was Gowalla. And there were a bunch of others trying to make it. And, of course, following, you know, kind of the trend, I was like, there's something here about the devices in everyone's pockets being available to share new types of information. And I was like, location is the type of information people are going to want to share. I think the insight Mike and I had along the way was that, actually, there were more types of information. The fact that, like, these devices had a camera, that would lead to our visual communication revolution, where, like, all of a sudden, people weren't just communicating with text and voice, but they had the chance to communicate with an image. But initially, our bet was on location. And I'm frankly just very happy that we discovered the image along the way. RAZ: So people were using this app? SYSTROM: Yeah. And, you know, it was just compelling enough to get, like, a handful of beta users, but I would, you know, basically come home at night and just tinker with this idea. And, you know, along the way, I prototyped it enough that I was willing to give it to a handful of friends. And those friends gave it to a handful of friends. And before you knew it, we had - I don't know - maybe 80, 90 people using it. And only at that moment did I decide that, like, hey, maybe this thing could be a company if we actually tried. RAZ: Then, like, at what point did you say, we - we should try to, like, raise some money for this? SYSTROM: I went to a bar where a bunch of investors were getting together. And, like, I kind of mingled around the room, and, you know, people were kind of showing their prototypes on their phones to different investors. And I showed it to this one investor. His name's Steve Anderson. He was one of our first investors. And he was like, this pretty cool. Let's set up coffee. You know, we can meet up, and you can tell me more about the app. And that was, like, the biggest accomplishment to date. I was like, oh, my god, there's an investor who's willing to talk to us. RAZ: Yeah. SYSTROM: So I went, and I had that coffee, and I sat down. And as - as we were talking, actually, I had an alert that would alert on my phone every time someone signed up because I was really excited when we went from 80 users to 85 users to 90 users. And as I'm sitting there with him, like, a bunch of people are signing up. And I wasn't entirely sure why, but he looked at me and was like, did you plan this - like, that you would have a bunch of people sign up while you were demoing to me? And I said, no, I, like, honestly don't know who these people are. And he looks at me. He's like, all right, count me in. But he actually said one thing to me. He goes, before I do this, you have to find a co-founder that's willing to do this with you. And at that moment I was like, all right, got to find someone awesome to kind of partner with and make this all happen. RAZ: So, Mike, how did you guys - like, I mean, how did this happen? Like, you came to Kevin, you were like, I like this thing; it's cool. I want to work with you. I mean did you - was it more formal than that? KRIEGER: I think where it came from was we had a kind of shared kindred spirit of tinkering. So on the weekends, a lot of times I would be at Coffee Bar, which is this great coffee shop here in San Francisco, and I'd be working on iPhone apps just for fun. And Burbn - the check-in in itself I didn't find as compelling, but having a sort of visual status was really compelling. So I got excited enough that I think I - yeah, I came up to Kevin. I was like, look, if you ever do this for real, like, let's have a conversation. And I think that first meeting we had about it, actually, I was like, count me interested. Like, I'm - I'm excited enough to do it. And you know how, like, the cliche of your life flashing before your eyes? Like, my future flashed before my eyes for talking to Kevin right then. I just imagined myself working one-on-one with him on something that I was really excited about in San Francisco and just trying to make something of it. And I was like - there was something in me that just stirred at that thought. RAZ: So just going back for a sec, when you met that investor, he just - he was just like, here's a bunch of money? SYSTROM: Well, he was like, OK, I'm willing to give you $50,000 to do this. And that's more money than I had ever heard of in my entire life for a business getting at the time. But the second someone shows any interest in you in Silicon Valley, all of a sudden you have a bunch of other people that really want to invest as well so. . . RAZ: Because nobody wants to miss the - miss the bus, right? SYSTROM: No one wants to miss the next Google, the next whatever. And that initial check went from 50,000 to 250,000. And then there was another investor, Andreessen Horowitz, who came in and put $250,000 in. So here are two guys with, like, basically a prototype and a couple of computers, no office, who raised a half a million dollars. And we're looking at each other like, we think we can make this last. I mean, we were - we were living on peanut butter and jelly sandwiches at the time, so. . . RAZ: So how did you guys pivot? I mean, what - what - how did you turn Burbn into what became Instagram? What was - what was the genesis of that? SYSTROM: I think the best thing for any entrepreneur is failure. And for us, it was the lack of momentum. We - I mentioned we got to - we got to about 100 users using this app. RAZ: A hundred, not 100,000 - a hundred. SYSTROM: No, no, no, no, a hundred. Like, you can fit them in a room. And Eric Ries is this guy in Silicon Valley who likes to, you know, talk about the lean startup method. And one of his - one of his lines is, like, don't ask why people don't use your startup. Ask why the people who continue to use your startup keep using it. And when we looked at our user base, our whole hundred people, each of them loved the photo aspect. So that's why we ended up focusing on photos. RAZ: But there were already a bunch of photo websites and even photo apps, so how were you able to come up with an idea that - that would make your thing different? SYSTROM: So we were both kind of burned out. We had decided that Burbn wasn't going to do anything. We had, you know, $495,000 left in the bank because $5,000 to buy a couple of computers, right? And - and we were like, all right, it's OK. If this idea doesn't work out, we can really string this half a million dollars out for a long time, so we're going to come up with a new idea. So we started focusing on photos, and we were both burned out. I was like, all right, Mike, I got to take - I got to take a break. So my now wife and I, Nicole, went to Mexico. And we were working on this idea of photos, so Mike was like, all right, I'm going to prototype this thing while you're on break. You come back, and then we'll, like, reconvene. So Mike started prototyping this app. And as I'm away, I'm walking down the beach with Nicole in Mexico. We were in this little surfing town called Todos Santos. And I'm like, you know, Nicole, I think we're going to focus on photos. And she goes, oh, yeah. That sounds like a great idea. I love all the photo posts on Burbn. But she goes, I don't think I'm going to post that much. And I go, well, why not? And she goes, well, my photos aren't that good. And I said, well, they're great. And she goes, well, they're not as good as your friend Greg. And I was like, well, Greg uses a bunch of filter apps to, like, make them look nice. And she goes, oh, you should probably add filters. And I was like, ah, that's it. Like, we - we just need to be able to make people feel like their photos are worthy of sharing. And I remember going back right from the beach. I sat in the room with the little dial-up connection that the little hacienda had. And I - I literally just, like, researched how to make the first filter, which ended up being called X-Pro II. And if you scroll all the way back on my account to the very first photo, there's Nichole's foot and a little stray dog in Mexico. And that's because, that day, I made X-Pro II, and I went out to a taco stand for lunch to test it. And I took that picture and posted it on the prototype that Mike had given me. So that was kind of the intersection of the ideas of photos and filters. And it all came through consumer insights. It was just like, what problem are we solving? Share something that people love, and make sure that they feel great sharing it. RAZ: So how long did it take from the time you decided to move away from Burbn and then launch Instagram? SYSTROM: It was only eight weeks from the time we, like, basically sketched it out to when we put it into the Apple store. We pressed launch on October 10 of 2010, and it was, like, about midnight, and people just started streaming. And it was crazy. It was like. . . RAZ: Like, how fast were people joining it? SYSTROM: The first 24 hours, we had 25,000 people sign up around the world, which sounded big to us at the time. RAZ: Yeah, that's incredible. Were - were you expecting that? SYSTROM: No. I mean, a couple of things that showed how naive we were at the time - number one, midnight in San Francisco, it's 9 a. m. somewhere. And we didn't quite realize how global our business could be. So it turns out everyone who was signing up at the beginning actually lived overseas. So when we looked into the database and we were like, who are these people, they all had, you know, email addresses from Germany and Hong Kong and various places around the world. And before you knew it, we actually had overloaded our system, and it was a very small, naive system. It was a single computer in a co-location space somewhere in LA. RAZ: Everything was on one computer? KRIEGER: Yeah, it was. There was nothing more exhilarating than seeing all those people stream in and nothing more crushing than then seeing, you know, people posting on Twitter or on their blogs and saying, like, oh, another startup that doesn't know how to scale. Like, oh, like, so clowny. We were both, I mean, at that point, like, running on zero sleep for two days, just devastated. And I was like, this is it. We built this great thing, and we totally messed it up. SYSTROM: And to be clear, there's no reason we should have succeeded. Like, I mean, the server was just - like, it was down every other hour. And, like, people just kind of forgave us. And they would come back, and they would share their photos. And at the time, mobile networks weren't that great either, so people would actually blame their connection and not us, which was great. But those initial weeks, I mean, it was just, like, trial by fire. And we had to learn everything on the job, and we had so many chances to fail, but we just kept at it and kept working and pulled a bunch of all-nighters. And the amount we learned in that first year, it was crazy. It was, like, five years of college all in one. And, yeah, it was pretty exciting and tiring. RAZ: How did people even find out about Instagram? Like, how did they know that they should download this - this app? KRIEGER: So we had this intuition that, if you're going to throw a party, which is kind of what an app launch really is, as people are streaming to the door, you want them to sort of know how they should act and who else is there. So one of the things we did was we have - you have a hundred sort of invites that you can have before you launch your app to the Apple Store where you can invite people try it out. And we're like, how are we going to use these hundred people? And we used a combination of some journalists that we'd gotten to know over, you know, the last couple of years in San Francisco and the Valley. We also went on this site called dribble. com, which is sort of, like, a place where designers go and show off their best work. And we figured photographers might not instantly take to Instagram because, like, they want, like, super-high resolution or they have other constraints. But designers love photography, but it's not their main sort of job. So we picked basically the 10 top designers on Dribble, and we emailed them. And some ignored us, which is fine, and some wrote back and said, sure, I'll try your app. And it was great 'cause, coming in day one, people who - who would explore things - we had a popular page at the time that showed the most popular photos across the whole community - would be like, wow, you can take that on a phone? Like, we take this for granted a little bit now. You know, cameras have improved every year. But I think part of what we showed to people back in 2010 was that there was something really amazing you could do with just the phone in your pocket.

Again, that email address is hibt@npr. org. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: It's HOW I BUILT THIS from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. So it's about a year after Instagram's launch, and it's grown to 10 million users at this point. And Mike Krieger and Kevin Systrom are expanding their staff very, very quickly. And at this point, did you guys have, like, investors banging on your door? SYSTROM: Yeah, we actually had investors showing up at our office. We'd be, like, trying to keep the servers up, and someone would, like, tap on our shoulder. And they'd be like, hi, I'm so and so from so and so investment partners, and I'd like to take you out for lunch. And we're like, we're trying to keep the site up, please. But we met, you know, a bunch of people along the way. And the ones we did make time for were the ones who were most respectful of that time and knew what we were going through and could help. RAZ: So very shortly after you launched this thing, it's - like, it's valued at, like, more than $20 million or something, right? SYSTROM: Yeah, yeah. It was - I think our first round was, like, I don't remember. It was, like, we took $8 million dollars of financing on, like, a 20 pre, so, like, roughly a $30 million dollar valuation or something. And I mean, again, at that stage in life, it's like, wow, I've never heard of a company that's worth this much. I mean, this is crazy. I didn't really think much of it. I just wanted to get back to work, and I think Mike felt the same way. We were just, like, so focused on building what we were building. It just - like, it kept growing. And the question was - again, Mike and I, every single day, were thinking, how - what scale can this get to? And I think it really started to hit us when we would be out and see people using it in the real world. It was kind of surreal over time. RAZ: I mean - I mean, the - sort of, like, from the outside, this story just seems like a - just a clear, linear, like, jumping from success to success, like it was super-easy. You put it up there, and then you raise all this money, and then the valuation's just in the stratosphere. But were there moments in the beginning, even - even after that initial 24-hour period and beyond, where you thought this could fail - this could easily just fail? KRIEGER: I mean, all the time. I (laughter) - like, three weeks in, Kevin turned to me, and he said, Mike, I don't know how big this is going to be, but I think we're on to something. And I was like, oh, we'll see. And every morning I would wake up expecting that that was the morning that growth would stall and that was it. And if I knew what I know now about metrics and how to measure whether people are coming back over a one-day, seven-day, 30-day period, I would actually have been, I think, a lot calmer because I think it would have shown, as it shows now, that people who join Instagram tend to stick around and become more active. And that's really exciting. But at the time, I didn't know that. I was like, ah, they're signing up. Are they going to come back tomorrow? Like, is it all going to change? And that was sort of an internal worry. And then, externally, you know, as we launched and grew, it became a very competitive space. And we would see, you know, companies get announced that had tens of millions of dollars in investments even before launching. And we're like, man, like, these guys have so much money. They're going to come in and, you know, attack us, and it's going to be really hard. And that's the other lesson learned, which is, you know, your valuation and the amount you raise, it can helpful in building your product, but it does absolutely nothing. People - end users don't care at all how much money you've raised. They care if you're providing some kind of value in the product. And again, lesson learned overtime - that, you know, you have to earn it every day from people. RAZ: I'm curious to sort of get your take on why it continued to grow. I mean, there are a lot of cool apps that you and I both know of that launched five, six years ago that were amazing, that people used that - that no one uses anymore, that are just gone. And there are lots of people who work really hard, who are really creative, who are really smart, have amazing ideas and put out a really cool product. So why - why do you think Instagram survived and thrived? SYSTROM: I think there was this opportunity that we spoke of that - back in the day - that people had cameras in their pockets with them for the first time ever. And digital photography was clearly going to be a thing. But the second a camera got added to the phone, it meant you had it with you at all times. And that doesn't mean that you're going to take photos on it. Obviously the quality has to be high enough. But we started the company right at the moment where, like, the quality of those cameras just kind of met up with point-and-shoots. And because of that, everyone started taking photos on their phone, but they had no place to put them. Or if they did, it was hard. I mean, they would look at Facebook, and they'd be like, well, you know, like, I have to upload them, like, on the desktop. Or on Twitter, like, it doesn't really show on the timeline. So they had this problem - like, there's no place to easily share all these photos that I'm taking all the time. And we just happened to be the right tool for that job at the right moment. And we created - I believe the thing that kept it growing was we created an open network. We sat down very early on in the product-design process and asked ourselves, OK, do we want to be a place where you send a friend request and you have to accept it in order to see those photos, or do we want to be open, where anyone can follow anyone? And I'm so glad we ended up choosing the open model because now you can follow someone from Japan. You can follow, you know, a chef from New York City. You can follow your favorite celebrity, or you can follow your friends. And that, like, hadn't really been done before in photos. If you look at every photo service before then, it was basically a closed-only, friends-only network. And we were the first ones to really open that up. RAZ: You know, there was a moment in my other radio show, the TED Radio Hour, where I think we all realized how big the show became when Pink, the pop singer, tweeted about the show. We were like, holy - she - like, she's listening to the show. SYSTROM: Yeah. RAZ: Did you guys have a moment where you were like, Jesus, like, they're using this thing that we built in, like, our basement? KRIEGER: I think, for me, the biggest one was the White House or Obama - I think it was Obama joined first, and I think it was part of the campaign that he was running. And I remember, like, the president of the United States, like, knows what Instagram is and knows how to use it? And I remember, you know, every - you know, every time somebody's using our app and I either see or hear about them, I'm like, I hope it doesn't crash. I hope it works perfectly, and I hope they, like, don't have any questions that keep them from using it. So that was, I think, a big inflection moment. And I think the other one was I noticed that the New York Times, when they would cover us, had stopped saying Instagram, comma, the photo-sharing app, and then it was just Instagram. I'm like, oh, we are - we have now reached the point where they can assume that most of their readers know what we are. RAZ: I am - I am old enough to remember when NPR said - would say Google, the search engine. SYSTROM: Yeah. And, for me - so I feel embarrassed because you had a really good example about, like, the president using. For me, it was like - our first celebrity was Snoop Dog. Do you remember Snoop Dog signing up? And then we were like, is this actually Snoop Dog? And then I got an email that was like, Snoop Dogg's people want to meet you guys. And I was like, oh, my gosh. I don't even know. What does it mean - people? Like, Snoop Dogg has people? And I remember Justin Bieber signing up and the world going kind of bonkers for that as well. And by world I mean teenage girls. And they basically started using the app incessantly, and it kind of took off with, like, a bunch of really young people as well. RAZ: Yeah. You - obviously, everybody knows that, eventually, you sold Instagram to Facebook for a billion dollars. I mean, it's just incredible that two years after you create this thing that happens. You couldn't have planned for that. You couldn't have. That couldn't even have been an ambition. SYSTROM: Yeah. I mean, the first day that we went home after pulling that all-nighter to launch Instagram, there was a guy sitting on the Muni here in San Francisco, which is the subway system, and he was using Instagram. And I was like, oh, my god. Like, we did it. Like, someone in the world is using this thing out in the wild. That feeling in that moment is the currency that you maximize when you're an entrepreneur. It's like seeing someone using your product and loving it is, like, way more rewarding than any amount of money in the world. RAZ: You guys now are within the Facebook family, right? I mean, you're an independent company, but you are part of Facebook. How does that change the way you operate? Obviously you're a lot bigger. SYSTROM: Yeah. Initially, that was actually pretty awesome because we had all these problems scaling our services. And, like, the Facebook infrastructure team would come over and be like, oh, yeah, we've seen that before. Here, this is what you do. So it made our lives actually a lot better. And we were able to hire some of the best people in the world and share talent. KRIEGER: I like to call ourselves the older brother or the older sibling, where we're the - we were the first company that Facebook acquired and sort of kept running. And then since then, you've seen oculus and WhatsApp. And I think there were a lot of things that we figured out early on in terms of the relationship - the office space, hiring. And I think we all, from both sides of the table, approached it from a spirit of, hey, how can we make Instagram better through these integrations rather than how can you make Instagram more like Facebook, you know, or try to adapt it to be exactly the same? RAZ: There was this - like, this controversy that happened with Instagram where you changed your terms of service and people were under the impression that their photos were - were going to, like, be your property. And a lot of people, like, left Instagram at that moment. Presumably, that - I mean, that's - that was a learning lesson for you - for you guys. SYSTROM: Huge lesson. Number one, people read the docs that, you know, you put out, and you should care about them as a founder. So your terms of service - basically what happened - we had these terms of service that we had, I think, effectively copied from some other site way back in the day and just find and replace their name with Instagram because we were a startup, and we didn't know what we were doing. But we eventually got to a place where, when we joined Facebook, Facebook was like, hey, you actually need a real one that, like, fits with the way you guys work, and we're going to make all these changes. And we went through it, and I was like, OK, great, this makes sense. And I didn't really read it all that carefully. And one of the sections, reading it again today, if I look at it, can be interpreted that we were going to take user photos and somehow use them in advertising. That was definitely not our intention. And, like, no one in the company had even thought of that idea. It just - if you read the sentence that way, you could see that maybe it would worry people. So immediately, you know, we had this big protest and people were, you know, leaving the service. I mean, we have a graph of account deletions at that time, and it was skyrocketing. And Mike and I sat down and we're like, what do we do? And - and we felt helpless. I mean, it was, like, all over - it was that first day all over again. It's like, we've screwed this up. How do we make sure people know? And I went back in my head. I was like, why don't we just apologize and say we're wrong? And I posted this long post on our blog. You can probably still find it online. And I was like, we're sorry. Like, we didn't mean this. That's absolutely not what we're trying to do. And we tweeted about it. And actually, the graph of deletions, at that moment, drops to zero. And sometimes you just have to say sorry. Sometimes you just have to say you were wrong and re-assert what you're actually trying to do. And that interaction with the community still sticks in my mind as something that we try to do every single day, which is to be really transparent with people, put our community first because, like, at the end of the day, without them, we're a photo-sharing app. RAZ: How much of what happened to you guys, to Instagram and this whole story, how much of it was luck? SYSTROM: I'd say 50 percent. Actually, I have this thesis that the world runs on luck. The question is what you do with it. Everyone gets lucky for some amount in their life. And the question is, are you - are you alert enough to know you're being lucky or you're becoming lucky? Are you talented enough to take that advantage and run with it? And do you have enough grit? Do you have enough, like, resilience to stay with it when it gets hard, because everyone gets lucky in minimal ways every week. I mean, you find a dollar on the ground or, you know, you get a break at work to work on a cool project, or you meet someone really interesting. The difference between people, I think, who succeed in the long run and the people who don't is, frankly, that optimism that, like, you got lucky, and now it's yours to - yours to make awesome. And that first day, I think, we got lucky by having the right ideas at the right time in the right place, and we were lucky to have met each other. I mean, there were a lot of co-founding pairs in tech who have not worked out, and Mike and I are, like, great friends - at least I think so. Right, Mike? (LAUGHTER)SYSTROM: And the question is, can you take that luck and capitalize on it? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: Instagram co-founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger. By the way, after the sale of Instagram to Facebook for a billion dollars, those two became very, very rich. But today, Instagram, according to Forbes, is worth more than $50 billion, which makes Instagram bigger, in dollar terms, than places like Alaska, Maine, Rhode Island, Latvia, Senegal. . .

MIKE KRIEGER: There was nothing more exhilarating than seeing all those people stream in and nothing more crushing than then seeing, you know, people posting on Twitter or on their blogs and saying, like, oh, another startup that doesn't know how to scale, like, oh, like, so clowny (ph). We were both, I mean, at that point, like, running on zero sleep for two days, just devastated. And I was like, this is it. We built this great thing, and we totally messed it up. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GUY RAZ, HOST:  From NPR, it's HOW I BUILT THIS, a show about innovators, entrepreneurs, idealists and the stories behind the movements they built. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: On today's show - how a walk along the beach sparked an idea that turned all of us into good photographers and made Instagram one of the fastest-growing apps of all time. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: OK, it's 2009 and Kevin Systrom is just a few years out of Stanford and doing the Silicon Valley thing. He's working at a travel startup by day and teaching himself to code at night. And a friend from college, Mike Krieger, is also in the area, pretty much doing the same thing. And after a few months of experimenting, Kevin builds an app. He calls it Burbn, and it's a check-in app where you can tell your friends you're at a coffee shop or a bar or wherever. And Kevin thinks this app has, you know, some potential. KEVIN SYSTROM: I mean, at that time, there were so many check-in apps. There was foursquare. There was Gowalla. And there were a bunch of others trying to make it. And, of course, following, you know, kind of the trend, I was like, there's something here about the devices in everyone's pockets being available to share new types of information. And I was like, location is the type of information people are going to want to share. I think the insight Mike and I had along the way was that, actually, there were more types of information. The fact that, like, these devices had a camera, that would lead to our visual communication revolution, where, like, all of a sudden, people weren't just communicating with text and voice, but they had the chance to communicate with an image. But initially, our bet was on location. And I'm frankly just very happy that we discovered the image along the way. RAZ: So people were using this app? SYSTROM: Yeah. And, you know, it was just compelling enough to get, like, a handful of beta users, but I would, you know, basically come home at night and just tinker with this idea. And, you know, along the way, I prototyped it enough that I was willing to give it to a handful of friends. And those friends gave it to a handful of friends. And before you knew it, we had - I don't know - maybe 80, 90 people using it. And only at that moment did I decide that, like, hey, maybe this thing could be a company if we actually tried. RAZ: Then, like, at what point did you say, we - we should try to, like, raise some money for this? SYSTROM: I went to a bar where a bunch of investors were getting together. And, like, I kind of mingled around the room, and, you know, people were kind of showing their prototypes on their phones to different investors. And I showed it to this one investor. His name's Steve Anderson. He was one of our first investors. And he was like, this pretty cool. Let's set up coffee. You know, we can meet up, and you can tell me more about the app. And that was, like, the biggest accomplishment to date. I was like, oh, my god, there's an investor who's willing to talk to us. RAZ: Yeah. SYSTROM: So I went, and I had that coffee, and I sat down. And as - as we were talking, actually, I had an alert that would alert on my phone every time someone signed up because I was really excited when we went from 80 users to 85 users to 90 users. And as I'm sitting there with him, like, a bunch of people are signing up. And I wasn't entirely sure why, but he looked at me and was like, did you plan this - like, that you would have a bunch of people sign up while you were demoing to me? And I said, no, I, like, honestly don't know who these people are. And he looks at me. He's like, all right, count me in. But he actually said one thing to me. He goes, before I do this, you have to find a co-founder that's willing to do this with you. And at that moment I was like, all right, got to find someone awesome to kind of partner with and make this all happen. RAZ: So, Mike, how did you guys - like, I mean, how did this happen? Like, you came to Kevin, you were like, I like this thing; it's cool. I want to work with you. I mean did you - was it more formal than that? KRIEGER: I think where it came from was we had a kind of shared kindred spirit of tinkering. So on the weekends, a lot of times I would be at Coffee Bar, which is this great coffee shop here in San Francisco, and I'd be working on iPhone apps just for fun. And Burbn - the check-in in itself I didn't find as compelling, but having a sort of visual status was really compelling. So I got excited enough that I think I - yeah, I came up to Kevin. I was like, look, if you ever do this for real, like, let's have a conversation. And I think that first meeting we had about it, actually, I was like, count me interested. Like, I'm - I'm excited enough to do it. And you know how, like, the cliche of your life flashing before your eyes? Like, my future flashed before my eyes for talking to Kevin right then. I just imagined myself working one-on-one with him on something that I was really excited about in San Francisco and just trying to make something of it. And I was like - there was something in me that just stirred at that thought. RAZ: So just going back for a sec, when you met that investor, he just - he was just like, here's a bunch of money? SYSTROM: Well, he was like, OK, I'm willing to give you $50,000 to do this. And that's more money than I had ever heard of in my entire life for a business getting at the time. But the second someone shows any interest in you in Silicon Valley, all of a sudden you have a bunch of other people that really want to invest as well so. . . RAZ: Because nobody wants to miss the - miss the bus, right? SYSTROM: No one wants to miss the next Google, the next whatever. And that initial check went from 50,000 to 250,000. And then there was another investor, Andreessen Horowitz, who came in and put $250,000 in. So here are two guys with, like, basically a prototype and a couple of computers, no office, who raised a half a million dollars. And we're looking at each other like, we think we can make this last. I mean, we were - we were living on peanut butter and jelly sandwiches at the time, so. . . RAZ: So how did you guys pivot? I mean, what - what - how did you turn Burbn into what became Instagram? What was - what was the genesis of that? SYSTROM: I think the best thing for any entrepreneur is failure. And for us, it was the lack of momentum. We - I mentioned we got to - we got to about 100 users using this app. RAZ: A hundred, not 100,000 - a hundred. SYSTROM: No, no, no, no, a hundred. Like, you can fit them in a room. And Eric Ries is this guy in Silicon Valley who likes to, you know, talk about the lean startup method. And one of his - one of his lines is, like, don't ask why people don't use your startup. Ask why the people who continue to use your startup keep using it. And when we looked at our user base, our whole hundred people, each of them loved the photo aspect. So that's why we ended up focusing on photos. RAZ: But there were already a bunch of photo websites and even photo apps, so how were you able to come up with an idea that - that would make your thing different? SYSTROM: So we were both kind of burned out. We had decided that Burbn wasn't going to do anything. We had, you know, $495,000 left in the bank because $5,000 to buy a couple of computers, right? And - and we were like, all right, it's OK. If this idea doesn't work out, we can really string this half a million dollars out for a long time, so we're going to come up with a new idea. So we started focusing on photos, and we were both burned out. I was like, all right, Mike, I got to take - I got to take a break. So my now wife and I, Nicole, went to Mexico. And we were working on this idea of photos, so Mike was like, all right, I'm going to prototype this thing while you're on break. You come back, and then we'll, like, reconvene. So Mike started prototyping this app. And as I'm away, I'm walking down the beach with Nicole in Mexico. We were in this little surfing town called Todos Santos. And I'm like, you know, Nicole, I think we're going to focus on photos. And she goes, oh, yeah. That sounds like a great idea. I love all the photo posts on Burbn. But she goes, I don't think I'm going to post that much. And I go, well, why not? And she goes, well, my photos aren't that good. And I said, well, they're great. And she goes, well, they're not as good as your friend Greg. And I was like, well, Greg uses a bunch of filter apps to, like, make them look nice. And she goes, oh, you should probably add filters. And I was like, ah, that's it. Like, we - we just need to be able to make people feel like their photos are worthy of sharing. And I remember going back right from the beach. I sat in the room with the little dial-up connection that the little hacienda had. And I - I literally just, like, researched how to make the first filter, which ended up being called X-Pro II. And if you scroll all the way back on my account to the very first photo, there's Nichole's foot and a little stray dog in Mexico. And that's because, that day, I made X-Pro II, and I went out to a taco stand for lunch to test it. And I took that picture and posted it on the prototype that Mike had given me. So that was kind of the intersection of the ideas of photos and filters. And it all came through consumer insights. It was just like, what problem are we solving? Share something that people love, and make sure that they feel great sharing it. RAZ: So how long did it take from the time you decided to move away from Burbn and then launch Instagram? SYSTROM: It was only eight weeks from the time we, like, basically sketched it out to when we put it into the Apple store. We pressed launch on October 10 of 2010, and it was, like, about midnight, and people just started streaming. And it was crazy. It was like. . . RAZ: Like, how fast were people joining it? SYSTROM: The first 24 hours, we had 25,000 people sign up around the world, which sounded big to us at the time. RAZ: Yeah, that's incredible. Were - were you expecting that? SYSTROM: No. I mean, a couple of things that showed how naive we were at the time - number one, midnight in San Francisco, it's 9 a. m. somewhere. And we didn't quite realize how global our business could be. So it turns out everyone who was signing up at the beginning actually lived overseas. So when we looked into the database and we were like, who are these people, they all had, you know, email addresses from Germany and Hong Kong and various places around the world. And before you knew it, we actually had overloaded our system, and it was a very small, naive system. It was a single computer in a co-location space somewhere in LA. RAZ: Everything was on one computer? KRIEGER: Yeah, it was. There was nothing more exhilarating than seeing all those people stream in and nothing more crushing than then seeing, you know, people posting on Twitter or on their blogs and saying, like, oh, another startup that doesn't know how to scale. Like, oh, like, so clowny. We were both, I mean, at that point, like, running on zero sleep for two days, just devastated. And I was like, this is it. We built this great thing, and we totally messed it up. SYSTROM: And to be clear, there's no reason we should have succeeded. Like, I mean, the server was just - like, it was down every other hour. And, like, people just kind of forgave us. And they would come back, and they would share their photos. And at the time, mobile networks weren't that great either, so people would actually blame their connection and not us, which was great. But those initial weeks, I mean, it was just, like, trial by fire. And we had to learn everything on the job, and we had so many chances to fail, but we just kept at it and kept working and pulled a bunch of all-nighters. And the amount we learned in that first year, it was crazy. It was, like, five years of college all in one. And, yeah, it was pretty exciting and tiring. RAZ: How did people even find out about Instagram? Like, how did they know that they should download this - this app? KRIEGER: So we had this intuition that, if you're going to throw a party, which is kind of what an app launch really is, as people are streaming to the door, you want them to sort of know how they should act and who else is there. So one of the things we did was we have - you have a hundred sort of invites that you can have before you launch your app to the Apple Store where you can invite people try it out. And we're like, how are we going to use these hundred people? And we used a combination of some journalists that we'd gotten to know over, you know, the last couple of years in San Francisco and the Valley. We also went on this site called dribble. com, which is sort of, like, a place where designers go and show off their best work. And we figured photographers might not instantly take to Instagram because, like, they want, like, super-high resolution or they have other constraints. But designers love photography, but it's not their main sort of job. So we picked basically the 10 top designers on Dribble, and we emailed them. And some ignored us, which is fine, and some wrote back and said, sure, I'll try your app. And it was great 'cause, coming in day one, people who - who would explore things - we had a popular page at the time that showed the most popular photos across the whole community - would be like, wow, you can take that on a phone? Like, we take this for granted a little bit now. You know, cameras have improved every year. But I think part of what we showed to people back in 2010 was that there was something really amazing you could do with just the phone in your pocket.

Again, that email address is hibt@npr. org. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: It's HOW I BUILT THIS from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. So it's about a year after Instagram's launch, and it's grown to 10 million users at this point. And Mike Krieger and Kevin Systrom are expanding their staff very, very quickly. And at this point, did you guys have, like, investors banging on your door? SYSTROM: Yeah, we actually had investors showing up at our office. We'd be, like, trying to keep the servers up, and someone would, like, tap on our shoulder. And they'd be like, hi, I'm so and so from so and so investment partners, and I'd like to take you out for lunch. And we're like, we're trying to keep the site up, please. But we met, you know, a bunch of people along the way. And the ones we did make time for were the ones who were most respectful of that time and knew what we were going through and could help. RAZ: So very shortly after you launched this thing, it's - like, it's valued at, like, more than $20 million or something, right? SYSTROM: Yeah, yeah. It was - I think our first round was, like, I don't remember. It was, like, we took $8 million dollars of financing on, like, a 20 pre, so, like, roughly a $30 million dollar valuation or something. And I mean, again, at that stage in life, it's like, wow, I've never heard of a company that's worth this much. I mean, this is crazy. I didn't really think much of it. I just wanted to get back to work, and I think Mike felt the same way. We were just, like, so focused on building what we were building. It just - like, it kept growing. And the question was - again, Mike and I, every single day, were thinking, how - what scale can this get to? And I think it really started to hit us when we would be out and see people using it in the real world. It was kind of surreal over time. RAZ: I mean - I mean, the - sort of, like, from the outside, this story just seems like a - just a clear, linear, like, jumping from success to success, like it was super-easy. You put it up there, and then you raise all this money, and then the valuation's just in the stratosphere. But were there moments in the beginning, even - even after that initial 24-hour period and beyond, where you thought this could fail - this could easily just fail? KRIEGER: I mean, all the time. I (laughter) - like, three weeks in, Kevin turned to me, and he said, Mike, I don't know how big this is going to be, but I think we're on to something. And I was like, oh, we'll see. And every morning I would wake up expecting that that was the morning that growth would stall and that was it. And if I knew what I know now about metrics and how to measure whether people are coming back over a one-day, seven-day, 30-day period, I would actually have been, I think, a lot calmer because I think it would have shown, as it shows now, that people who join Instagram tend to stick around and become more active. And that's really exciting. But at the time, I didn't know that. I was like, ah, they're signing up. Are they going to come back tomorrow? Like, is it all going to change? And that was sort of an internal worry. And then, externally, you know, as we launched and grew, it became a very competitive space. And we would see, you know, companies get announced that had tens of millions of dollars in investments even before launching. And we're like, man, like, these guys have so much money. They're going to come in and, you know, attack us, and it's going to be really hard. And that's the other lesson learned, which is, you know, your valuation and the amount you raise, it can helpful in building your product, but it does absolutely nothing. People - end users don't care at all how much money you've raised. They care if you're providing some kind of value in the product. And again, lesson learned overtime - that, you know, you have to earn it every day from people. RAZ: I'm curious to sort of get your take on why it continued to grow. I mean, there are a lot of cool apps that you and I both know of that launched five, six years ago that were amazing, that people used that - that no one uses anymore, that are just gone. And there are lots of people who work really hard, who are really creative, who are really smart, have amazing ideas and put out a really cool product. So why - why do you think Instagram survived and thrived? SYSTROM: I think there was this opportunity that we spoke of that - back in the day - that people had cameras in their pockets with them for the first time ever. And digital photography was clearly going to be a thing. But the second a camera got added to the phone, it meant you had it with you at all times. And that doesn't mean that you're going to take photos on it. Obviously the quality has to be high enough. But we started the company right at the moment where, like, the quality of those cameras just kind of met up with point-and-shoots. And because of that, everyone started taking photos on their phone, but they had no place to put them. Or if they did, it was hard. I mean, they would look at Facebook, and they'd be like, well, you know, like, I have to upload them, like, on the desktop. Or on Twitter, like, it doesn't really show on the timeline. So they had this problem - like, there's no place to easily share all these photos that I'm taking all the time. And we just happened to be the right tool for that job at the right moment. And we created - I believe the thing that kept it growing was we created an open network. We sat down very early on in the product-design process and asked ourselves, OK, do we want to be a place where you send a friend request and you have to accept it in order to see those photos, or do we want to be open, where anyone can follow anyone? And I'm so glad we ended up choosing the open model because now you can follow someone from Japan. You can follow, you know, a chef from New York City. You can follow your favorite celebrity, or you can follow your friends. And that, like, hadn't really been done before in photos. If you look at every photo service before then, it was basically a closed-only, friends-only network. And we were the first ones to really open that up. RAZ: You know, there was a moment in my other radio show, the TED Radio Hour, where I think we all realized how big the show became when Pink, the pop singer, tweeted about the show. We were like, holy - she - like, she's listening to the show. SYSTROM: Yeah. RAZ: Did you guys have a moment where you were like, Jesus, like, they're using this thing that we built in, like, our basement? KRIEGER: I think, for me, the biggest one was the White House or Obama - I think it was Obama joined first, and I think it was part of the campaign that he was running. And I remember, like, the president of the United States, like, knows what Instagram is and knows how to use it? And I remember, you know, every - you know, every time somebody's using our app and I either see or hear about them, I'm like, I hope it doesn't crash. I hope it works perfectly, and I hope they, like, don't have any questions that keep them from using it. So that was, I think, a big inflection moment. And I think the other one was I noticed that the New York Times, when they would cover us, had stopped saying Instagram, comma, the photo-sharing app, and then it was just Instagram. I'm like, oh, we are - we have now reached the point where they can assume that most of their readers know what we are. RAZ: I am - I am old enough to remember when NPR said - would say Google, the search engine. SYSTROM: Yeah. And, for me - so I feel embarrassed because you had a really good example about, like, the president using. For me, it was like - our first celebrity was Snoop Dog. Do you remember Snoop Dog signing up? And then we were like, is this actually Snoop Dog? And then I got an email that was like, Snoop Dogg's people want to meet you guys. And I was like, oh, my gosh. I don't even know. What does it mean - people? Like, Snoop Dogg has people? And I remember Justin Bieber signing up and the world going kind of bonkers for that as well. And by world I mean teenage girls. And they basically started using the app incessantly, and it kind of took off with, like, a bunch of really young people as well. RAZ: Yeah. You - obviously, everybody knows that, eventually, you sold Instagram to Facebook for a billion dollars. I mean, it's just incredible that two years after you create this thing that happens. You couldn't have planned for that. You couldn't have. That couldn't even have been an ambition. SYSTROM: Yeah. I mean, the first day that we went home after pulling that all-nighter to launch Instagram, there was a guy sitting on the Muni here in San Francisco, which is the subway system, and he was using Instagram. And I was like, oh, my god. Like, we did it. Like, someone in the world is using this thing out in the wild. That feeling in that moment is the currency that you maximize when you're an entrepreneur. It's like seeing someone using your product and loving it is, like, way more rewarding than any amount of money in the world. RAZ: You guys now are within the Facebook family, right? I mean, you're an independent company, but you are part of Facebook. How does that change the way you operate? Obviously you're a lot bigger. SYSTROM: Yeah. Initially, that was actually pretty awesome because we had all these problems scaling our services. And, like, the Facebook infrastructure team would come over and be like, oh, yeah, we've seen that before. Here, this is what you do. So it made our lives actually a lot better. And we were able to hire some of the best people in the world and share talent. KRIEGER: I like to call ourselves the older brother or the older sibling, where we're the - we were the first company that Facebook acquired and sort of kept running. And then since then, you've seen oculus and WhatsApp. And I think there were a lot of things that we figured out early on in terms of the relationship - the office space, hiring. And I think we all, from both sides of the table, approached it from a spirit of, hey, how can we make Instagram better through these integrations rather than how can you make Instagram more like Facebook, you know, or try to adapt it to be exactly the same? RAZ: There was this - like, this controversy that happened with Instagram where you changed your terms of service and people were under the impression that their photos were - were going to, like, be your property. And a lot of people, like, left Instagram at that moment. Presumably, that - I mean, that's - that was a learning lesson for you - for you guys. SYSTROM: Huge lesson. Number one, people read the docs that, you know, you put out, and you should care about them as a founder. So your terms of service - basically what happened - we had these terms of service that we had, I think, effectively copied from some other site way back in the day and just find and replace their name with Instagram because we were a startup, and we didn't know what we were doing. But we eventually got to a place where, when we joined Facebook, Facebook was like, hey, you actually need a real one that, like, fits with the way you guys work, and we're going to make all these changes. And we went through it, and I was like, OK, great, this makes sense. And I didn't really read it all that carefully. And one of the sections, reading it again today, if I look at it, can be interpreted that we were going to take user photos and somehow use them in advertising. That was definitely not our intention. And, like, no one in the company had even thought of that idea. It just - if you read the sentence that way, you could see that maybe it would worry people. So immediately, you know, we had this big protest and people were, you know, leaving the service. I mean, we have a graph of account deletions at that time, and it was skyrocketing. And Mike and I sat down and we're like, what do we do? And - and we felt helpless. I mean, it was, like, all over - it was that first day all over again. It's like, we've screwed this up. How do we make sure people know? And I went back in my head. I was like, why don't we just apologize and say we're wrong? And I posted this long post on our blog. You can probably still find it online. And I was like, we're sorry. Like, we didn't mean this. That's absolutely not what we're trying to do. And we tweeted about it. And actually, the graph of deletions, at that moment, drops to zero. And sometimes you just have to say sorry. Sometimes you just have to say you were wrong and re-assert what you're actually trying to do. And that interaction with the community still sticks in my mind as something that we try to do every single day, which is to be really transparent with people, put our community first because, like, at the end of the day, without them, we're a photo-sharing app. RAZ: How much of what happened to you guys, to Instagram and this whole story, how much of it was luck? SYSTROM: I'd say 50 percent. Actually, I have this thesis that the world runs on luck. The question is what you do with it. Everyone gets lucky for some amount in their life. And the question is, are you - are you alert enough to know you're being lucky or you're becoming lucky? Are you talented enough to take that advantage and run with it? And do you have enough grit? Do you have enough, like, resilience to stay with it when it gets hard, because everyone gets lucky in minimal ways every week. I mean, you find a dollar on the ground or, you know, you get a break at work to work on a cool project, or you meet someone really interesting. The difference between people, I think, who succeed in the long run and the people who don't is, frankly, that optimism that, like, you got lucky, and now it's yours to - yours to make awesome. And that first day, I think, we got lucky by having the right ideas at the right time in the right place, and we were lucky to have met each other. I mean, there were a lot of co-founding pairs in tech who have not worked out, and Mike and I are, like, great friends - at least I think so. Right, Mike? (LAUGHTER) SYSTROM: And the question is, can you take that luck and capitalize on it? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: Instagram co-founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger. By the way, after the sale of Instagram to Facebook for a billion dollars, those two became very, very rich. But today, Instagram, according to Forbes, is worth more than $50 billion, which makes Instagram bigger, in dollar terms, than places like Alaska, Maine, Rhode Island, Latvia, Senegal. . .

SMITH: Kabir Daya says when he got the alert on his cell phone yesterday, he not only wondered where the suspect might be lurking but also whether he himself might be mistaken for the guy. DAYA: I will be honest. That was a little bit in the back of my head as well. I mean there's always a little tinge of anxiety about that kind of stuff, you know, me looking the way I am. And I have a beard and, you know, a darker complexion. And I clearly look like I wasn't necessarily born here. SMITH: To some, it's especially concerning now amid a series of incidents in New York targeting Muslims and what some Muslim civil rights advocates call a mainstreaming of Islamophobia. Ibrahim Hooper with the Council on American-Islamic Relations says he's troubled that authorities put out the suspect's name that's obviously Muslim but no description or picture. SMITH: If you're riding on a train with somebody and you see somebody wearing a headscarf or with a beard or with a darker complexion or somebody you perceive to be Muslim, that could lead to suspicion of that person and some kind of action targeting that person.

But University of Southern Mississippi professor Bandana Kar, who's been studying the alert system for the Department of Homeland Security, says that's like putting up a wanted poster with no picture and could hurt more than it helps. BANDANA KAR: The open-ended nature of that alert, being very vague, end up generating a lot of false information. Then it confuses the entire system. SMITH: DHS officials say they will soon make changes that'll allow for longer messages and better descriptions, but attaching images or a link to one, they say, requires further study. Julius Genachowski was chair of the FCC when the system was first launched on the tenth anniversary of 9/11. He says it's an essential tool designed precisely for cases like this. JULIUS GENACHOWSKI: Yeah, this is too powerful to be put on a shelf. I'd expect and encourage law enforcement authorities to be thoughtful but to find the best way to use them to maximize the benefits and minimize the risks.

Today, Yahoo confirmed to users that at least 500 million accounts were stolen. And the company says the attack was state-sponsored. NPR tech reporter Aarti Shahani joins us now. And first, Aarti, tell us about the attack. When did it happen, and what exactly was taken? AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: Well, a whole lot was taken. And apparently it happened back in 2014. Hackers broke into Yahoo's servers and got users' names, phone numbers, dates of birth and passwords. What was not taken, according to Yahoo, was financial information. The company says hackers didn't take credit card and bank account numbers. So those are probably stored in a different place, kind of like putting the jewels in the bedroom instead of the living room. Yahoo says it's securing accounts now and is asking users to change their passwords if they haven't done so since 2014, although, you know, many security experts say you should change your password a lot more than that, say, every three months. And like internet companies like Yahoo don't require it, they could, although it might be seen as annoying. SIEGEL: Aarti, if this happened in 2014, why is Yahoo just notifying users now? SHAHANI: That is a fabulous question. It could be that Yahoo didn't discover the breach immediately. You know, sometimes there is a delay. But NPR asked, and they did not tell us when exactly they found out. SIEGEL: Why does Yahoo say that a foreign government was behind this hack? SHAHANI: Well, it's interesting how Yahoo framed it in its letter to users because they basically said, hey, these attacks, backed by an enemy state, are happening to lots of tech companies, not just us, you know, which is fair enough. But Yahoo doesn't say which government or provide even high-level details about the code used to break in, you know, what the native language of the hacker may be or where the code has been seen before. Experts I spoke with say Yahoo could be playing a game, right? Like - oh, it was a state-sponsored attack, not our fault. And if it was state-sponsored, then you should stop and ask yourself about motive. Were they after a high-value target or a politician or a CEO, right? So the plot will thicken. SIEGEL: Yahoo is working out a deal these days to be purchased by Verizon for nearly $5 billion. Could news of this hack affect that deal? SHAHANI: Well, the short answer is we don't know, and that's because Verizon had no idea at all. The company's saying that they just found out in the last two days. And in a statement, they do not sound happy about it. They say they have, quote, \"limited information and they'll have to evaluate through a lens of Verizon's interests. \"It could be, by the way, that Yahoo was forced to tell Verizon now because the tech outlet Recode was reporting the story. The reason it matters is once Yahoo is breached, this data, which is its main asset, could be seen as a liability, right? Say users want to file a lawsuit and claim that Yahoo was negligent. Well, then that could become Verizon's responsibility legally - a big headache for them. So it is definitely a bad timing for Yahoo. SIEGEL: That's NPR's tech reporter Aarti Shahani. Aarti, thanks.

A growing number of people in Silicon Valley now look to an old idea endorsed by both Milton Friedman and Dr. Martin Luther King, a regular paycheck from the federal government, whether you work or not. KQED's Queena Kim reports. QUEENA KIM, BYLINE: When we talk about the economy, we spend a lot of time talking about jobs and wages. But what if, in the future, employers need far fewer workers? Misha Chellam has been asking this question. He's a tech entrepreneur in San Francisco. And he took me to a restaurant to show me where he thinks the economy is headed. MISHA CHELLAM: All right. So we're at Eatsa, which is a future-concept restaurant. KIM: Imagine if Apple opened a fast food joint. And that's sort of what Eatsa looks like. So where are the cashiers? CHELLAM: There are no cashiers. KIM: What? CHELLAM: That is part of the magic here. We're not going to order from anybody. We're going to order from computers. KIM: Chellam and I walk up to one of the eight or so iPads mounted to the wall. CHELLAM: If I just swipe my card - I'm in San Francisco. I feel like I need to go with kale. Oh, but I. . . KIM: A couple clicks later - and we're done. There are about 15 to 20 customers in the restaurant but only one employee. CHELLAM: I have this gut sense from having been in the Valley for a while now that there will be a coming wave of automation that's going to get rid of a lot of jobs. KIM: Chellam and I are at his office in San Francisco. And in Silicon Valley, where there are experiments in automation everywhere, you can see why techies like Chellam are concerned. There's a Lowe's hardware store with a robot that checks inventory. There's a robot butler working at a hotel in Cupertino. And then there's Uber, which has been experimenting with driverless taxis and trucks. CHELLAM: And that would affect 3. 5 million truck drivers, another 5 million people who support the truck-driving industry. I mean, that's just one example of automation. KIM: Chellam says politicians aren't addressing this automated future. At most, they talk about retraining, which, Chellam says, fails to deal with the scope of the problem. CHELLAM: Take the truck-driver example. What are you going to retrain 3. 5 million people to do in a short enough period of time? KIM: Chellum believes as technology replaces more workers, the traditional 40-hour-a-week job could become a thing of the past. If that happens, how will families get health insurance or save for retirement? Some experts say the only answer is a government-guaranteed paycheck that would allow people to buy food and housing. That would not only help the individuals but would help keep the economic wheels spinning and generate tax revenues. NATALIE FOSTER: Silicon Valley's interest in the universal basic income is one part guilt and one part optimism. KIM: That's Natalie Foster. She's a fellow at the Institute of the Future. It's a nonprofit research organization in Palo Alto. Foster says techies understand that there's a lot that seems impossible about the basic income. And right now they're in an inquiry and research phase. They're hosting panels that ask. . . FOSTER: What would it mean to give people money that they didn't work for? And that's a notion that challenges a lot of people.

He's a co-founder of Facebook and active in the basic-income movement. CHRIS HUGHES: The reality is that work has changed. You know, 40 percent of jobs are now contingent, meaning they're part-time, independent contractors, Uber drivers.

Social media didn't just become important this year. The line binders full of women that we just mentioned became a trending topic in 2012. But Donald Trump's mastery of the form all but ensures that what happens on Twitter will be as much a part of the analysis as anything else. New this year, Twitter will actually be inserted into the debates themselves. Twitter will be feeding debate moderator Lester Holt live tweets and questions during the debate which he can use at his discretion. The man tasked with looking through those tweets and deciding which trends to feature will be Adam Sharp, Twitter's head of news and government. He joined us from his home in Stamford, Conn. , and I asked him how he sees his role in this year's presidential debates. ADAM SHARP: My role is to help provide context to the moderators, to the media covering the event and to the audience around what the Twitter community and overall electorate are talking about, the trends of discussion, what issues are dominating the discussion this week, this year. We'll be looking at tweets from users from across the country, trying to identify those tweets that stand out as the voice of the crowd as opposed to a random voice in it. MARTIN: You know, it is no secret that supporters of different candidates organize and make certain points. Is this, in fact, a test of your ability to organize on Twitter? SHARP: I think when we help curate questions for the moderators of these debates, as we did for several debates in the primaries, we try to look for a cross-section of voices, try to find those voices that are undecided voters or those from the political center, as well as some of the perspective from voters on each side, showing their criticism or questioning of the opponent. That's very common for a moderator to form a question of one candidate in the frame of the opposition, in that frame of people on the other side aren't convinced of your candidacy and voting for your opponent because X, and they're asking why. Sometimes it's better to frame the question in the form of that undecided voice, that neutral voice. MARTIN: Some people feel that the tone that sometimes people adopt on Twitter is particularly alienating to certain people, like there's kind of a bullying factor that sometimes people feel takes hold. But on the other hand, some people feel, well, you know, that represents a particular point of view. And who is the one who decides what particular point of view or tone is the right one? And I just wondered how are you going to address questions of tone? SHARP: While certainly there are loud voices in that room, those who contribute substantive thought generally tend to have the broader reach. We did some research where we found among political voices on the platform, tweets that contained facts - you know, numbers, tweets that contain links to supporting material - on average saw a greater reach than those that were just voicing a piece of political rhetoric. Now, that does not take away from the fact that there certainly are a number of loud voices in the room, and politics draw out those passions. And that's why we've rolled out several new features in just the last few months to help combat that kind of abuse and harassment and have more to come. MARTIN: One criticism of social media is that despite the fact that there's this huge number of people using it that a lot of times the people that you connect with often fall along your same sort of ideological spectrum. So do you have some advice for people who really do want to get a range of views? SHARP: Well, what I would encourage people to do is don't just follow people you agree with. One thing I did a while ago was I searched Twitter for other people who had my same name. And I found some that were far-left Democrats, some that were extremely conservative Republicans. And that on its own started introducing some fresh new voices into the timeline. MARTIN: That was Adam Sharp, head of news and government at Twitter.

The election - probably. Traffic - for sure. What about that cable bill? Well, the Federal Communications Commission is trying to do something about that last one. The FCC is scheduled to vote this week on a plan that could - emphasis on could - lead to lower cable TV bills. The idea is to allow cable subscribers to replace their cable box with an app. Here to talk about the proposal is NPR's Brian Naylor. Brian, welcome. Thanks so much for joining us. BRIAN NAYLOR, BYLINE: Hi, Michel. Sure. MARTIN: So how would this work, and how would this potentially save money? NAYLOR: So that set-top box, which probably sits below the TV in most cases, consumers are paying to rent it from their cable providers month after month. In many cases, cable subscribers have a couple of boxes in their homes - maybe one in the living room, another in the bedroom - and it adds up. According to a congressional study, the average cable consumer pays $231 a year just to rent that box. That's an estimated $20 billion a year, a lot of money. MARTIN: So how would the FCC plan change that? NAYLOR: Well, so FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler says he wants to end the tyranny of the set-top box. As he envisions it, cable companies would have to offer you a free app. And once you open it, it would provide access to all of the channels that you now get through the cable box. And this app you could watch on your smartphone or tablet. Or, you know, if you have a streaming device already like Roku or Apple TV, you could install the cable app on it. And then you could say, hey, thanks, cable company. Here's your box back. And they'd have to stop charging you every month. Or you could keep that box if that's what works best for you. MARTIN: I can't imagine that the cable companies are thrilled at the idea of losing that revenue stream. So what's their argument against it? NAYLOR: Well, right, it's $20 billion a year. People are already cutting the cord and getting channels like ESPN or HBO on their apps. But they didn't like the original plan that Wheeler had proposed either, which would've forced the cable companies to provide their programming to third parties like Google, say, that could sell their own boxes. And so that was kind of a non-starter for the cable industry. They're a little bit less against this, but they've got some issues with it as well. MARTIN: When could this potentially happen? NAYLOR: Well, you know, who knows? Under a best-case scenario, Wheeler says cable companies would have two years to come up with these apps. But I wouldn't bet on that timeline just yet. As we say, there's a couple of issues. It's not clear - first of all, Wheeler has the support of a majority of the commission behind him, so I think there's a lot of arm twisting and tweaking going on behind the scenes at the FCC. And the other issue is that, you know, it's not just the cable companies, but the Hollywood movie and TV studios and others aren't on board because of copyright issues. MARTIN: That's NPR's Brian Naylor. Brian, thank you. NAYLOR: Thanks, Michel.

MARTIN: I can't imagine that the cable companies are thrilled at the idea of losing that revenue stream. So what's their argument against it? NAYLOR: Well, right, it's $20 billion a year. People are already cutting the cord and getting channels like ESPN or HBO on their apps. But they didn't like the original plan that Wheeler had proposed either, which would've forced the cable companies to provide their programming to third parties like Google, say, that could sell their own boxes. And so that was kind of a non-starter for the cable industry. They're a little bit less against this, but they've got some issues with it as well. MARTIN: When could this potentially happen? NAYLOR: Well, you know, who knows? Under a best-case scenario, Wheeler says cable companies would have two years to come up with these apps. But I wouldn't bet on that timeline just yet. As we say, there's a couple of issues. It's not clear - first of all, Wheeler has the support of a majority of the commission behind him, so I think there's a lot of arm twisting and tweaking going on behind the scenes at the FCC. And the other issue is that, you know, it's not just the cable companies, but the Hollywood movie and TV studios and others aren't on board because of copyright issues.

Mostly it's doing a lot of helpful tasks, prioritizing what comes up in email, finding the fastest route to get home from the office, or even deciphering scratchy handwriting on envelopes at the post office. Eric Horvitz is the managing director of Microsoft Research Redmond Lab. ERIC HORVITZ: People often think about what's coming next in AI as some sort of a big disruption that happens all of a sudden. But many advances have been going on and on for years. SYDELL: But Horvitz admits that as AI is used for more tasks, it's raising ethical questions that need to be answered not by competing companies, but by a large group of scientists from many places. So now, Microsoft has joined other major companies including Facebook, Google, Amazon and IBM to back a nonprofit partnership on AI. Horvitz says the partnership will discuss areas such as how self-driving cars will make decisions, like should it save the life of a driver or careen into a group of five people? HORVITZ: Part of the discussion we'd love to see in this partnership is to think deeply about these kinds of situations and systems that negotiate them, and come up with best practices for the industry and beyond. SYDELL: And the partnership is also about educating the public. Oren Etzioni, the CEO of the Allen Institute for AI in Seattle, believes that's great because there are a lot of misconceptions about AI. For example, he believes the benefits of self-driving cars outweigh the ethics problems. OREN ETZIONI: We have extensive statistics showing how many people are killed due to human error. If we have a program that is ever vigilant, that knows to hit the brake, the thing that we'll see is a large drop in the number of people who are dying.

Artist Gabriel Barcia-Colombo created the Hereafter Institute to explore this very idea and created an interactive exhibit at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. It gives participants the opportunity to experience a variety of services, including a digital funeral where they're eulogized solely on what they've posted on social media.

Thanks so much for joining us, and I'm glad you're still with us in real life. DOREE SHAFRIR: (Laughter) Thank you. Me too.

SHAFRIR: I think it's just this morbid fascination I have with what was there - what were their last thoughts that they decided to put on social media? MARTIN: So you talked to the creator of the Hereafter Institute, the artist, Gabriel Barcia-Colombo. Can you talk a little bit about what he told you he wants participants to take away from this project? SHAFRIR: So he is really interested in people starting conversations about this stuff and really thinking about what their digital legacies are going to be and then also who do you want to designate as a person who would be kind of in charge of all your social media after you died? On Facebook, you can designate someone to be what I think of as like the executer of your Facebook estate, and they can turn your page into a memorial page after you die. But the other social media platforms dont really have these mechanisms in place yet. And I think it's going to start to be something that we have to think about more and more. MARTIN: Well, drumroll - tell us a little bit about your experience and what was it like to experience your digital funeral? SHAFRIR: Yes. So in advance they asked us to send them some of our social media. And I think I sent them my Facebook and my Twitter. And then when I showed up, I was taken into this empty auditorium and then a man in a black suit came out and stood at a lectern and eulogized me and said, you know, Doree was a beloved friend, daughter and wife. And then all of my tweets started scrolling on a screen in front of me as though to say, you know, here are some words of Doree's to remember her by - tweeting about wearing a dress to a wedding with pockets or Justin Bieber. And I thought, oh, my God, if I did die - God forbid - right now this is what people would see. MARTIN: It is interesting to think of because on the one hand that is one of the things that people love about social media is that it does capture the day-to-day lives - like everybody can be a character in their own play. And I'm just interested in if you think if more people were to think about what their digital legacy would be, do you think it might change something? SHAFRIR: I think that it is elevating the experience of, quote, unquote, \"normal people\" to say that they are valued to kind of say that we existed and our experiences is valuable. You don't have to just be a founding father or a famous person to feel like your lived experience was worth being commemorated after you die.

Web-based translators have made it much easier to understand things that are written in other languages, but they are not perfect, like this example. Facebook recently translated a Colombian voter's post from the original Spanish to English. It reads, (reading) life gave me the opportunity to vote in my country on this day - so exciting. It's not poetry, but you get the idea. Now Google says it can do it better thanks to artificial intelligence. NPR's Aarti Shahani is with us to talk about this. Hi there. AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: Hi. MCEVERS: So how is Google using artificial intelligence to improve translation? SHAHANI: Well, you know, so it's Google as well as Facebook, Microsoft, Baidu and a bunch of other tech companies, leading tech companies who are moving to an AI system here. And this is how it works in principle. You could have a linguist, a human expert, sit down and dictate all the rules going from one language to another, but that would be a really tedious, exhausting process that arguably, as it seems, doesn't really turn out the kinds of results you want because a lot of languages aren't structured in parallel form. So what these companies such as Google are doing now is they're moving to a pattern recognition. It's called Neural Machine Translation. And the way it works is, you take a boatload of data - translations - really good translations, for example, between Chinese and English. You take that data, and you load it into the computers. And the algorithms then mine through the data to look for patterns. Oh, this seems to go to that. That seems to go to that. And so by doing this sort of mining through and pattern recognition, the machines figure out how to translate not just phrase by phrase but entire thoughts, sentences, paragraphs. MCEVERS: We wanted to see how this method compares to a professional translator. DOTTIE LI: My name is Dottie Li. I'm managing director of TransPacific Communications. I happen to be the voice and voice coach of Rosetta Stone's Mandarin products. MCEVERS: Dottie Li was kind enough to go head to head with the new Google Translate for us. We gave her this commentary about the U. S. presidential election from People's Daily. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Speaking foreign language). MCEVERS: This is how Google translates it. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE: Everyone is most concerned about Hillary and Trump, who is even worse for China, when this problem is not clear to see them both who may destroy the United States. MCEVERS: And this is how Dottie Li translates it. LI: What people are most concerned with between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is which one of them would be tougher on China. When they are unclear on the answer, they would have to see which one would possibly make America worse. MCEVERS: So we asked Dottie Li what she thought of all this. LI: I think this is definitely a battle between human intelligence and mechanical robotic computer devices. I firmly believe that human beings will triumph. In this case, you could see that machines came through with some kind of mechanical, very technical aspects that don't make much sense. MCEVERS: What about you, Aarti Shahani? What do you think about all this? SHAHANI: (Laughter) Well, I'm thinking two things. One is I'm probably a bit more optimistic than she is about the capacity of machines to translate more beautifully. And two, maybe more importantly, is, you know, she used the word battle. This is a battle. And I think that the people engineering these kinds of translation techniques see it more as a partnership. You know, when you look at, for example, Google and Google's take on its own work right now, they recently issued a paper on this. And in translation, like, on a scale of zero to six - zero being total garbage and six being perfect - humans in Chinese-to-English, English-to-Chinese will get about a five. The old way of translating phrase by phrase would be around, like, a three and a half, three and three quarters. This new way of using neural nets to do it gets you about a four-and-a-half. So you know, by Google's admission, not quite human but better than what was before - you know, and I think that part of their hope in releasing this Chinese-English translation out, you know, to the public in the wild before other languages get released out there is because they recognize, man, the old way of doing it was so bad. They needed some sort of improvement for the public. MCEVERS: That's NPR's Aarti Shahani. Thanks a lot. SHAHANI: Thank you. KELLY MCEVERS, HOST:  And now for something back on the ground.

Va. It was supposed to usher in a new age of public transit - that didn't happen. But West Virginia University, which operates the PRT system, remains committed to it. And the school is spending more than $100 million to refurbish the aging system. NPR's Joe Palca went to Morgantown to check out this bold idea. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: PRT is very different from conventional mass transit. Normally when you get on a subway or light rail, you get into a large car that can hold lots of people. And you stop at every stop on the line. With PRT, you get in a much smaller car. And your car only goes to your destination. It doesn't stop anywhere else. I'd come to Morgantown, population 30,000, to give a talk to graduate students. But I've been curious about PRT for a while. So I dragooned second-year pharmaceutical science student Tiffany Kornberg into taking me for a ride on it. Morgantown's PRT runs approximately 9 miles out from the city center, where Kornberg and I got on, to the university Medical Center. So is this useful? I mean, the PRT, is it good to have? TIFFANY KORNBERG: It's definitely easier than driving and trying to park. PALCA: We climbed the stairs to an elevated platform. There's a turnstile, 50 cents for visitors, free if you're a student. Before you can go through, you have to select the station you're traveling to. That's a key to using PRT. There are several of the boxy PRT cars stopped at the station, each holds about 18 people. They're brightly painted with the West Virginia University blue and gold colors. How do we know which car to get into? KORNBERG: It says right up there. When it dings, it'll show a name of whatever station it is. PALCA: The sign over one of the cars says Medical Center, which is where we're headed. And the car door opens. (SOUNDBITE OF CAR DOOR CLOSING)PALCA: We're in. We start off rattling down an elevated guideway at a good clip. I've got to tell you, I feel like I'm in a Disneyland ride. We approached the station at the engineering campus, but the car never slows down. And so this is the advantage of PRT. We would have stopped here, and nobody would have gotten off because nobody's - on this pod is going there. But with PRT, it just zips right past. Another PRT feature, if there's a midday lull and nobody is going anywhere, the cars just sit at a station and wait. And so the cool thing is you're not wasting resources of running empty cars up and down all day long just because the schedule says you have to. When we reached the Medical Center stop, I made my way to the office of Clement Solomon, who runs the PRT system. CLEMENT SOLOMON: This is one of the best-kept secrets and the transportation world. PALCA: Solomon says the system provides 15,000 rides a day, double that when there's a home football game. He says a few years ago, the university had to make a decision. The PRT cars were wearing out and the control system needed updating. Should they refurbish the PRT system or just abandon it? So they commissioned a study. SOLOMON: We would have to do anywhere from 30 to 60 buses just in loops running nonstop to transport our students. PALCA: He says refurbishing PRT was the best option. SOLOMON: If you look at it, there isn't a system in the world that can do what this system can do. PALCA: But elsewhere, PRT just hasn't caught on. There is a system at Heathrow Airport in London and at Masdar City in Abu Dhabi. And several places are considering PRT, including Greenville, S. C. But a revolution in public transportation - not so much. Joe Palca, NPR News, Morgantown.

They're brightly painted with the West Virginia University blue and gold colors. How do we know which car to get into? KORNBERG: It says right up there. When it dings, it'll show a name of whatever station it is. PALCA: The sign over one of the cars says Medical Center, which is where we're headed. And the car door opens. (SOUNDBITE OF CAR DOOR CLOSING) PALCA: We're in. We start off rattling down an elevated guideway at a good clip. I've got to tell you, I feel like I'm in a Disneyland ride. We approached the station at the engineering campus, but the car never slows down. And so this is the advantage of PRT. We would have stopped here, and nobody would have gotten off because nobody's - on this pod is going there. But with PRT, it just zips right past. Another PRT feature, if there's a midday lull and nobody is going anywhere, the cars just sit at a station and wait. And so the cool thing is you're not wasting resources of running empty cars up and down all day long just because the schedule says you have to. When we reached the Medical Center stop, I made my way to the office of Clement Solomon, who runs the PRT system. CLEMENT SOLOMON: This is one of the best-kept secrets and the transportation world. PALCA: Solomon says the system provides 15,000 rides a day, double that when there's a home football game. He says a few years ago, the university had to make a decision. The PRT cars were wearing out and the control system needed updating. Should they refurbish the PRT system or just abandon it? So they commissioned a study. SOLOMON: We would have to do anywhere from 30 to 60 buses just in loops running nonstop to transport our students. PALCA: He says refurbishing PRT was the best option. SOLOMON: If you look at it, there isn't a system in the world that can do what this system can do. PALCA: But elsewhere, PRT just hasn't caught on. There is a system at Heathrow Airport in London and at Masdar City in Abu Dhabi. And several places are considering PRT, including Greenville, S. C. But a revolution in public transportation - not so much. Joe Palca, NPR News, Morgantown.", "section": "Joe's Big Idea", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

MOORHEAD: There were two battery manufacturers. One battery manufacturer was good. The other battery manufacturer was not good. SHAHANI: So take the good, and toss out the bad. But. . .

Spotify and Apple Music have tens of millions of subscribers, but Amazon is coming to market with something different - a monthly fee of just $3. 99 with some artificial intelligence thrown in. NPR's Laura Sydell reports. LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE: The artificial intelligence is integrated into the Amazon Echo, and it's impressive. To those more intimate with it, it's also known as Alexa. It's a standalone device with a speaker and what many experts say is some of the best voice recognition software on the market. You can dictate shopping lists to Alexa, set timers, ask for news briefs, ask it to play a particular song in your music library. The new service has millions of songs, and you can do this. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Alexa, play that song that goes, I can make your hands clap. ALEXA: \"HandClap\" by Fitz and the Tantrums from Amazon music. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"HANDCLAP\")MICHAEL FITZPATRICK: (Singing) I can make your hands clap. SYDELL: To make this work, Amazon's Steve Boom says the company has been collecting data from millions of Alexa users about how they talk to it about music, and they've been programming Alexa to respond. STEVE BOOM: To learn characteristics of different songs in the catalog so that when people ask for things the way they want to ask for them, that we can respond to that. SYDELL: Responding in a way that caters more to the way humans actually speak is a great way to open people up to the vastly expanding universe of artificial intelligence, says James McQuivey, an analyst with Forrester Research. JAMES MCQUIVEY: And I think that Amazon is signaling that it believes it can have conversations like this with users about many, many more things in the future. SYDELL: So in the future, Alexa might be connected to the lights in your house, the garage and of course Amazon's vast retail empire. Then there's the price. It's not quite as good as it looks. You already have to have an Echo to get the 3. 99 a month, and it only works on the Echo. If you want it to work everywhere else, it costs 7. 99 a month. Still, that's less than the leading standalone streaming service Spotify. McQuivey says Amazon can afford to do such low pricing because it's not just a music service, and other big companies might follow. MCQUIVEY: Because it is such a valuable creator of frequent customer interactions. And Amazon knows this. Apple knows this, and Google also knows it. SYDELL: Amazon won't say how many people own the Amazon Echo, only that it's in the millions. But it could be enough to be a major challenger to Spotify. Laura Sydell, NPR News.

Adler carried with him three things - hot tea, biscuits and an offer, an offer to every homeless person he met to record a video message for a long-lost relative or friend. Kevin Adler promised he would try to deliver the messages in time for the holidays. Out of that was born a mission, a startup called Miracle Messages, which has now helped dozens of homeless people reunite with their families. We invited Adler and one of those people he's helped to come tell us about it. Adler says one of the first hurdles is persuading people to make a video. KEVIN ADLER: A lot of folks that have recorded messages, one of the hesitancies in recording a message is they've said, well, I don't know how the family's going to respond. I feel like a burden. I feel ashamed. I'm embarrassed. And so trying to get past that, doing something very simple with a - what we call a video postcard, is a very helpful first step for basically saying who you love, who you want to reconnect with, whatever kind of message you want to leave. And we'll do our best to deliver it. KELLY: Now let me introduce you to Dave Adams. Adams lived on the streets in San Francisco for 20 years. He says he lost touch with his family, couldn't figure out how to make contact. DAVE ADAMS: Well, personally, I gave up a while back, just decided I wasn't going to put a whole lot of effort into it anymore. I ain't computer smart. Pretty dumb - pretty much dumb as a box of rocks when it comes to computers. So I didn't have - knew I didn't have no way I could do it. So I just gave up. KELLY: Until a volunteer at Miracle Messages helped Adams find his brothers. And he learned he had a half sister named Dorothy who'd been looking for him for years. So he called her. ADAMS: She don't usually answer phones that she don't know the number to on a cell phone. She said, OK, I'll answer the phone. And then she answers the phone. And I says, is this Dorothy? She says yes. I hear you're looking - you've been looking for me. You want to talk to me about something? And it's like - she says, oh my god. Oh, god. Oh, god. It ain't. It ain't. It ain't. She said, who are you? I told her. She says - then she couldn't say nothing. She just started crying. She was just, you know - she says yeah, she got a little upset - emotional somewhat, you know? I guess about 30-something years she's been looking. She promised her dad, our dad, that no matter what, she'll just keep going until she found me. KELLY: When we got Adams together on the line with founder Kevin Adler, we asked about that moment and what Adler hopes might follow from it. Is there, aside from the reunions themselves, a broader goal of helping people move on with their lives, move off the streets? ADLER: So my uncle Mark had been homeless for about 30 years. He suffered from schizophrenia, lived on and off the streets. I never saw him as a homeless man. You know, he's my beloved uncle. And so. . . ADAMS: . . . I ain't homeless, dude. I'm houseless. ADLER: (Laughter) Exactly, houseless. And so when we walk down the street and we see someone who is without a house, it's easy to define them by that. And we want to live in a world where we walk down the street and we don't see Homeless Joe or Jane, Houseless Joe or Jane - sorry, Dave - but we see someone. . . ADAMS: . . . Now, there's some homelessness - homelessness is a state of mind. KELLY: Dave, you jumped in there, in case not everybody listening could hear. And you were, it sounded like, objecting to the term homeless. Did you think of yourself that way these last 20 years? ADAMS: No, I said homelessness and houselessness is different. Houseless is like how I think about it. Where you lay your head at night and lay down to go to sleep. Whether it's in a mansion or in a car or a school bus or a doorway, one thing about it is that's home. KELLY: And it sounds like, Dave, you are headed to a new house, a new home with your sister at her farm in Tennessee. Is that right? ADAMS: For now. KELLY: For now? ADAMS: That's - she's going to pick me up at the bus stop, the bus station. KELLY: When Dave Adams gets to that bus stop in Tennessee, he already will have a job working on a farm. Adams' family was glad to hear from him. Kevin Adler says that's not always the case. ADLER: In our experience so far, about 90 percent of the messages that we've delivered are positively received. But that still means that about 1 out of every 10 occasions the family or the friends are not interested in reconnecting. Fortunately, in many of those instances, we've had other individuals who maybe weren't mentioned in the initial video that do reach out and say, hey, I'd like to reconnect. KELLY: So, Adler says, the work of what he calls a global network of volunteer detectives continues. ADLER: We want to reunite 1 million people by 2021. That's 1 percent of the world's homeless population - houseless population. So yeah, if we're really going to move the needle in ending homelessness and using social media for social good, we figure we need to set the goal at least at a million and then hopefully exceed it.

A recent survey by the software company Adobe showed that large numbers of office workers check email in bed, while watching movies, even in the bathroom. That's probably not a good thing, so says Jocelyn Glei. She has written a new book called \"Unsubscribe\" about how to use email better, and she's with us now in the studio. Welcome. JOCELYN GLEI: Thanks for having me, Kelly - pleasure to be here. MCEVERS: How pervasive is email, really? I mean how much time are people spending? GLEI: Some studies say people are checking their email on average about 11 times an hour, processing 122 messages a day on average and spending about 28 percent of their work week on email. And that's a low number. I think The Washington Post recently reported on another one that said some people are spending four hours a day. MCEVERS: So why do we like it so much? GLEI: Email really is very similar to a slot machine in many ways. So if you think about it, you know, most of the time you check your email. You sort of pull that lever. And you kind of lose. Like, you get something, you know, kind of disappointing. Like, it's an email from an angry customer, or it's an urgent message from your boss to ask you to do a task that you don't really feel like doing. But every once in a while, you get something great. You know, you get. . . MCEVERS: Somebody like, I want to make a movie about your life. GLEI: (Laughter) That - I haven't gotten that yet. But you know, I got an email the other day from a long lost childhood friend. Or you know, maybe someone invites you to give a TED Talk, you know? And so there's those random rewards that kind of come mixed in with all that junk, and that's what keeps you in that loop. It makes you kind of want to keep pulling that lever again and again maybe when you have better things to do. MCEVERS: Email has been around for a really long time. If it's so kind of problematic, why do we still use it? I mean there are a lot of other options out there. GLEI: Well, I think one of the first things that's completely unique about email is it's one of the last sort of great unowned pieces of technology that operates behind the scenes on the internet. If you think about these technologies that are going to kill email or replace it, you know, you think about Slack. Or Facebook just launched workplace. MCEVERS: Like, different messaging. . . GLEI: Precisely, a different kind of real-time collaborative messaging app, but these are companies, so they kind of have different objectives. And I think email is almost like the cockroach of the technology world, you know? It can be really agile. And it can kind of be constantly reinventing itself because it's not trying to please any shareholders or anything of that nature. MCEVERS: And so to kill it would not - there's really no way to kill it. You couldn't just do it in one stroke. GLEI: I don't think so. And also it means that it's free. No one's trying to make money off of email. People can constantly be building new apps to improve it. And also, I think it's - everyone aged 7 to 70 understands what email is. Everyone all over the globe understands what email is. It's kind of the universal language of, you know, messaging at this point. MCEVERS: OK, given that we're stuck with email, give us some advice about how to make it work better. GLEI: I mean I think the No. 1 tip is really that we want to be batch processing our email. So as opposed to kind of constantly nibbling on it throughout the day and being very reactive, we want to limit it to a few discrete batches where we're a hundred percent focused on email and then try to kind of set it aside and focus on other tasks because essentially people who are processing their email in that way feel more productive, less stressed and have a higher sense of well-being. MCEVERS: That's Jocelyn Glei. Her new book is called \"Unsubscribe. \" Thank you so much. GLEI: Thank you for having me. KELLY MCEVERS, HOST:  We use email just about everywhere. A recent survey by the software company Adobe showed that large numbers of office workers check email in bed, while watching movies, even in the bathroom. That's probably not a good thing, so says Jocelyn Glei. She has written a new book called \"Unsubscribe\" about how to use email better, and she's with us now in the studio. Welcome. JOCELYN GLEI: Thanks for having me, Kelly - pleasure to be here. MCEVERS: How pervasive is email, really? I mean how much time are people spending? GLEI: Some studies say people are checking their email on average about 11 times an hour, processing 122 messages a day on average and spending about 28 percent of their work week on email. And that's a low number. I think The Washington Post recently reported on another one that said some people are spending four hours a day. MCEVERS: So why do we like it so much? GLEI: Email really is very similar to a slot machine in many ways. So if you think about it, you know, most of the time you check your email. You sort of pull that lever. And you kind of lose. Like, you get something, you know, kind of disappointing. Like, it's an email from an angry customer, or it's an urgent message from your boss to ask you to do a task that you don't really feel like doing. But every once in a while, you get something great. You know, you get. . . MCEVERS: Somebody like, I want to make a movie about your life. GLEI: (Laughter) That - I haven't gotten that yet. But you know, I got an email the other day from a long lost childhood friend. Or you know, maybe someone invites you to give a TED Talk, you know? And so there's those random rewards that kind of come mixed in with all that junk, and that's what keeps you in that loop. It makes you kind of want to keep pulling that lever again and again maybe when you have better things to do. MCEVERS: Email has been around for a really long time. If it's so kind of problematic, why do we still use it? I mean there are a lot of other options out there. GLEI: Well, I think one of the first things that's completely unique about email is it's one of the last sort of great unowned pieces of technology that operates behind the scenes on the internet. If you think about these technologies that are going to kill email or replace it, you know, you think about Slack. Or Facebook just launched workplace. MCEVERS: Like, different messaging. . . GLEI: Precisely, a different kind of real-time collaborative messaging app, but these are companies, so they kind of have different objectives. And I think email is almost like the cockroach of the technology world, you know? It can be really agile. And it can kind of be constantly reinventing itself because it's not trying to please any shareholders or anything of that nature. MCEVERS: And so to kill it would not - there's really no way to kill it. You couldn't just do it in one stroke. GLEI: I don't think so. And also it means that it's free. No one's trying to make money off of email. People can constantly be building new apps to improve it. And also, I think it's - everyone aged 7 to 70 understands what email is. Everyone all over the globe understands what email is. It's kind of the universal language of, you know, messaging at this point.

Security experts worry about the lack of an adequate paper trail, especially this year, given concerns about foreign hacking and the campaign rhetoric about rigged elections. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports from the battleground state of Pennsylvania. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: I've come to Harrisburg to see the Danaher 1242, a voting machine also known as the ELECTronic. Get it? The ELECTronic? Folded up, this contraption looks like a huge, beige suitcase. JERRY FEASER: Lift the latches. And then gently lifting up. . . (SOUNDBITE OF VOTING MACHINE)GREENFIELDBOYCE: Jerry Feaser is director of elections for Dauphin County. Once the machine is vertical, he opens its doors. (SOUNDBITE OF VOTING MACHINE)GREENFIELDBOYCE: There's a panel with blinking lights, the candidates' names. It's a familiar sight to voters here. They've used these machines for over 30 years. FEASER: When I first turned 18 and started voting myself, this was the first machine I ever voted on. This is the only voting machine I've ever known. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Now, this year, there's concerns about hacking. But Feaser says, consider this. These machines aren't connected to the internet. The only link to the outside world is the plug in the electrical outlet. And while a hacker could try to sneak in and tamper with the hardware, Feaser says these machines get checked and decked out with numbered security seals before going to polling places. FEASER: I could take this voting machine, drop it off in the middle of Red Square in Moscow, and the Russians couldn't hack into it. GREENFIELDBOYCE: At the end of election night, the machine spits out a paper receipt showing the total votes recorded for each candidate. (SOUNDBITE OF VOTING MACHINE)FEASER: And tear off the tape results. GREENFIELDBOYCE: (Laughter) How long is that piece of paper? That's, like, a 10-foot-long piece of paper there. FEASER: At least. GREENFIELDBOYCE: But critics say this paper is not the kind of paper backup you really need. Without a hard copy of individual ballots, you can't do a real recount. PAMELA SMITH: They don't have a separate record that the voter got a chance to see and confirm was correct at the time that they voted - nothing independent of the software and the machine. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Pamela Smith is president of a nonpartisan nonprofit called Verified Voting. She says five states exclusively use voting machines that lack an independent paper trail, New Jersey, Delaware, Georgia, Louisiana and South Carolina. SMITH: And then there's another nine states that have paperless voting machines in some jurisdictions. GREENFIELDBOYCE: In Pennsylvania, a battleground state, those machines are used in a majority of counties. SMITH: You know, on a scale of all of the states, I would say Pennsylvania would be my biggest concern. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Others agree, like Avi Rubin, a computer security expert at Johns Hopkins University. AVI RUBIN: What do we do if, at the end of the election, it comes down to Pennsylvania, and there's a challenge saying, you know, these machines were corrupted? We can't do recounts. We don't have paper ballots. We just have to live with those machines. GREENFIELDBOYCE: At a time when Donald Trump is warning of a rigged election - here's what he said during one recent visit to the state. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DONALD TRUMP: The only way we can lose, in my opinion - I really mean this - Pennsylvania is if cheating goes on. I really believe it. GREENFIELDBOYCE: That doesn't sit well with Marian Schneider. She's Pennsylvania's deputy secretary for elections and administration. MARIAN SCHNEIDER: I think the rhetoric about cheating and rigging is very irresponsible. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Concerns about hacking, on the other hand - federal officials have warned that state election systems have been probed by hackers with ties to Russia. The Department of Homeland Security offered to help states review election systems for vulnerabilities. SCHNEIDER: And we in Pennsylvania thought that that was a good idea - to take advantage of those services. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She has no evidence of any tampering. I asked her, if the election is close, and there's a challenge to the results, could Pennsylvania do an adequate audit or recount? SCHNEIDER: The systems will be examined at that point. I mean, that's - at this point, it's really speculation. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She says state law doesn't trigger a recount unless the difference between candidates is very, very small.

Companies keep files on us, and they use those files to decide what to sell us and at what price. That's right. The price of a product is not the same for everyone. You may be getting a better deal or a worse deal than your friend or your co-worker. Well, Julia Angwin, a senior reporter at ProPublica, has spent the year with her team looking at algorithms, including those that companies use to decide what they will charge us for a product. And she joins us now. Welcome to the program. JULIA ANGWIN: It's great to be here. SIEGEL: How are companies using our information to set prices? ANGWIN: So basically every website you visit creates itself the moment you arrive, and you know that because you see that your ads are customized to you. But in fact the whole page could well be customized, and we have found that there are cases where companies determine the price of the product to you based on where you live. The one we found most recently was Princeton Review with their online SAT course had different prices in different ZIP codes across the nation ranging from $6,600 to $8,400. SIEGEL: Yeah, one finding that you report is that because of that, Asians were nearly twice as likely to be charged a higher price in SAT prep courses by Princeton Review than non-Asians because they're Asian or because they live in certain ZIP codes. ANGWIN: As far as we could tell - and the company said it was not an intentional discrimination against Asians. They drew their lines for their ZIP code pricing in a way that mostly captured a lot of high-income areas but actually also managed to capture a lot of low-income, Asian areas. So Queens, N. Y. , is highly Asian but not a high-income area. And we don't really know what went into their algorithm to make it turn out that way. SIEGEL: We're talking about algorithms, but should we be talking about the humans who design the algorithms? ANGWIN: The humans behind these algorithms - I don't have any reason to believe that any of them had any intentional biases. I do think that the real question that we've been raising in our reporting is, is there anyone checking for these unintentional biases? SIEGEL: If in the case of Princeton Review you come away thinking there is no intent to discriminate by charging more for the same service in Queens, N. Y. , than somewhere else, why are they charging that in that case, and are you sure it's not evident to somebody in on the algorithm that, hey, there's money to be made there from these Asian immigrant families? They're desperate for their kids to get into a good college. ANGWIN: I mean the truth is I'm not sure. It's very hard to prove intent. All I can say as a reporter is that I have no evidence that there was an intention to discriminate against Asians, but there may well have been. The truth is that's why we called our series Black Boxes. We can't see inside these algorithms that are black boxes. We can really only look at the outputs and say, well, what it looks like is it's discriminatory to Asians, but I don't know what you guys put into your inputs to get it that way. SIEGEL: Well if artificial intelligence is not neutral, what's the solution - to have uniform pricing or to look back at the algorithms and correct for census data when the disparities in prices are arrived at? ANGWIN: I think the solution is to build some type of accountability into our emerging systems of algorithms just the way that when credit scores were introduced, they were a very innovative algorithm that had huge implications for people about whether they get a loan or buy a home. And we put in place some rules around that, which is that you're allowed to see the data that is used to calculate that score, and you're allowed to dispute it. And yes, people who have gone through that process will say it's not as clean or as great a process as it could be, but it seems to me that for high-stakes algorithms that we're increasingly using in our lives today, we want to put in some similar types of accountability measures so that people have a way to fight back if this algorithm makes a decision that they want to dispute.

Lots of very popular websites have had issues. The New York Times, Twitter and Spotify have been glitchy. PayPal says some transactions haven't gone through. NPR's tech blogger Alina Selyukh is here to tell us what's been happening. Hi there. ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE: Hello. MCEVERS: So what's going on? SELYUKH: What you might have experienced today is the result of what's called a distributed denial of service attack. It's the kind of attack when hackers overwhelm a website with fake traffic to try to kick it offline. They hijack a ton of other people's computers or devices and then use them to barrage a website just until it shuts down. Except in this case, the victim wasn't just one website. It was a major internet infrastructure company. It's called Dyn. And what Dyn does is direct traffic. It makes sure that when you type in a web address, you end up exactly where you intended. And so when Dyn's servers are overwhelmed by an attack, the traffic to its clients' websites and services also goes haywire. MCEVERS: Do we know who's responsible for this attack? SELYUKH: Right now we don't, but this is a really peculiar attack. Typically, a denial of service attack comes from a bunch of computers infected with malicious software. That sort of thing we've been seeing quite a bit. But in this case, Dyn says their attack is coming not from computers. In fact, it's coming from tens of millions of internet-connected things, and that's pretty new. We've all been buying all these new devices that are connected to the web. And experts have been warning that they're not very secure. And this is one of the biggest examples of what happens when hackers hijack those internet-connected things and use them to cause harm. MCEVERS: So, like, this could - this attack could be, like, coming from a house or from, like, here inside the NPR building? SELYUKH: Theoretically, yes. Dyn says this could be any kind of device connected to the web. Think about all the internet connected things you have at home - a thermostat, a webcam, a router, a DVR. And that's what makes this particular attack so powerful. Dyn officials say it's really, really distributed, meaning it's coming from an incredible number of directions. And it's also been moving. The trouble started on the East Coast around 7 a. m. And when Dyn cleared its servers there, it moved to another location and has been traveling around the world hitting up Dyn's servers. MCEVERS: Does Dyn think it will stop soon? SELYUKH: Dyn officials say they're trying really hard to stop this. And the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI are investigating these attacks. And, actually, this incident is so disruptive that it's bringing together a huge community of security experts. Dyn says that it's gotten help today not only from its own clients but also its rivals. Nobody wants to be next. MCEVERS: Thanks so much, Alina. SELYUKH: Thank you very much. MCEVERS: That's NPR tech blogger Alina Selyukh.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"DOT\")UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As Dot) I have all kinds of other apps on my tablet, too. They'll make finding the stuff on our list super-easy. (SOUNDBITE OF OWL HOOTING)UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: (As character) A great horned owl. It's a bird of prey. That's on your list. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As Dot) A what? Where? UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: (As character) You missed it 'cause you were looking at your screen. MCEVERS: Randi Zuckerberg is one of the show's executive producers. She wrote the children's book that inspired the show. She says she hopes it will encourage more girls to get into tech. That was after 10 frustrating years she spent in Silicon Valley. RANDI ZUCKERBERG: I grew so frustrated by so few women in the room wherever I went. It was a fantastic decade, but also a lonely one. And so I thought, what if we could get more messages out into pop culture with female role models for young girls, showing them how exciting and cool and wonderful this world of technology is? Maybe that could inspire the next generation of leaders. So that was one of my real motivations for \"Dot. \" But the other was having children of my own. On one hand, I'm sitting there writing about all these amazing uses of tech, and then, in my own household, tech is making me want to rip my hair out of my head. And I thought, wow, we really need a book that covers this topic of balance, what it means to be a child in the modern digital age and something that gets parents comfortable around that. MCEVERS: You know, it's interesting, yeah, to see a - you know, there's a young girl at the center of the show. Technology is a huge part of her life. I mean, she's basically, like, carrying a tablet around with her all the time and using it to solve problems. But I guess if you do the flip side, you know, I thought about my own 7-year-old daughter watching this, and I thought, so she - if she was watching this show, she would be watching a screen about a girl who's carrying a screen a lot of the time. I mean, isn't it that we don't need to encourage our kids to use more screens, it's that we kind of are trying to have them use less? ZUCKERBERG: You know, it's something we thought about so much in turning the book into a show. I think there's a few thoughts that I have. On one hand, yes, the tech-life balance for children should skew so far on the side of life. It's not even a tech-life balance question. Like, children should get outside. MCEVERS: Yeah. ZUCKERBERG: But on the other hand, we need to make sure that we are not projecting our own fear and anxiety and guilt as parents onto children because, for some reason, adults, when we think of screen time, we immediately go to a place of anxiety and fear. MCEVERS: Right, right. ZUCKERBERG: But children don't feel that way. To them, the future is fun. They don't think about, now I'm using tech, and now I'm not. MCEVERS: Yeah. ZUCKERBERG: It's seamlessly integrated. So I think we also need to make sure, as parents, that we are giving our children the tools that they'll need to be successful for the rest of their lives and arming them with enough tech literacy. MCEVERS: You worked in Silicon Valley for a long time, as you said. Full disclosure - we should say you were an executive at Facebook. Your brother is Mark Zuckerberg. And when you talk about how there weren't enough women in tech, is that one of the reasons you left? ZUCKERBERG: You know, I - there were several reasons I left, including the fact that I just - I love New York City. Growing up in New York, I never felt conscious about being a woman. I went out to Silicon Valley, and suddenly every moment I was aware that I was a woman. I remember sending emails to people. And I guess Randi could be a guy or girl's name, and they would look visibly disappointed when a woman walked into the room. I guess they thought they were meeting with Randi, a guy. It got exhausting being in room after room of people saying, how do we solve this problem, but then not really doing anything. MCEVERS: The problem of not enough women being in tech? ZUCKERBERG: Exactly. MCEVERS: I mean, this is the big debate, right? Is it the pipeline? Is it that there are not enough women and girls in the pipeline at all? Or is it about what happens once they get through the pipeline? I mean, does some of the responsibility lie with the companies, too? ZUCKERBERG: Absolutely. You know, I think it is a multi-prong problem, and that's why it's going to be difficult to fix it. Diversity takes effort, and it's worth the effort. But on the other hand, I mean, look at a system like Silicon Valley. You have this incredible, entrenched system, where you have these top engineering schools with primarily men graduating in computer science. MCEVERS: Right. ZUCKERBERG: Then you have all the top venture capitalist investors that are around those schools trying to poach that talent. . . MCEVERS: Right. ZUCKERBERG: . . . Who are mostly men. And then because it's men funding men, they hire men. No one out there is trying to be biased, but it's just the nature of this game. And then it keeps feeding itself. So we need to do more on the educational level to get more women into the pipeline, and I'm thrilled that this is the first year at Stanford that there's equal number of men and women in computer science. But you're right, some of it does fall on investors and companies putting in that extra effort to have diversity. MCEVERS: Randi Zuckerberg, thank you so much. ZUCKERBERG: Thank you so much.

BRIAN NAYLOR, BYLINE: As details of the proposed AT&T/Time Warner deal have emerged, political candidates and lawmakers of every stripe have reacted. GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump stated his flat-out opposition.

(APPLAUSE)NAYLOR: The Clinton campaign also raised concerns. On NBC's \"Meet The Press,\" Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine said there were tough questions to be answered.

Others have also weighed in. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa said it's imperative that antitrust regulators conduct what he called a robust review of the proposed deal and said his panel will hold a hearing to examine the deal's impact on competition and consumers.

Todd O'Boyle of Common Cause, which advocates for consumers says that might lead to higher costs and fewer choices for viewers.

S. nuclear power industry is shrinking. Another plant goes offline today. Nuclear power is expensive compared to some alternatives. Frank Morris of member station KCUR reports that that's forcing the industry to reckon with what critics call a broken system. FRANK MORRIS, BYLINE: This plant where I'm standing is a good example. This is the Fort Calhoun nuclear power plant half an hour north of Omaha, Neb. This plant is full of new equipment. There's a building right across from me, a white concrete box that's still under construction. It's licensed until 2033, but this plant is shutting down. BROCK LINDAU: I think we're going 100 miles an hour running perfect and somehow they just took the wheels off from underneath us and now we're trying to skid to a halt. MORRIS: Brock Lindau spent most of his career at the Fort Calhoun nuclear plant. He helped install almost $700 million in upgrades that got the plant through a flood and a fire and helped get a license to operate until 2033. In turn, the plant's given Lindau a good income which he's used to buy a big house. LISA LINDAU: So today, I have to paint the trim around the windows. MORRIS: Lisa Lindau says they love this place, but they have to get it ready to sell when Brock loses his job. L. LINDAU: And it's kind of sad because you think as you're painting, you think a lot, you know? And you can't help but think as you paint, you're painting for the next people. MORRIS: If the Lindaus are perplexed, it's understandable. The Fort Calhoun plant cranked out electricity for 43 years, and it was licensed for another 17. Decommissioning will cost up to $1. 5 billion and take up to 60 years. Still, Tim Burke figures eating all of that is cheaper than keeping the plant in production. Burke runs the Omaha Public Power District, which owns Fort Calhoun, and he says that operating a small plant like this one, especially in a region with abundant wind power and natural gas just doesn't make sense. TIM BURKE: So we had low-cost energy primarily due to increased wind, low cost natural gas and a lot of capacity now in this regional transmission organization. MORRIS: And it's not like his customers are using more power. Across the U. S. , demand has been flat for a decade. New capacity drives down price. Nuclear power with its stiff regulations and fixed expenses can have a hard time competing. ALLISON MACFARLANE: There's certainly accelerated decommissioning. There's a lot more decommissioning going on now than there was, say, 10 or 15 years ago. MORRIS: Allison Macfarlane, former chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, says it wasn't supposed to be like this. A decade ago, low carbon nuclear power had a bright future as a tool to fight climate change. Now the industry's shrinking. MACFARLANE: There are now more plants going offline than coming online. MORRIS: Then what happens to the nuclear waste? MACFARLANE: Yeah. Well, that's an excellent question. It doesn't go anywhere (laughter). There isn't any solution for it right now, which is a big problem. MORRIS: The government had a solution, Yucca Mountain in Nevada. Utility rate payers kicked in $34 billion to develop a long-term storage facility there. But Christina Simeone with the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy says that plan's not going anywhere. CHRISTINA SIMEONE: So what is happening is plants across the country are having to store waste on site. That's every nuclear power plant in the country is storing this high-level radioactive waste on site. MORRIS: Simeone says that set up is, A, dangerous - nuclear power plants and de facto nuclear waste dumps are sited near water which can spread nuclear waste and, B, expensive - waste has to be stored in heavy concrete casks and guarded. The government has already paid more than $5 billion for that. And Simeone says that figure is likely to mushroom to about 30 billion minimum a decade from now.

I'm Terry Gross. Twitter is one of the stars of this election cycle. Everyone is tweeting their reactions to debates and linking to articles. Donald Trump tweets provocative messages even in the middle of the night. The paradox of Twitter is that it's become a great platform for free speech, enabling the voices of individuals and pro-democracy movements to be heard and to connect with others. But it's also given a platform to trolls, people who write tweets that insult, harass and threaten their targets. Last week, the Anti-Defamation League issued a report detailing the widespread use of Twitter to harass journalists with anti-Semitic messages during the 2016 campaign. Twitter executives are wrestling with how to deal with the trolls without undermining Twitter's commitment to free speech. A little later in the show I'll talk about this with BuzzFeed tech reporter Charlie Warzel, who's written a series of articles about harassment on Twitter. But first, we're going to hear from a writer who's received countless harassing and threatening tweets. David French writes for the conservative publication National Review and is a senior fellow in its think tank arm, the National Review Institute. He has been and is still being trolled for his critical comments about Ann Coulter, the alt-right right and Donald Trump. He's part of the Never Trump movement. And Bill Kristol even suggested that French consider running as a conservative alternative to Trump early in the campaign. David French, welcome to FRESH AIR. Tell us first what set off the attack by trolls. DAVID FRENCH: Well, first, thanks very much for having me. I've been listening to FRESH AIR for many years. It's a privilege to be here, although not under these circumstances. What set off the attack by trolls was really something pretty simple. In September or mid-September of last year, I had noticed that Ann Coulter, who is a very prominent supporter of Donald Trump, was tweeting out a lot of thoughts that are common to this part of the right - even though I hate to even call them part of the right, they call themselves part of the right - called the alt-right that were explicitly white nationalist in their tone and tenor. And so I wrote in our group blog on National Review called The Corner that Ann Coulter was deliberately appealing to these people. And I - and basically and politely said this is something that's inexcusable and it has no place in the conservative movement. And then I had no idea what was about to happen next. My Twitter feed basically exploded. I have - did not have that many followers - in the thousands, certainly not like the more prominent folks in politics, but it was unbelievable. I began to see images, for example, of my youngest daughter, who we adopted from Ethiopia many years ago, who at the time was 7 years old - images of her in a gas chamber with a - Donald Trump in an SS uniform about to push the button to kill her. I saw images of her Photoshopped or, you know, artist's rendering of her face in slave fields. I was called all manner of unbelievable names, which is kind of par for the course for Twitter, but among them was this term that has gained currency in recent years called cuckservatives. Cuckservative is somebody who's been cuckolded by the establishment, by the liberal elite. And then people began to refer to my wife as having sex with black men when I was deployed to Iraq in 2007, 2008. And it just descended from there. And that's a side of Twitter I know that others had experienced, but I had certainly never experienced it before. And then it just got worse. GROSS: So this was all because you criticized Ann Coulter? FRENCH: Yes, it was because I - not just criticized Ann Coulter. I mean, that happens all the time. I mean, she's a frequent target of criticism. It's because I criticized this group called the alt-right. It's - and for, you know, those who don't know what the alt-right is, it's a collection of mostly younger people who are rebelling against mainstream conservatism, rebelling against progressive liberalism and have really began to adopt white nationalism, white identity politics. They will forward around Nazi memes. They're very definitely anti-Semitic. They have launched an avalanche of anti-Semitic hate against a number of Jewish journalists. And so this small group is very, very, very vocal online. It has a disproportionate impact online that far outweighs its actual numbers. GROSS: So you start getting, you know, these trolling tweets. Did they start multiplying? Did it start small and keep getting bigger? FRENCH: Yeah, it really did multiply. So the next thing was, you know, I'm a writer, my wife is a writer. So we both wrote a follow-up piece - or I wrote a follow-up piece; she wrote her own piece. She put it in The Washington Post. I put mine in National Review that highlighted just some of these terrible tweets and basically said, look, we're not going to be intimidated by this, but we want to expose it. We want to show people what's going on out there if you criticize the people - some of the people who are supporting Donald Trump or criticize some of Donald Trump's allies, particularly the alt-right. Well, then it just blew up after that. The number of tweets multiplied exponentially. The same images kept coming again and again, including pornographic images. My wife's blog, somebody - several people found her blog on Patheos, which is a religious website, and filled the comments section of her blog with images of African-American men mainly being murdered, committing suicide. It was horrible. It was horrible. So I was able to - fortunately, she was out of town and offline when those images started to roll in, and I was able to scrub them before she could see them. But it would be horribly traumatizing to even see these images. And then - but some of my neighbors saw them who read what I write and what my wife writes, and they were traumatized by it. They were fearful for their own safety. And that was really not the beginning of the end of the harassment we received, but the end of the beginning after we began scrubbing and blocking and reporting all of these images. GROSS: So I'm just wondering, do you think that all the trolling was a result of you criticizing the alt-right, or do you think it was also because you're critical of Donald Trump? You became part of the Never Trump movement. FRENCH: Well, it's both-and. I mean, it initially began - I'd always criticized Donald Trump throughout the primary, but I had never received that. It was when you began to make the linkage between Donald Trump and the alt-right that they really began to get stronger and stronger. And then when you - the more you are against Donald Trump and the more that people feel like people are reading you or listening to what you have to say, then the alt-right comes down on you even harder because they really are sort of like the online shock troops of the Trump movement. I mean, they are the most aggressive, the most vicious, the most threatening, the most targeted. And again, you know, I wouldn't write about this if this had only happened to me. You know, I would have dealt with this in private. I would have dealt with this with law enforcement, tried to deal with this with Twitter. But then I began to hear story after story after story, I mean, multiple people who've taken on Donald Trump, in particular his appeals to white nationalism, in particular his racially-coded appeals. Any time you call that out, any time you criticized that, that part of Trumpism that intersects with the alt-right, they come at you viciously, especially if you're a journalist, especially if you're a writer. GROSS: Did the viciousness that you experienced on Twitter cross over into the larger world? FRENCH: Oh, yeah, absolutely. So, you know, it crossed over into my wife's blog, as I just mentioned. And then there was a brief time where I considered mounting an independent presidential run against Donald Trump. I was talking to Bill Kristol about that, and that leaked out into the press. So there was a whole new level of Twitter attacks that occurred then. But then you - we got an emailed threat that was very serious. And then most recently - and this is alarming and jolting - my wife was on a phone call with her father. They were talking about something unrelated to the alt-right. They're just having a phone conversation, and someone literally broke into the line and began talking about Donald Trump, spewing profanity. We still don't know how this happened. We've contacted law enforcement, they're stumped as to how to how it happened. But it did lead to a pretty frantic and worried search in my father-in-law's home as to whether someone had been in his house and had literally picked up the other end of the phone. So it has crossed over well beyond Twitter. It has crossed over well beyond just comments on blogs and intruded on to, you know, what people would call real life - your phone calls, your emails. So my wife, you know, she carries a handgun now at all times. She's gotten more handgun training. We're much more careful about the security around our home. And again, we're not the only ones. There are other journalists who've spent tons of money on security systems for the homes. They have gotten handguns themselves after never carrying them before in their lives. It really is a campaign of fear and intimidation against journalists across the political spectrum who go against Donald Trump, and in particular go after Donald Trump's connection to the alt-right. GROSS: How did you explain this to your daughter, who I think you said is 7 years old? FRENCH: (Laughter) You know, we - she's now 8, so - she was 7 when this started. So this has been going for more than a year now. So we have sheltered her from this completely. She's an African-American girl in a white family with - other two siblings are white and her parents are white. And she's grown up in the South, and there's going to be a whole lot of sensitivities over the years. And already our sensitivities and explaining and her understanding how she - how and why she's different from her siblings, why her skin color is different, how people interact with us as a family differently, these are things that all kinds of multi-racial adoptive families work through. And it's a very delicate and sensitive thing. So the last thing that we want to do is to introduce this element into her life. So while my older two children, who are 17 and 15, know that their younger sister has been subjected to this, she does not. And we will try to keep this from her as long as we possibly can. I mean, you know, she's still too young to listen to FRESH AIR podcasts. (LAUGHTER)FRENCH: So we're keeping this from her. But there will come a time when we have to introduce this to her and we have to explain that this happened. And this is going to be a very, very, very difficult and painful conversation. And I can't even imagine how she's going to feel about it. And it's going to be a real challenge for our whole family and something that we're kind of pushing down the road because right now, her older siblings have borne the brunt of concern about this. Her parents have borne the brunt of concern about this. And thank God she's been immunized from it and protected from it, but that can't last forever. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is David French. He writes for the conservative publication National Review, and he's also a senior fellow at the National Review's think tank arm, the National Review Institute. We're going to take a short break, then we'll be back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is David French, who writes for the conservative publication National Review and is a senior fellow at the National Review Institute. And we're talking about his experiences being trolled. He started getting really harassing, threatening, vicious tweets after he started speaking out against the alt-right and became a part of the Never Trump movement. So sticking with Twitter now, when you started to be trolled on Twitter, what were your options? What could you do? FRENCH: Well, you know, your options are relatively limited. I mean, you can block or mute the Twitter account, which is - you know, we began blocking Twitter accounts by the hundreds. You can report Twitter accounts for banning, which Twitter did ban a few of them. My wife took the lead in that and spent better part of a day reporting account after account after account. And many of them did get banned. And then, you know, if something on Twitter does cross the line into what you think is a true threat - in other words, an actionable - a threat that implies an immediate potential for violence, you can refer that to law enforcement. You know, it's pretty tough to identify any given tweet as a true threat. Normally, it's threatening or intimidating, but it's not a true threat and it's probably protected by the First Amendment, even as bad as some of those images were. But Twitter, of course, is not a government entity. It does not have to allow any and all constitutionally-protected expression on its site. GROSS: So you blocked a lot of - blocked a lot of people. And blocking means their messages will no longer be received by you, and they know that you've blocked them. FRENCH: Correct. GROSS: You muted some of them, which means that their messages will no longer be seen by you, but they don't know it. FRENCH: Right. GROSS: So you're still officially getting their messages, but you're actually not. FRENCH: Right, right. GROSS: So there's no revenge that can be sought for muting someone because they don't know, whereas if they block you - if you block them, they might want to get even with you in some way. FRENCH: Right. GROSS: Were you concerned about that, that. . . FRENCH: Well, you know, I'll be honest with you, Terry, I was not - I'm not a Twitter expert by any means. I mean, I began to reflexively block before a friend said, hey, mute them because it has the same effect as blocking in the sense that they can't - you can't see what they write. But it's kind of a - you get a bit of satisfaction out of it because they will spend time busily working on their little posts and putting together little - their little images to no effect because you're not seeing it. So the mute button I think is more effective in some ways than the block button because again, they don't know when they've been muted. And I think that's a more effective way, all things considered, that - the more effective tool that you, as the Twitter user, have. But, you know, Twitter itself, I think, has a real problem on its hands. I mean, this is a platform that right now I use only because professionally I feel like I must. Every journalist is on Twitter. Following journalists on Twitter is a great way to see breaking news as it's unfolding and emerging. And so for right now, it's indispensable for our profession for a very limited purpose. But I know journalist after journalist, writer after writer, public figure after public figure who literally dreads opening their Twitter app right now. So good on Twitter for creating something that for a time is indispensable. But they haven't fixed this troll problem, and that means they're replaceable as soon as somebody gets a better platform because you don't want a product that people dread to use. GROSS: I'm wondering how time consuming this process has been for you, both in terms of trying to mute or block people who are trolling you and in terms of trying to get Twitter to ban people who are trolling you. FRENCH: It's been very time consuming. I would say that between the muting and the blocking and the attempts to ban over the last year, you're talking hours and hours, multiplying into days of work because you're reviewing your timelines, you are going through the process with - of reporting the bans to Twitter. Now, the bans we mainly focused on early on, and we were able to get the worst-of-the-worst accounts banned. And since then, we have focused much more on blocking and muting, and that's much less - that's a very quick process. GROSS: When you reported people who were harassing you on Twitter, what's your understanding of the criteria Twitter used to decide whether the people you reported to them were worthy of being banned? FRENCH: Well, you know, they're looking for hateful speech. They're looking for threatening speech. All of these things are subjective. So there's going to be some give in the joints. However, the speech that we were dealing with - so far over the line. Our situation was black and white. I mean, you just had to show them what the tweets were. There is no circumstance under which Twitter would want its platform to be used to show pictures of 7-year-old girls in gas chambers or pictures of 7-year-old African-American girls as slaves. There's no circumstance where that is what they want their product to be used for. So all we had to do was show them the evidence, and, as I said, they responded reasonably. The problem was that these trolls use a system that was created with, I think, perhaps, an excessively idealistic view of human nature, a system that was used to connect everyone with everyone else who's on Twitter. They used the system itself in a way that it was not designed to be used for but was easily exploited. And that exploitation is where Twitter has a real problem. They can respond, I think, with some decent speed once they're aware of an issue and once they're aware that people are receiving real harassment. The deeper problem that they have, as I said, is they set up a system that, from the ground up, is going to give basically everyone one clear shot at you first. GROSS: Is one of the problems that you ran into that, like, if somebody has a lot of followers and that somebody sent you a harassing tweet, then all their followers are following that harassing tweet and they start sending you harassing tweets, too, even though they have no idea who you are? FRENCH: Yeah, absolutely. And this is actually a pretty common tactic you will see. You will see someone with a large following fix a target, and they will tweet something at that target that is cruel but not over the line to receive a ban or a block - or to receive a ban. But they know - they know they have thousands and thousands and thousands of followers who have no conscience and no scruples. So it's almost like sending out the signal flare or sounding the bugle charge. And you will see this online. And a number of the more quote, unquote, \"respectable\" atl-righters have used this tactic frequently. And that is, they're going to fix that target with their own tweet, knowing full well and intending full well for the resulting consequence. And then they go back to Twitter and they say, well, it's not my fault. Look at my Twitter timeline. And I'm not responsible for these people. And it's a very hard thing for Twitter to pin down and respond to because then - when these same people go back to the conservative public and will say look, Twitter is discriminating against me. My tweets aren't nearly as bad as anyone else's. And so that's a real difficulty. And again, it's a difficulty that's inherent in the platform. It's the way people have taken this platform and figured out diabolical ways to use it. And it's one of the things that makes - I think puts Twitter on precarious ground right now. GROSS: What would you like to see Twitter do? How - how do you wish they had responded to you? FRENCH: You know, I - boy, I'm going to - I'll put on my entrepreneurial tech titan hat right now (laughter) and try to figure out a. . . GROSS: Which I'm sure you own, yeah. FRENCH: (Laughter) Right. You know, I think that the one thing that Twitter has to get a handle on, which is so unfortunate because it's so key to its appeal as a platform when done well, is that ability to immediately target and attack - and put whatever you want to put on their timeline just by hitting their handle with no filter, no pre-clearance. And then that - that's what exposes people to trolling. And when it works out well - when people like someone and they're popular, it can be a joy. You know, the other day - I'll tell a story on myself - I'm a big fan of Dwayne The Rock Johnson, America's greatest celebrity. And I had a highlight when I tweeted something at him, and he tweeted right back at me. That's a cool thing about Twitter. I had to screenshot that, showed it to my kids, that means I'm somebody. The Rock tweeted at me. You know, that's a fun thing. Who doesn't like that? But then that very thing that people use for joy and for fun, when it's in the wrong hands becomes a weapon for intimidation and creating fear. And I honestly - boy, I tell you, if I knew the answer to that I would be doing it. GROSS: My guest is David French, a writer for National Review and a senior fellow at the National Review Institute. We'll talk more after a break. And I'll talk with Charlie Warzel, who's written a series of articles for BuzzFeed about how Twitter is dealing with trolls. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross, back with writer David French. We're talking about how he's been trolled, harassed on Twitter ever since he started writing critical comments about Ann Coulter and the alt-right and became part of the Never Trump movement. French is a writer for the conservative publication National Review, which published his article about being harassed on Twitter titled \"The Price I've Paid For Opposing Donald Trump. \" So you referred earlier to almost being afraid to open Twitter because you don't know what you're going to see and it might be very offensive. So are you still concerned about that? Are you still getting trolled? FRENCH: (Laughter) Oh, my goodness, I - we dread it. I mean, so the other day I was - I was at dinner - at lunch after church with some of our friends, teachers in the kin - in the little school that my kids attend. And they said, well, have things calmed down for you? And so I said, well, let's see. And I just opened my Twitter timeline and scrolled through the first three or so. And the first one was just a profanity-laden tirade against me. And I kind of laughed at that. But my wife was looking over my shoulder, and she saw the next ones which I hadn't read yet, and she just burst into tears. And, look, I don't like to admit this stuff because the trolls feed on your anguish and your pain. They - they love it when they can get to you. But, you know, people need to know this is the reality of what it's like right now when you're out there on these issues. And my wife is a survivor of sex abuse and assault. And here was Twitter. . . GROSS: Which I should say she's written about, you know. . . FRENCH: Exactly. GROSS: . . . So she's comfortable with you saying that. FRENCH: Yes, yes. I would not just spill that. She's written about it in no less prominent of a publication than The Washington Post, so I'm not telling stories on my family. And so she's a survivor of a very - horribly traumatic experiences. And, you know, there's people boasting about having sex with her one after the other after the other on Twitter, these - these men who are bombarding the Twitter feed with boasts because again, going back to earlier in the interview when I noted that people had claimed that one of the ways for harassing us is because we have an African-American daughter was to say that my wife had been sleeping with black men while I was deployed. And so you just have this bombarding your Twitter feed, she saw it. And it's - and she's tough. I mean, she is tough. But, you know, the first hundred times, it's one thing. When it starts to get to the next hundred and the next hundred, it's - it wears down even the strongest person. GROSS: So, I mean, one of your concerns is that the alt-right has attached itself to the Republican Party nominee, Donald Trump. So this is obviously a connection you'd like to see undone. FRENCH: Oh, absolutely. GROSS: What do you think will happen? Do you think that the alt-right is now just kind of a part of the Republican Party? FRENCH: Well, you know, I will tell you this, if the alt-right is part of the Republican Party, the Republican Party's days are numbered because any movement that attaches itself to that level of hatred and viciousness is - it's going to end up being just a small, bitter, vicious rump of a party because it has no electoral future at all. Now, the problem that we have is that before that happens, before that extinction of it happens, an awful lot of damage can be done. And one of the things that's most disturbing and, again, why I wrote my piece, it's not so much that there is an alt-right that exists. We've always known that there is a trolling culture out there and there's a culture that glories in hurting and hating and intimidating other people. That's been there. What is new here is this notion that not just the GOP nominee, who has retweeted alt-right accounts and whose team is very, very well aware of this dynamic out there, but also major outlets of mainstream formerly what I would call mainstream conservative media, like a Breitbart, like a Drudge, directly and intentionally and purposefully stoke this alt-right nonsense. They publish long, extended pieces that essentially function as rationalizations of the alt-right, excuse-making for the alt-right. They advance alt-right memes and alt-right themes into the culture. They do all of this very, very deliberately. There's nothing conspiratorial about it. It's just right there out in the open. And so one of the most disappointing things - I would say the most disappointing thing about this election cycle has not been that this alt-right exists. We've always known, as I said, that there is this dark underbelly out there of the internet. We might not have known how big it was or how focused it was. But what has been so profoundly disappointing is the outright indifference and unconcern to its existence shown by so many more mainstream Republicans. And that's one thing that's been incredibly and deeply disappointing. GROSS: David French, thank you very much for talking with us openly about your experiences. Thank you. FRENCH: Well, thank you so much for having me. GROSS: David French is a writer for National Review and a senior fellow at its think tank arm, the National Review Institute. TERRY GROSS, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Twitter is one of the stars of this election cycle. Everyone is tweeting their reactions to debates and linking to articles. Donald Trump tweets provocative messages even in the middle of the night. The paradox of Twitter is that it's become a great platform for free speech, enabling the voices of individuals and pro-democracy movements to be heard and to connect with others. But it's also given a platform to trolls, people who write tweets that insult, harass and threaten their targets. Last week, the Anti-Defamation League issued a report detailing the widespread use of Twitter to harass journalists with anti-Semitic messages during the 2016 campaign. Twitter executives are wrestling with how to deal with the trolls without undermining Twitter's commitment to free speech. A little later in the show I'll talk about this with BuzzFeed tech reporter Charlie Warzel, who's written a series of articles about harassment on Twitter. But first, we're going to hear from a writer who's received countless harassing and threatening tweets. David French writes for the conservative publication National Review and is a senior fellow in its think tank arm, the National Review Institute. He has been and is still being trolled for his critical comments about Ann Coulter, the alt-right right and Donald Trump. He's part of the Never Trump movement. And Bill Kristol even suggested that French consider running as a conservative alternative to Trump early in the campaign. David French, welcome to FRESH AIR. Tell us first what set off the attack by trolls. DAVID FRENCH: Well, first, thanks very much for having me. I've been listening to FRESH AIR for many years. It's a privilege to be here, although not under these circumstances. What set off the attack by trolls was really something pretty simple. In September or mid-September of last year, I had noticed that Ann Coulter, who is a very prominent supporter of Donald Trump, was tweeting out a lot of thoughts that are common to this part of the right - even though I hate to even call them part of the right, they call themselves part of the right - called the alt-right that were explicitly white nationalist in their tone and tenor. And so I wrote in our group blog on National Review called The Corner that Ann Coulter was deliberately appealing to these people. And I - and basically and politely said this is something that's inexcusable and it has no place in the conservative movement. And then I had no idea what was about to happen next. My Twitter feed basically exploded. I have - did not have that many followers - in the thousands, certainly not like the more prominent folks in politics, but it was unbelievable. I began to see images, for example, of my youngest daughter, who we adopted from Ethiopia many years ago, who at the time was 7 years old - images of her in a gas chamber with a - Donald Trump in an SS uniform about to push the button to kill her. I saw images of her Photoshopped or, you know, artist's rendering of her face in slave fields. I was called all manner of unbelievable names, which is kind of par for the course for Twitter, but among them was this term that has gained currency in recent years called cuckservatives. Cuckservative is somebody who's been cuckolded by the establishment, by the liberal elite. And then people began to refer to my wife as having sex with black men when I was deployed to Iraq in 2007, 2008. And it just descended from there. And that's a side of Twitter I know that others had experienced, but I had certainly never experienced it before. And then it just got worse. GROSS: So this was all because you criticized Ann Coulter? FRENCH: Yes, it was because I - not just criticized Ann Coulter. I mean, that happens all the time. I mean, she's a frequent target of criticism. It's because I criticized this group called the alt-right. It's - and for, you know, those who don't know what the alt-right is, it's a collection of mostly younger people who are rebelling against mainstream conservatism, rebelling against progressive liberalism and have really began to adopt white nationalism, white identity politics. They will forward around Nazi memes. They're very definitely anti-Semitic. They have launched an avalanche of anti-Semitic hate against a number of Jewish journalists. And so this small group is very, very, very vocal online. It has a disproportionate impact online that far outweighs its actual numbers. GROSS: So you start getting, you know, these trolling tweets.

We want to show people what's going on out there if you criticize the people - some of the people who are supporting Donald Trump or criticize some of Donald Trump's allies, particularly the alt-right. Well, then it just blew up after that. The number of tweets multiplied exponentially. The same images kept coming again and again, including pornographic images. My wife's blog, somebody - several people found her blog on Patheos, which is a religious website, and filled the comments section of her blog with images of African-American men mainly being murdered, committing suicide.

It was when you began to make the linkage between Donald Trump and the alt-right that they really began to get stronger and stronger. And then when you - the more you are against Donald Trump and the more that people feel like people are reading you or listening to what you have to say, then the alt-right comes down on you even harder because they really are sort of like the online shock troops of the Trump movement. I mean, they are the most aggressive, the most vicious, the most threatening, the most targeted. And again, you know, I wouldn't write about this if this had only happened to me. You know, I would have dealt with this in private. I would have dealt with this with law enforcement, tried to deal with this with Twitter. But then I began to hear story after story after story, I mean, multiple people who've taken on Donald Trump, in particular his appeals to white nationalism, in particular his racially-coded appeals. Any time you call that out, any time you criticized that, that part of Trumpism that intersects with the alt-right, they come at you viciously, especially if you're a journalist, especially if you're a writer. GROSS: Did the viciousness that you experienced on Twitter cross over into the larger world? FRENCH: Oh, yeah, absolutely. So, you know, it crossed over into my wife's blog, as I just mentioned.

So my wife, you know, she carries a handgun now at all times. She's gotten more handgun training. We're much more careful about the security around our home. And again, we're not the only ones. There are other journalists who've spent tons of money on security systems for the homes. They have gotten handguns themselves after never carrying them before in their lives. It really is a campaign of fear and intimidation against journalists across the political spectrum who go against Donald Trump, and in particular go after Donald Trump's connection to the alt-right. GROSS: How did you explain this to your daughter, who I think you said is 7 years old? FRENCH: (Laughter) You know, we - she's now 8, so - she was 7 when this started. So this has been going for more than a year now. So we have sheltered her from this completely. She's an African-American girl in a white family with - other two siblings are white and her parents are white. And she's grown up in the South, and there's going to be a whole lot of sensitivities over the years. And already our sensitivities and explaining and her understanding how she - how and why she's different from her siblings, why her skin color is different, how people interact with us as a family differently, these are things that all kinds of multi-racial adoptive families work through. And it's a very delicate and sensitive thing. So the last thing that we want to do is to introduce this element into her life. So while my older two children, who are 17 and 15, know that their younger sister has been subjected to this, she does not. And we will try to keep this from her as long as we possibly can. I mean, you know, she's still too young to listen to FRESH AIR podcasts. (LAUGHTER) FRENCH: So we're keeping this from her. But there will come a time when we have to introduce this to her and we have to explain that this happened. And this is going to be a very, very, very difficult and painful conversation. And I can't even imagine how she's going to feel about it. And it's going to be a real challenge for our whole family and something that we're kind of pushing down the road because right now, her older siblings have borne the brunt of concern about this. Her parents have borne the brunt of concern about this. And thank God she's been immunized from it and protected from it, but that can't last forever. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is David French. He writes for the conservative publication National Review, and he's also a senior fellow at the National Review's think tank arm, the National Review Institute. We're going to take a short break, then we'll be back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is David French, who writes for the conservative publication National Review and is a senior fellow at the National Review Institute. And we're talking about his experiences being trolled. He started getting really harassing, threatening, vicious tweets after he started speaking out against the alt-right and became a part of the Never Trump movement. So sticking with Twitter now, when you started to be trolled on Twitter, what were your options? What could you do? FRENCH: Well, you know, your options are relatively limited. I mean, you can block or mute the Twitter account, which is - you know, we began blocking Twitter accounts by the hundreds. You can report Twitter accounts for banning, which Twitter did ban a few of them. My wife took the lead in that and spent better part of a day reporting account after account after account. And many of them did get banned. And then, you know, if something on Twitter does cross the line into what you think is a true threat - in other words, an actionable - a threat that implies an immediate potential for violence, you can refer that to law enforcement. You know, it's pretty tough to identify any given tweet as a true threat. Normally, it's threatening or intimidating, but it's not a true threat and it's probably protected by the First Amendment, even as bad as some of those images were. But Twitter, of course, is not a government entity. It does not have to allow any and all constitutionally-protected expression on its site. GROSS: So you blocked a lot of - blocked a lot of people. And blocking means their messages will no longer be received by you, and they know that you've blocked them. FRENCH: Correct. GROSS: You muted some of them, which means that their messages will no longer be seen by you, but they don't know it. FRENCH: Right. GROSS: So you're still officially getting their messages, but you're actually not. FRENCH: Right, right. GROSS: So there's no revenge that can be sought for muting someone because they don't know, whereas if they block you - if you block them, they might want to get even with you in some way. FRENCH: Right. GROSS: Were you concerned about that, that. . . FRENCH: Well, you know, I'll be honest with you, Terry, I was not - I'm not a Twitter expert by any means. I mean, I began to reflexively block before a friend said, hey, mute them because it has the same effect as blocking in the sense that they can't - you can't see what they write. But it's kind of a - you get a bit of satisfaction out of it because they will spend time busily working on their little posts and putting together little - their little images to no effect because you're not seeing it. So the mute button I think is more effective in some ways than the block button because again, they don't know when they've been muted. And I think that's a more effective way, all things considered, that - the more effective tool that you, as the Twitter user, have. But, you know, Twitter itself, I think, has a real problem on its hands. I mean, this is a platform that right now I use only because professionally I feel like I must. Every journalist is on Twitter. Following journalists on Twitter is a great way to see breaking news as it's unfolding and emerging. And so for right now, it's indispensable for our profession for a very limited purpose. But I know journalist after journalist, writer after writer, public figure after public figure who literally dreads opening their Twitter app right now. So good on Twitter for creating something that for a time is indispensable. But they haven't fixed this troll problem, and that means they're replaceable as soon as somebody gets a better platform because you don't want a product that people dread to use. GROSS: I'm wondering how time consuming this process has been for you, both in terms of trying to mute or block people who are trolling you and in terms of trying to get Twitter to ban people who are trolling you. FRENCH: It's been very time consuming. I would say that between the muting and the blocking and the attempts to ban over the last year, you're talking hours and hours, multiplying into days of work because you're reviewing your timelines, you are going through the process with - of reporting the bans to Twitter. Now, the bans we mainly focused on early on, and we were able to get the worst-of-the-worst accounts banned. And since then, we have focused much more on blocking and muting, and that's much less - that's a very quick process. GROSS: When you reported people who were harassing you on Twitter, what's your understanding of the criteria Twitter used to decide whether the people you reported to them were worthy of being banned? FRENCH: Well, you know, they're looking for hateful speech. They're looking for threatening speech. All of these things are subjective. So there's going to be some give in the joints. However, the speech that we were dealing with - so far over the line. Our situation was black and white. I mean, you just had to show them what the tweets were. There is no circumstance under which Twitter would want its platform to be used to show pictures of 7-year-old girls in gas chambers or pictures of 7-year-old African-American girls as slaves. There's no circumstance where that is what they want their product to be used for. So all we had to do was show them the evidence, and, as I said, they responded reasonably. The problem was that these trolls use a system that was created with, I think, perhaps, an excessively idealistic view of human nature, a system that was used to connect everyone with everyone else who's on Twitter. They used the system itself in a way that it was not designed to be used for but was easily exploited. And that exploitation is where Twitter has a real problem. They can respond, I think, with some decent speed once they're aware of an issue and once they're aware that people are receiving real harassment. The deeper problem that they have, as I said, is they set up a system that, from the ground up, is going to give basically everyone one clear shot at you first. GROSS: Is one of the problems that you ran into that, like, if somebody has a lot of followers and that somebody sent you a harassing tweet, then all their followers are following that harassing tweet and they start sending you harassing tweets, too, even though they have no idea who you are? FRENCH: Yeah, absolutely. And this is actually a pretty common tactic you will see. You will see someone with a large following fix a target, and they will tweet something at that target that is cruel but not over the line to receive a ban or a block - or to receive a ban. But they know - they know they have thousands and thousands and thousands of followers who have no conscience and no scruples. So it's almost like sending out the signal flare or sounding the bugle charge. And you will see this online. And a number of the more quote, unquote, \"respectable\" atl-righters have used this tactic frequently. And that is, they're going to fix that target with their own tweet, knowing full well and intending full well for the resulting consequence. And then they go back to Twitter and they say, well, it's not my fault. Look at my Twitter timeline. And I'm not responsible for these people. And it's a very hard thing for Twitter to pin down and respond to because then - when these same people go back to the conservative public and will say look, Twitter is discriminating against me. My tweets aren't nearly as bad as anyone else's. And so that's a real difficulty. And again, it's a difficulty that's inherent in the platform. It's the way people have taken this platform and figured out diabolical ways to use it. And it's one of the things that makes - I think puts Twitter on precarious ground right now. GROSS: What would you like to see Twitter do? How - how do you wish they had responded to you? FRENCH: You know, I - boy, I'm going to - I'll put on my entrepreneurial tech titan hat right now (laughter) and try to figure out a. . . GROSS: Which I'm sure you own, yeah. FRENCH: (Laughter) Right. You know, I think that the one thing that Twitter has to get a handle on, which is so unfortunate because it's so key to its appeal as a platform when done well, is that ability to immediately target and attack - and put whatever you want to put on their timeline just by hitting their handle with no filter, no pre-clearance. And then that - that's what exposes people to trolling. And when it works out well - when people like someone and they're popular, it can be a joy. You know, the other day - I'll tell a story on myself - I'm a big fan of Dwayne The Rock Johnson, America's greatest celebrity. And I had a highlight when I tweeted something at him, and he tweeted right back at me. That's a cool thing about Twitter. I had to screenshot that, showed it to my kids, that means I'm somebody. The Rock tweeted at me. You know, that's a fun thing. Who doesn't like that? But then that very thing that people use for joy and for fun, when it's in the wrong hands becomes a weapon for intimidation and creating fear. And I honestly - boy, I tell you, if I knew the answer to that I would be doing it. GROSS: My guest is David French, a writer for National Review and a senior fellow at the National Review Institute. We'll talk more after a break. And I'll talk with Charlie Warzel, who's written a series of articles for BuzzFeed about how Twitter is dealing with trolls. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross, back with writer David French. We're talking about how he's been trolled, harassed on Twitter ever since he started writing critical comments about Ann Coulter and the alt-right and became part of the Never Trump movement. French is a writer for the conservative publication National Review, which published his article about being harassed on Twitter titled \"The Price I've Paid For Opposing Donald Trump. \" So you referred earlier to almost being afraid to open Twitter because you don't know what you're going to see and it might be very offensive. So are you still concerned about that? Are you still getting trolled? FRENCH: (Laughter) Oh, my goodness, I - we dread it. I mean, so the other day I was - I was at dinner - at lunch after church with some of our friends, teachers in the kin - in the little school that my kids attend. And they said, well, have things calmed down for you? And so I said, well, let's see. And I just opened my Twitter timeline and scrolled through the first three or so. And the first one was just a profanity-laden tirade against me. And I kind of laughed at that. But my wife was looking over my shoulder, and she saw the next ones which I hadn't read yet, and she just burst into tears. And, look, I don't like to admit this stuff because the trolls feed on your anguish and your pain. They - they love it when they can get to you. But, you know, people need to know this is the reality of what it's like right now when you're out there on these issues. And my wife is a survivor of sex abuse and assault. And here was Twitter. . . GROSS: Which I should say she's written about, you know. . . FRENCH: Exactly. GROSS: . . . So she's comfortable with you saying that. FRENCH: Yes, yes. I would not just spill that. She's written about it in no less prominent of a publication than The Washington Post, so I'm not telling stories on my family. And so she's a survivor of a very - horribly traumatic experiences. And, you know, there's people boasting about having sex with her one after the other after the other on Twitter, these - these men who are bombarding the Twitter feed with boasts because again, going back to earlier in the interview when I noted that people had claimed that one of the ways for harassing us is because we have an African-American daughter was to say that my wife had been sleeping with black men while I was deployed. And so you just have this bombarding your Twitter feed, she saw it. And it's - and she's tough. I mean, she is tough. But, you know, the first hundred times, it's one thing. When it starts to get to the next hundred and the next hundred, it's - it wears down even the strongest person. GROSS: So, I mean, one of your concerns is that the alt-right has attached itself to the Republican Party nominee, Donald Trump. So this is obviously a connection you'd like to see undone. FRENCH: Oh, absolutely. GROSS: What do you think will happen? Do you think that the alt-right is now just kind of a part of the Republican Party? FRENCH: Well, you know, I will tell you this, if the alt-right is part of the Republican Party, the Republican Party's days are numbered because any movement that attaches itself to that level of hatred and viciousness is - it's going to end up being just a small, bitter, vicious rump of a party because it has no electoral future at all. Now, the problem that we have is that before that happens, before that extinction of it happens, an awful lot of damage can be done. And one of the things that's most disturbing and, again, why I wrote my piece, it's not so much that there is an alt-right that exists. We've always known that there is a trolling culture out there and there's a culture that glories in hurting and hating and intimidating other people. That's been there. What is new here is this notion that not just the GOP nominee, who has retweeted alt-right accounts and whose team is very, very well aware of this dynamic out there, but also major outlets of mainstream formerly what I would call mainstream conservative media, like a Breitbart, like a Drudge, directly and intentionally and purposefully stoke this alt-right nonsense. They publish long, extended pieces that essentially function as rationalizations of the alt-right, excuse-making for the alt-right. They advance alt-right memes and alt-right themes into the culture. They do all of this very, very deliberately. There's nothing conspiratorial about it. It's just right there out in the open. And so one of the most disappointing things - I would say the most disappointing thing about this election cycle has not been that this alt-right exists. We've always known, as I said, that there is this dark underbelly out there of the internet. We might not have known how big it was or how focused it was. But what has been so profoundly disappointing is the outright indifference and unconcern to its existence shown by so many more mainstream Republicans. And that's one thing that's been incredibly and deeply disappointing. GROSS: David French, thank you very much for talking with us openly about your experiences. Thank you. FRENCH: Well, thank you so much for having me.

Warzel is a technology reporter for BuzzFeed. Charlie Warzel, welcome to FRESH AIR. As you point out in your articles, one of Twitter's greatest strengths is also one of its vulnerabilities, free speech. The founders of Twitter were strong free speech advocates. It's the free speech approach to Twitter that has enabled Twitter to be such an important platform for pro-democracy movements, for the Arab Spring. Can you talk about that paradox that the free speech that Twitter embodies is also Twitter's vulnerability? CHARLIE WARZEL: I think that this is one of the fundamental issues of the internet, this issue of free speech right now. And what we're sort of seeing is the idealistic understanding of what the internet could be, this utopian idea that so many entrepreneurs and people who have created these enormous social platforms, that they believe at their core that the internet can sort of raise all voices and really be an amazing tool. And to have that anonymity tends to be something that these platforms favor. In Twitter's case, its core to their idea of free speech, and free speech is one of the founding principles that Twitter is built upon and this understanding that to truly connect the world, to truly be the pulse of the world, you have to give people the option to be able to be free of persecution. And that's why you saw so much of what happened in the early days of Twitter with the Iranian revolution and the Arab Spring, where Twitter played such an important role for political dissidents. It really sort of protected and allowed them to have a voice and elevated the platform. GROSS: Would you compare Twitter's policy with Facebook and Instagram in terms of what you can say and how - and how you have to identify yourself? WARZEL: Instagram and Facebook have adopted a real identity-centric approach. You have to give a version of yourself. You can't choose a pseudonym. You have to project some version of the person who you really are. And that is a very powerful thing, and it's a reason why Facebook is sort of one of the primary ways we authenticate ourselves across the internet. And as a result, Facebook has its own problems with abuse and harassment but not nearly to the same degree because there's no way for people to sort of hide behind an anonymous account name or an anonymous avatar. On Facebook, you have to project that image of who you are. And Facebook has really doubled down on that. They have a lot of strict community standards as well as Instagram. One of those is no nudity, and it is something that has - that strong stand has inured the platform a little bit more to the kind of abuse that we're seeing grow so rapidly on Twitter. GROSS: Yeah, you mentioned that Twitter is one of the few social media platforms used in the adult entertainment industry because it allows nudity. WARZEL: Absolutely. And for that, it's been an incredibly useful platform for adult entertainers. And it is an example of giving a voice and being a home for people that don't necessarily have a voice. And I think that you see that actually working - not to make too much of a jump, but it's really one of the same principles that's at play with a lot of activist movements in the country. It is a place where you can broadcast your raw opinion. You can get the news out that, you know, maybe some platforms are wary to broadcast. And that's been an incredibly successful tool for all kinds of movements like Black Lives Matter and the Arab Spring. GROSS: So one of the kinds of videos that's a real issue on social media is beheading videos. Sometimes a beheading video, as gruesome as it is, is news because it proves that a hostage has been murdered. Sometimes it's purely harassment. People have been getting beheading videos just as a way of upsetting them, of harassing them, of threatening them. Can you compare, for instance, how Facebook and Twitter deal with beheading videos? WARZEL: I think this is something that my reporting showed Twitter struggled internally with a lot, especially in in 2014, when this rash of ISIS beheading videos really started to flood the internet. There were internal meetings that we reported that showed that Twitter's executives were truly concerned that the platform would be overrun by this kind of content that may be newsworthy but is also broadcasting a very distinct message and is also incredibly disturbing. But Twitter has become the place where news happens, where you get that raw eyewitness account and access. And Twitter had to figure out a way to harness the best of that. And I think that is something that they're still struggling with. They've created a newsworthy clause which allows them to allow certain images based off of their relevancy to public information and to the news. But there was a worry inside the company that if Twitter were to be overrun with these grisly, just very disturbing videos that there really wouldn't be anyone who would want to sign on. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is journalist Charlie Warzel. He covers tech for BuzzFeed, and he's written a series of articles about Twitter and trolling. We're going to take a short break, then we'll be back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is journalist Charlie Warzel. He's a tech reporter for BuzzFeed. He's been writing a series of articles about Twitter and trolling and what Twitter is and isn't doing to try to stop trolling. You write that there's really a discussion, a debate within Twitter about what is Twitter. Is it more of a communication utility where it just - you know, it opens up the lines and you do what you will with it, kind of like the phone company, or is it a mediator of content, where content has to have some oversight? Would you describe more about that debate? WARZEL: Anyone who's been following Twitter for the past decade has watched this evolution. Twitter started out as a very sort of quick, short-burst messaging platform, just the 140 characters, no images, no video, really sort of like a status update, what you're doing that day or at that moment and in a sense evolved just incredibly to be this sort of media-rich platform that has content partnerships with the NFL and media outlets like Bloomberg. As a result, Twitter really sort of is this media company. It is a place where news happens. It is a vibrant source of news for so many people. And yet Twitter is also a utility in many ways. Twitter is this communication method, this digital way of reaching somebody, of having a conversation? It provides that infrastructure. And the real problem here is - seems to be that Twitter doesn't really want to put itself in any kind of box like that. They're very reluctant to, and they keep redefining, you know, who they are. And the problem with that redefinition is that a utility is not subject to nearly the same kind of moderation as a media company. I can send you or anyone almost anything over a text message and AT&T or Verizon aren't going to moderate that and have no requirement to moderate that, whereas if I use a blogging platform to, you know, smear somebody or say something awful about somebody, there is sort of a standard on the internet that has been created that that should be regulated. GROSS: What kind of effort is Twitter making to come up with a solution, a product that will both protect people on Twitter and protect free speech? WARZEL: This is the fundamental problem, the free speech element really, really hampers Twitter. It's very important to them that no voices be silenced. And yet the task of moderating is to silence certain voices to some extent. Twitter introduced a quality filter not too long ago that they have rolled out to everyone. It used to be only for special verified users, so lots of celebrities and journalists. But this filter has proven - it's driven by an algorithm, and it's proven to be generally poor. It's also an opt-in filter, meaning everyday users are everyday users are going to have to go through their settings and change that. And that's something that I think plenty of everyday Twitter users who aren't sort of in the weeds don't necessarily even know they have that option. GROSS: What does it filter? WARZEL: The quality filter will ostensibly favor tweets that are created by verified users. I think that there is some effort to filter out certain search terms perhaps that are particularly violent or racially insensitive or tagged to hate speech in some way. But again, this is all very proprietary information that Twitter doesn't really let anyone in on, especially journalists. And this is one of the difficulties in covering Twitter from this angle of harassment is that there's so little knowledge as to what Twitter is really trying to do and so little effort on their part to disclose any of it, an unwillingness to disclose any of it that makes it difficult to see how, if at all, they are earnestly trying to fix this problem. GROSS: BuzzFeed conducted a survey of Twitter users. There were 2,700 users who responded to the survey. I would say right at the jump here this is a very unscientific (laughter) survey. WARZEL: Yes. GROSS: This is representative of people who knew about the survey and decided to participate in it. That said, what were some of your takeaways from these responders? WARZEL: I'll also just stress that this is an unscientific survey. But nonetheless we wanted to hear from users themselves and understand exactly what happens when they do go out there and experience harassment and report it. And what we found was that roughly 46 percent of respondents told us that the last time they reported an abusive tweet to the company, the company took no action on the request that they were aware of. Another 29 percent said when they reported abusive tweets, they never heard anything back at all. It was effectively radio silence. And 18 percent said that when they did report an abusive tweet, they were told that the tweet did not violate Twitter's rules of being either a violent threat or hateful conduct. Only 56 instances out of roughly 2,700 people surveyed showed that Twitter deleted an offending account or a tweet that violated these rules. And so I think what - what the survey really showed was that regardless of what Twitter is doing behind the scenes, Twitter is doing a poor job of communicating exactly what's going on once you hit that report button. GROSS: The New York Times this week ran a double-page spread of all the people, places and things Trump has insulted on Twitter since declaring his presidency. And there were one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight columns of really small print covering two pages of these tweets. Have you been following his tweets? And I'm just wondering how you think Donald Trump's use of Twitter is affecting perceptions of Twitter. WARZEL: I think this is one of the most fascinating things about Twitter is just how integral it has been in this election. Donald Trump has been able to really leverage Twitter to get his message out to the base, really sort of skirting the media. And then also using Twitter as a way to pick up a lot of free media. He can send out a string of incendiary tweets at 3 in the morning and by 7 a. m. , they're dominating all of the morning shows. Twitter has been just central in this. And yet so much of that message lately has been so negative. And if you look at the way that Donald Trump tweets and sort of what that New York Times spread can kind of show is that Donald Trump is himself a very effective troll with regard to Twitter. He says incendiary things that may or may not be based at all in fact. He sort of is looking for the reaction more than he's looking for any sort of substance. The fact that you have engaged with it, that you are outraged by it is just as important as whether or not you believe in it. And I think that, you know, that behavior is again sort of being normalized in that sense to have somebody who exhibits a lot of this trollish behavior be elevated to the most covered human being in America or maybe the world for this past 18 months, I think that that has a profound effect on how other people, you know, choose to use the internet. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is journalist Charlie Warzel. He covers tech for BuzzFeed. And he's written a series of articles about Twitter and trolling. We're going to take a short break, then we'll be back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is journalist Charlie Warzel. He's a tech reporter for BuzzFeed. He's been writing a series of articles about Twitter and trolling and what Twitter is and isn't doing to try to stop trolling. What kind of response have you gotten from Twitter to your requests to interview the CEO or get more information about what they're trying to do to deal with people who harass other people? WARZEL: A major fundamental issue of my reporting on Twitter has been the lack of transparency. Twitter has not allowed us to speak with Jack Dorsey on this issue. And Twitter has not made any executives available to talk about this issue yet. If you speak with Twitter about this issue, they will say that theyre working on it and that this is something that they take very seriously now and have always taken very seriously and that they are actively working towards putting out some tools that will that will stop this. What those tools are is yet to be determined, and they have hinted publicly that we might see some of those things soon. But there's not a lot for Twitter right now to gain perhaps by acknowledging this problem without putting forth a solution. That seems to be sort of the company line. I would argue, however, that so many of the people that I've spoken with love Twitter but are so frustrated and sort of feel that the company isn't angry enough about this, about this failing that, you know, the people at Twitter surely want to see this problem go away as much as anyone else. And what people would like to see from Twitter - the people I have interviewed, the people experiencing this abuse on a daily basis - is a little bit more outrage. In 2014, Twitter's former CEO Dick Costolo released a memo that said we suck at dealing with abuse. And that memo was greeted by people who experience harassment with a lot of kudos. People were sort of thrilled to know that the company saw it, was frustrated and was going to deal with it. Since then not much has been done, and there's this sort of growing frustration as Twitter stays silent that maybe it doesn't understand just how bad this problem is. GROSS: So why did Disney and the company sales force decide against buying Twitter? WARZEL: The reports showed that, among a number of reasons, investors in both of the companies were troubled by a lot of the issues of harassment that are currently plaguing Twitter and all the bad press that that sort of entails. You have a lot of very high-profile celebrities who have quit the platform, like the \"Saturday Night Live\" actor Leslie Jones. And when those sort of things happen, they create sort of this PR disaster for Twitter. So the harassment issue has sort of for the first time truly started to impact Twitter's bottom line. In past years, harassment has been something that Twitter can sort of point to as a small cordoned-off problem. It's something that's happening, the company regrets that it's happening, it is trying to fix the problem, but the rest of Twitter is out here spreading great information, you know, being the place where celebrities can interact with each other and with normal people. And it is billed as this wonderful community. This sort of shows, though, that the harassment issue and the fact that abuse is increasing on the platform at a pretty alarming rate, it's finally affecting Twitter's bottom line. It's finally affecting how the company is performing, how the company is viewed in Silicon Valley and in the eyes of plenty of its competitors. And I think that that could be a moment for Twitter. It could be a real reckoning where Twitter finally says we have to get this problem under control or risk the future. GROSS: Charlie Warzel, thank you so much for talking with us.

TERRY GROSS, HOST:  Our next guest, Charlie Warzel, has written a series of articles about harassment on Twitter and how the company is trying to deal with it. Warzel is a technology reporter for BuzzFeed. Charlie Warzel, welcome to FRESH AIR. As you point out in your articles, one of Twitter's greatest strengths is also one of its vulnerabilities, free speech. The founders of Twitter were strong free speech advocates. It's the free speech approach to Twitter that has enabled Twitter to be such an important platform for pro-democracy movements, for the Arab Spring. Can you talk about that paradox that the free speech that Twitter embodies is also Twitter's vulnerability? CHARLIE WARZEL: I think that this is one of the fundamental issues of the internet, this issue of free speech right now. And what we're sort of seeing is the idealistic understanding of what the internet could be, this utopian idea that so many entrepreneurs and people who have created these enormous social platforms, that they believe at their core that the internet can sort of raise all voices and really be an amazing tool. And to have that anonymity tends to be something that these platforms favor. In Twitter's case, its core to their idea of free speech, and free speech is one of the founding principles that Twitter is built upon and this understanding that to truly connect the world, to truly be the pulse of the world, you have to give people the option to be able to be free of persecution. And that's why you saw so much of what happened in the early days of Twitter with the Iranian revolution and the Arab Spring, where Twitter played such an important role for political dissidents. It really sort of protected and allowed them to have a voice and elevated the platform. GROSS: Would you compare Twitter's policy with Facebook and Instagram in terms of what you can say and how - and how you have to identify yourself? WARZEL: Instagram and Facebook have adopted a real identity-centric approach. You have to give a version of yourself. You can't choose a pseudonym. You have to project some version of the person who you really are. And that is a very powerful thing, and it's a reason why Facebook is sort of one of the primary ways we authenticate ourselves across the internet. And as a result, Facebook has its own problems with abuse and harassment but not nearly to the same degree because there's no way for people to sort of hide behind an anonymous account name or an anonymous avatar. On Facebook, you have to project that image of who you are. And Facebook has really doubled down on that. They have a lot of strict community standards as well as Instagram. One of those is no nudity, and it is something that has - that strong stand has inured the platform a little bit more to the kind of abuse that we're seeing grow so rapidly on Twitter. GROSS: Yeah, you mentioned that Twitter is one of the few social media platforms used in the adult entertainment industry because it allows nudity. WARZEL: Absolutely. And for that, it's been an incredibly useful platform for adult entertainers. And it is an example of giving a voice and being a home for people that don't necessarily have a voice. And I think that you see that actually working - not to make too much of a jump, but it's really one of the same principles that's at play with a lot of activist movements in the country. It is a place where you can broadcast your raw opinion. You can get the news out that, you know, maybe some platforms are wary to broadcast. And that's been an incredibly successful tool for all kinds of movements like Black Lives Matter and the Arab Spring. GROSS: So one of the kinds of videos that's a real issue on social media is beheading videos. Sometimes a beheading video, as gruesome as it is, is news because it proves that a hostage has been murdered. Sometimes it's purely harassment. People have been getting beheading videos just as a way of upsetting them, of harassing them, of threatening them. Can you compare, for instance, how Facebook and Twitter deal with beheading videos? WARZEL: I think this is something that my reporting showed Twitter struggled internally with a lot, especially in in 2014, when this rash of ISIS beheading videos really started to flood the internet. There were internal meetings that we reported that showed that Twitter's executives were truly concerned that the platform would be overrun by this kind of content that may be newsworthy but is also broadcasting a very distinct message and is also incredibly disturbing. But Twitter has become the place where news happens, where you get that raw eyewitness account and access. And Twitter had to figure out a way to harness the best of that. And I think that is something that they're still struggling with. They've created a newsworthy clause which allows them to allow certain images based off of their relevancy to public information and to the news. But there was a worry inside the company that if Twitter were to be overrun with these grisly, just very disturbing videos that there really wouldn't be anyone who would want to sign on. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is journalist Charlie Warzel. He covers tech for BuzzFeed, and he's written a series of articles about Twitter and trolling. We're going to take a short break, then we'll be back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is journalist Charlie Warzel. He's a tech reporter for BuzzFeed. He's been writing a series of articles about Twitter and trolling and what Twitter is and isn't doing to try to stop trolling. You write that there's really a discussion, a debate within Twitter about what is Twitter. Is it more of a communication utility where it just - you know, it opens up the lines and you do what you will with it, kind of like the phone company, or is it a mediator of content, where content has to have some oversight? Would you describe more about that debate? WARZEL: Anyone who's been following Twitter for the past decade has watched this evolution. Twitter started out as a very sort of quick, short-burst messaging platform, just the 140 characters, no images, no video, really sort of like a status update, what you're doing that day or at that moment and in a sense evolved just incredibly to be this sort of media-rich platform that has content partnerships with the NFL and media outlets like Bloomberg. As a result, Twitter really sort of is this media company. It is a place where news happens. It is a vibrant source of news for so many people. And yet Twitter is also a utility in many ways. Twitter is this communication method, this digital way of reaching somebody, of having a conversation? It provides that infrastructure. And the real problem here is - seems to be that Twitter doesn't really want to put itself in any kind of box like that. They're very reluctant to, and they keep redefining, you know, who they are. And the problem with that redefinition is that a utility is not subject to nearly the same kind of moderation as a media company. I can send you or anyone almost anything over a text message and AT&T or Verizon aren't going to moderate that and have no requirement to moderate that, whereas if I use a blogging platform to, you know, smear somebody or say something awful about somebody, there is sort of a standard on the internet that has been created that that should be regulated. GROSS: What kind of effort is Twitter making to come up with a solution, a product that will both protect people on Twitter and protect free speech? WARZEL: This is the fundamental problem, the free speech element really, really hampers Twitter. It's very important to them that no voices be silenced. And yet the task of moderating is to silence certain voices to some extent. Twitter introduced a quality filter not too long ago that they have rolled out to everyone. It used to be only for special verified users, so lots of celebrities and journalists. But this filter has proven - it's driven by an algorithm, and it's proven to be generally poor. It's also an opt-in filter, meaning everyday users are everyday users are going to have to go through their settings and change that. And that's something that I think plenty of everyday Twitter users who aren't sort of in the weeds don't necessarily even know they have that option. GROSS: What does it filter? WARZEL: The quality filter will ostensibly favor tweets that are created by verified users. I think that there is some effort to filter out certain search terms perhaps that are particularly violent or racially insensitive or tagged to hate speech in some way. But again, this is all very proprietary information that Twitter doesn't really let anyone in on, especially journalists. And this is one of the difficulties in covering Twitter from this angle of harassment is that there's so little knowledge as to what Twitter is really trying to do and so little effort on their part to disclose any of it, an unwillingness to disclose any of it that makes it difficult to see how, if at all, they are earnestly trying to fix this problem. GROSS: BuzzFeed conducted a survey of Twitter users. There were 2,700 users who responded to the survey. I would say right at the jump here this is a very unscientific (laughter) survey. WARZEL: Yes. GROSS: This is representative of people who knew about the survey and decided to participate in it. That said, what were some of your takeaways from these responders? WARZEL: I'll also just stress that this is an unscientific survey. But nonetheless we wanted to hear from users themselves and understand exactly what happens when they do go out there and experience harassment and report it. And what we found was that roughly 46 percent of respondents told us that the last time they reported an abusive tweet to the company, the company took no action on the request that they were aware of. Another 29 percent said when they reported abusive tweets, they never heard anything back at all. It was effectively radio silence. And 18 percent said that when they did report an abusive tweet, they were told that the tweet did not violate Twitter's rules of being either a violent threat or hateful conduct. Only 56 instances out of roughly 2,700 people surveyed showed that Twitter deleted an offending account or a tweet that violated these rules. And so I think what - what the survey really showed was that regardless of what Twitter is doing behind the scenes, Twitter is doing a poor job of communicating exactly what's going on once you hit that report button. GROSS: The New York Times this week ran a double-page spread of all the people, places and things Trump has insulted on Twitter since declaring his presidency. And there were one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight columns of really small print covering two pages of these tweets. Have you been following his tweets? And I'm just wondering how you think Donald Trump's use of Twitter is affecting perceptions of Twitter. WARZEL: I think this is one of the most fascinating things about Twitter is just how integral it has been in this election. Donald Trump has been able to really leverage Twitter to get his message out to the base, really sort of skirting the media. And then also using Twitter as a way to pick up a lot of free media. He can send out a string of incendiary tweets at 3 in the morning and by 7 a. m. , they're dominating all of the morning shows. Twitter has been just central in this. And yet so much of that message lately has been so negative. And if you look at the way that Donald Trump tweets and sort of what that New York Times spread can kind of show is that Donald Trump is himself a very effective troll with regard to Twitter. He says incendiary things that may or may not be based at all in fact. He sort of is looking for the reaction more than he's looking for any sort of substance. The fact that you have engaged with it, that you are outraged by it is just as important as whether or not you believe in it. And I think that, you know, that behavior is again sort of being normalized in that sense to have somebody who exhibits a lot of this trollish behavior be elevated to the most covered human being in America or maybe the world for this past 18 months, I think that that has a profound effect on how other people, you know, choose to use the internet. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is journalist Charlie Warzel. He covers tech for BuzzFeed. And he's written a series of articles about Twitter and trolling. We're going to take a short break, then we'll be back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is journalist Charlie Warzel. He's a tech reporter for BuzzFeed. He's been writing a series of articles about Twitter and trolling and what Twitter is and isn't doing to try to stop trolling. What kind of response have you gotten from Twitter to your requests to interview the CEO or get more information about what they're trying to do to deal with people who harass other people? WARZEL: A major fundamental issue of my reporting on Twitter has been the lack of transparency. Twitter has not allowed us to speak with Jack Dorsey on this issue. And Twitter has not made any executives available to talk about this issue yet. If you speak with Twitter about this issue, they will say that theyre working on it and that this is something that they take very seriously now and have always taken very seriously and that they are actively working towards putting out some tools that will that will stop this. What those tools are is yet to be determined, and they have hinted publicly that we might see some of those things soon. But there's not a lot for Twitter right now to gain perhaps by acknowledging this problem without putting forth a solution. That seems to be sort of the company line. I would argue, however, that so many of the people that I've spoken with love Twitter but are so frustrated and sort of feel that the company isn't angry enough about this, about this failing that, you know, the people at Twitter surely want to see this problem go away as much as anyone else. And what people would like to see from Twitter - the people I have interviewed, the people experiencing this abuse on a daily basis - is a little bit more outrage. In 2014, Twitter's former CEO Dick Costolo released a memo that said we suck at dealing with abuse. And that memo was greeted by people who experience harassment with a lot of kudos. People were sort of thrilled to know that the company saw it, was frustrated and was going to deal with it. Since then not much has been done, and there's this sort of growing frustration as Twitter stays silent that maybe it doesn't understand just how bad this problem is. GROSS: So why did Disney and the company sales force decide against buying Twitter? WARZEL: The reports showed that, among a number of reasons, investors in both of the companies were troubled by a lot of the issues of harassment that are currently plaguing Twitter and all the bad press that that sort of entails. You have a lot of very high-profile celebrities who have quit the platform, like the \"Saturday Night Live\" actor Leslie Jones. And when those sort of things happen, they create sort of this PR disaster for Twitter. So the harassment issue has sort of for the first time truly started to impact Twitter's bottom line. In past years, harassment has been something that Twitter can sort of point to as a small cordoned-off problem. It's something that's happening, the company regrets that it's happening, it is trying to fix the problem, but the rest of Twitter is out here spreading great information, you know, being the place where celebrities can interact with each other and with normal people. And it is billed as this wonderful community. This sort of shows, though, that the harassment issue and the fact that abuse is increasing on the platform at a pretty alarming rate, it's finally affecting Twitter's bottom line. It's finally affecting how the company is performing, how the company is viewed in Silicon Valley and in the eyes of plenty of its competitors. And I think that that could be a moment for Twitter. It could be a real reckoning where Twitter finally says we have to get this problem under control or risk the future. GROSS: Charlie Warzel, thank you so much for talking with us.

Anheuser-Busch calls it the world's first commercial delivery by a self-driving truck. Farhad Manjoo is a technology columnist for The New York Times, and he's also been in a driver-free truck. Thanks very much for being with us. FARHAD MANJOO: Hey, good to be here. SIMON: What's it like to be in one of these trucks? MANJOO: Well, surprisingly normal. The trucks so far - the ones that they're running so far - have a driver sitting at the seat, then he flips a button and the truck just kind of takes over. It's basically like looking at someone flip on cruise control, except here, you know, when the driver took his hands off the wheel, the wheel kept turning as the road moved ahead. SIMON: I mean this question utterly seriously because I gather there were some tweets about it this week. We're talking about a beer truck delivery. Is it possible that some fraternity at the University of Wisconsin could hack into a beer truck and (laughter) get it delivered to their frat house instead of the market? MANJOO: You know, this is one of the concerns with both self-driving trucks, self-driving cars and generally more of our kind of national infrastructure becoming digital, becoming automated. You know, this is one of the questions I think looming over the whole sector is the security both from hacking but also from mishap, you know, just sort of inadvertent bugs in the system that could cause it, you know, real problems in the real world. SIMON: And will this ultimately throw human truck drivers out of business? MANJOO: This company Otto, which Uber recently purchased, they argue that the human truck driver, at least in the foreseeable future, in the next, perhaps, 10 to 20 years, the human truck driver won't be completely eliminated from the truck. So on residential streets, on other streets where it's both more difficult to drive a truck, the human truck driver might still be necessary at that point. And the truck driver does other things like unload the vehicle, perhaps, fill out the paperwork, you know, do a lot of white-collar type work in the cab. Their sort of vision for this is that if you get this technology in your truck, you can make your truck twice as efficient and your job perhaps slightly easier. Now of course, this is the - they're making the technology so they're sort of putting the best face on this. Truck drivers I spoke to weren't as enthusiastic about this whole proposition. So I would say that there are both sort of technological changes here but also social changes. And those social dynamics - the idea of a truck driving down the road and no one is in it might be so alien to people that we might - it might take a very long time before we're comfortable with that. SIMON: Well, but - let me point out, Mr. Manjoo, people used to be that way about elevators. We think nothing of it now in the tallest buildings in the world. MANJOO: It's true. I mean, it's hard to - I think I've been in one elevator that had an operator. So it's possible we'll be that way with trucks and cars at some point. My own feeling is that it's probably going to be at least 20 years until that happens, perhaps longer. SIMON: Farhad Manjoo is technology columnist at The New York Times. Thanks for being with us.

But in 1970, the Minimoog Model D was unleashed, and its impact was nothing short of revolutionary.

And this year, Moog Music is reissuing the Minimoog, hand-building them almost exactly as they were over four decades ago. To talk about this, we have brought in a huge fan of the Minimoog. He is Devo's own Mark Mothersbaugh. He's in our studios at NPR West. Hey, Mark. Thanks for doing this. Thanks for coming in. MARK MOTHERSBAUGH: Hey, hello. MARTIN: I understand you have brought one of your own Minimoogs with you. Describe what it looks like and why it was so important to the music that you made with Devo. MOTHERSBAUGH: This is from mid-'70s, this particular one that I brought along. It's got a keyboard that's, you know, like, four octaves. But the important thing was it was an instrument that you could fold up, you could take it outside of the lab. So in the old days, synths were, like, people standing around in lab coats touching knobs and dials. And this allowed you to move out of that environment into nightclubs. MARTIN: Can you give us a sample of some of the sounds that you were particularly fond of using? MOTHERSBAUGH: Yeah, I can play you some things, and. . .

(SOUNDBITE OF MINIMOOG PLAYING)MOTHERSBAUGH: I got to be honest, I love all the kind of more ugly, aggressive sounds just 'cause that's where I came from. It's like, I came from a time that was really ugly and aggressive. I was at Kent State when the shootings happened, and what we were observing was not evolution but de-evolution. And so we were looking for things that were startling and that were confrontational at the time. So those kind of sounds were important to us. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"SMART PATROL/MR. DNA\")DEVO: (Singing) He's been with world. I'm tired of the soup du jour. He's been with the world. MOTHERSBAUGH: You know, I was old enough that I was listening to people like Jimi Hendrix who were - who was making the guitar - he was taking the guitar further than anybody had ever taken a guitar sound. And I wanted to know, how can keyboard players do that? And it's so hard 'cause we have these - you can't bend a, you know, like, a piano note the same way. MARTIN: Yeah. MOTHERSBAUGH: But on this keyboard, it became super plastic, and I could bend it even more. And so then you were in competition for, like, who could do the most expressive, crazy, synth solos. (SOUNDBITE OF MINIMOOG PLAYING)MARTIN: Yeah, that's weird. MOTHERSBAUGH: Well, back in the '70s, it was hard to do stuff like that. (SOUNDBITE OF MINIMOOG PLAYING)MARTIN: Is it fun to play? Compared to other traditional instruments, what is the physical sensation of making music with a Moog like? MOTHERSBAUGH: Well, you know, it's - 'cause everything's so ergonomic, it's, like, right there at your fingertips. One of the things that left me cold when synths started becoming more compact or started going into computers and things, is you lost the physical reality of the sound. It's like you have little, you know, like, numbers and you can, like, change it in physical space. MARTIN: That feels different than clicking a mouse. MOTHERSBAUGH: There's something about it that's different than, you know, like, either punching in numbers on a computer keyboard or using a mouse to slide a fake fader or something, you know. It's - there's something that still, to me, is, like, really satisfying about playing things on the Moog. MARTIN: Mark Mothersbaugh - composer, producer, synthesizer guru. He joined us from the studios of NPR West to talk about his love of the Minimoog. Hey, Mark, thanks so much. MOTHERSBAUGH: Thanks for - oh, that's what everybody says. They all go, thanks for having me. Toodle-oo. (SOUNDBITE OF DEVO SONG, \"WHIP IT\") (SOUNDBITE OF MOOG MUSIC) RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Long ago, electronic music was created on massive consoles the size of refrigerators. But in 1970, the Minimoog Model D was unleashed, and its impact was nothing short of revolutionary. (SOUNDBITE OF INSTRUMENTAL SONG MONTAGE) MARTIN: Jazz-rock from Herbie Hancock, electrifying pop from Michael Jackson, futuristic sounds from Devo - all of these were driven by sounds from the Minimoog. And this year, Moog Music is reissuing the Minimoog, hand-building them almost exactly as they were over four decades ago. To talk about this, we have brought in a huge fan of the Minimoog. He is Devo's own Mark Mothersbaugh. He's in our studios at NPR West. Hey, Mark. Thanks for doing this. Thanks for coming in. MARK MOTHERSBAUGH: Hey, hello. MARTIN: I understand you have brought one of your own Minimoogs with you. Describe what it looks like and why it was so important to the music that you made with Devo. MOTHERSBAUGH: This is from mid-'70s, this particular one that I brought along. It's got a keyboard that's, you know, like, four octaves. But the important thing was it was an instrument that you could fold up, you could take it outside of the lab. So in the old days, synths were, like, people standing around in lab coats touching knobs and dials. And this allowed you to move out of that environment into nightclubs. MARTIN: Can you give us a sample of some of the sounds that you were particularly fond of using? MOTHERSBAUGH: Yeah, I can play you some things, and. . . MARTIN: You could probably play a lot of things. MOTHERSBAUGH: Well, even if I haven't done them for a long time, they're kind of like - probably if you dissected my brain, there's probably a whole section that's Minimoog. MARTIN: (Laughter).

The promise they made to city residents - they would have a car to pick you up no matter who you are, and that appealed to African-Americans in particular. They for years faced discrimination by cab drivers. But a new study suggests the apps struggle with the very same issue of racial profiling as taxis. NPR's tech blogger Alina Selyukh is here to tell us about the research. Welcome back to the studio. ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE: Hello. CORNISH: So first just tell us how this study worked. SELYUKH: Right. So this research was done in two cities - Boston and Seattle. And academics there tried to record almost 1,500 ride requests to see if race played a difference in how long people had to wait for a ride. In Seattle, they had eight people four black, four white and split by gender. And in Boston, they had people who could sort of pass up for either race but then used separate accounts with a white-sounding name and then a, quote, \"distinctly black\" name. CORNISH: So what did the study find? SELYUKH: Overall they did find some differences in how passengers were treated. In Seattle, African-American riders had to wait a bit longer to get a ride. In Boston, people with the black-sounding names were more likely to have drivers cancel a ride after accepting it. That was especially the case for black men. And it's important to note, though, that Lyft did a fair bit better. Its drivers did not appear to cancel on riders in a way that factored in race. CORNISH: All right, so there's a difference between Uber and Lyft, but what's going on there? What is the difference? SELYUKH: And that's actually a point that researchers make in their study. There's a difference when Uber and Lyft drivers find out what your name is and what you look like. On Uber, they learn that after accepting your request, meaning they have to cancel it if they want to pass you up. On Lyft, they see your name and face before they even accept the request, meaning if they do decide to ignore you, that kind of data would not be recorded in this research. Of course Lyft does not like this interpretation, and they say that its drivers have a financial incentive. They get bonuses if they do accept as many requests as possible. CORNISH: So how have the companies actually responded to this study? SELYUKH: They both really highlight the fact that they have made a positive impact on people of color. They're giving people a new way to get around without having to hail a cab, which is a historically discriminatory practice. And both companies do have non-discrimination policies. But here's the tricky part to me with these companies. While the driver's behavior reflects broadly on them, the choices that go into that behavior are really personal. It is one individual making a quick decision about what kind of passenger they want in their own car. CORNISH: These companies aren't really the first to face this problem, right? I mean Airbnb is trying to weed out discrimination on its platform. So is this something that the gig economy needs to deal with more broadly? SELYUKH: Let's be clear. This is not just a problem for the gig economy. But here, it is a special kind of challenge for Uber and Lyft. The drivers are not employees. They're independent participants on the app just like the riders. It's very similar on Airbnb. So these companies - they can crack down on particular users, say, who are overtly racist. Typically that would be prompted by another user reporting them, and they could be banned from an app, for instance. But it's much harder to weed out subtle discrimination that doesn't have a record or piece of data attached to them. The researchers on the study suggest that the companies, for instance, could replace names and attendees with unique numbers to see that levels the playing field. It's unclear whether the apps will attempt that, but I guess we'll see. CORNISH: That's NPR's tech blogger Alina Selyukh. Thanks so much. SELYUKH: Thank you.

How much did fake news stories inform voters' choices? And did social media allow hate speech, which may have deepened the divides in this country? Two big things happened over the past few days. Twitter announced new rules to try to curtail hate speech and suspended several accounts linked to the so-called alt-right movement, which has been associated with white nationalism. And Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg underscored what his company is doing to stop the spread of so-called fake news. To talk more about this and the broader role of social media in our democracy, I'm joined by Vivian Schiller. She's the former head of news and journalism partnerships at Twitter and also the former CEO of NPR. Vivian, thanks so much for being with us. VIVIAN SCHILLER: Hi, glad to be with you. MARTIN: I want to start by asking you about Mark Zuckerberg's statement. And I'm going to quote here. He said, we will continue to work with journalists and others in the news industry to get their input, in particular to better understand their fact-checking systems and learn from them. You've been on both sides of this. What should the relationship be between mainstream journalism and social media companies, especially when it comes to this idea of misinformation? SCHILLER: First of all, there's a lot of definitions flying around of what we mean when we say fake news. And there's also a lot of pitfalls and I think some misguided recommendations that are out there about what Facebook and Twitter and the others should and shouldn't do. It's very difficult and I, you know, recommend sort of very thoughtful slow going for everyone. MARTIN: So let's go slow in the conversation. What is fake news, as you understand it? SCHILLER: So my definition of fake news is a content-like object that is a story, an article, a video, a tweet that has been fabricated, completely invented out of thin air, intentionally for the purpose of misleading. So an example from the election, from the campaign was when a so-called news organization called the Denver Guardian - which, by the way, doesn't exist - wrote an article and pushed it on social media that said that the pope had endorsed Donald Trump. That's the perfect definition of fake news. It was intentionally designed to deceive. MARTIN: So what has been lumped into that category that shouldn't belong there? SCHILLER: Well, lumped in there is a lot of stuff, including stories that were intended to be serious journalism but just got it wrong, statements that are made by public officials that are wrong but are reported. And then there's this whole sort of mushy area in the middle of stories that are missing context, might be laden with innuendo, missing facts. MARTIN: So you say there's fake news and then there's just bad journalism (laughter). SCHILLER: Well, that's the short answer, yeah. MARTIN: So if you set aside the shoddy journalism - which I can understand would be very hard for any social media company to try to fix or prevent the spread of - but just taking the idea of just outright false news, these fake news stories like the one you cited, do social media companies have an obligation to try to prevent the spread of those stories? SCHILLER: Let me just say I think it would be a mistake for social media companies to try to, on their own, determine or deign what is a fake news story and what isn't and shut it off, or what's a good news organization or a bad news organization. That's a very, very slippery slope. MARTIN: Let's talk about your former employer, Twitter, which announced just a few days ago that it's going to make it easier to report abusive language on its site. It also suspended, as we mentioned, several accounts linked to the alt-right. Do you think these changes are a good idea? SCHILLER: Well, those are two very, very different things, so let's separate them. The first one, which is allowing a greater range of tools to prevent abuse on Twitter, I applaud Twitter for that move and I encourage them to keep going. The second action they took is much trickier and frankly concerns me a little bit. Twitter has selected certain Twitter accounts - most of them are from the so-called alt-right - and has suspended them. The problem is there is very little transparency and consistency when it comes to what accounts Twitter is suspending and which they are not. As long as there is an even playing field for all and the rules are clearly understood, that would be a good thing. We are not there yet. There's more to do. MARTIN: Do you still believe in these sites in social media as a harbinger for good when it comes to protecting democratic values? SCHILLER: A hundred percent. The way that information is shared around the world, important information that we might not ever see or hear - and I would hate for us to go backwards on that. Does it come with a whole bunch of problems? You bet. MARTIN: Vivian Schiller's the former head of news and journalism partnerships at Twitter. Thanks so much, Vivian. SCHILLER: Thank you.

The nearly $9 billion observatory will replace the aging Hubble Space Telescope, and astronomers are giddy about the wealth of new information they expect to gain if they get the telescope to work. NPR's Joe Palca reports. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: A virtual army of scientists and engineers has been laboring to get the new telescope ready for launch. Astrophysicist and systems engineer Begona Vila is a relative newcomer on the project. BEGONA VILA: Oh, only 10 years. PALCA: Vila works at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. It's here that the telescope's mirrors and instruments are frozen, shaken and rattled to make sure they'll survive their trip to a spot a million miles from Earth. Unlike Hubble, the James Webb telescope is primarily designed to look at the universe at what's called infrared wavelengths. This allows it to peer through dust clouds and to see how the earliest stars and galaxies formed. But to work properly, infrared telescopes have to be kept cold - very cold. Vila says the Webb telescope uses a multi-layered sunshield to protect it from the sun's heat. VILA: That's like a big umbrella - beach umbrella - so we keep that facing the sun and the Earth so all the heat on it dissipates - all the heat through the layers. So that allows all the instruments to cool to the temperatures that we need. PALCA: Now, the sunshield is big - about the size of a tennis court. And for launch, it has to fit into a much smaller space - about the size of a school bus. So the sunshield has to fold up, as does the large main mirror and a variety of other essential instruments.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Now, the massive James Webb Space Telescope is heading into its final round of ground tests. The nearly $9 billion observatory will replace the aging Hubble Space Telescope, and astronomers are giddy about the wealth of new information they expect to gain if they get the telescope to work. NPR's Joe Palca reports. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: A virtual army of scientists and engineers has been laboring to get the new telescope ready for launch. Astrophysicist and systems engineer Begona Vila is a relative newcomer on the project. BEGONA VILA: Oh, only 10 years. PALCA: Vila works at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. It's here that the telescope's mirrors and instruments are frozen, shaken and rattled to make sure they'll survive their trip to a spot a million miles from Earth. Unlike Hubble, the James Webb telescope is primarily designed to look at the universe at what's called infrared wavelengths. This allows it to peer through dust clouds and to see how the earliest stars and galaxies formed. But to work properly, infrared telescopes have to be kept cold - very cold. Vila says the Webb telescope uses a multi-layered sunshield to protect it from the sun's heat. VILA: That's like a big umbrella - beach umbrella - so we keep that facing the sun and the Earth so all the heat on it dissipates - all the heat through the layers. So that allows all the instruments to cool to the temperatures that we need. PALCA: Now, the sunshield is big - about the size of a tennis court. And for launch, it has to fit into a much smaller space - about the size of a school bus. So the sunshield has to fold up, as does the large main mirror and a variety of other essential instruments. The unfolding takes place in a carefully choreographed sequence of steps over two weeks. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Solar panels extend. ARI SHAPIRO, BYLINE: Antenna deployment.

The alternative, lab-grown diamonds, are finally emerging as a real competitor after nearly a half-century of research. Technology has advanced now to the point that it's possible for these labs to churn out huge, white diamonds - just the type you might want to wear. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports on how this is changing the diamond industry. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: There's a company outside of Washington, D. C. , called WD Lab Grown Diamonds. Yarden Tsach runs the place. He unwraps a little parcel of white tissue paper to show me a sparkly diamond. YARDEN TSACH: So this will be a round stone that is about two carats. GREENFIELDBOYCE: It looks like, you know, your typical engagement ring stone. TSACH: Yeah, yeah. And this is what we do. GREENFIELDBOYCE: What they do is make diamonds. Tsach takes me into the lab. He doesn't let me get a close look at the machines, but I peek through a window. He says inside each machine is a vacuum chamber. At the bottom, they put a little bit of solid diamond. That's the seed for diamond growing. Then they add gases to the chamber and microwaves. This creates a reaction that deposits more and more carbon onto the seed, building the diamond up until it's big enough to look good on a ring. TSACH: On most of the cases on the floor here it will think about eight weeks. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And let's be clear - this isn't cubic zirconia or some fake. TSACH: So it is diamond. It's not something else. GREENFIELDBOYCE: But compared with diamonds mined from the ground, it can be more than 30 percent cheaper. That means people can buy a bigger diamond. TSACH: The market is huge. We cannot satisfy the demand. We're expanding, and we still cannot satisfy the demand. GREENFIELDBOYCE: This is just one of a bunch of diamond growing companies out there. Manmade diamonds are now appearing at tony retailers, like Barneys New York, which introduced them in October as a high-tech, eco-friendly alternative to mined gems. To see how all of this is going over it with the traditional diamond industry, I headed to New York City's famous diamond district. This one block of West 47th Street is crammed with shop windows filled with glittering diamonds. Right around the corner is the International Gemological Institute. It grades diamonds on the famous four Cs - cut, clarity, carats and color. David Weinstein is the executive director. DAVID WEINSTEIN: I deal with diamond all day long for three decades. To me, diamonds aren't anything spectacular. You know, it's hard to get me to say wow. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He pulls out some envelopes from a stack on his cluttered desk. WEINSTEIN: And these are all laboratory-grown. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says in the old days, the rare lab-grown diamonds you'd see would be yellow or brownish - not any more. WEINSTEIN: The quality has got to the point where they're astonishingly white. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Lots of these diamonds come into his lab, and there's going to be a lot more. A recent report from the investment firm Morgan Stanley found that lab-grown diamonds currently make up maybe 1 percent of the global market, but it predicted that could grow to as much as 7 to 15 percent in the next few years. The Federal Trade Commission says gemstone marketers must be truthful about exactly what they're selling. WEINSTEIN: I think there'll always be a distinction between what came out of the ground - what took millions and millions of years to make - and what was made in the last, you know, 72 hours. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Weinstein can tell the difference between natural and lab-grown diamonds. For one thing, companies often laser-inscribe their manufactured diamonds, putting words like lab-grown right on them. But even if they didn't, Weinstein has microscopes and other instruments that can reveal a diamond's origin. WEINSTEIN: We're not fooled. We feel a hundred percent confident that's something we can do, you know, all the time. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The problem is while bigger diamonds generally get tested, a significant part of the diamond trade is very small stones. They're used to accent larger gems, or you might have a ring studded with teeny diamonds. WEINSTEIN: For many manufacturers who make jewelry with small stones, it's just not economically feasible for them to send 10,000 stones into a laboratory and pay the expense to have every stone tested. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Already there's been cases of undisclosed lab-grown diamonds getting mixed in with bulk batches of little diamonds. A few weeks ago, the U. S. jewelry Council hosted a meeting in New York for major players in the diamond business to discuss how to deal with this threat. One solution is new testing technologies. The Gemological Institute of America is a non-profit research institute. Its gleaming office building looms over the diamond district. Tom Moses is the chief research officer in this lab. He shows me a prototype of a machine that can test incredibly small diamonds in bulk. It looks like a glass box the size of a refrigerator with tubes and moving metal parts. TOM MOSES: So you see all the little diamonds? GREENFIELDBOYCE: No, I don't. MOSES: Down there? You see them going in this white tray being loaded and picked up? GREENFIELDBOYCE: Oh, those are diamonds. MOSES: Yeah. There's thousands in there. GREENFIELDBOYCE: They're the size of poppy seeds. Testing each one takes about two seconds and costs eight cents. The machine sorts the diamonds into either lab-grown or natural. Moses says his organization doesn't have any bias for one over the other. MOSES: That's not our job to determine, you know, what's the right kind of diamond for an individual. GREENFIELDBOYCE: But as lab-grown diamonds become more common, he thinks it's important that anyone buying a diamond is clear on whether it's mined or manufactured. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News.

For families, there are financial and emotional costs. As Natasha Haverty reports, video visitations usually replace in-person visits. NATASHA HAVERTY, BYLINE: Since her son Tommy went to jail, Dawn Herbert tries to see him as much as she can. He's incarcerated less than a 10-minute drive from her house in Keene, N. H. , but he might as well be a lot further. DAWN HERBERT: He's in that building, and I can't get to him. HAVERTY: Dawn's visits probably don't look like what you're picturing - sitting across a table or behind a pane of Plexiglas. No, when Dawn visits her son Tommy, she has to sit in a windowless booth just past the jail's front door, hold a phone to her ear and wait for him to show up on a little screen. HERBERT: It's nice that they have this. You have an appointment. You are connected, which is - OK, great, you know (laughter)? Hi, Honey (laughter). TOMMY ROGERS: (Inaudible). HAVERTY: On this day, Dawn can hear her son, but most times, she says she can't. The sound cuts out, or the screen freezes up. And this whole time, Tommy is a few hundred feet away on his cell block, sitting at another little screen. HERBERT: I can't stand it 'cause he's on the screen in front of me, and I can't touch him. HAVERTY: This is what a visit means in this jail because when this jail signed its contract with Securus, the company that installed the technology, it agreed to ban all in-person visits between inmates and families. And that's on its way to becoming the new normal in jails across the U. S. Video visits come in. In-person visits disappear. RICHARD VAN WICKLER: We were actually reluctant. We were like, really? HAVERTY: Richard Van Wickler is superintendent of Cheshire County Jail where Dawn's son is. He signed the jail's contract with Securus. VAN WICKLER: Video visitation - I mean it's like another technological advancement of our society that nobody's really used to. But then we began to see the advantages of it. HAVERTY: One advantage - less worry about contraband coming in, which means fewer inmate strip searches, which means less staff time. And here's another advantage. Jails stand to make a profit. Come do a video visit at the jail; it's free. But do it from your home computer; that can run a dollar a minute. Securus promised Cheshire County Jail a 20 percent cut of the thousands of dollars those fees bring in. And while Superintendent Van Wickler says he's sympathetic to what's being lost here, it's part of the social contract of being incarcerated. VAN WICKLER: When one violates the law and one has to serve time in a public institution, one of the liberties that one could lose is the opportunity to hug a loved one. And you know what? That's a difficult sanction. That's hard time. HAVERTY: But anyone looking to argue that banning in-person visits goes a step beyond hard time has to be able to point at a legal definition of what a visit is. And as Bernadette Rauby of the Prison Policy Initiative points out, those laws passed before video visitation came out. BERNADETTE RAUBY: They referred to how many visits need to be provided in the jails, but they don't define what a visit might be. HAVERTY: Advocates like Rauby say video visitation is great for families who are far away as a supplement to real visits. Yet, video visitation is actually far more common in county jails than in state prisons, which baffles Rauby because most people doing time in jail are closer to their families. That's also where real visits are getting banned. RAUBY: We're taking away families right to an in-person visit when they're most able to provide that for their incarcerated loved one. HAVERTY: I called Securus to get their take. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE: Thank you for calling Securus Technologies, the leading provider of inmate communication services. HAVERTY: But I just kept getting handed off to customer service representatives. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE: If you are calling about Securus video visitation services, press one now. HAVERTY: Video visitation is catching on really fast. Seventy-five percent of the jails that use it have gone ahead and ended in-person visits altogether even when that wasn't required in the contract, which means as long as their sons or daughters are locked up, moms like Dawn Herbert will have to get used to a screen being the closest they can get.

It's a concrete though limited move to get terrorist propaganda off the world's leading Internet platforms. NPR's Aarti Shahani reports. AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: Already on the internet, security researchers, people who combat hackers, share intel. They find something they believe to be malware, code that can attack computers. And they let each other know. They put the so-called hash, the unique DNA of that bad code, into a central database and say, hey, everyone, look out for this thing. Now the internet companies that are dealing with content are doing the same thing not for malware but for ISIS beheading videos and other extremist propaganda. HANY FARID: It's exactly like that. And, in fact, this is exactly the same type of technology that is now being used to remove that content. SHAHANI: Hany Farid helped to build that technology. He's a computer scientist at Dartmouth and an advisor to the Counter Extremism Project. The nonprofit's been trying to get the internet companies to take action. And now, finally, Farid notes, they are changing their tune. FARID: For years, they have said that this is technologically not feasible. That was absolutely not true. It's always been technologically feasible. And they've been dragging their feet for a long time, I think, and for too long - until the pressure simply mounted. SHAHANI: Pressure has mounted from governments around the world and the media. To be clear, the four tech companies are not going to rely on algorithms to automatically ID all the terrorist calls to violence online. FARID: There's always a human in the loop at the beginning of the process determining that this content is extremist-related or violates terms of service. SHAHANI: Once a human tags the video or picture as bad, then the tech can take over and crawl through a platform to look for every instance of it and pull it. Note the platforms are not working together to pull the content. When Twitter hits the delete button, nothing happens on Facebook or YouTube. FARID: Each of these companies will be individually analyzing this content, comparing it against a database of known bad content and then making their own internal decisions on how to handle that. SHAHANI: According to the joint's announcement, no outside third party will monitor what content is pulled or how quickly or slowly it's done. Farid says that could limit the effectiveness of the move. FARID: Look, at the end of the day, these tech companies are private business. And their mandate is to reach customers and to make money. SHAHANI: He says collaborating to actively remove customers and content is not necessarily in their financial interests. Aarti Shahani, NPR News, San Francisco.

Farid says that could limit the effectiveness of the move. FARID: Look, at the end of the day, these tech companies are private business. And their mandate is to reach customers and to make money. SHAHANI: He says collaborating to actively remove customers and content is not necessarily in their financial interests.

And sometimes it's put real people and businesses in the middle. That's what happened to a pizzeria here in Washington, D. C. , recently. But once a fake news story is out there, and the harm has been done, what can a person do about it? Well, to help us answer that question is Derigan Silver. He teaches media, First Amendment and internet law at the University of Denver. Welcome to the program. DERIGAN SILVER: Thanks. Thanks for having me. CORNISH: So, to begin, what legal action can someone take if they've been harmed professionally or economically by being the subject of a fake news story? Where can they start? SILVER: So in most of these situations, the person who's been harmed is going to bring a lawsuit we call a tort. Now, a tort is a non-contractual harm between two private individuals. It's a civil lawsuit where you're alleging that one person harmed another. The most famous tort that most people know about is McDonald's hot coffee tort. And this is the famous lawsuit where the woman got a lot of hot coffee from McDonald's and got horribly burned by it and then sued the fast food chain for damages caused by the hot coffee. So any time one private individual harms another private individual, you can bring a lawsuit for a tort. So one of those torts that people can have the advantage of is called defamation. Defamation is a tort that alleges that a communication damaged your reputation. CORNISH: And so when somebody decides I have been harmed - right? - by being the subject of such a story, who do they try to hold accountable? SILVER: Well, they can hold accountable anybody who is communicated the defamatory statement to anybody else. That includes the person who originated the defamatory statement, but under something called the republication rule, it also includes anybody who repeated the defamatory statement. Now, simply re-tweeting a defamatory statement is probably not going to be enough to qualify for republication, but passing on information that you heard from somebody else certainly is republication. So you have some cases coming out of Texas, for example, where hundreds and hundreds of people were adding to a posting that had more and more and more defamatory content. And if you can track those people down, if you can find out those identities, then, yes, you can sue every single person who sort of adds to that defamatory statement or repeats that defamatory statement. CORNISH: That sounds like an expensive proposition, though - right? - for the average person. SILVER: Absolutely. And that's one of the problems with defamation law - is once the information is out there, you know, is monetary damages really what they want to recover? And should they have to be able to pay lawyers for $500 an hour in order to recover their good name from a story that is clearly made up and clearly fictitious and clearly has no basis in reality at all? CORNISH: Is there any movement afoot to review these laws or statutes? Or - among your community - right? - of academics, how are people talking about this? SILVER: You know, I think that fake news really has kind of all set us back a little bit. One of the ideas behind the First Amendment is that we believe in something called the marketplace of ideas - that if you let truthhood and falsity battle in the marketplace of ideas, that truth will eventually win - that we have a an assumption that people are rational, and they can determine truth from falsity. And that's kind of making us rethink these sort of basic premises behind freedom of expression - is - are we in a situation now where truth no longer matters, and people are not able to sort these things out? Other people say, you know, the idea that truth is always going to win is idle sentimentality. The reason we have freedom of expression is not because truth will always win, but because without freedom of expression, truth has no chance of winning whatsoever. And so this has been a really challenging election for a lot of people who believe in free speech. And, you know, media law has actually come up a lot in this election, and it's something that a lot of us are thinking deeply about.

This time the company estimates that more than 1 billion user accounts had data stolen. This is the second time this year that Yahoo is disclosing a mega breach. And here to discuss it is NPR's Aarti Shahani. And Aarti, what happened? AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: The company's chief security officer put out a statement on Yahoo's Tumblr page saying basically, hey, so I know this happened before, and it happened again. Back in September, it was a half billion accounts. Now in a separate hack, it looks like there was more than 1 billion user accounts affected. The data includes names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, encrypted passwords and in some cases encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers, as in the question to use in everything you're protecting online, like, what's your mother's maiden name, your first dog, your childhood best friend? Yahoo said the attack likely happened in the summer of 2013. The company is saying no financial information was taken. But that data theft can still have a financial impact, right? If hackers get all that info from your Yahoo email, they can use it to break into other accounts. That's how the crime works. And you know, Yahoo knows that. SIEGEL: Has Yahoo described how this break happened? SHAHANI: There are two details here that caught my eye. One, Yahoo says that an unauthorized third party - and outside party - accessed their proprietary code to learn how to forge cookies. Now, when you forge cookies, that can let an intruder unlock a user account without a password. This is interesting because it wasn't what we usually hear about, which is spearfishing. Spearfishing is like when, oh, an unknowing employee opens an email attachment that lets the cyber-robbers in. In this case, the hackers got what's supposed to be Yahoo's super-secret code. Secondly, Yahoo said it looks like this hack could have been sponsored by a nation state. They made the exact same claim last time. And like last time, they provided no evidence. They didn't say, hey, this code we saw resembles this other known attack or hackers let some foreign language slip into the digital trail. They didn't give any of that. SIEGEL: Yahoo is supposed to be purchased by Verizon. What is Verizon saying about this? SHAHANI: So Verizon is saying, hey, like we've said all along, we will evaluate the situation while Yahoo continues its investigation. And Verizon will review the impact of this breach before reaching any final conclusions. My little prediction, for what it's worth, is that if Verizon goes ahead and buys Yahoo, it'll be for a lot less than the initial $4. 8 billion offer that was on the table. SIEGEL: And what are Yahoo customers supposed to do about this? SHAHANI: (Laughter) Well, Yahoo says it is reaching out to affected customers to let them know. The standard procedure is to offer victims free credit monitoring for a year and change. So that's something people may want to use. Customers may also want to reconsider changing the security questions that they use in their other accounts to not reflect what they were using in Yahoo. SIEGEL: Aarti, when Yahoo talks about a billion user accounts, is that the total number of Yahoo user accounts? SHAHANI: Yahoo claims to have a billion monthly active users - and so that would mean that a billion people actively using Yahoo and then, you know, many others - an untold number of others - who are not actively using it. So we don't know in this breach if the billion in question are mostly current, active users whose accounts were breached or people that were no longer really turning to Yahoo, maybe went to Gmail instead. SIEGEL: OK, that's NPR's Aarti Shahani. Aarti, thanks. SHAHANI: Thank you. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  Yahoo has announced yet again that customers were hacked.

To try to make sense of what we know now, NPR's Aarti Shahani is on the line. Hi, Aarti. AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: Hi. INSKEEP: What happened? SHAHANI: According to a post on Yahoo's Tumblr page by the company's chief security officer, it was law enforcement who came to Yahoo and said, hey, we've got a bunch of stolen data on our hands, and we think it's yours. Yahoo took a look, had some outside forensics experts take a look, and, yeah, it's a bunch of Yahoo accounts. And by a bunch, Steve, I mean more than a billion, as you said. Interestingly, hackers did not get it in the way we're used to hearing about. It wasn't a spearfishing attack where some unknowing employee opens an attachment and, bam, the thieves are inside the servers. In this case, hackers managed to access proprietary code, what's supposed to be the company's super secret code, and then figured a way to break in. Yahoo claims it's state-sponsored actors, that a foreign government is behind it. But the company's given zero proof of that. And it looks like the hack happened back in August of 2013. INSKEEP: A couple of quick questions here. They said earlier there'd been half a billion accounts hacked. Is this an additional 1 billion, so 1. 5 billion in all? SHAHANI: Well, from the statement today and from the calls we've had with them, it seems to be a separate hack not related to the half billion already reported. And so, yeah, I mean, we're talking about a fresh batch. INSKEEP: Of what kind of information about people? SHAHANI: So the data that was taken includes names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, encrypted passwords and in some cases encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers. Yahoo says what was not taken was bank account or credit card information. That data's stored separately. INSKEEP: Oh, OK. Should people be relieved then? SHAHANI: Well, I mean, sure, it's relieving, but at the same time, you know, what's a well-known fact about hacks in the cybersecurity world is that these user credentials that are stolen from one site can be used to break into another site, you know, and it makes sense. So people recycle their emails and passwords all over the place. And with security questions, you know, for example, when your bank asks you what's your mom's maiden name, well, she's only got one. And so you're going to use it at Yahoo Mail and at Citibank, right? Yahoo's reaching out to customers impacted by this hack and actually forcing them to change their passwords this time around. In the hack announced in September, they didn't do that. They just recommended a password change. INSKEEP: Can I just mention - I know Yahoo is a big company but not the biggest company. In fact, it gets in the news often for being a little bit troubled. Should we be surprised that they have information on more than a billion people apparently? SHAHANI: Well, I mean, that's the funny thing about it is Yahoo announced earlier this year, you know, when it was in talks about being purchased by Verizon - talks that are still going on - Yahoo announced that it has a billion active users every month. So, I mean, it's still a force out there. People are still using their Yahoo Mail. I think what we should be surprised about is how sloppy their security has been and how, you know, up until now, they keep saying, oh, whoops, we got hacked. And not just hacked, like mega hacked. It shouldn't be such a surprise for them recurringly (ph). INSKEEP: Well, what does it mean for this buyout that you just mentioned? SHAHANI: Well, you know, Verizon is thinking about buying Yahoo. And what Verizon told us in the statement is that they're evaluating this newest breach and its impact before reaching any final conclusions. You know, my guess is that there's no way Verizon's going to buy Yahoo for $4. 8 billion, if they buy Yahoo at all. It'll be for a smaller figure. INSKEEP: Aarti, thanks very much.

I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, ideas about reconciliation, especially in such a divided moment in time. And like a lot of us, Eli Pariser has been wondering how to better understand the people he doesn't always come into contact with, especially online. ELI PARISER: So I think the first thing that everyone thinks of - and me, too - is I'm going to go find, you know, people who think totally different from me. . . RAZ: Yeah, right. PARISER: . . . And follow them. RAZ: Yeah. PARISER: And that's great if you can handle it. Personally - and I think most people who do that experiment, it's kind of a recipe for madness a little bit because. . . RAZ: Wait, have you done that? PARISER: Yeah, totally. No, I. . . RAZ: What'd you do? What'd you do? PARISER: Oh, I follow a whole bunch of conservatives on Twitter and on Facebook. RAZ: And you can't handle it? Or, like, it brings you down or drives you crazy or what? PARISER: It sends me into. . . RAZ: Like, a deep, dark place? PARISER: Not a deep, dark place but, like, a - I can't kind of listen sincerely because I feel like the arguments are being manipulated. RAZ: Of course, long before the presidential election in the U. S. , there was talk of how hard it can be to get outside your own bubble online - to hear other arguments, to understand them, even empathize with them. Eli Pariser knows more about this stuff than most people. He's the founder of the viral content website Upworthy. And he's written a book all about what he calls filter bubbles, how websites like Facebook and Google filter what you see according to all kinds of criteria you can't control. Here's Eli on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)PARISER: Your filter bubble is kind of your own personal, unique universe of information that you live in online. And what's in your filter bubble depends on who you are and it depends on what you do. But the thing is that you don't decide what gets in. And more importantly, you don't actually see what gets edited out. So Facebook isn't the only place that's doing this kind of invisible algorithmic editing of the web. Google's doing it, too. If I search for something and you search for something even right now, at the very same time, we may get very different search results. Even if you're logged out, one engineer told me there are 57 signals that Google looks at - everything from what kind of computer you're on to what kind of browser you're using to where you're located - that it uses to personally tailor your query results. Think about it for a second. There is no standard Google anymore. And where this - this moves us very quickly toward a world in which the internet is showing us what it thinks we want to see, but not necessarily what we need to see. As Eric Schmidt said, it'll be very hard for people to watch or consume something that has not in some sense been tailored for them. RAZ: All of this matters more now than ever before, when here in the U. S. and even around the world people just cannot seem to agree on the most basic stuff, let alone more complicated problems. PARISER: So a fascinating thing is that there was a big debate in this election about crime in the United States. And was crime up or was crime down? And according to crime statistics, crime is not up. We're not in a record era of crime. But, you know, if you google it, you see a mix of more conservative-leaning websites that assert strongly that crime is growing and high. And that's kind of scary because Facebook and Google are orders of magnitude bigger than any newspaper ever has been, than any media institution has ever been. But I think we still haven't really grappled with, you know, we have a sense of what the ethics of being a newspaper are, but we don't really have a sense of what the ethics of being an algorithm writer are and what our responsibilities are when it comes to this stuff. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)PARISER: So one of the problems with the filter bubble was discovered by some researchers at Netflix. What they discovered was that in our Netflix queues, there's kind of this epic struggle going on between our future aspirational selves and our more impulsive present selves. You know, we all want to be someone who has watched \"Rashomon. \" But right now, we want to watch \"Ace Ventura\" for the fourth time. (LAUGHTER)PARISER: So the best editing gives us a bit of both. It gives us a little bit of Justin Bieber and a little bit of Afghanistan. It gives us some information vegetables, it gives us some information dessert. And the challenge with these kind of algorithmic filters, these personalized filters, is that because they're mainly looking at what you click on first, you know, you don't - it can throw off that balance. And instead of a balanced information diet, you can end up surrounded by information junk food. RAZ: I mean, we're now in a place where all of a sudden we have access to infinite information, to facts, to truth all the time. So how do we - like, how do we change the way filtering and algorithms work to avoid the information junk food? PARISER: Yeah. I mean, I do talk to people inside Google and inside Facebook who are very concerned and very interested in how do we actually solve these problems? And I think one of the things that Facebook has done at times is when you have a story that has one point of view, underneath it pop up a related story with a different point of view. That's actually pretty powerful. I think the second piece that's really interesting is one of the most interesting spaces where people have kind of been able to get good cross partisan dialogue going, where they've been able to actually hear each other are spaces where there's some unifying identity that supersedes your political identity. And the classic example of this is message boards for sports fans, and it turns out that there's really rich conversation happening on sports message boards because we're all, you know, Red Sox fans first, and then I might be a Republican and you might be a Democrat. And having that sense of shared identity allows people to be less defensive and more open to new ideas. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)PARISER: So if algorithms are going to curate the world for us, if they're going to decide what we get to see and what we don't get to see, then we need to make sure that they're not just keyed to relevance. We need to make sure that they also show us things that are uncomfortable. And we need the new gatekeepers to encode that kind of responsibility into the code that they're writing because I think we really need the internet to be that thing that we all dreamed of it being. We need it to connect us all together. We need it to introduce us to new ideas and new people and different perspectives. And it's not going to do that if it leaves us all isolated in a web of one. Thank you. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: Eli Pariser - you can see his TED talk at ted. com. GUY RAZ, HOST:  It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, ideas about reconciliation, especially in such a divided moment in time. And like a lot of us, Eli Pariser has been wondering how to better understand the people he doesn't always come into contact with, especially online. ELI PARISER: So I think the first thing that everyone thinks of - and me, too - is I'm going to go find, you know, people who think totally different from me. . . RAZ: Yeah, right. PARISER: . . . And follow them. RAZ: Yeah. PARISER: And that's great if you can handle it. Personally - and I think most people who do that experiment, it's kind of a recipe for madness a little bit because. . . RAZ: Wait, have you done that? PARISER: Yeah, totally. No, I. . . RAZ: What'd you do? What'd you do? PARISER: Oh, I follow a whole bunch of conservatives on Twitter and on Facebook. RAZ: And you can't handle it? Or, like, it brings you down or drives you crazy or what? PARISER: It sends me into. . . RAZ: Like, a deep, dark place? PARISER: Not a deep, dark place but, like, a - I can't kind of listen sincerely because I feel like the arguments are being manipulated. RAZ: Of course, long before the presidential election in the U. S. , there was talk of how hard it can be to get outside your own bubble online - to hear other arguments, to understand them, even empathize with them. Eli Pariser knows more about this stuff than most people. He's the founder of the viral content website Upworthy. And he's written a book all about what he calls filter bubbles, how websites like Facebook and Google filter what you see according to all kinds of criteria you can't control. Here's Eli on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) PARISER: Your filter bubble is kind of your own personal, unique universe of information that you live in online. And what's in your filter bubble depends on who you are and it depends on what you do. But the thing is that you don't decide what gets in. And more importantly, you don't actually see what gets edited out. So Facebook isn't the only place that's doing this kind of invisible algorithmic editing of the web. Google's doing it, too. If I search for something and you search for something even right now, at the very same time, we may get very different search results. Even if you're logged out, one engineer told me there are 57 signals that Google looks at - everything from what kind of computer you're on to what kind of browser you're using to where you're located - that it uses to personally tailor your query results. Think about it for a second. There is no standard Google anymore. And where this - this moves us very quickly toward a world in which the internet is showing us what it thinks we want to see, but not necessarily what we need to see. As Eric Schmidt said, it'll be very hard for people to watch or consume something that has not in some sense been tailored for them. RAZ: All of this matters more now than ever before, when here in the U. S. and even around the world people just cannot seem to agree on the most basic stuff, let alone more complicated problems. PARISER: So a fascinating thing is that there was a big debate in this election about crime in the United States. And was crime up or was crime down? And according to crime statistics, crime is not up. We're not in a record era of crime. But, you know, if you google it, you see a mix of more conservative-leaning websites that assert strongly that crime is growing and high. And that's kind of scary because Facebook and Google are orders of magnitude bigger than any newspaper ever has been, than any media institution has ever been. But I think we still haven't really grappled with, you know, we have a sense of what the ethics of being a newspaper are, but we don't really have a sense of what the ethics of being an algorithm writer are and what our responsibilities are when it comes to this stuff.

(SOUNDBITE OF RADIO BROADCAST)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Speaking Korean). CHANG: Chungju-si, South Korea. (SOUNDBITE OF RADIO BROADCAST)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Speaking Korean). CHANG: All right. How about here? I'm just going up to Seoul. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"OE TOL I YA\")CNBLUE: (Singing in Korean). CHANG: Oh, yeah - nice. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"OE TOL I YA\")CNBLUE: (Singing in Korean).

Radio Garden was designed by Jonathan Puckey in collaboration with the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision. Jonathan Puckey joins us from Amsterdam now. Welcome. JONATHAN PUCKEY: Hello. CHANG: So how did this project come about? PUCKEY: Yeah. So a year ago, we were invited by the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision to actually come up with an installation for their museum for a research project called Transnational Radio Encounters. And this research project is about radio that crosses borders and radio of different languages. And we actually quite quickly came up with the idea of making a website instead of an installation. CHANG: You know, it is interesting. On this globe, you don't see any state borders in the U. S. , and you don't see any country designations in the rest of the globe. You know, it's just, like, a satellite image. Why leave out the borders? PUCKEY: Like, radio itself, of course, doesn't know about borders. It's a signal that travels as far as the signal strength goes. And we kind of wanted to reflect that idea. In the past when you used to listen to radio, you would even have, like, the city names on the dials. Like, you would tune into - for example, in the Netherlands, you would tune into Hilversum. And we kind of wanted to, like, replicate this sort of idea that, yeah, you're kind of traveling in your mind as you listen to this radio. And you're not, like, busy with where you are exactly. CHANG: I like that idea. Like, right now, I'm just going to click on this dot in the middle of Asia - oh, it's Afghanistan. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)UNIDENTIFIED ARTIST #2: (Singing in foreign language). CHANG: I love that. I feel like I'm peeking through the window at someone else's party. But I don't feel shut out. I kind of feel invited. And it makes the world feel smaller to me by being able to navigate it so quickly with a mouse. PUCKEY: Yes, I really like the idea that you can get lost. Like, you don't know exactly where you're going. Like I tried, for example, to find San Francisco the other day and actually had a hard time pinpointing it because I'm so used to actually seeing a map and sort of knowing exactly where I need to go - really enjoy this sort of fact of sort of getting lost. CHANG: Right. So besides the live broadcast, there are a couple other buttons here. I'm looking at jingles. I'm going to click on jingles. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED SINGERS: (Singing) Seventy-seven WABC. CHANG: (Laughter) That is from 1961, New York, obviously prerecorded. PUCKEY: Yeah, well - because we were working together with this research group and one of the research projects was research actually into the world of jingles. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED SINGERS: (Laughter) Seven-ninety, WAKY. . . CHANG: The Radio Garden website - it's less than a week old, right? And it's already been shared like crazy on social media. PUCKEY: Yeah, this was really surprising. We launched on Monday, and it's just been going all over the globe. Right now, we're sort of going viral in Brazil and actually Saudi Arabia and actually countries where we didn't even have that many radio stations or content from those places. CHANG: Wow. PUCKEY: But they seem to really be getting into it. We've been receiving, like, copious amounts of requests of radio stations to have their station put on the website, which is really surprising. I have, like, a list of, like, 600 emails that I still need to, like, run through this weekend. . . CHANG: Wow. PUCKEY: . . . Adding all these stations the website. So that's been great.

NPR's Brian Naylor reports. CAYLA: My name is Cayla. My mom said she named me after her grandmother. BRIAN NAYLOR, BYLINE: My Friend Cayla is a doll and looks pretty much like most dolls do. She's available in various skin tones and hair colors. And according to her website, she is the smartest toy you'll ever have. Ask her if she can sing a song. Sing a song, Cayla. CAYLA: Well, I think I'm pretty good at singing. Here's a song I love to sing to my next door neighbor's little girl. (Singing) Twinkle, twinkle. . . NAYLOR: But My Friend Cayla also has some issues. She sings and talks and listens but maybe a little too well. CLAIRE GARTLAND: We're very concerned about the fact that these dolls are essentially spying on your kids' private conversations. NAYLOR: Claire Gartland is with the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington nonprofit that advocates for consumer privacy. The problem with Cayla, she says, is everything a child tells her can be recorded in the guise of having an interactive conversation. Ask her, say, can I tell you a secret? CAYLA: Sure. Go ahead. Be very quiet though. I promise not to tell anyone. It's just between you and me because we are friends. NAYLOR: But Gartland says that secret and anything else your child tells or asks Cayla isn't secret at all. If the doll is connected to a smartphone, as it's designed to be, that information can be sent to the toymaker, and that's troubling. GARTLAND: There's all kinds of intimate details of their personal life, their parents' personal lives. You know, we know how kids at, you know, younger ages don't necessarily have the same social filter. So these children could be chattering on about anything. NAYLOR: Gartland says the conversations that Cayla records are sent to servers at the toymaker, a company called Genesis, and to a third party called Nuance that makes voice-recognition software for a lot of companies. Nuance also has a database used by law enforcement and military and intelligence agencies that matches voiceprints. In a blog post, Nuance says it does not share voice data collected from its customers with any of its other customers. Genesis did not return calls for comment. Gartland says parents are not being sufficiently notified of My Friend Cayla's capabilities. GARTLAND: And more importantly, they're not consenting to this, and that's where some of our legal regulations come into play here. NAYLOR: The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act requires companies that collect and use private information from children 12 and under notify their parents and get permission first. The Electronic Privacy Information Center and other privacy advocates have filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission about Cayla. Ideally, they'd like to see the toy and its sibling, I-Que Intelligent Robot, taken off the shelves in the U. S. as has happened in some European countries. Brian Naylor, NPR News, Washington.

The company announced that decision yesterday about a week after the pilot project started. California officials had repeatedly objected to Uber's project. They said the company had failed to get the required permit. To talk about this, I'm joined by Queena Kim. She covers Silicon Valley for member station KQED. Hiya. QUEENA KIM, BYLINE: Hey. SIEGEL: And explain to us this dispute between Uber and the state of California. What's behind it? KIM: Yeah, so self-driving cars here in California have to be registered with the DMV. Uber is arguing that their car isn't really self-driving. They have a driver behind the wheel that can take over if the computer malfunctions. Also they're saying that the technology isn't totally self-driving, so the car can't just go out and drive itself. Well, the DMV didn't buy that argument. And then we entered unchartered territory. 'Cause it's totally unclear what the enforcement mechanism would be, the state attorney general threatened to sue. And you know, that can take a really long time. And so Uber exploited this uncertainty and continued to run its pilot. Well, we got an answer yesterday about what the state can do. And the DMV pulled the registrations for these cars. And if you're not registered, you can't be on the streets. SIEGEL: This also comes after there was a video taken of one of these cars running a red light. KIM: Yes. The company is saying that that was driver error, and it wasn't the computer. And there were also some complaints amongst bicyclists that the car made these - what's called an unsafe right hook, which means at the last minute just sort of veers into the bike lane when it makes a right turn which obviously is unsafe if there's a biker there. SIEGEL: Now, I understand that Uber objected to being required to register, and they claim that their car isn't fully self-driving. It seems as though getting a permit could have been - other people have done it. Is there any other reason people think Uber might be resisting this process? KIM: So we're sort of in the area of speculation here 'cause they haven't really drilled into why they're not doing this. One idea that was floated out there is that this might give them a competitive advantage. If you register your car with the DMV, you have to start giving out these incident reports every time the car does something wrong or the driver has to take over, if it gets into an accident. These reports are all public. And right now, the self-driving car space is really competitive. And so I imagine if you don't tell your competitors everything that went wrong, that gives you an advantage. SIEGEL: Uber has had self-driving cars on the road in Pittsburgh since September. Why does the company's relationship with regulators in California seem to be worse than it is in Pennsylvania? KIM: Well, as you know, Pittsburgh is an old steel town, and it's been trying to redefine itself as a sort of hub for self-driving cars and a little - like, a playground for innovation. So the mayor there was very supportive of this effort. Here in California, this experiment has been going on for a little longer with Google. There are more regulations in place, and they didn't abide by them. It's not so much a free-for-all as it seems to be in Pittsburgh. SIEGEL: That's reporter Queena Kim of member station KQED. Thanks for talking with us. KIM: Well, thanks for having me on. SIEGEL: And today Uber announced that it would be expanding its pilot project for self-driving cars in Arizona. In a statement, Arizona Governor Doug Ducey said, California may not want you, but we do.

Also they're saying that the technology isn't totally self-driving, so the car can't just go out and drive itself. Well, the DMV didn't buy that argument. And then we entered unchartered territory. 'Cause it's totally unclear what the enforcement mechanism would be, the state attorney general threatened to sue. And you know, that can take a really long time. And so Uber exploited this uncertainty and continued to run its pilot. Well, we got an answer yesterday about what the state can do. And the DMV pulled the registrations for these cars. And if you're not registered, you can't be on the streets. SIEGEL: This also comes after there was a video taken of one of these cars running a red light. KIM: Yes. The company is saying that that was driver error, and it wasn't the computer. And there were also some complaints amongst bicyclists that the car made these - what's called an unsafe right hook, which means at the last minute just sort of veers into the bike lane when it makes a right turn which obviously is unsafe if there's a biker there. SIEGEL: Now, I understand that Uber objected to being required to register, and they claim that their car isn't fully self-driving. It seems as though getting a permit could have been - other people have done it. Is there any other reason people think Uber might be resisting this process? KIM: So we're sort of in the area of speculation here 'cause they haven't really drilled into why they're not doing this. One idea that was floated out there is that this might give them a competitive advantage. If you register your car with the DMV, you have to start giving out these incident reports every time the car does something wrong or the driver has to take over, if it gets into an accident. These reports are all public. And right now, the self-driving car space is really competitive. And so I imagine if you don't tell your competitors everything that went wrong, that gives you an advantage. SIEGEL: Uber has had self-driving cars on the road in Pittsburgh since September. Why does the company's relationship with regulators in California seem to be worse than it is in Pennsylvania? KIM: Well, as you know, Pittsburgh is an old steel town, and it's been trying to redefine itself as a sort of hub for self-driving cars and a little - like, a playground for innovation. So the mayor there was very supportive of this effort. Here in California, this experiment has been going on for a little longer with Google. There are more regulations in place, and they didn't abide by them. It's not so much a free-for-all as it seems to be in Pittsburgh. SIEGEL: That's reporter Queena Kim of member station KQED. Thanks for talking with us. KIM: Well, thanks for having me on. SIEGEL: And today Uber announced that it would be expanding its pilot project for self-driving cars in Arizona. In a statement, Arizona Governor Doug Ducey said, California may not want you, but we do.", "section": "Technology", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

This week on All Tech Considered, we're hearing about improbable news and the search for a new name for the dongle. First, a report on cybersecurity - NPR's Brian Naylor reports this is an issue the Trump administration will have to confront. BRIAN NAYLOR, BYLINE: One of Donald Trump's first big decisions as president may be whether to continue whatever actions the Obama administration has promised to take in response to findings by U. S. intelligence agencies that Russia hacked computers at the Democratic National Committee and other Democratic political groups. JAY KAPLAN: State-sponsored hacking is arguably one of the biggest threats to the nation. NAYLOR: Jay Kaplan is a former analyst at the National Security Agency. State actors are behind numerous recent hacks including employee records at the Office of Personnel Management believed to be the work of China. The Obama administration in a recent report on enhancing national cybersecurity avoided addressing head-on the issue of state-sponsored hacking, but it did recommend steps including hiring 100,000 what it called cybersecurity practitioners over the next 10 years to fix vulnerabilities in government and private IT systems. That's a huge challenge, Kaplan says, but there are other ways to deal with the problem. KAPLAN: A great example of that is actually using crowdsourcing as a solution. NAYLOR: Kaplan's firm, Synack, is working with the Pentagon on just that. KAPLAN: To uncover security holes across the federal government, specifically DOD focus, but they're hoping to broaden that scope soon. NAYLOR: And a new administration may bring other new ways of looking at the problems or at least that's what Betsy Cooper hopes. Cooper is director of the Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity at UC, Berkeley. BETSY COOPER: We absolutely believe that this is an opportunity for progress that a new administration without ties to past government structures creates the opportunity for resetting the playing fields. NAYLOR: One proposal is for a cyber workforce incubator to be set up in Silicon Valley where tech industry experts and government officials could get together to exchange ideas. COOPER: Each group would rotate back to their normal jobs - the government folks having gotten better exposure to the Silicon Valley culture and the way of working and the Silicon Valley folks having better understood the importance of government problems and the importance of working on these issues in the public sector. NAYLOR: Cooper also suggests a public campaign like the government is used to get people to buckle their seat belts or recycle to get ordinary Americans aware of the importance of things like using strong passwords and other so-called good cyber hygiene practices. It's not just individuals or government systems that need help with cybersecurity issues. MELISSA HATHAWAY: I think the president should focus on three things - energy, finance and telecom. NAYLOR: Melissa Hathaway has worked on cyber issues in the Obama and George W. Bush administrations. She says the IT systems of utilities and banks have already been infected with malware and are vulnerable to hackers, not only from state sponsors, but also criminals. HATHAWAY: If I can bring a utility offline through ransomware or through some other means and I can cause them to pay to get it restored, you're seeing criminals enter into this area as well. NAYLOR: And she points to recent attacks in which hackers hijacked so-called internet-of-things devices, like printers or refrigerators, to bring down online services including Twitter and Spotify. She says it's time to act. HATHAWAY: I think it's really important that we stop talking about these problems and start solving them, and that's going to require leadership. It's going to require focused attention. NAYLOR: And Hathaway says if Trump wants to make America great again, he needs to address cybersecurity quickly. Brian Naylor, NPR News, Washington.

Most perished while trying to reach Europe. DAVID GREENE, HOST: But there's also a deadly migrant corridor in this country near the U. S. -Mexico border. In Brooks County, Texas the terrain is tough, temperatures are blazing and many who die there are never identified. MARTIN: Jen Reel wants to try to change that. She's a photojournalist with the Texas Observer, and she's created a database to identify people using pictures of the things they carried with them. JEN REEL: There were a lot of rosaries and prayer cards. Those were very difficult to photograph because people understand when they're making this trip that it's a huge risk and there's a lot of danger. I imagine that they're relying on their faith to get them through this. MARTIN: For some, faith wasn't enough. Reel's database is called I Have a Name. Most of the things she took pictures of are from mass graves in Brooks County, Texas. REEL: The problem was because they were so overwhelmed with lack of resources - it's a very small county, I think about 7,000 people live there - they were not identifying properly where these people were buried. Some of the remains were found, multiple sets of remains in a grave site. MARTIN: Eventually the bodies - along with whatever items people had with them on those journeys - were exhumed by forensic anthropologists at Baylor University. They were also trying to identify them. Jen Reel met them at their lab. REEL: They were unpacking a blue backpack that had been found with some remains. And as they were unpacking them, there were toiletries, things like that, but also a baseball. You know, growing up I had played catch almost every night after dinner with my parents. And so I wanted to create a photo essay of the personal items because I thought that these images were a way to relate. Oftentimes the images that we see come out of Brooks County are migrants who are being detained by border patrol or seeking assistance in refugee centers. So this was a different way to approach that. MARTIN: So you got involved trying to document what was found alongside these bodies. Can you describe some of the photographs? REEL: Sure. One case was from an individual - a presumed male - believed to be between the ages of 35 and 50. And there was a stuffed animal found with the remains. There was also what looked to be a large wedding band. And it had been sewn into the waistband of this person's jeans. And oftentimes when people make this trip they are robbed. We saw a lot of that, actually, personal items that were hidden. One gentleman had created photocopies of money that he kept in his pockets and his real money was sewn into his clothing as well. MARTIN: Have you been able to identify any of these people? REEL: So we launched this database on December 8. And while I was photographing for the database, I came across a case that had a child's drawing along with a woman's name and a prayer written on a piece of paper. And I did some searching online and ended up finding a missing persons ad in a small paper out of McAllen, which is down at the border. And we ended up finding the family from Ecuador who was looking for this woman. And they were able to confirm that it was her then through DNA testing. MARTIN: As a photojournalist, it is your job to be sort of outside of the moment that you're trying to capture. But what was it like for you to document these items? REEL: Well, I would say that the stuffed animal really stayed with me. And to me that seemed like a gift. You know, there are people waiting to be reunited with their loved ones, and they're still waiting. MARTIN: Jen Reel is a multimedia editor at the Texas Observer. Jen, thank you so much for talking with us about your work. REEL: Thank you so much, Rachel.

The hackers for hire released research showing they could break into St. Jude's pacemakers remotely over the Internet. That's a terrifying thought. A hacker could get into the device in your heart, take it over, make it stop - terrifying enough to move markets. And as St. Jude's stock price fell with publicity of the research, the hackers and hedge fund made money. Justine Bone, CEO of the hacker research group MedSec, in that same Bloomberg interview. . .

So far, Amazon has not complied. The Echo is the personal assistant who answers to the name of Alexa. She'll play music and answer simple questions on voice command, but that technology also records what you say and sends that recording to a server. Whether or not this particular Echo has any useful information is not known, but Alexa, Siri and Google's Home assistant are in a lot of houses these days. Who knows what they hear and might record? And who else might hear the most intimate sounds of your household? Scott Stein is a senior editor at CNET. Thanks very much for being with us. SCOTT STEIN: Thanks. Thanks for having me. SIMON: Why do the police want the Echo? What do they think is on there? STEIN: I think they're hoping for any information, you know? It sounds like, from reports, they may not necessarily be clear on what information could be available, but hoping for something that might be overheard. Of course, devices like the Echo don't record all the time. They do record voice snippets when you make a request, and those are recorded, but they're short. And maybe they were hoping for something to be revealed there. SIMON: As I understand it, it's sort of like you have to say, Siri, and ask a question. I mean, a potential murderer would have to say, Alexa, I'm going to commit a crime now. Or am I naive? STEIN: Yes, no, I mean, it would have to be something specific or maybe something like a cryptic clue that might be set to a particular time where you could hear something in the background, perhaps. You know, it's - you do - you have to bring up by command. And then that snippet is only going to be as long as the request goes. And you can see on the device, when the blue light basically stops churning, that's when the recording stops. And you can even go back in your settings in your app. Not a lot of people realize that you can play back those audio clips any time. SIMON: What about the next generation of devices? What changes might there be that could also change your concerns? STEIN: Well, you know, the concern would be that the artificial intelligence is going to be more advanced and potentially their listening capabilities will be more advanced. I also think it's going to be very interesting when you look at cameras because, you know, there are a lot of advances in camera technology. You could start having cameras that start recognizing and interpreting all sorts of things in your environment that might be related to what you use for security or start being worked into operating systems. So that's another level that's going to be intriguing. Technology like augmented reality, which we've heard a little bit about, that is going to start utilizing more intelligent and now cameras that analyze the environment in ways we might not expect. SIMON: Mr. Stein, forgive me, but you're - I mean, you're a professional in this world. STEIN: Yes. SIMON: Does all of this. . . STEIN: I guess - yeah, I am. I am. SIMON: Does all this stuff ever make you a little - feel a little creepy? STEIN: It makes me feel very creepy. You know, I sometimes feel like a guinea pig with this technology - or often. And it also concerns me a lot. I think about the fuzzy line of where the privacy of data is out there in the cloud. The question is, will governments or other people be able to access data that you have on request? Will companies comply? How does that work? How does it work in a criminal investigation? Where's that line - because that's - that's the part that is a little mysterious. There is an element of how much of an open world are we living in and how much of that should we be comfortable with being out there? But to some degree, we've already been doing that. SIMON: Alexa, tell Mr. Stein we're - we're glad he was our guest. I guess she's not listening. Thanks very much, Scott Stein, senior editor at CNET. STEIN: Thank you.
