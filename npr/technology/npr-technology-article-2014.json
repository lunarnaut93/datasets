I'm Audie Cornish. Tomorrow is World Braille Day, a day to commemorate the birth of the Frenchman Louis Braille. Braille was just a toddler when he was blinded in an accident. Undeterred, he went on to become a brilliant student. But he was frustrated that he could not read or write. In school, he learned about a system of dots used by soldiers to communicate at night. Braille adapted that system into something that would transform the lives of the blind and visually impaired. Almost 200 years later, Braille has not changed so much, but how we read things has. Now that much reading takes place on screens and not on paper, how has that affected Braille's popularity among the blind? Well, here to explain is Judy Dixon. She's with the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped, part of the Library of Congress. Welcome to the studio. JUDY DIXON: Thank you. CORNISH: So first, to explain, you've been a Braille reader since childhood, right? DIXON: Yes. I started reading Braille when I was in the first grade at the school for the blind in Florida. When I first started reading Braille, all we had was Braille on paper. And, of course, we read Dick and Jane and Sally. I guess I'm showing my age here. (LAUGHTER)DIXON: And I don't think people read those books anymore. But I read the typical schoolbooks that other kids in the class were reading. And I just read on paper. CORNISH: Now, as an adult, you were one of the first people to really get involved in kind of high-tech Braille, right, and Web Braille. And can you talk a little bit about where the technology is today? Because, obviously, smartphones, for instance, have become an incredibly valuable tool. DIXON: The Braille technology really started taking off in the early '80s with the development of devices that we call refreshable Braille displays. And they're small boxes - different sizes, of course. I have a couple of them here. This device that's in front of me I have connected to an iPhone. And I have the app BARD Mobile, which is an app that was developed by the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped to read our Braille and audio books. And these devices have Braille cells, so the pins of a Braille cell - Braille is made of six dots. Each dot of the Braille cell raises and lowers so that if I wanted to read the letter A, which is dot one, the upper left of the Braille cell which - the Braille cell is three dots high and two dots wide. The pin for that dot would raise and all the other pins would not raise. And I have the book \"The Joy of Cooking\" loaded here. And I was just looking at the introduction to \"The Joy of Cooking,\" which is saying things like all new illustrations, rich new soups, more cooking with fire, including grilling, hot and cold, smoking and hearth cooking. New meals, turns. New grains chapter. Cook for a day, eat for a week. So it's - I'm reading the introduction to \"The Joy of Cooking. \"CORNISH: And as your fingers are running over and I can see those little pins kind of bobbing and disappearing. DIXON: Yes. CORNISH: Now, how do you feel today when you think of just how much wider the access is with Braille? DIXON: I feel now that I can read almost anything that's published, in one way or another, between my iPhone, my Kindle. The other kinds of Braille displays also can be connected to computers. So any book or document that can be read on a computer can be read with a Braille display and Braille. CORNISH: Tell us about the price of this, because I understand that Braille readers are pretty expensive. DIXON: That is certainly still the major drawback of refreshable Braille devices is that they are expensive. These devices are in the thousands. So a smaller version like this 14-cell unit that I have here would be about $1,500, larger units of 40-cell would be in the neighborhood of 3 to $4,000 and the prices go up. So these prices are somewhat prohibitive for many people. If a way of making Braille cells can be found that uses a mainstream technology that was in many, many devices and was pennies per unit, then Braille devices could be made for perhaps a few hundred dollars and could be affordable by all Braille readers. CORNISH: Now, how important do you think Braille is going forward? Do you see this enduring another 200 years? DIXON: I think about that, and perhaps yes, perhaps no. It's hard to imagine what will come along that could replace Braille for us. Audio is a linear experience. The words come, they go. But with Braille, I can see the word, I can see how it's spelled, I can see how the punctuation is. I don't have to wonder if a word has one T or two T's. It just is something I observe when I read a Braille word under my fingers. And it's a very different experience. I personally am kind of a visual learner. I don't take things in well audio. If I see it in Braille, I remember it, because it goes into my visual memory. CORNISH: Judy Dixon is with the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped, part of the Library of Congress. Thank you for coming in. DIXON: Thank you. CORNISH: We were talking on the eve of World Braille Day. Louis Braille would've been 205 years old tomorrow. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Audie Cornish.

But look closely. One little lacy number has the word consent printed on it and they somehow managed to squeeze the words, no means no onto a skimpy pink thong. It turns out the site's a lookalike, a prank and it's just the latest effort by two Baltimore artists who are tired of the sexual messaging coming from companies like Victoria's Secret and Playboy. From member station WYPR in Baltimore, Stephanie Hughes has their story. STEPHANIE HUGHES, BYLINE: Rebecca Nagle sometimes finds herself asking the question, what would Hugh Hefner say? REBECCA NAGLE: The only sex that is good is when it's good for everyone. And I've only ever had good sex. HUGHES: Did you write that? NAGLE: Yeah. HUGHES: Nagle has spent a lot of time studying Hefner. She's one of the directors of a Baltimore-based group called FORCE: Upsetting Rape Culture. The group is interested in promoting consent. FORCE thinks the way Playboy talks about consent is problematic. That includes the magazine's annual list of top party schools. NAGLE: The way that they describe women on the list are like campus perks, sort of alongside things like good bars and a good football stadium. HUGHES: FORCE wanted to change the message. So, last September, the group created a fake Playboy website. But instead of listing party schools, the site highlighted colleges working to promote consent. Nagle says it's not hard to imagine Hugh Hefner getting behind that. NAGLE: If you're somebody who's all about sexual pleasure, it makes total sense that you'd also be somebody who's all about consent. HUGHES: The website looks like it could have been created by Playboy. There's the bunny logo and language with just the right amount of smugness. FORCE also created replicas of several blogs reporting on the fake list, including the Huffington Post and BroBible. com. Playboy hasn't responded publicly to the prank, but BroBible did. Andy Moore is the associate editor for the website, which is aimed primarily at college-age men. He agreed with FORCE's message that consent and party school lists can co-exist. ANDY MOORE: They didn't say don't have a good time. I think that there's a way to rank these schools and to talk about this while keeping in mind that any sort of terrible behavior is not allowed. HUGHES: That's something the artists are hoping more people will think about and not just those who read Playboy or BroBible. They've used other brands to get that message across. (SOUNDBITE OF TV AD)HANNAH BRANCATO: Victoria's Secret, in a lot of ways, publicly owns the idea of sexuality. HUGHES: Hannah Brancato is another director of FORCE. The group was concerned with messages Victoria's Secret was placing on their underwear, such as stop staring and no peeking. BRANCATO: The words stop and no are being used as a way to flirt instead of a way to set boundaries. HUGHES: So, FORCE created a fake Victoria's Secret website. They pretended to release a new line of consent-themed underwear. BRANCATO: We said that Victoria's Secret was apologizing for their past styles and instead they were releasing this new line promoting consent culture - the idea of loving your body, communicating about sex, asking first, no means no. HUGHES: The prank fooled a lot of people, including 19-year-old Cinneah El-Amin from Baltimore. She was especially pleased to see models of all shapes and sizes wearing the underwear. CINNEAH EL-AMIN: Being able to look into this prank and see someone who looks like me, you know, meant a lot. HUGHES: The fake Victoria's Secret website received hundreds of thousands of hits. That's comparable to other corporate pranks. With the Playboy spoof, according to the count on each website, as of January 2nd, FORCE's list had been shared more times on Facebook and Twitter than the actual party school list. Hannah Brancato says that shows this kind of activism can be effective. BRANCATO: This is how you change attitudes, by changing the culture that we're consuming on a day-to-day basis. HUGHES: Until that change happens, Nagle and Brancato are planning to keep it up. They have other pranks in the works. For NPR News, I'm Stephanie Hughes in Baltimore.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RATH: Carlos Watson is the cofounder of the online magazine Ozy. Each week, he joins us to talk about what's new and what's next. Welcome back, Carlos. Happy New Year. CARLOS WATSON: Arun, Happy New Year to you. Always good to be back. RATH: So this week, we're going to talk about some of the stuff you're excited about in the year ahead. One of those things, in a word, Japan. WATSON: Indeed. It's funny. Japan was a big topic here in the States in the 1980s as they kind of surged economically. They were very integrated into the American conversation. They were ceded amidst some economic troubles, but they're back. Last year, Arun, what we celebrated a stock market recovery of some 30 percent here in the States, they were up by 50 percent. Not only that, you see them making major investments in clean tech and even getting a little more muscular, which may or may not be a good thing militarily. But all of that has put Japan back front and center. RATH: And in a dramatic contrast to here, it seems like in Japan, they're kind of excited about their government or have a bit more confidence in the direction of their government. WATSON: Long story short, a number of governments in Japan over the last decade and a half have struggled to get the economy on track. And at long last, this prime minister, who in fact this is his second time around, seems to have gotten people pointed in a direction that they feel good about. And indeed, there is much more confidence, and it has shown up in no small part in their stock market. RATH: Coming down to Hollywood now, just down the street from us. You - I love the way you put this: you say we didn't know we were waiting for Denzel Washington's successor, but you say he's here. WATSON: He's here. So 41-year-old British actor Idris Elba. I know you probably enjoyed him on \"The Wire\" in which he played a fabulous character named Stringer Bell. He also was good in the BBC detective series \"Luther. \" But where he really seems to be breaking out is this new Mandela film. And now he's got two big upcoming films coming our way - one with Sean Penn called \"The Gunmen\" and another called \"Beast of No Nation. \" So Idris Elba is not only one of People magazine's hottest guys out there, but he's definitely an actor to watch. RATH: And something else - I didn't know about these rumors floating around that he might be the next James Bond. WATSON: You know, they've only had five or six key people, and obviously, Daniel Craig's in the seat now and has done a good job. Idris Elba is kind of the first serious name of a black actor that we've heard talked about in that regard. So what a big deal that would be. RATH: I would love to see that. So finally, what's the company that you're keeping your eye on this year? WATSON: You know, it's funny. It's a company here in Silicon Valley - the car company Tesla. Of course, they're the makers of the first all-electric sports car. And for me, Arun, what Apple did in the computer industry, meaning kind of fundamentally redesign how average people think about computers; what HBO did in television in terms of blending both substance and style, it's clear in my mind that Tesla has tried to do that in the car space. They're the company that's a decade old. They just had their first profitable quarter last year, and they're looking to expand. In fact, their stock price last year, Arun, was up over 300 percent. RATH: Wow. You mentioned Apple. And sort of like Apple in the early years, Tesla's had some ups and downs. You know, towards the end of last year, there was that issue with - around the battery fires. But sounds like they're on their way back up again. WATSON: Indeed, they seem to be. And, as you said, there was the battery fire issue, and I'm sure there will be other parts of the conversation. But they really, you know, are injecting a certain sense of optimism back in the space. You might think of a sports car company like Tesla as being something for the big cities. The next place where they're looking to make a big dent is in the Midwest. So lots to look at when you talk about Tesla. RATH: Carlos Watson is the cofounder of the online magazine Ozy. Carlos, thanks again. WATSON: Arun, great to be with you.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RATH: No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop. Not that puzzle. Different show. Look, I don't want to offend, but this is a puzzle that's probably way too complicated for most of us. CHRIS BELL: It's like a Dan Brown novel, if Dan Brown could write this well, to be honest with you. (LAUGHTER)BELL: I mean, it's beyond the realms of my intelligence and beyond the realms, I think, of any individual's intelligence to do this. RATH: Freeland writer Chris Bell will guide us through this mystery. In a piece for The Telegraph, he wrote about an unknown organization posting incredibly complicated puzzles online to lure the world's most talented code breakers. It began two years ago with a simple message. BELL: It arrived on an underground message board called 4chan. And the message was a simple black square with white writing on. And the message read: Hello, we're looking for highly intelligent individuals. To find them, we have devised a test. There's a message hidden in this image. Find it, and it will lead you on the road to finding us. We look forward to meeting the few that will make it all the way through. Good luck. 3301. And that was all it said. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RATH: 3301, the only signature left by the mysterious entity that launched the challenge. Thousands of people took it on. To code breakers who dwell in this world, it was simple in the beginning. The first puzzle used a technique called steganography, concealing a message or image within another image. Terrorists have used it to hide messages. Pedophiles use it to conceal child pornography. Hidden inside that first seemingly simple image, those black words on white text, were many more pictures, codes, clues and one recurring image, a cicada. BELL: That's why the puzzle was actually named Cicada 3301, because it just appeared throughout. It's a bit like the moth imagery in Thomas Harris novel, \"The Silence of the Lambs. \" So it began to symbolize the entire puzzle as it started. RATH: If you decoded that first image, you were led to a website. That website contained more puzzles, even harder ones. BELL: That's why thousands of people joined in, because no one person had the skills to solve all of the puzzles. RATH: Extremely obscure knowledge was needed to crack those codes, knowledge of Medieval Welsh literature, occult numerology. BELL: There was clues placed inside the literature. There was stuff from the Victorian occult. There were Caesar ciphers. There was mind neurology (unintelligible) it led to a telephone number. And when it reached a certain point, they solved clues that led to, I think, 14 different GPS coordinates in locations around the world from a place like Hawaii to Warsaw. And when the people visited these locations, they found the cicada image there again and a further clue. RATH: This was one of the most complex puzzles the Internet has ever seen. BELL: And this is why people slowly started to realize that maybe it wasn't just some random, lonely kind of neckbeard sitting in his mom's basement. This was an international game. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)BELL: As the puzzles got more and more complex, people started to, you know, suspect this is a military organization behind this, like, you know, NSA or many people seemed to suspect the CIA behind this kind of thing. RATH: Some people, working in teams or individually, cracked the code and made it to the end. So what happened? BELL: Nobody knows. And this is part of the enduring kind of Cicada mystery is that after they got through all these tests the first time around, it led to a website on what's known as the darknet. And this is about the Web that tends to hide various nefarious industries, I think. They led to a website there, which once a certain number of people have accessed it, it closed down and left the message: We want the leaders, not the followers. And for thousands of people who were trying to solve the mystery, it was an enormous disappointment. RATH: No one is quite sure what happened for the select few who made it. BELL: There's lots of different rumors. None of them talked about it. They reckon there's anywhere between a dozen and two dozen people who made it to the final website. Apparently, they had to build a computer server and register certain addresses. But they never realized who - revealed, rather, who was behind the tests to begin with. The path led and stopped. RATH: But one year ago today on January 5, 2013, it all started over again - the puzzles with different techniques, new physical locations. BELL: And again, once the first few people got through to that, the website closed down again. RATH: And the mystery still continues. Chris Bell says it's become something special now. BELL: It kind of tapped into all the things that the Internet loves, in a way. It tapped into kind of slightly ludicrous conspiracy theory. And then the greatest thing, of course, is it never actually revealed its purpose. For thousands of people who sat at websites to try and decode these puzzles, it's been a real, you know, labor of love for many of them. RATH: For the past two years, new puzzles appeared online on January 4 or 5. And sure enough, this weekend, a ton of new puzzles appeared. Chris says the problem is so far, all the ones he's checked out have been fakes. But he's going to keep looking. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ARUN RATH, HOST:   And speaking of mysteries, we've got an amazing puzzle for you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RATH: No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop. Not that puzzle. Different show. Look, I don't want to offend, but this is a puzzle that's probably way too complicated for most of us. CHRIS BELL: It's like a Dan Brown novel, if Dan Brown could write this well, to be honest with you. (LAUGHTER) BELL: I mean, it's beyond the realms of my intelligence and beyond the realms, I think, of any individual's intelligence to do this. RATH: Freeland writer Chris Bell will guide us through this mystery. In a piece for The Telegraph, he wrote about an unknown organization posting incredibly complicated puzzles online to lure the world's most talented code breakers. It began two years ago with a simple message. BELL: It arrived on an underground message board called 4chan. And the message was a simple black square with white writing on. And the message read: Hello, we're looking for highly intelligent individuals. To find them, we have devised a test. There's a message hidden in this image. Find it, and it will lead you on the road to finding us. We look forward to meeting the few that will make it all the way through. Good luck. 3301. And that was all it said. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RATH: 3301, the only signature left by the mysterious entity that launched the challenge. Thousands of people took it on. To code breakers who dwell in this world, it was simple in the beginning. The first puzzle used a technique called steganography, concealing a message or image within another image. Terrorists have used it to hide messages. Pedophiles use it to conceal child pornography. Hidden inside that first seemingly simple image, those black words on white text, were many more pictures, codes, clues and one recurring image, a cicada. BELL: That's why the puzzle was actually named Cicada 3301, because it just appeared throughout. It's a bit like the moth imagery in Thomas Harris novel, \"The Silence of the Lambs. \" So it began to symbolize the entire puzzle as it started. RATH: If you decoded that first image, you were led to a website. That website contained more puzzles, even harder ones. BELL: That's why thousands of people joined in, because no one person had the skills to solve all of the puzzles. RATH: Extremely obscure knowledge was needed to crack those codes, knowledge of Medieval Welsh literature, occult numerology. BELL: There was clues placed inside the literature.

I'm Robert Siegel. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: And I'm Audie Cornish. The Consumer Electronics Show is best known for its whiz-bang gadgets and tech wizardry. But the world's biggest maker of computer processors, Intel, used its keynote speech to announce something different: That its processors are now free of so-called conflict minerals. They include tungsten, gold, tantalum, and tin found in everything from light bulbs to the smartphone in your pocket. But they're often sourced from war-torn countries, like the Democratic Republic of Congo, where mines have ties to armed groups. Four years ago, the president signed a Conflict Minerals Rule into law. Companies now have to make public whether their supply chains are conflict-free, the deadline for them to comply is this spring. Intel is the first American company to say they're already there. Their supply chain management director is Carolyn Duran. She's here to explain how they do it. Welcome to the program and tell us how this process works. CAROLYN DURAN: Well, this is really focused in two manners. The first was to focus on the supply chain and understanding where those four metals were used. And once we knew where they were used, mapping down through the entire supply chain to figure out where those minerals came from. The second part of it was to identify the smelters as part of that supply chain, and to do third-party audits, or intel direct observations by visiting smelters. By those two methods we were able to accomplish our goal. CORNISH: So help us understand, will there be enough supply. I mean essentially if you rule out certain smelters, is there going to be enough to make all the products? DURAN: There will definitely be enough. Once we hit, I call it an inflection point, when enough smelters of a given metal have gone through, we've found that it's better - the smelters have found that it's better for them to be engaged and validation processes than to not. CORNISH: Why, just because they need a guaranteed customer? DURAN: Yes, that's where the supply chain pressure comes in. So if enough customers say I need to see some validation of conflict free sourcing before I'll buy from you, when enough are there saying yes, we offer that, those that are not begin to offer it. And I can give you an example of that. In tantalum, which is the place where the electronics industry has the largest purchasing power - we're the largest consumer of tantalum - we saw in the beginning several that joined with us right from the beginning, saying this is the right thing to do, and yes, we'll go for it. We saw a few that said oh, it's not my problem. I don't need to do this. And when customers said: You know, you have to validate this in enough customers said it, they actually changed their systems. Before that time, they just didn't care. They would just buy what was cheapest. After enough supply chain pressure came in, they did start to care and implemented those systems. And that's, for me, a very heartwarming - when we started I wasn't sure how this is going to play out. We were just doing our best effort. We saw smelters changing their behavior, to me that meant we were successful. CORNISH: How can you absolutely be sure the source of each mineral? DURAN: So we'll never absolutely be sure forever, right? We're testing in a point in time from the soldier for their materials that were transacted over the past year. So we'll be constantly monitoring. And if we do find issues, which we may, we expect to resolve them and get those taken care of as quickly as possible. CORNISH: Now, how meaningful do you think this effort is - this law is - if essentially there aren't any penalties, right? I mean a company who comes to say: Yes, there are conflict minerals in our product, and they make that public. But, at the end of the day, they don't, you know, there's no consequence for that. DURAN: That's true. I think the consequence will be coming from the public. And so, the law is a way for companies to be required to disclose what they're doing. And it will be up to the public and ultimately consumers to determine and highlight those that are doing the right thing and those that are choosing to turn away. CORNISH: How significant or important is it for a company of your size to be doing this? DURAN: I would imagine that it's pretty significant. We are a recognized brand so people will know of Intel and we also have a pretty complex supply chain. Even though this is focused on the microprocessor where we have large control, based on our manufacturing of these parts, it was still a significant challenge for us and took us several years to accomplish. So for us to stand up and say it was worth it that we did it, that it can be done, is pretty powerful. CORNISH: Carolyn Duran, she is the supply chain management director at Intel.

Readers will never again have to click to read the second half of a story, and the site is crafted to appeal to a mobile audience. As NPR's David Folkenflik reports, the Times' digital redesign has also embraced a somewhat controversial shift in journalism - some posts on the site that look similar to articles reported and written by people working for the paper's advertisers. DAVID FOLKENFLIK, BYLINE: The practice is sometimes called native advertising or branded content. The idea is that there is content - maybe in the form of an article, maybe something else - created by or for an advertiser. Stephanie Losee is a former Fortune magazine writer who is now computer-maker Dell's managing editor of global communications. She oversees a stable of writers and identifies the engine driving this dynamic. STEPHANIE LOSEE: Brands have the privilege now of speaking directly to their audiences. FOLKENFLIK: In the digital age, Losee says, advertisers have a lot of options. LOSEE: Brands no longer had to rely exclusively on traditional publishers to gather audiences around content. We weren't calling it content at the time but that's what they were doing so that brands could advertise to those audiences. FOLKENFLIK: Now, Dell and other corporations will pay for articles they have commissioned to appear on The New York Times site - advertising intended to burnish awareness of a company rather than hawk its wares. This is no longer a luxury or an experiment, other papers are already in the game. Newspapers have lost ground to Twitter and Facebook and other social media platforms where sponsored tweets and postings appear as part of the user's daily stream. For The Times, the move has required great care. Michael Zimbalist is the senior vice president for advertising products at The New York Times. MICHAEL ZIMBALIST: We've put a lot of attention into how we're going to make it really clear to you as a reader of The New York Times that that story is, in fact, coming from a brand. And that begins with the name. We arrived at the name Paid Post, which we're very happy about. FOLKENFLIK: The word paid underscoring that someone paid for it, the word post suggesting it's content that could be worthwhile. The material from Dell runs in similar font as the paper's articles. But as Zimbalist says, it's very clearly marked with corporate logos and the legend paid for and posted by Dell at the top of the page. ZIMBALIST: Expertise can come from anywhere and great stories can come from all kinds of unexpected places. One of those places will be from brands. FOLKENFLIK: There are risks to imbedding corporate content, as The Atlantic found when it posted a sponsored article from the Church of Scientology that celebrated its history and airbrushed the many controversies that have dogged the organization. It seemed inconsistent with the nature of the magazine, which promised to take greater care differentiating original and paid material. Critics say that ambiguity is the point for many advertisers who are willing to pay if they can borrow the reputation of the news sites. But take BuzzFeed. The site's founder, Jonah Peretti, says his company's approach is inspired by fashion magazines like Vogue or the Super Bowl. Without the ads, he says, they'd be a lot less entertaining. JONAH PERETTI: Now, some people, I think, actually don't like the fact that our ads are good quality or that the ads are interesting, particularly when you think about the period where newspapers were mostly monopolies. And they could make huge amount of money without ever really spending any time or attention on the advertising. FOLKENFLIK: BuzzFeed's digital traffic now far exceeds that of The New York Times or CNN, and sometimes sponsored posts go viral, too. But a reader quickly skimming them might skip by the small corporate logo and the label stating they were written by a, quote, \"BuzzFeed partner. \" There are echoes here of past print advertising approaches. For example, some regional papers farm out their real estate sections to marketing employees rather than reporters. Foreign governments have paid for special sections to appear in newspapers touting their countries. As Zimbalist of The New York Times says, what's old is new again. David Folkenflik, NPR News, New York. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:   The New York Times today unveiled a major redesign of its website. Readers will never again have to click to read the second half of a story, and the site is crafted to appeal to a mobile audience. As NPR's David Folkenflik reports, the Times' digital redesign has also embraced a somewhat controversial shift in journalism - some posts on the site that look similar to articles reported and written by people working for the paper's advertisers. DAVID FOLKENFLIK, BYLINE: The practice is sometimes called native advertising or branded content. The idea is that there is content - maybe in the form of an article, maybe something else - created by or for an advertiser. Stephanie Losee is a former Fortune magazine writer who is now computer-maker Dell's managing editor of global communications. She oversees a stable of writers and identifies the engine driving this dynamic. STEPHANIE LOSEE: Brands have the privilege now of speaking directly to their audiences. FOLKENFLIK: In the digital age, Losee says, advertisers have a lot of options. LOSEE: Brands no longer had to rely exclusively on traditional publishers to gather audiences around content.

Finally today, we want to take a look at the world of Internet media. Now we often hear that the Internet is the brave new world where things like race and gender don't matter. Everybody can be who they want to be and have equal access and equal say. But we also know that there is an ugly side to the Internet, and that's something you may have experienced yourself, particularly if you are a girl or a woman. That's what we're going to talk about today. Writer Amanda Hess, in a piece in Pacific Standard magazine titled \"Why Women Aren't Welcome on the Internet,\" says that the way women are treated online really is different - that women are subjected to a level of abuse that is in fact more pervasive and more vicious than that directed at men. She says, in short, quote, we have been thinking about Internet harassment all wrong, unquote. And Amanda Hess is with us now from Southern California Public Radio in Pasadena. Amanda Hess, welcome. Thanks so much for joining us. AMANDA HESS: Thanks for having me. MARTIN: Also joining the conversation, Bridget Johnson, the Washington, D. C. editor for PJ Media. That's a conservative libertarian news and commentary site. She's one of our regular contributors here in Washington, D. C. Mikki Kendall is also with us, writer and media critic with HoodFeminism. com. She's with us from member station WBEZ in Chicago. Welcome back to you both. Thank you both so much for joining us. BRIDGET JOHNSON: Great to be here, Michel. MIKKI KENDALL: Thank you for having me. MARTIN: Now here's where I think I need to pause and say if you want to know what we're talking about, you need to know what we're talking about. So some of the things that we are going to talk about might be very upsetting, and this is the time that I need to say maybe this is - you might need to make a different choice for the next couple of minutes about how to spend your time. We hope you'll stay with us if you can. So, Amanda Hess, let me start with you. How do you know that this is happening more and more often and more viciously to women? Because I'm sure there are people who will say, well, women are just more sensitive. HESS: Sure. Well, there hasn't been a huge body of research on this issue, but there have been a few organizations and legal scholars who are beginning to dig into it who have been able to sort of isolate some statistics that show that women are disproportionately affected by online threats and harassment. The Pew Research Center is. . . MARTIN: Well, you cite some of that in your piece, for example, in 2006, researchers from the University of Maryland set up a bunch of fake online accounts and then sent them into chat rooms. And you said that accounts with female usernames or feminine usernames incurred an average of 100 sexually explicit or threatening messages a day and the masculine names received 3. 7. And that you said that there was another study by the Pew Research Center, which has been tracking the online lives of Americans for more than a decade, that women and men have been logging on in equal numbers since the year 2000, but that the kinds of communications we're talking about are disproportionally lobbed at women. Any idea why? HESS: Well, I think when you have any group that is traditionally marginalized in life, you're going to see a similar marginalization online because the Internet is really intimately connected to our real lives. So when we talk about women being oversensitive, that's also a complaint that's been applied to women who pursue sexual harassment litigation against their employers. MARTIN: Well, that's another area we're going to get into. Just talk about your experience if you would - username - you talked about, in your piece, a personal experience you had with this. And I just think this is where you need to explain to people what it is that we're actually talking about. There's a person that goes by the username HeadlessFemalePig, and he did what? HESS: HeadlessFemalePig set up a Twitter account this summer expressly for the purpose of threatening to rape me and cut off my head. He's just sort of the latest abuser in a long line of mostly anonymous people who have taken to the Internet to make sexual comments against me and threaten my life. MARTIN: Do you feel that that is in part because of your subject matter? I mean, you often write about racy topics - you know, dating, female sexuality. Your bio website is titled Sex With Amanda Hess. Do you think that those kinds of stories are more likely to bring out people with this kind of, I don't know, desire to harass? HESS: Yeah. I mean, I think when I speak with other women who talk about women's issues, whether it's, you know, from abortion to dating - by the way, I don't find dating to be a particularly racy topic - there will. . . MARTIN: Point taken. HESS: . . . Be people who sort of use gendered harassment to lash out against people who are specifically taking on misogyny or discussing sexuality, frankly. MARTIN: Well, here's why it's important that we have Bridget Johnson with us because you are a conservative writer for a conservative website, and I wanted to ask if you have had similar experiences. JOHNSON: I. . . MARTIN: And you write about politics. JOHNSON: Yeah, I get kind of two different types of harassment. The first, you know, since I write about terrorism a lot, I get it from extremists. I actually don't really mind that that much 'cause I feel like it's more of a toe-to-toe battle. It actually does bother me more when you get ones that are, you know, personally harassing, that you know it's somebody with a screw loose. (CROSSTALK)MARTIN: But do they say things about your gender? Do they say things that are sort of directed to you as a woman? JOHNSON: Yeah. MARTIN: Like what - do you mind if I ask? JOHNSON: Things about a person's looks, things about, you know, if you write something that has to do with, you know, policy on birth control, etc. , you could be branded as slutty very easily. When I was at the Rocky Mountain News, actually my home computer router was hacked. And the hacker made it so that when I started to enter the automatic fields where, you know, your name would drop down, it would be Bridget and then insults after that. MARTIN: And can I ask you, Bridget Johnson, because, as I said, this is a conservative libertarian sort of news and website - do you think that the people who attack you online in that space, do you think that they are people who don't agree with your politics who are attracted to the site in order to be - harass you? Or are they fellow conservatives who don't agree with you about a particular issue and just become nasty - not just - but become nasty and harassing in expressing whatever? JOHNSON: I can definitely. . . MARTIN: Are they fellow conservatives is what I'm asking you. JOHNSON: It comes from both sides. You can get, you know, the people who are coming onto the site, you know, just with express purpose of that. But you also have people, I think, who settle into a site and get really comfortable with it. And then if they see either on our site or another site another writer who is insulting somebody, they kind of - they're a follower. They kind of go along with that, and they feel that the Internet has given them this great license to be able to say, behind of the mask of a screen name, what they don't have the guts to say to somebody face-to-face in person. MARTIN: Mikki Kendall, what about you? KENDALL: So my experience has been both gendered and racial. I'm going to get called the B-word. I'm going to get called the N-word. I'm often going to be called them together. You get a lot of this - I think we all can all agree that it comes almost regardless of your topic. I had someone troll me - I posted a video yesterday of me and my kids having sort of fun science experiments in the deep frost. And I got a couple of angry trolling comments about throwing boiling water in the air to turn it into snow. If you can find something controversial in snowed-in science, I don't really know what else to - I can't please you. And I've definitely had - I wrote about abortion. I definitely got a lot of flak and stalking and harassment behind that. But I've also, frankly, gotten from people who were theoretically on my side - you know, men of color, women of color, white women, whatever - who just don't like what I have to say that day. And they want to make sure that I know that they don't think I have a right to say it. MARTIN: But you were dancing around the truth. In a way, we have to dance around a little bit because some of the kinds of things that have been said that - Amanda, that you write about in your piece and, Mikki, you told us about - are just not things that we would like to say in this space. But, Mikki, can you give us an example of what you're talking about? I mean, people threatening to rape you, that kind of thing. In addition to. . . KENDALL: I've actually gotten rape threats. I've gotten death threats. I've gotten. . . MARTIN: People threatening your children. KENDALL: Someone sent me a picture of me and my kids walking across the parking lot of the building we were living in and threatened to come see us. We had to move. I had to actually move a few years ago. And it was horrible. And I've sort of gotten, in the wake of that experience - of an actual stalking - I've sort of gotten this sense of when I have to pay attention to the threats and when the threats are such that I can make fun of them. MARTIN: If you're just joining us. . . KENDALL: And I can block that person. MARTIN: I understand, Mikki. OK. KENDALL: Because sometimes there's just no use in trying to talk back and trying to interact with people. I've also gotten very careful about how much of my personal information is actually public. The name I write under is not the name I live under. MARTIN: And you've had to do that because of - is this harassment that started in the real world and that was reflected online or is this stuff that started online? KENDALL: No, it definitely - it began online and then spread offline. I had a couple of people even go so far as to do it on Facebook with their actual Facebook - you know, their real names and locations. And they sent me these messages on Facebook. And I suspect they were very confused when the police came a-knocking. But. . . MARTIN: Well, let me talk about that because - if you're just joining us, we're talking about the whole question of why so many women writers are targets of Internet harassment. Our guests are Mikki Kendall - that's who was speaking just now - of HoodFeminism. com, Bridget Johnson of PJ Media and Amanda Hess who wrote an article about this for Pacific Standard magazine. Amanda, you draw a distinction - well, there are a couple things I wanted to ask you about - there's a lot to talk about in a short amount of time - is that you say that these - you liken these harassers to the Ku Klux Klan. These are people who are hiding under their hoods or behind usernames whose sole purpose is to intimidate people. And you also say that, you know, law enforcement is sometimes just technologically ill-equipped to deal with this. But you also say that, you know, there seems to be a kind of a growing consciousness around this, that people are starting to get the idea that cyberstalking is wrong, that cyberbullying is wrong - a lot more stories about this. So what is it that you say that we're thinking about all wrong? How do we need to think about this differently in your opinion? HESS: I think the main thing is that people need to understand that the Internet is as real as real life. I hesitate to use the term real life to even apply to this space that we are all walking in. And that's something that even as people can sort of understand that they spend really their whole days and their lives online, when it comes to abuse and violence against women and other marginalized communities, they often tell us to laugh it off or say that police resources should be used for crimes that occur, you know, in the meat space, if you will. So that's really the sort of paradigm shift that I think needs to happen in order to make sure that there are resources applied to investigating and prosecuting those crimes. MARTIN: And why do you think so because there are people who would say really what you need to focus on are physical interactions, that if something happens, it's kind of - just ignore it, laugh at it - ignore it or just don't read the comments or whatever. Why do you feel that this needs to be elevated to the level of, like, a physical threat or something that takes place in your physical space? HESS: Well, threats of physical violence, whether they are carried out in person or online are already illegal. They - it's a criminal act, but the problem is that there is not a lot of movement to even investigate these crimes. So, for example, when someone this summer threatened to rape and kill me, when I interfaced with the police about it - first of all, they had no idea what Twitter was, which was the platform where the threats came over. So it was very difficult to even sort of try to convince this person that it was - that this is a space that I use for my professional life, that I use for my personal life and it's a service that I need to use. And the other thing is that because a lot of police don't have a very intimate understanding of the Internet and how it works, there's a tendency to ignore it, to not investigate it. And if they don't investigate it, it really becomes impossible to prove, you know, how direct the threat is, how close this person actually lives to me. The person who threatened me claimed that they lived close to me, but it's difficult to prove without the police looking into it. MARTIN: Actually looking into it. But. . . HESS: And it's also impossible to prove a pattern of harassment, which is also criminal. MARTIN: Let's hear from the other guests on this as well. So, Bridget, how do you sort out when to engage and when not to engage? And is there a way in which you think you would like us to look at this question? JOHNSON: Right. I categorize the harassers into two categories. You have the insulters, which I've already talked about, and those are those people who just kind of follow and call people names. Then the second group is people who have made criminal suggestions or threats. The people making rape threats are not just being rude. They have a criminal mentality. The Internet has given people a new way to act out. You know, for example, if somebody was previously into child porn, they'd have to surreptitiously meet somebody to get some photos or a VHS or something. Now it's very easy for them to act out on that fantasy. So those making rape threats, you can believe that they've thought about wanting to do that. The Internet gives them a new way to virtually violate somebody. And what police need to be concerned about is the escalation. Are these people going to get to the point where the virtual fantasy is just not good enough and they act it out in real life? It might not be with the columnist or blogger that they're harassing, but it could be another woman who is more vulnerable. MARTIN: It's hard to know, though, because, again, as Amanda pointed out at the beginning, there's so little research on this, it's hard to know what is a sort of a fantasy that acts out. But, I mean, you know, Amanda makes the point, though, that if this affects - the way she says - she describes it, that these messages are an assault on women's careers and their psychological bandwidth and their freedom to engage. It's like if you are censoring yourself because you don't want to invite the harassment, then - but I don't know. I don't know. Mikki Kendall, what do you think about this? KENDALL: Well, so let's back this up for a second and talk about the fact that just because someone says it online, it doesn't mean they can't find you offline, right? Even if I personally don't use Foursquare or one of the other locator services, if my friend who's with me says on Twitter or anywhere else, hey, I'm at so and so with @Karnythia, and they talk about the restaurant name, then obviously you can find me. I write fiction as well. Sometimes I do conventions. You can find me at a convention. You can find my name on the websites for those conventions. So I think it's really disingenuous to think that just because it's said online, it can't be taken to offline. We are all relatively easy to find if we're writing in public in the first place. MARTIN: Do you feel, Mikki Kendall, that there is a - that your male colleagues understand the world that you're in when you talk about these issues? Do you feel that there's kind of a shared understanding of how this. . . KENDALL: I think some of them do. I think it depends - you know, I don't think it's gender-based. I think if you are talking about, say, certain categories of black men or trans men or disabled male men in particular, they are also getting some of this harassment. You also see men who try to speak up for women get a lot of this hate and harassment. There are guys who - and I love them for it - will sit on Twitter when they have time and sort of wrangle my mentions to distract the trolls, to distract the threats. And one of the things that you'll see is that they'll then develop their own cadre of haters because somehow the fact that they're defending a woman means that they are worthless as well. MARTIN: Let me give Amanda the final thought here since you were the person who kind of aggregated all this and put this all together. Is there something - is there one thing you'd like to take away - us to take away from this conversation? HESS: I think whether or not a threat escalates into an actual physical confrontation, the sheer volume and accumulation of these threats has the effect of intimidating women from using the Internet. And I think, you know, it's a really sad state where some people are saying, well, if you're not literally raped then everything is fine. I think we as a society should have a bit of a higher bar than that for, you know, taking action to make sure that women have equal opportunities in our society. MARTIN: Amanda Hess is a freelance writer. Her piece \"Why Women Aren't Welcome on the Internet\" is the cover story of Pacific Standard magazine. She was with us from KPCC in Pasadena.

You can get, you know, the people who are coming onto the site, you know, just with express purpose of that. But you also have people, I think, who settle into a site and get really comfortable with it. And then if they see either on our site or another site another writer who is insulting somebody, they kind of - they're a follower. They kind of go along with that, and they feel that the Internet has given them this great license to be able to say, behind of the mask of a screen name, what they don't have the guts to say to somebody face-to-face in person. MARTIN: Mikki Kendall, what about you? KENDALL: So my experience has been both gendered and racial. I'm going to get called the B-word. I'm going to get called the N-word. I'm often going to be called them together. You get a lot of this - I think we all can all agree that it comes almost regardless of your topic. I had someone troll me - I posted a video yesterday of me and my kids having sort of fun science experiments in the deep frost. And I got a couple of angry trolling comments about throwing boiling water in the air to turn it into snow. If you can find something controversial in snowed-in science, I don't really know what else to - I can't please you. And I've definitely had - I wrote about abortion. I definitely got a lot of flak and stalking and harassment behind that. But I've also, frankly, gotten from people who were theoretically on my side - you know, men of color, women of color, white women, whatever - who just don't like what I have to say that day. And they want to make sure that I know that they don't think I have a right to say it. MARTIN: But you were dancing around the truth. In a way, we have to dance around a little bit because some of the kinds of things that have been said that - Amanda, that you write about in your piece and, Mikki, you told us about - are just not things that we would like to say in this space. But, Mikki, can you give us an example of what you're talking about? I mean, people threatening to rape you, that kind of thing. In addition to. . . KENDALL: I've actually gotten rape threats. I've gotten death threats. I've gotten. . . MARTIN: People threatening your children. KENDALL: Someone sent me a picture of me and my kids walking across the parking lot of the building we were living in and threatened to come see us. We had to move. I had to actually move a few years ago. And it was horrible. And I've sort of gotten, in the wake of that experience - of an actual stalking - I've sort of gotten this sense of when I have to pay attention to the threats and when the threats are such that I can make fun of them. MARTIN: If you're just joining us. . . KENDALL: And I can block that person. MARTIN: I understand, Mikki. OK. KENDALL: Because sometimes there's just no use in trying to talk back and trying to interact with people. I've also gotten very careful about how much of my personal information is actually public. The name I write under is not the name I live under. MARTIN: And you've had to do that because of - is this harassment that started in the real world and that was reflected online or is this stuff that started online? KENDALL: No, it definitely - it began online and then spread offline. I had a couple of people even go so far as to do it on Facebook with their actual Facebook - you know, their real names and locations. And they sent me these messages on Facebook. And I suspect they were very confused when the police came a-knocking. But. . . MARTIN: Well, let me talk about that because - if you're just joining us, we're talking about the whole question of why so many women writers are targets of Internet harassment. Our guests are Mikki Kendall - that's who was speaking just now - of HoodFeminism. com, Bridget Johnson of PJ Media and Amanda Hess who wrote an article about this for Pacific Standard magazine. Amanda, you draw a distinction - well, there are a couple things I wanted to ask you about - there's a lot to talk about in a short amount of time - is that you say that these - you liken these harassers to the Ku Klux Klan. These are people who are hiding under their hoods or behind usernames whose sole purpose is to intimidate people. And you also say that, you know, law enforcement is sometimes just technologically ill-equipped to deal with this. But you also say that, you know, there seems to be a kind of a growing consciousness around this, that people are starting to get the idea that cyberstalking is wrong, that cyberbullying is wrong - a lot more stories about this. So what is it that you say that we're thinking about all wrong? How do we need to think about this differently in your opinion? HESS: I think the main thing is that people need to understand that the Internet is as real as real life. I hesitate to use the term real life to even apply to this space that we are all walking in. And that's something that even as people can sort of understand that they spend really their whole days and their lives online, when it comes to abuse and violence against women and other marginalized communities, they often tell us to laugh it off or say that police resources should be used for crimes that occur, you know, in the meat space, if you will. So that's really the sort of paradigm shift that I think needs to happen in order to make sure that there are resources applied to investigating and prosecuting those crimes. MARTIN: And why do you think so because there are people who would say really what you need to focus on are physical interactions, that if something happens, it's kind of - just ignore it, laugh at it - ignore it or just don't read the comments or whatever. Why do you feel that this needs to be elevated to the level of, like, a physical threat or something that takes place in your physical space? HESS: Well, threats of physical violence, whether they are carried out in person or online are already illegal. They - it's a criminal act, but the problem is that there is not a lot of movement to even investigate these crimes. So, for example, when someone this summer threatened to rape and kill me, when I interfaced with the police about it - first of all, they had no idea what Twitter was, which was the platform where the threats came over. So it was very difficult to even sort of try to convince this person that it was - that this is a space that I use for my professional life, that I use for my personal life and it's a service that I need to use. And the other thing is that because a lot of police don't have a very intimate understanding of the Internet and how it works, there's a tendency to ignore it, to not investigate it. And if they don't investigate it, it really becomes impossible to prove, you know, how direct the threat is, how close this person actually lives to me. The person who threatened me claimed that they lived close to me, but it's difficult to prove without the police looking into it. MARTIN: Actually looking into it. But. . . HESS: And it's also impossible to prove a pattern of harassment, which is also criminal. MARTIN: Let's hear from the other guests on this as well. So, Bridget, how do you sort out when to engage and when not to engage? And is there a way in which you think you would like us to look at this question? JOHNSON: Right. I categorize the harassers into two categories. You have the insulters, which I've already talked about, and those are those people who just kind of follow and call people names. Then the second group is people who have made criminal suggestions or threats. The people making rape threats are not just being rude. They have a criminal mentality. The Internet has given people a new way to act out. You know, for example, if somebody was previously into child porn, they'd have to surreptitiously meet somebody to get some photos or a VHS or something. Now it's very easy for them to act out on that fantasy. So those making rape threats, you can believe that they've thought about wanting to do that. The Internet gives them a new way to virtually violate somebody. And what police need to be concerned about is the escalation. Are these people going to get to the point where the virtual fantasy is just not good enough and they act it out in real life? It might not be with the columnist or blogger that they're harassing, but it could be another woman who is more vulnerable. MARTIN: It's hard to know, though, because, again, as Amanda pointed out at the beginning, there's so little research on this, it's hard to know what is a sort of a fantasy that acts out. But, I mean, you know, Amanda makes the point, though, that if this affects - the way she says - she describes it, that these messages are an assault on women's careers and their psychological bandwidth and their freedom to engage. It's like if you are censoring yourself because you don't want to invite the harassment, then - but I don't know. I don't know. Mikki Kendall, what do you think about this? KENDALL: Well, so let's back this up for a second and talk about the fact that just because someone says it online, it doesn't mean they can't find you offline, right? Even if I personally don't use Foursquare or one of the other locator services, if my friend who's with me says on Twitter or anywhere else, hey, I'm at so and so with @Karnythia, and they talk about the restaurant name, then obviously you can find me. I write fiction as well. Sometimes I do conventions. You can find me at a convention. You can find my name on the websites for those conventions. So I think it's really disingenuous to think that just because it's said online, it can't be taken to offline. We are all relatively easy to find if we're writing in public in the first place. MARTIN: Do you feel, Mikki Kendall, that there is a - that your male colleagues understand the world that you're in when you talk about these issues? Do you feel that there's kind of a shared understanding of how this. . . KENDALL: I think some of them do. I think it depends - you know, I don't think it's gender-based. I think if you are talking about, say, certain categories of black men or trans men or disabled male men in particular, they are also getting some of this harassment. You also see men who try to speak up for women get a lot of this hate and harassment. There are guys who - and I love them for it - will sit on Twitter when they have time and sort of wrangle my mentions to distract the trolls, to distract the threats. And one of the things that you'll see is that they'll then develop their own cadre of haters because somehow the fact that they're defending a woman means that they are worthless as well. MARTIN: Let me give Amanda the final thought here since you were the person who kind of aggregated all this and put this all together. Is there something - is there one thing you'd like to take away - us to take away from this conversation? HESS: I think whether or not a threat escalates into an actual physical confrontation, the sheer volume and accumulation of these threats has the effect of intimidating women from using the Internet. And I think, you know, it's a really sad state where some people are saying, well, if you're not literally raped then everything is fine. I think we as a society should have a bit of a higher bar than that for, you know, taking action to make sure that women have equal opportunities in our society. MARTIN: Amanda Hess is a freelance writer. Her piece \"Why Women Aren't Welcome on the Internet\" is the cover story of Pacific Standard magazine. She was with us from KPCC in Pasadena. Bridget Johnson is the Washington, D. C. editor for PJ Media, with us in our Washington, D. C. studios once again. Mikki Kendall is a writer and media critic with HoodFeminism. com, with us from NPR member station WBEZ, which is in Chicago. Thank you all so much for joining us. JOHNSON: Thanks, Michel.

Teens and early 20-somethings are its biggest users. But as NPR's Patti Neighmond reports, there are growing signs of disenchantment with the site. PATTI NEIGHMOND, BYLINE: Genevieve Brown is 19 years old, a sophomore at New York's Sarah Lawrence College and an avid Facebook user since junior high. It used to be a great joy. But lately, not so much. GENEVIEVE BROWN: I mean, it's kind of like everyone's life is a movie on Facebook. NEIGHMOND: A movie that she is not a part of. BROWN: You'll see that someone has gone to this new restaurant that maybe you were wanting to go to or they're out with their friend or their boyfriend or something like that and they're taking a picture of them all smiling with their delicious-looking food. NEIGHMOND: We're having a great time out at a concert. Now, Brown knows that no one's life is one grand adventure after another. But even so. . . BROWN: Sometimes I feel really sad after logging on to Facebook and going through it. NEIGHMOND: It's not just Brown. A number of studies have found people feel worse after scrolling Facebook - more envious, lonely, even angry. In one German study, people were particularly unhappy after viewing vacation photos. They were also more envious when browsing Facebook instead of actively using it by posting comments and photos of themselves. Passive use is how Facebook officials describe it. Moira Burke is a social psychologist at Facebook. In a study she did when she was at Carnegie Mellon University, she found big differences between browsers and active users. MOIRA BURKE: We found that talking to your close friends, writing on your friends' walls, having them like a comment on your posts was associated with improvements in well-being. So we found that people were happier and felt more connected to their friends. NEIGHMOND: Burke says it's a lot like face-to-face life. BURKE: You can be a wallflower or a social butterfly. You can connect one on one with your friends or not. And the outcomes that you experience really depend on how you interact with other people. NEIGHMOND: But kids say you can post as much as you want but if nobody likes your post, it still makes you feel bad. In response to a recent NPR posting on Facebook use, nearly 800 young people weighed in. And most of them said they'd considered leaving Facebook, but at the same time, most said they just couldn't. It's their main connection to friends, school activities, even homework. But some did make the break. JORDAN PERRY: My name is Jordan Perry(ph). I'm 23 years old and I deactivated my Facebook account about a month ago. NEIGHMOND: Perry's in grad school at the University of Central Florida. And as he moves into adulthood, Facebook has started to feel intrusive. PERRY: If you're friends with somebody and you're out with them and they post what they're doing, they can tag you in that status, and then it shows up on your feed or to all your friends and so they know like where you are. So if you're out at a bar or at a movie, somebody can say, at the movies and tag you, and then everyone knows where you are. And I just felt that was weird. NEIGHMOND: Too much information, he says. Even younger kids can feel overwhelmed. The Pew Research Center recently did focus groups with kids between 12 and 18. Senior researcher Amanda Lenhart says many felt exhausted by the pressure to present a perfect version of themselves. AMANDA LENHART: Whether that's through having the perfect photo of yourself as your profile photo and curating the other materials that were posted either by you about yourself or by other people. And certainly, that's - that can be stressful, particularly if you have lots of other people who are posting material about you, which you don't necessarily control. NEIGHMOND: And today, with more parents, family members and even grandparents roaming the site, Lenhart says kids feel less and less control. LENHART: Whether that's because parents would comment on things that they had posted on and would make faux pas in terms of sort of the social norms of the teens on Facebook and embarrass their children, or if it's a - you know, parents are just watching what their kids are doing and then asking a lot more questions in ways that makes teens uncomfortable. NEIGHMOND: Which may be one reason why some kids are spending more time on photo-driven apps like Instagram or Snapchat where pictures disappear in seconds, or Twitter where you get 140 characters to express yourself. Use of those is on the rise. A survey from the Pew Research Center finds the number of new young Facebook users flattening, not rising, for the first time since the site began nearly a decade ago.

Now you can, thanks to new technology unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show this week. Tech journalist Rich Jaroslovsky is at the annual gadget extravaganza in Las Vegas. Good morning, Rich. RICH JAROSLOVSKY: Good morning. MONTAGNE: Why don't we start with that kitchen stove? JAROSLOVSKY: The one that I spent the most time with is from a company called Dacor. And this looks to be a conventional stove except that it has a built in Android tablet, as a controller. So if you're standing at the stove, you can watch a how-to video, you can follow your recipe. If you're away from your stove and you've got your Smartphone with you, you can turn the oven on and off. You can check to see whether your food is done. If you've got a probe stuck into your roast, you could check to see what the internal temperature of the roast is while you're still at the office. MONTAGNE: What else are you seeing there, at that electronic show, that is getting warmer, you might say, intelligent? JAROSLOVSKY: One of the themes of the show seems to me to be connectivity being put into all sorts of devices; things like when you pull up to the house having the lights come on; the thermostat adjust; music playing when you walk in the door. That's kind of the fantasy and it is potentially achievable. But right now, these are all separate devices and they really don't work and play well together. MONTAGNE: I'm going to guess that's the next thing to come along, something that takes all these devices and makes them whole, so to speak. JAROSLOVSKY: That's exactly right. And in fact, a company called Revolve has a little thing that sits on a tabletop - it's a little bit bigger than a hockey puck - and it's crammed with all sorts of radios and technology to allow it to communicate with all different kinds of products. And then there is a single app that controls the Revolve device, which in turn controls everything else. And it works with things that are already showing some popularity, things like the Sonos wireless music systems; the Nest intelligent thermostat; the Philips hue-colored LED light bulbs. But these products are proliferating so fast that I am kind of wondering how the Revolve people are going to keep up. MONTAGNE: Well, let me ask you. I suppose the range is big but these devices that allow so much connectivity, are they terribly expensive? JAROSLOVSKY: It's not as bad as you would think. Because the sensors and the radios that make that kind of connectivity possible are really, really coming down in price. One of my favorite things so far at the show is a Bluetooth connected toothbrush.

They're using sensors and systems like Wi-Fi Internet connections and Bluetooth to monitor the human body on a constant, real-time basis. Critics say this high-tech medicine is leaving security concerns behind. Aarti Shahani reports from member station KQED. AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: Teddy the Guardian is a little brown bear with a blinking red heart. Founder Ana Burica says the toy can record your child's heart rate, body temperature and blood oxygen levels and upload all that to a mobile app. ANA BURICA: All the child has to do is take Teddy by the paw, hold him for three to five seconds, and this is the time definitely enough for the sensors to track the values. SHAHANI: BodyCap is a little red and white pill that looks like Tylenol, but inside there's a chip. Marketing director Isabelle Lauret says a patient recovering from chemotherapy can swallow it and the pill will shoot off a temperature reading every 30 seconds. ISABELLE LAURET: And the doctor can get on his iPad. So if there is a rise of temperature, he can call his patient and ask him to return to the hospital immediately to do all checks. SHAHANI: And over at Beddit, founder Lasse Leppakorpi shows me sensors you can put under your bed sheet. LASSE LEPPAKORPI: It automatically during the night analyzes your sleep quality, your heart rate, your breathing. And then it sends the information using Bluetooth to your mobile device. SHAHANI: This all feels very, very intimate. So I ask: How do you handle security? LEPPAKORPI: For the data? SHAHANI: Yes. LEPPAKORPI: So what kind of security you will need with your own sleep and wellness data, which is stored in your own mobile device? MARK ORLANDO: I think we've all seen how secure mobile devices can be, which is to say not very secure. SHAHANI: Mark Orlando is a cyber-expert with Foreground Security. And he's seeing a lot of start-ups jump into health and fitness; hire all the right engineers and coders. But he says these companies are not hiring a single data security expert or outside auditor. ORLANDO: It's their product that's collecting and aggregating this data. So, you know, I think that they need to take responsibility, as opposed to kind of shifting the risk onto, say, a mobile phone manufacturer or, you know, an e-mail provider. SHAHANI: There's a real spread in what companies can do and are doing to protect health data. Some encrypt it before it leaves the device and re-encrypt on the Cloud. So even if it's stolen, it's useless. Others don't ever encrypt. And many investors don't ask. Listen to this candid confession from a leading venture capitalist Ping Li, who was talking at a Silicon Valley conference last October. He says that he pushes his startups to make a great product first, security comes later. PING LI: I think you should push it earlier. But it's so hard to know when a startup becomes interesting enough to get attacked. And sometimes it's a weird thing. You get attacked and we made it - we finally are, you know, we finally are worthy of getting hacked. (LAUGHTER)SHAHANI: Experts say that with cybercrime is on the rise, and lots of health data out there, many more startups are going to find themselves worthy of getting hacked. For NPR News, I'm Aarti Shahani in Las Vegas. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:   This year's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas includes companies that promise to revolutionize medicine as we know it. They're using sensors and systems like Wi-Fi Internet connections and Bluetooth to monitor the human body on a constant, real-time basis. Critics say this high-tech medicine is leaving security concerns behind. Aarti Shahani reports from member station KQED. AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: Teddy the Guardian is a little brown bear with a blinking red heart. Founder Ana Burica says the toy can record your child's heart rate, body temperature and blood oxygen levels and upload all that to a mobile app. ANA BURICA: All the child has to do is take Teddy by the paw, hold him for three to five seconds, and this is the time definitely enough for the sensors to track the values. SHAHANI: BodyCap is a little red and white pill that looks like Tylenol, but inside there's a chip. Marketing director Isabelle Lauret says a patient recovering from chemotherapy can swallow it and the pill will shoot off a temperature reading every 30 seconds. ISABELLE LAURET: And the doctor can get on his iPad. So if there is a rise of temperature, he can call his patient and ask him to return to the hospital immediately to do all checks. SHAHANI: And over at Beddit, founder Lasse Leppakorpi shows me sensors you can put under your bed sheet. LASSE LEPPAKORPI: It automatically during the night analyzes your sleep quality, your heart rate, your breathing. And then it sends the information using Bluetooth to your mobile device. SHAHANI: This all feels very, very intimate. So I ask: How do you handle security? LEPPAKORPI: For the data? SHAHANI: Yes. LEPPAKORPI: So what kind of security you will need with your own sleep and wellness data, which is stored in your own mobile device? MARK ORLANDO: I think we've all seen how secure mobile devices can be, which is to say not very secure. SHAHANI: Mark Orlando is a cyber-expert with Foreground Security. And he's seeing a lot of start-ups jump into health and fitness; hire all the right engineers and coders. But he says these companies are not hiring a single data security expert or outside auditor. ORLANDO: It's their product that's collecting and aggregating this data. So, you know, I think that they need to take responsibility, as opposed to kind of shifting the risk onto, say, a mobile phone manufacturer or, you know, an e-mail provider. SHAHANI: There's a real spread in what companies can do and are doing to protect health data. Some encrypt it before it leaves the device and re-encrypt on the Cloud. So even if it's stolen, it's useless. Others don't ever encrypt. And many investors don't ask. Listen to this candid confession from a leading venture capitalist Ping Li, who was talking at a Silicon Valley conference last October. He says that he pushes his startups to make a great product first, security comes later. PING LI: I think you should push it earlier. But it's so hard to know when a startup becomes interesting enough to get attacked. And sometimes it's a weird thing. You get attacked and we made it - we finally are, you know, we finally are worthy of getting hacked.

I'm Scott Simon. The biggest show in Vegas this week wasn't Celine Dion or DJ Afrojack. It was the Consumer Electronics Show. The annual show where buyers, journalists and consumers get a first look at new tech products that are about to hit the market. Snoop Dogg was there, Secretary of Commerce Pritzker was there. And so was NPR's Steve Henn, who joined us as the show was packing up, from the floor of the Consumer Electronic Show on Friday. Steve, thanks so much for being with us. STEVE HENN, BYLINE: Oh, my pleasure. SIMON: Twenty thousand new products there? HENN: Yes, 20,000 new products were unveiled. There were hundreds of thousands of products. You know, the show took up more than two million square feet of space. It filled the Las Vegas Convention Center and spilled over into four hotels. It's just - it's enormous. SIMON: I gather they're connecting everything to the Internet these days. What I read, onesies for babies. . . HENN: Right. SIMON: . . . and toothbrushes. I'm very envious because that I don't have one yet. Why would you connect a toothbrush to the Internet? HENN: This actually was designed by a father who was wondering whether or not his kids were actually brushing their teeth when they said they were. But he's hopeful that an Internet-connected toothbrush will also give people a little bit of data about how well they're brushing their teeth and could actually allow folks to brush better over time. So, there's a real interest in this idea that we can collect data about every aspect of our lives and optimize it. SIMON: And why is the onesie connected to the Internet? HENN: So, it has a variety of sensors in it. One that monitors breathing, so it can send an alert to your cell phone if you're child were to stop breathing. They're connecting this onesie to a bottle warmer so the onesie can sense when your baby wakes up and turn on the bottle warmer so when you go in to pick up your baby and it's their feeding time, the milk or the formula is ready for them. SIMON: So, this opiates the need for a baby to scream, is what you're suggesting. (LAUGHTER)HENN: Right, exactly. SIMON: And technology is becoming wearable? HENN: Right. You know, many sensor are getting smaller. The ability to connect to the Net is now embedded in chips that are just tiny and can be built into things like clothing. And this is really allowing technology companies to get data about us that is really very, very intimate. And that raises a number of questions about privacy and the security of that data, and then how these companies are going to use it in the future. Really, almost anything about your life could be monitored by the technologies that were unveiled here. SIMON: We mentioned about 20,000 new products. Just based on your experience in the industry, Steve, two years from now will we be talking about, what, a dozen of them that survive the cut? HENN: I think that would be perhaps a bit optimistic. But what I think we will be talking about are some of the technologies that those products touched on. I mean, for example, one that I think is going to really change the way we interact with computers and smartphones and the world in the coming years will be the ability to map our surroundings in three dimensions. There are sensors now that can clip onto a tablet that allow you to scan your room and create a perfect model of that. And I think that technology will actually form the basis of computing to sort of extend in new ways into our world that will probably change the way we live.

That means he sees only in shades of black and white. But a sensor attached to his head has expanded his world by translating colors into sound frequencies. And for this reason, Mr. Harbisson considers himself to be a cyborg. Neil Harbisson joins us now from the studios of the BBC in London. Thanks so much for being with us. NEIL HARBISSON: Thank you. SIMON: Why do you consider yourself a cyborg and not just a guy who wears a device? HARBISSON: Well, at the beginning, I felt that I was wearing a device but slowly the software started to feel more and more as an extension of my senses. And there was a point where I couldn't differentiate the software from my brain. I started to dream in color so my brain was reproducing the sound of the software. And I started to feel that the antenna was no longer a device that I was wearing but a part of my body. SIMON: Well, let me get you to explain that device, if you could. This is something that's actually been implanted. HARBISSON: Yes. So, first of all, in 2004, this was attached to my head, so it was a camera and headphones and a computer that I was wearing 24 hours a day and the antenna was attached on the surface of my head. Then I started to use a pressure to my bones so that I could hear colors through bone conduction. And then a couple of months ago, this was actually drilled inside the bone. SIMON: So, how has hearing color affected your life? HARBISSON: Well, it's changed many, many things - color's absolutely everywhere. So, wherever I look there's music now. Going to the museum now, I can listen to an Andy Warhol, I can listen to a Picasso. And when I listen to music, it happens the other way around. I feel color, so it's changed the way they perceive not only (unintelligible). So, daily places, such as supermarkets, 'cause there's many, many colors there. SIMON: Mr. Harbisson, you co-founded the Cyborg Foundation. What do you do and what do you mean when you list one of the goals of the organization to defend cyborg rights? HARBISSON: Well, now, cyborgs are a minority group. There are no laws defending the right to use technology as a part of the body. And then we want to defend the right of anyone who feels their right of wearing technology as part of the body has been in danger. In cases like not being allowed into a shop, for example, or not being allowed in a cinema, 'cause they think that they might be doing something illegal, or just the simple fact of being able to appear on your passport photo with your cybernetic extension if it appears on your head. SIMON: Now, I gather you can now appear that way on your passport photo? HARBISSON: Yes, but it took quite a long time to convince them that I felt that this was a part of my body and it should be allowed on the passport photo. SIMON: I don't want to anticipate a lot of arguments that may or may not be made or that may or may not amount to anything, but where do you draw the line between someone like you who feels that they need that device to participate fully in the world and, you know, and some guy who never takes the ear buds out of his ears? HARBISSON: I think it's, there's a difference between wearing technology and feeling that you are technology. That's, I think, the difference. SIMON: I mean, on the one hand, if it helps people who can't walk walk or people, for example, like you who have some sort of visual impairment, if it helps them see the world more fully. But isn't there a concern - and maybe science fiction films fuel some of this too - that we would be on the verge of inventing some kind of super-strong human beings with, you know, arms as strong as machine pistons that could do ill in the world? HARBISSON: Well, I think we should all have this wish to extend our senses and our perception 'cause I personally am comparing myself with other animal species and perceiving sound through bone conduction, which is what I have now. It's also very normal in nature. There's dolphins that can perceive through bone conduction, having an antenna attached to the head is something many animals have. So, I think that we can learn a lot from other senses that already exist in nature and we can apply them to humans. SIMON: And does that make us human beings with some enhanced component parts or does it make us robots with some human parts? HARBISSON: I think it makes us human. I think this is something extremely human, to create technology and then apply it to ourselves is something only humans can do so. I feel much more human now that I have technology in me. SIMON: Neil Harbisson is an artist and co-founder of the Cyborg Foundation. Thanks very much for being with us, sir. HARBISSON: Thank you.

(SOUNDBITE OF THEME MUSIC)CORNISH: The party is over at the Consumer Electronics Show, the electronics industry's annual mega-gathering. Cleanup at the Las Vegas Convention Center is well underway. Now, observers noted the absence of Microsoft, which for years had a major presence. And there was talk about who will replace Microsoft's outgoing CEO, Steve Ballmer. In an interview, Alan Mulally, CEO of Ford Motor Company, said he will not take the job, as had been rumored. David Linthicum blogs for InfoWorld and joins us to talk about Microsoft. Hi there, David. DAVID LINTHICUM: Hey. CORNISH: So let's talk about Microsoft's absence at CES. It's not the first time so how big a deal was it? LINTHICUM: Wasn't a big deal because I think that a lot of companies, Apple included, have found that there is diminished value in going to CES - which has largely become kind of an innovative, consumer oriented, electronics show. The, you know, laptop, the tablet computer market, the phone market just moves too quickly to just catch up one time a year. CORNISH: And then this other issue in the news, the CEO of Ford Motor Company deciding not to go to Microsoft. Can you talk a little bit about why people thought he'd be such a good candidate? LINTHICUM: Well, Microsoft needs some new leadership obviously. They've gone off course on a few things and their revenues are down, and they're not as innovative and creative as they were in the past. And so, people have been looking for a new leader to come in there and take the company off in a different direction. And the CEO of Ford, obviously a very polished - more what you think of in terms of what a CEO is. So him not taking the job really means that it's going back out to more people that are more like Steve Ballmer and more like Bill Gates, which. . . CORNISH: Meaning programmers or. . . LINTHICUM: Meaning people who are technology people; people who understand their own systems and really aren't polished CEOs. CORNISH: So let's talk a little bit more about the technology. What are the key things that a new CEO is going to need to focus on? And in this, I want to get a sense of how things have been going for Microsoft, especially on the consumer electronics side. LINTHICUM: Well, they've had some successes but mostly it's been fairly underwhelming. So, you know, you can certainly point to the success of the Xbox. And that is certainly a huge consumer product that's very popular out there, almost a religious following. However, in the tablet computing space, in the operating system space, in the phone space, they haven't been making the splash I think they thought they would make. And they've been missing a lot of the creative and innovative aspects that Microsoft has really kind of dominated at in the past. And they've become kind of a fast follower in the space. And so they wait to see, you know, who's going to be innovative in that area and try to get in there and compete with them. And while that used to work maybe 15, 20 years ago, it doesn't work now. CORNISH: So at this point, but when do people expect to hear some sort of announcement about a new CEO? LINTHICUM: I'd say it's probably going to be within the next 30 days. It has to happen sooner rather than later because, typically, the new CEO is going to set the direction. He's going to bring in his own set of innovators and leaders, and start moving the company in new areas and new spaces. And that needs to occur now in order to have any kind of impact within the next year. CORNISH: David Linthicum, he's the senior vice president of Cloud Technology Partners and a blogger for InfoWord.

What are the key things that a new CEO is going to need to focus on? And in this, I want to get a sense of how things have been going for Microsoft, especially on the consumer electronics side. LINTHICUM: Well, they've had some successes but mostly it's been fairly underwhelming. So, you know, you can certainly point to the success of the Xbox. And that is certainly a huge consumer product that's very popular out there, almost a religious following. However, in the tablet computing space, in the operating system space, in the phone space, they haven't been making the splash I think they thought they would make. And they've been missing a lot of the creative and innovative aspects that Microsoft has really kind of dominated at in the past. And they've become kind of a fast follower in the space. And so they wait to see, you know, who's going to be innovative in that area and try to get in there and compete with them. And while that used to work maybe 15, 20 years ago, it doesn't work now. CORNISH: So at this point, but when do people expect to hear some sort of announcement about a new CEO? LINTHICUM: I'd say it's probably going to be within the next 30 days. It has to happen sooner rather than later because, typically, the new CEO is going to set the direction. He's going to bring in his own set of innovators and leaders, and start moving the company in new areas and new spaces. And that needs to occur now in order to have any kind of impact within the next year. CORNISH: David Linthicum, he's the senior vice president of Cloud Technology Partners and a blogger for InfoWord. Thanks so much for talking with us. LINTHICUM: Thank you very much.", "section": "Technology", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2014 NPR.  All rights reserved.

I'm Audie Cornish. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: And I'm Melissa Block. This week, there's a swirl of conversation and a hefty dose of outrage across Twitter, Facebook and the Web, all springing from the tweets of a woman named Lisa Bonchek Adams who describes herself on Twitter as: Living with stage 4 breast cancer, writing about it, mom to three, doing as much as I can for as long as I can. Her open detailed conversation about living with cancer led to a column in The Guardian by Emma Gilbey Keller who mused: Should there be boundaries in this kind of experience? Are her tweets a grim equivalent of deathbed selfies? Then, Emma Keller's husband, Bill Keller, the New York Times former executive editor weighed in. In an op-ed in the Times, he critiqued Lisa Adams for what he called her fierce and very public cage fight with death. A battlefield strategy, he said, that may raise false hopes. There is something enviable, Keller wrote, about going gently. Well, Meaghan O'Rourke is one of many who are writing about this debate and the larger questions it's raised. Her piece for the New Yorker is titled \"Tweeting Cancer. \" Meaghan, welcome to the program. MEAGHAN O'ROURKE: Thanks for having me. BLOCK: You write in that piece for the New Yorker that both Emma and Bill Keller's columns are tone deaf. Those are your words. What do you mean by that? O'ROURKE: I attempt to give them the benefit of the doubt in that I think that both columns probably, in the minds of the writers, were trying to raise complicated questions and to air them and not to shut conversation down. But, unfortunately, I think that the way each column went about doing that felt insensitive at best. And, you know, while raising explicit questions and comparisons about models of death, you know, Keller compared Lisa Adams' long struggle to his father-in-law's, what he called, calm death from cancer. You know, in explicitly raising these comparisons, they were implicitly suggesting that the calm death was the superior way to die and it seemed like a rather ad hominem way to have that discussion. BLOCK: Why do you think this story has touched such a nerve, has triggered so many comments and so much anger? O'ROURKE: I think that today, and this is something I've written a lot about, we're in a very complicated place with grieving and with death. And, you know, one of the things we saw in the 20th century was a kind of privatization of grief and death. You know, death became something that took place in the hospital. People lived longer, so it was less likely that, you know, you grew up having several siblings that died. We became a more secular society. All of these things served to make death a much more uncomfortable subject for us. And one of the things that I found sadly lacking in both of the Kellers' pieces despite, you know, what their intentions might have been was some historical context. Because while it may seem very strange and novel to us that a person who is gravely ill might be tweeting about her illness, in fact, in some ways, you know, death has long had a public side. And grief has long had a public side. You know, for many years, we saw kind of public deathbeds, you know, where the town would kind of come to your bedside to watch you die in the hopes of witnessing this grave change and learning something about their own lives. You know, it's something Emily Dickenson wrote about in the 19th century. So in a way, I see this as a kind of contemporary version of that and I see some of the incredible debates surrounding this as a kind of yearning for finding a way for death to be more part of our lives. But also, you know, people find it strange that in the kind of - in the midst of banality and superficiality that can be Facebook and Twitter, you know, you suddenly have these very profound intense tweets or Facebook posts. And a lot of people, and I think the Kellers included, you know, found that kind of jarring. I would argue that that's actually kind of possibly a youthful corrective to what can be the more superficial aspects of those, you know, media. BLOCK: One of the things Bill Keller wrote in his op-ed was: Social media have become a kind of self-medication for Lisa Adams, which made me wonder, you know, is there anything wrong with that really? What's the problem there? O'ROURKE: Yeah. I, first of all, think there would be nothing wrong with it and also I think that that's a very narrow view of what Lisa Adams is doing. I mean, I think part of her mission explicitly is also to educate and to bring awareness into what is often a veiled experience. And that's probably something I feel really sympathetic toward, probably because I wrote a book about grief that, in some ways, was trying to do something similar, which is to say, you know, what does grief really look like? We are very - it's all around us, but we don't understand it well. And, you know, something that also, I felt, was lacking from those pieces was the larger consideration of the fact that more than ever, we die of prolonged terminal illnesses. You know, the New England Journal of Medicine released a study last summer of 2012 that showed that, you know, over the past hundred years, our top 10 causes of death really have gone from being fairly speedy killers to pretty slow killers. BLOCK: Your memoir which is titled \"The Long Goodbye\" is about the death of your mother and how we grieve today. I imagine that does shape - your experience with that does shape how you view this discussion and this whole conversation we're having about these columns. O'ROURKE: You know, I have to say, and I imagine a lot of listeners feel this way, I have really complicated feelings about it. And it, you know, and watching my mother really suffer through some chemotherapy made me think maybe I wouldn't do that myself. But on the other hand, you know, she was somebody who was diagnosed with metastatic cancer that had metastasized to, you know, multiple organs, which is a very grim prognosis. She was 52 and she elected to have, you know, what her doctor called industrial strength chemo. And it was impossibly hard to watch her go through it, but she went into total remission for a little more than a year. And that was a year that, I think, we three children of hers and her husband counted as a really important year. So, you know, part of the difficulty, and this is a profound difficulty that we all have in sort of thinking about these questions, is we never know if that gamble to pursue treatment is going to pay off. And I would've loved to see more nuance in the raising of this discussion because it's not like it's either a calm death or this, like, burn the barns to the ground, you know, horrible battle. I mean, there's a lot of middle ground in there. And, in fact, I think Adams herself was in remission for many years and her kids were only metastasized a little more than a year ago. BLOCK: Lisa Adams has also responded to this by saying: Tweeting suffering is not what I do. She says, she's as much about talking about persevering and finding beauty in the world around you. O'ROURKE: It's kind of a full-time job to be a patient and to be the family of a patient member. And a lot of what she writes about is, like, what is it like to have to incorporate this into your life, like what is it like to wait for tests? What is it like to, you know, deal with visitors in your hospital room? These are kind of pragmatic questions, too. It's not just like, oh, I suffer, you know, or I fall upon the thorns of life. Or, you know, and she does write a lot about beauty and there's a lot about kind of the every day. But there's also just a lot of really pragmatic, helpful information for cancer patients and their families. BLOCK: Meaghan O'Rourke, her piece for the New Yorker is titled \"Tweeting Cancer. \" Her memoir is \"The Long Goodbye. \" Meaghan O'Rourke, thanks so much. O'ROURKE: Thanks so much for having me.

Singer, Author Of 'Cybersecurity And Cyberwar' : NPR", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2014/01/14/262387292/what-everyone-needs-to-know-about-todays-cyberthreats", "author": "No author found", "published_date": "2014-01-14", "content": "TERRY GROSS, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Even if cybersecurity isn't a subject you think about a lot, the data breach of credit card information from Target and Neiman Marcus customers has probably increased your level of cyber-anxiety. My guest, P. W. Singer, is the co-author of the new book \"Cybersecurity and Cyberwar: What Everyone Needs to Know. \"It's about issues that face the military, government, businesses and individuals, and the decisions facing us when trying to balance security with freedom of speech and the ideals of an open Internet. Singer is the director of the 21st Century Defense Initiative at the Brookings Institution. He's the author of previous books about private military contractors, child soldiers, and how advances in robotics are changing war. P. W. Singer, welcome to FRESH AIR. Let's start with the Target security breach, which was followed by the Neiman Marcus security breach. And at Target, I know they not only got credit card numbers, that included the code verification value, that three-number code on the back of the card that you're often asked for when you're paying for something by phone. And they got other personal data. What do those breaches signify in the world of cybersecurity? P. W. SINGER: There are certain things that jump out to me about these incidents. And look, there'll be more of them. The first is they're good illustrations of how cybersecurity issues affect us all. You know, even if you look at the kind of shopper who is at Target versus the kind of shopper who sends their personal buyer out to Neiman Marcus, they're both being hit here. The second is in terms of the question for these companies, and at least in some of the information that's been following from - whether it's Target or other ones like Snapchat - is that companies may not have been taking security in the cyber realm as seriously as they should and in terms of how they communicate that when incidents happen. There are certain industries that have done quite well because the incentives are really well-aligned, when we think about the banking industry, versus those others, whether it's consumer or the power grid, where they haven't been taking it seriously enough, again, because the incentives aren't there. The third is the lessons for you and I, and in the book we explore at the end, there's a series of fairly simple steps we can take. We overcomplicate this. And one of them is, frankly, don't use the same password for all your different accounts because the fear in these incidents is someone can daisy chain across your accounts. GROSS: So what I heard about Target and the Neiman Marcus breaches, it just made me wonder, like, what is the safest way to pay for something now? Obviously cash, but then you're carrying around a lot of cash with you. But if you're paying with a credit card, do you think it's any safer to pay in the store or by phone or through the Internet? SINGER: You're never ever going to have 100 percent security, and that's true whether I'm talking about you and, you know, buying online for everything from, you know, socks to concert tickets to you name it, to the nation, when we think about our military role. You're never going to have 100 percent security in this space. And so what you have to do is change your mentality to one of resilience, which is basically, you know, whether we're thinking about this in terms of the physical side of resilience, if your body gets cut, it just doesn't give up, it has all sorts of reaction mechanisms, to the psychological side of resilience. If you go through life thinking that nothing bad is ever going to happen to you, well, that's a recipe for disaster. Instead it's how you're going to react to these bad things. And so it's the same - you know, if you're thinking about going into a store and you're saying, OK, but I'm using my credit card in the store, well, that credit card in the store, what is it linked to, all these other digital aspects. What are the kind of questions that they ask you for marketing reasons, your zip code and the like? And so the point here is that you have to understand that if you're going to get the good of the cyberworld, accept that there is some bad that comes along with it. GROSS: OK, so you and everybody is recommending that we vary our passwords and that we change them every so often, so that if somebody breaks into our information, they can't daisy chain and use one password to get into all of our accounts. I don't know anybody who is capable of remembering their passwords. (LAUGHTER)GROSS: And of course you're not supposed to store them on your computer for obvious reasons, because that can be hacked. Where do you store - I mean, what. . . SINGER: Well, it's funny because we're focusing on passwords, as if they're the - you know, assumption that that's the only thing to keep you safe. No, there's a whole series of layers of things that we can do, and they range from, you know, as we were talking about, having strong passwords to often it's not the password itself, it's the secondary questions, having counterintuitive answers for them because, you know, if you're being targeted, in many way it's - they're going after the ability to change your password, to tell the provider, OK, I lost my password, can you send me a new one. And in that case they'll ask you some kind of, you know, question like, well, what's your mother's maiden name, which is easily lookupable online, and they get multiple chances at it. So one of the things we talk about in the book is, you know, give counterintuitive answers to those. So, you know, what's my mother's maiden name? Pizza, which is instead your favorite food. So it's something they'll never, ever be able to look up. But again, any password. . . GROSS: But then you won't be able to remember that. OK, really. (LAUGHTER)SINGER: What I'm getting at - but the bottom line here, and there are some new software products that make this easier. But the bottom line is any password is breakable, or they'll go after it through work-arounds, like in the case of some of these - whether it's department stores that have been targeted, all the way up to aerospace companies to the U. S. military itself. There's other things, very basic things we learned in kindergarten, like don't accept candy from strangers. Well guess what? The most important penetration of secure U. S. military networks by a foreign intelligence agency happened because a soldier found a memory stick that had been - there had been a candy drop is what they call it. It had been left outside enticingly, actually in the parking lot, and the soldier picked up that memory stick and took it into the base and plugged it into their computer, and that's when we had the biggest external penetration of classified U. S. military networks. The main thing, Terry, is for your password, don't make the mistake that is out there. First, what is the most common password today? GROSS: Password. SINGER: Password. What's number two? 123456, which, you know. . . GROSS: Oh, brilliant, OK, yeah. SINGER: Which in the movie \"Spaceballs\" they joked about how that was what we - you know, that's what I use for my luggage. Well, guess what? That's what people are still using for valuable online identities. GROSS: So you refer to this in the book that you should never click on a link unless you know who sent it and never click on a link if it looks suspicious. So, you know, we all know people whose email accounts have been hacked. And so we get emails that appear to be from them because it has their name and email address on it, but it's actually some hacker who hijacked their email address and is sending something else. So I've gotten my share of I'm stranded in England and I don't have any money because somebody also robbed me. Please wire me some money. I've gotten those. And then I've also gotten just a link with no message, just a link from somebody who I know. And I once or twice, I think, actually made the mistake of opening the link because I figured, oh, this is somebody who I really know and trust. Let me see what they wanted me to read. And it opens to some, like, really weird ad, you know, like - just like an ad that looks just like incredibly cheap and schlocky for some like product like no one's ever heard of. And I don't even know if it's a real ad. And so I ask myself, what's the point of that link? Is it to get access to my email, or is it for me to read this ad that no one would read unless there was this link? And if they want my email, what do they want it for? SINGER: In some situations, it may be someone who's trying to get inside your network, either for your personal finance information, or maybe it's because you're part of a large media organization that they want to cause some kind of trouble for. Or in other cases, as you noted, it may not be that kind of crime, it may just be someone trying to steer eyes to, you know, the latest advertisement for men's erectile dysfunction ads or the like, where they're being paid, the criminals in these cases, are being paid by the number of clicks that they draw in. So what I'm getting at here is a bigger problem, and again, it's thinking about it as you as an individual, the company that you're in, to how we think about this as citizens on a national security level. The head of the NSA, who is simultaneously the general in charge of the military Cyber Command, talked about how, and this is in testimony to Congress, that there were, quote, millions of attacks on U. S. military systems every single day. But what he was doing is bundling together the kinds of attacks that you just talked about there, you know, that are everything from, you know, a low-level attempt at fraud, to address scams, to people trying to deface the Pentagon website, to people trying to carry out some kind of political protest, to people actually trying to get inside the network to steal secrets of some sort. Another way of putting this is that we bundle together all sorts of unlike things, unlike actions and unlike people behind those actions, simply because they all involve the zeros and ones of software. We've bundled it all together. And the point of the book is that we have to push beyond that kind of thinking because otherwise we'll be helpless. We'll be helpless in terms of our counter-responses but helpless in how we think about it. GROSS: Your book starts with a senior leader in the Defense Department talking about why he thought cybersecurity and cyberwar were so important, but he was referring to that as all this cyberstuff. What troubled you about that? SINGER: It's that combination of knowing something's important but only being able to call it stuff. (LAUGHTER)SINGER: And that's - that was this moment which, you know, was great from a writer's standpoint for, you know, kicking off a book that tries to explain all this stuff, but it's equally troubling when we think about the ramifications of that. And look, we can't knock him too much. You know, all of us make some kind of cybersecurity decisions that matter, whether, you know, you're at the Pentagon or a large corporation to a small cupcake store to you're a journalist to you're a parent. And yet we're not well-trained. We're not well-equipped for this area right now. To give an illustration from business, more than 70 percent of business executives, not CTOs or CIOs or the like, but business executives in general, 70 percent have made some kind of cybersecurity decision for their company, and yet no major MBA program teaches it as a regular course of management practice. Same thing could describe what's going on at, you know, the schools we teach our diplomats, law schools, journalism schools, you name it. And so this stuff problem is a great illustration of where we're at right now but how far we need to go. GROSS: Yeah, and you describe leaders in government and the military who aren't especially cyber-literate and don't even know how to use their email. SINGER: There's that, but really the anecdotes that are both funny but scare me is the attitude part, the - we call it Ludditism. It's people who are in the positions that truly matter, that can truly move the dial, whether it's in law or agencies or whatever, who unfortunately sometimes are proud of their cyber-ignorance, proud of not using the technology that literally our entire world depends on, you know, whether it's our systems of commerce or communication or conflict. In the book, for example, we use the illustration of the former secretary of Homeland Security, you know, the civilian agency ostensibly in charge of cybersecurity in the United States, and she proudly talked about how she didn't use email and in fact had not used social media for over a decade, not because she didn't think it was secure, because she just didn't think it was useful. Or, you know, go to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court is going to decide all sorts of legal issues in this realm, from, you know, privacy questions to what's legal or not at the NSA, a case that's probably going to come up in - certainly within the next year. And in the words of one justice there, they, quote, haven't yet gotten around to email, haven't yet gotten around to it. I mean, this is a bad place to be. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is P. W. Singer. He's the author of the new book \"Cybersecurity and Cyberwar: What Everyone Needs to Know. \" And he's also the director of the 21st century security and intelligence at the Brookings Institution. Let's take a short break and then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is P. W. Singer. He's the author of the new book \"Cybersecurity and Cyberwar: What Everyone Needs to Know. \" He's also the director of the 21st-century security and intelligence at the Brookings Institution. Let's look at the - you know, WikiLeaks and at Edward Snowden. Do you think that those leaks should never have happened? And I don't mean to judge the quality of the information or whether it's good that the public knows that information or not. I just mean from the perspective of government agencies. What kind of security do you think would have prevented WikiLeaks and Edward Snowden? SINGER: What's funny about it is they're the actual types of security that these agencies were supposed to be following but just hadn't gotten around to it yet, to go back to that Supreme Court example. So it's things like not sharing passwords across, not allowing an individual in one position to have free rein over information all across the entire organization, even if it was not in their personal responsibility areas, to trying to monitor what's happening inside your networks, not just what's happening outside your networks so you're seeing anomalies like, you know, massive amounts of information being collected or going out to, in the case of Manning, not allowing certain kinds of hardware in that shouldn't happen in. You know, he joked that he downloaded all the classified information on all sorts of operations from Iraq to Afghanistan to the like on a CD that was labeled Lady Gaga. I mean, you know - again these are huge incidents in cybersecurity, cyberwar history with a huge amount of resonance, but they're also lessons for how very basic steps can go a long way in preventing these sort of things from happening. GROSS: You write that China is considered the most threatening actor in cyberspace. So what exactly is China doing? It's stealing patents and designs? SINGER: It's stealing designs for things that are of, you know, clear national security importance like the design of a jet fighter. There's an advanced jet fighter that we're - we've been research and developing, and we're now in the midst of building, the Joint Strike Fighter. It's a trillion-dollar program. And that program has been hacked multiple times. In fact in one situation it was actually hacked while the plane was in midair. They were downloading information off it that way. So how do you measure the loss there? Do you measure it in terms of the literally billions of dollars of research and development that we paid for that they got for free? Or do you measure it in terms of the 10 to 20 years that we were supposed to be ahead of them that we're not going to be? We're already seeing design elements of that popping up in their new jet fighter systems. Do you think about that in terms of the national security impact on the battlefield, how you thought you would be ahead of them in having a military advantage that you're not going to have anymore? Do you think about it on the trade market? There's lots of different ways to weigh it. But that's not the only thing that's being stolen. We've seen examples of companies that were engaged in some kind of negotiation, for example an oil company that was preparing a bid, and lo and behold their counterpart would come in with a bid just slightly above what they were going to do after they got inside their networks. So they didn't steal a secret like a patent, but they stole a secret that, again, could be worth ultimately billions, or if you're talking about oil companies, it can be tens or hundreds of billions, to national security in terms of tapping into diplomatic messages to - look, in the book we talk about Operation Shady Rat. It was this massive advanced persistent threat campaign, what they call an APT campaign, where it got into everything from international agencies that range from diplomatic ones to the International Olympics Committee to national government agencies all around the world, not just the United States but in Germany, France, Japan, you name it, to corporations, again, that ranged from, you know, oil companies to banks, you name it, to academic institutions, even my own institution. And again, the information ranged from things that you can measure in monetary value to they scooped up the personal cell phones of White House staff that people had inside their messages, huge effort here. GROSS: Are we talking about the government of China doing this or individuals in China doing this? SINGER: Therein lies the challenge of this because you have this massive scale of operations. In some situations it's very clearly direct government linked. In the book, for example, we explore the attack that happened on the New York Times that again, you know, the information that they were going after was not, you know, what the New York Times was going to charge for its newspapers next year. They were actually trying to find out who was speaking to New York Times reporters about corruption involving certain key Chinese government leaders and their families. That was what they were going after. But in that case it was tracked back to Chinese military agency. In other situations it's what you would describe as the patriotic hacker community, where they're not officially government, but they're government-linked in a certain way. And then you have the more distinct criminal aspect. GROSS: Now but you also write China suffers the largest number of cyberattacks in the world. So if China is responsible for initiating a lot of cyberattack, how is it also suffering the largest number of cyberattacks? SINGER: In many ways it's a problem of their own making. It's an issue of they're a greater market for hardware than they are of software. To put it more directly, they use a massive amount of pirated software. So they're not getting all the security updates for it. One top of that, they're not the only ones emanating attacks. Whether you're thinking about the low-level criminal versions - for example right now Indonesia is at the top, not China, to the United States. If we look at ISPs, Internet service providers, of the top 50 cybercrime-spewing ones, the ones that have the most cybercrime coming out of them, 20 are American. GROSS: P. W. Singer will be back in the second half of the show. He's the co-author of the new book \"Cybersecurity and Cyberwar: What Everyone Needs to Know. \" I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross back with P. W. Singer, co-author of the new book \"Cybersecurity and Cyberwar: What Everyone Needs to Know. \" It's about cyber threats facing individuals, businesses and nations. Singer is the director of the 21st Century Defense Initiative at the Brookings Institution, and the author of previous books about private military contractors, child soldiers and how robotics is changing war. There are laws of war which are often violated but, you know, we do have the Geneva Accords. Is there any equivalent for cyberwar? And if not, is there talk of having something? SINGER: This is a huge area for the future of war, but also the future of international law. And there's some interesting historic parallels to this where, you know, in the past we receive new technologies that had been science fiction, like the fly machine, that allowed us to fight in new places, but they also showed the inadequacy of the existing laws of war and understandings of them. You know, so if you think about the airplane, our notions of what the home front was fundamentally changed by your ability to now attack behind the battle lines. And so some people have pushed the idea that we should create an entire new set of laws for it, new cyber Geneva conventions. It's a worthy idea, but we're also trying to come out of this in a realistic manner. And rather, what we look at is the notion of grafting. For people who study international relations, grafting, building on to something that works rather than to try and write an entire new law, has been far more successful historically. And so that's what we're looking at is the idea of can you graft onto the existing laws of war, take the values from them in terms of protecting civilians, trying to have a weapon that goes after its intended target, doesn't have collateral damage, all these sorts of things to - most importantly - the idea of accountability, that it's always traceable back, that people are taking ownership of what they send out. Those are the kind of values that we want to try and have in this space. GROSS: Yes. Well, one of the problems right now in the cyber world is it's sometimes hard to know who originated the attack. Because you can launch the attack through bots, through other computers, it's sometimes hard for a government to say this government attacked us. SINGER: Exactly. There's not the very clear and definable, you know, smoke plume coming out of the missile. And that's why when you hear these people using Cold War parallels of cyber deterrence, they fall by the wayside - even how we do, thread assessment. But it's not just the idea of the detection part of it, it's also how you respond - or maybe rather when you respond - is changed by this. You know, back in the Cold War, the idea was that you had to, if someone was launching a missile at you, you got to get your missiles off the ground immediately before their missile hits you. Well, that's impossible in this space when you're talking about things literally moving at, you know, the speed of light across a fiber-optic. But it also may not be good strategy. You may want to watch an attack play out inside your system, so you're understanding it, so you're able to do those kind of attributions. You may not always want to let the other side know that you know that they're attacking you. Your response, maybe you want to hit them back immediately, or maybe you want to let it settle a while and design something to go effective after them. And this is another part of it in terms of how we talk about cyber offense. There's this notion that it's incredibly easy. But if we look at examples like Stuxnet, which was this weapon that we used to go after the Iranian nuclear research, it takes a massive amount of research and time and collective effort to build a truly impactful cyber weapon. And so, again, the timelines are different from how they're described. GROSS: Is there any national or international body now whose job is to protect the security of cyberspace from state actors and from criminals? SINGER: It's a huge important question because how this plays out will shape the future of the Internet itself. There's been a push for the ITU - actually, it was originally the International Telegraph Union - it was originally created for the telegraph - there's been a push for this international group now to take over the governance of the Internet because of these kinds of security concerns. That's been the narrative that's been pushed. Now notably, that's been pushed by mostly authoritarian states, like the Russias and Chinas of the world. And they're using the cyber insecurity that's out there and the narrative over these kind of attacks. But their concern is a different kind of information attack. It's not in the West how we think about it of threats to infrastructure or the like, they're worried about a different kind of Wild West - open values, the free flow of information that might be threatening to their internal stability. And so what they're pushing for is a move away from the current Internet model of multi-stakeholder to states should be able to have this kind of control and build up walls, Balkanize the Internet, the Russian model of blacklisting over 82,000 websites. Where I come down on this is that we're all players on the Internet. And my concern in the year ahead is - and there's some major negotiations that are going to happen over this in the year ahead. And of note, because of the NSA's disclosures, the U. S. has lost a little bit of its swagger. We've also of concern, maybe lost some of our coalition partners on this, the swing states, like the Brazils, the Indias, the Germanys. And my concern is if we don't watch out, the Internet that's been so great for you and I is not going to be the ones that we give to our kids. GROSS: Would you elaborate on that concern? SINGER: The Internet started by two California universities connecting to each other. And it has been run, so to speak, with this underlying ethic that, you know, frankly comes out of, you know, 1970s California hippies. It's about sharing. It's about free flow of information. It's about openness. There's a huge amount of informality that's actually been incredibly effective. So, for example, some of the key decisions about certain technical standards are made by groups of people that voluntarily come together and they vote by humming. It sounds insane and yet it works. You now have pushing against this states saying we should be in charge of this. And, of course, states bring, in particular when you're talking about authoritarian states, a very different goal. And so I'm worried - and again, you can think about this in terms of the push by authoritarian states, like your Russias and Chinas of the world, and then the flip side, some of what's come out of the NSA disclosures about monitoring of a different kind of information. And so you've seen states start to - we're not there yet, but the ripple effects have been to, you know, almost poison the well. GROSS: You know, talking about cyber security, some of the security has been handled just by freelancers, you know, individuals on the Internet. And I want you to tell the story of Brian Krebs and what he exposed. SINGER: It's a great illustration of the power of individuals on the Internet. And Brian Krebs is this technical expert - a blogger - who also works for The Washington Post. And he got curious about not the individual cyber criminals, but the networks that they were using, the institutions, the markets and the like, and he dug a little and found that in fact, one key hub was responsible for this massive amount of cyber crime. And he contacted the organization and those that it was linking to and said hey, did you know this? And some did and now that they were, you know, notified by someone from The Washington Post, they took action; others didn't and said, wow, that's important to us. And so that hub, its activities got stopped. And low and behold, for a short period of time, 80 percent of all cyber crime on the Internet disappeared all because they went after this one hub. And it's a great illustration of how it's all a network. We're not just talking about a computer network, it's a network of people and relationships and that you can take real action if you mobilize them in a way that their underlying incentives are effective. And so in this situation it was the fact that he had the combination of technical expertise, but he also had this media side where the companies involved didn't want to be embarrassed and so they finally took action. GROSS: You write about something called The Internet of Things. What is meant by that? SINGER: The Internet of Things is one of the most important nutrients for the Internet itself, but also for you and I outside the Internet and, of course, cybersecurity and cyberwar impacts of it. So if you think about the way we use the Internet, our Internet-enabled devices, it's mainly been about communication between you and I, you know, me emailing you from my computer to your iPhone or the like. And that iPhone is a good illustration of one of the other trends that's out there, you know, becoming more and more mobile. But so basically, it's been about us having conversations of some sort, us sharing information online in some way shape or form. Cisco estimates that over the next five years, we'll see the number of Internet-enabled, Internet-linked devices go to as much as 40 billion. And what that means, as you see everything from refrigerators to cars to gadgets that no one's even dreamed up yet, all being linked up, it's no longer about you and I having conversations, it's about the things having conversations among them. And so that's when in The Internet of Things it really truly starts to change the real world. So we're already seeing little micro-examples of it. Like, for example, if you've bought a new car recently, when it detects that the brake pads are about to wear out, it'll automatically notify the manufacturer, who will automatically make you an appointment at the car dealership. The next step on this will be to link outside those networks, so your car, as its driving home, it will notify your smart thermostat that you're 10 minutes out. And the smart thermostat that's linked to a smart power grid, you know, it's been on an environmentally-efficient temperature in your house and now it's going to change it to the temperature that you just like for the time that you're there. All these great powerful impacts of The Internet of Things, but, of course it also comes with cyber threat consequences of a next level. We've already as an illustration seen car hacking. You know, not just stealing information from your car - where are you, with the GPS and the like - but now taking over certain actions of your car that is causing the car to do things contrary than what the driver of the car wants. And so it's a huge change in all our online life, but also our life in the real world. GROSS: What kind of precautions do you take in your personal life? SINGER: I try and practice what I preach. And in the book it goes through all of these things from, you know, password protocols to I can't tell you the number of conferences that I've gone to where you get this wonderful, really cool, you know, memory stick with the logo of you - the conference. Or recently it was a foreign government and they gave the silver memory stick; oh, isn't it beautiful? Isn't it wonderful? Sorry, going to toss that in the trash, it's not going into any of my networks. But look, there's another part of it which is understanding that everything that you do, it still is never going to give you 100 percent security. So if you can't bear to lose it, prepare to lose it. It's true whether you're talking about access for your power grid or your jetfighter designs to those pictures of your kids that you have saved online - prepare to back them up because you might lose them. GROSS: I want to thank you so much for talking with us. SINGER: Thank you for having me. GROSS: P. W. Singer is the co-author of the new book \"Cybersecurity and Cyberwar: What Everyone Needs to Know. \" You can read the introduction to the book on our website freshair. npr. org. Coming up, Maureen Corrigan reviews Chang-rae Lee's new dystopian novel. This is FRESH AIR. TERRY GROSS, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Even if cybersecurity isn't a subject you think about a lot, the data breach of credit card information from Target and Neiman Marcus customers has probably increased your level of cyber-anxiety. My guest, P. W. Singer, is the co-author of the new book \"Cybersecurity and Cyberwar: What Everyone Needs to Know. \" It's about issues that face the military, government, businesses and individuals, and the decisions facing us when trying to balance security with freedom of speech and the ideals of an open Internet. Singer is the director of the 21st Century Defense Initiative at the Brookings Institution. He's the author of previous books about private military contractors, child soldiers, and how advances in robotics are changing war. P. W. Singer, welcome to FRESH AIR. Let's start with the Target security breach, which was followed by the Neiman Marcus security breach. And at Target, I know they not only got credit card numbers, that included the code verification value, that three-number code on the back of the card that you're often asked for when you're paying for something by phone. And they got other personal data. What do those breaches signify in the world of cybersecurity? P. W. SINGER: There are certain things that jump out to me about these incidents. And look, there'll be more of them. The first is they're good illustrations of how cybersecurity issues affect us all. You know, even if you look at the kind of shopper who is at Target versus the kind of shopper who sends their personal buyer out to Neiman Marcus, they're both being hit here. The second is in terms of the question for these companies, and at least in some of the information that's been following from - whether it's Target or other ones like Snapchat - is that companies may not have been taking security in the cyber realm as seriously as they should and in terms of how they communicate that when incidents happen. There are certain industries that have done quite well because the incentives are really well-aligned, when we think about the banking industry, versus those others, whether it's consumer or the power grid, where they haven't been taking it seriously enough, again, because the incentives aren't there. The third is the lessons for you and I, and in the book we explore at the end, there's a series of fairly simple steps we can take. We overcomplicate this. And one of them is, frankly, don't use the same password for all your different accounts because the fear in these incidents is someone can daisy chain across your accounts. GROSS: So what I heard about Target and the Neiman Marcus breaches, it just made me wonder, like, what is the safest way to pay for something now? Obviously cash, but then you're carrying around a lot of cash with you. But if you're paying with a credit card, do you think it's any safer to pay in the store or by phone or through the Internet? SINGER: You're never ever going to have 100 percent security, and that's true whether I'm talking about you and, you know, buying online for everything from, you know, socks to concert tickets to you name it, to the nation, when we think about our military role. You're never going to have 100 percent security in this space. And so what you have to do is change your mentality to one of resilience, which is basically, you know, whether we're thinking about this in terms of the physical side of resilience, if your body gets cut, it just doesn't give up, it has all sorts of reaction mechanisms, to the psychological side of resilience. If you go through life thinking that nothing bad is ever going to happen to you, well, that's a recipe for disaster. Instead it's how you're going to react to these bad things. And so it's the same - you know, if you're thinking about going into a store and you're saying, OK, but I'm using my credit card in the store, well, that credit card in the store, what is it linked to, all these other digital aspects. What are the kind of questions that they ask you for marketing reasons, your zip code and the like? And so the point here is that you have to understand that if you're going to get the good of the cyberworld, accept that there is some bad that comes along with it. GROSS: OK, so you and everybody is recommending that we vary our passwords and that we change them every so often, so that if somebody breaks into our information, they can't daisy chain and use one password to get into all of our accounts. I don't know anybody who is capable of remembering their passwords. (LAUGHTER) GROSS: And of course you're not supposed to store them on your computer for obvious reasons, because that can be hacked. Where do you store - I mean, what. . . SINGER: Well, it's funny because we're focusing on passwords, as if they're the - you know, assumption that that's the only thing to keep you safe. No, there's a whole series of layers of things that we can do, and they range from, you know, as we were talking about, having strong passwords to often it's not the password itself, it's the secondary questions, having counterintuitive answers for them because, you know, if you're being targeted, in many way it's - they're going after the ability to change your password, to tell the provider, OK, I lost my password, can you send me a new one. And in that case they'll ask you some kind of, you know, question like, well, what's your mother's maiden name, which is easily lookupable online, and they get multiple chances at it. So one of the things we talk about in the book is, you know, give counterintuitive answers to those. So, you know, what's my mother's maiden name? Pizza, which is instead your favorite food. So it's something they'll never, ever be able to look up. But again, any password. . . GROSS: But then you won't be able to remember that. OK, really. (LAUGHTER) SINGER: What I'm getting at - but the bottom line here, and there are some new software products that make this easier. But the bottom line is any password is breakable, or they'll go after it through work-arounds, like in the case of some of these - whether it's department stores that have been targeted, all the way up to aerospace companies to the U. S. military itself. There's other things, very basic things we learned in kindergarten, like don't accept candy from strangers. Well guess what? The most important penetration of secure U. S. military networks by a foreign intelligence agency happened because a soldier found a memory stick that had been - there had been a candy drop is what they call it. It had been left outside enticingly, actually in the parking lot, and the soldier picked up that memory stick and took it into the base and plugged it into their computer, and that's when we had the biggest external penetration of classified U. S. military networks. The main thing, Terry, is for your password, don't make the mistake that is out there. First, what is the most common password today? GROSS: Password. SINGER: Password. What's number two? 123456, which, you know. . . GROSS: Oh, brilliant, OK, yeah. SINGER: Which in the movie \"Spaceballs\" they joked about how that was what we - you know, that's what I use for my luggage. Well, guess what? That's what people are still using for valuable online identities. GROSS: So you refer to this in the book that you should never click on a link unless you know who sent it and never click on a link if it looks suspicious. So, you know, we all know people whose email accounts have been hacked. And so we get emails that appear to be from them because it has their name and email address on it, but it's actually some hacker who hijacked their email address and is sending something else. So I've gotten my share of I'm stranded in England and I don't have any money because somebody also robbed me. Please wire me some money. I've gotten those. And then I've also gotten just a link with no message, just a link from somebody who I know. And I once or twice, I think, actually made the mistake of opening the link because I figured, oh, this is somebody who I really know and trust. Let me see what they wanted me to read. And it opens to some, like, really weird ad, you know, like - just like an ad that looks just like incredibly cheap and schlocky for some like product like no one's ever heard of. And I don't even know if it's a real ad. And so I ask myself, what's the point of that link? Is it to get access to my email, or is it for me to read this ad that no one would read unless there was this link? And if they want my email, what do they want it for? SINGER: In some situations, it may be someone who's trying to get inside your network, either for your personal finance information, or maybe it's because you're part of a large media organization that they want to cause some kind of trouble for. Or in other cases, as you noted, it may not be that kind of crime, it may just be someone trying to steer eyes to, you know, the latest advertisement for men's erectile dysfunction ads or the like, where they're being paid, the criminals in these cases, are being paid by the number of clicks that they draw in. So what I'm getting at here is a bigger problem, and again, it's thinking about it as you as an individual, the company that you're in, to how we think about this as citizens on a national security level. The head of the NSA, who is simultaneously the general in charge of the military Cyber Command, talked about how, and this is in testimony to Congress, that there were, quote, millions of attacks on U. S. military systems every single day. But what he was doing is bundling together the kinds of attacks that you just talked about there, you know, that are everything from, you know, a low-level attempt at fraud, to address scams, to people trying to deface the Pentagon website, to people trying to carry out some kind of political protest, to people actually trying to get inside the network to steal secrets of some sort. Another way of putting this is that we bundle together all sorts of unlike things, unlike actions and unlike people behind those actions, simply because they all involve the zeros and ones of software. We've bundled it all together. And the point of the book is that we have to push beyond that kind of thinking because otherwise we'll be helpless. We'll be helpless in terms of our counter-responses but helpless in how we think about it. GROSS: Your book starts with a senior leader in the Defense Department talking about why he thought cybersecurity and cyberwar were so important, but he was referring to that as all this cyberstuff. What troubled you about that? SINGER: It's that combination of knowing something's important but only being able to call it stuff. (LAUGHTER) SINGER: And that's - that was this moment which, you know, was great from a writer's standpoint for, you know, kicking off a book that tries to explain all this stuff, but it's equally troubling when we think about the ramifications of that. And look, we can't knock him too much. You know, all of us make some kind of cybersecurity decisions that matter, whether, you know, you're at the Pentagon or a large corporation to a small cupcake store to you're a journalist to you're a parent. And yet we're not well-trained. We're not well-equipped for this area right now. To give an illustration from business, more than 70 percent of business executives, not CTOs or CIOs or the like, but business executives in general, 70 percent have made some kind of cybersecurity decision for their company, and yet no major MBA program teaches it as a regular course of management practice. Same thing could describe what's going on at, you know, the schools we teach our diplomats, law schools, journalism schools, you name it. And so this stuff problem is a great illustration of where we're at right now but how far we need to go. GROSS: Yeah, and you describe leaders in government and the military who aren't especially cyber-literate and don't even know how to use their email. SINGER: There's that, but really the anecdotes that are both funny but scare me is the attitude part, the - we call it Ludditism. It's people who are in the positions that truly matter, that can truly move the dial, whether it's in law or agencies or whatever, who unfortunately sometimes are proud of their cyber-ignorance, proud of not using the technology that literally our entire world depends on, you know, whether it's our systems of commerce or communication or conflict. In the book, for example, we use the illustration of the former secretary of Homeland Security, you know, the civilian agency ostensibly in charge of cybersecurity in the United States, and she proudly talked about how she didn't use email and in fact had not used social media for over a decade, not because she didn't think it was secure, because she just didn't think it was useful. Or, you know, go to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court is going to decide all sorts of legal issues in this realm, from, you know, privacy questions to what's legal or not at the NSA, a case that's probably going to come up in - certainly within the next year. And in the words of one justice there, they, quote, haven't yet gotten around to email, haven't yet gotten around to it. I mean, this is a bad place to be. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is P. W. Singer. He's the author of the new book \"Cybersecurity and Cyberwar: What Everyone Needs to Know. \" And he's also the director of the 21st century security and intelligence at the Brookings Institution. Let's take a short break and then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is P. W. Singer. He's the author of the new book \"Cybersecurity and Cyberwar: What Everyone Needs to Know. \" He's also the director of the 21st-century security and intelligence at the Brookings Institution. Let's look at the - you know, WikiLeaks and at Edward Snowden. Do you think that those leaks should never have happened? And I don't mean to judge the quality of the information or whether it's good that the public knows that information or not. I just mean from the perspective of government agencies. What kind of security do you think would have prevented WikiLeaks and Edward Snowden? SINGER: What's funny about it is they're the actual types of security that these agencies were supposed to be following but just hadn't gotten around to it yet, to go back to that Supreme Court example. So it's things like not sharing passwords across, not allowing an individual in one position to have free rein over information all across the entire organization, even if it was not in their personal responsibility areas, to trying to monitor what's happening inside your networks, not just what's happening outside your networks so you're seeing anomalies like, you know, massive amounts of information being collected or going out to, in the case of Manning, not allowing certain kinds of hardware in that shouldn't happen in. You know, he joked that he downloaded all the classified information on all sorts of operations from Iraq to Afghanistan to the like on a CD that was labeled Lady Gaga. I mean, you know - again these are huge incidents in cybersecurity, cyberwar history with a huge amount of resonance, but they're also lessons for how very basic steps can go a long way in preventing these sort of things from happening. GROSS: You write that China is considered the most threatening actor in cyberspace. So what exactly is China doing? It's stealing patents and designs? SINGER: It's stealing designs for things that are of, you know, clear national security importance like the design of a jet fighter. There's an advanced jet fighter that we're - we've been research and developing, and we're now in the midst of building, the Joint Strike Fighter. It's a trillion-dollar program. And that program has been hacked multiple times. In fact in one situation it was actually hacked while the plane was in midair. They were downloading information off it that way. So how do you measure the loss there? Do you measure it in terms of the literally billions of dollars of research and development that we paid for that they got for free? Or do you measure it in terms of the 10 to 20 years that we were supposed to be ahead of them that we're not going to be? We're already seeing design elements of that popping up in their new jet fighter systems. Do you think about that in terms of the national security impact on the battlefield, how you thought you would be ahead of them in having a military advantage that you're not going to have anymore? Do you think about it on the trade market? There's lots of different ways to weigh it. But that's not the only thing that's being stolen. We've seen examples of companies that were engaged in some kind of negotiation, for example an oil company that was preparing a bid, and lo and behold their counterpart would come in with a bid just slightly above what they were going to do after they got inside their networks. So they didn't steal a secret like a patent, but they stole a secret that, again, could be worth ultimately billions, or if you're talking about oil companies, it can be tens or hundreds of billions, to national security in terms of tapping into diplomatic messages to - look, in the book we talk about Operation Shady Rat. It was this massive advanced persistent threat campaign, what they call an APT campaign, where it got into everything from international agencies that range from diplomatic ones to the International Olympics Committee to national government agencies all around the world, not just the United States but in Germany, France, Japan, you name it, to corporations, again, that ranged from, you know, oil companies to banks, you name it, to academic institutions, even my own institution. And again, the information ranged from things that you can measure in monetary value to they scooped up the personal cell phones of White House staff that people had inside their messages, huge effort here. GROSS: Are we talking about the government of China doing this or individuals in China doing this? SINGER: Therein lies the challenge of this because you have this massive scale of operations. In some situations it's very clearly direct government linked. In the book, for example, we explore the attack that happened on the New York Times that again, you know, the information that they were going after was not, you know, what the New York Times was going to charge for its newspapers next year. They were actually trying to find out who was speaking to New York Times reporters about corruption involving certain key Chinese government leaders and their families. That was what they were going after. But in that case it was tracked back to Chinese military agency. In other situations it's what you would describe as the patriotic hacker community, where they're not officially government, but they're government-linked in a certain way. And then you have the more distinct criminal aspect. GROSS: Now but you also write China suffers the largest number of cyberattacks in the world. So if China is responsible for initiating a lot of cyberattack, how is it also suffering the largest number of cyberattacks? SINGER: In many ways it's a problem of their own making. It's an issue of they're a greater market for hardware than they are of software. To put it more directly, they use a massive amount of pirated software. So they're not getting all the security updates for it. One top of that, they're not the only ones emanating attacks. Whether you're thinking about the low-level criminal versions - for example right now Indonesia is at the top, not China, to the United States. If we look at ISPs, Internet service providers, of the top 50 cybercrime-spewing ones, the ones that have the most cybercrime coming out of them, 20 are American. GROSS: P. W. Singer will be back in the second half of the show. He's the co-author of the new book \"Cybersecurity and Cyberwar: What Everyone Needs to Know. \" I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross back with P. W. Singer, co-author of the new book \"Cybersecurity and Cyberwar: What Everyone Needs to Know. \" It's about cyber threats facing individuals, businesses and nations. Singer is the director of the 21st Century Defense Initiative at the Brookings Institution, and the author of previous books about private military contractors, child soldiers and how robotics is changing war. There are laws of war which are often violated but, you know, we do have the Geneva Accords. Is there any equivalent for cyberwar? And if not, is there talk of having something? SINGER: This is a huge area for the future of war, but also the future of international law. And there's some interesting historic parallels to this where, you know, in the past we receive new technologies that had been science fiction, like the fly machine, that allowed us to fight in new places, but they also showed the inadequacy of the existing laws of war and understandings of them. You know, so if you think about the airplane, our notions of what the home front was fundamentally changed by your ability to now attack behind the battle lines. And so some people have pushed the idea that we should create an entire new set of laws for it, new cyber Geneva conventions. It's a worthy idea, but we're also trying to come out of this in a realistic manner. And rather, what we look at is the notion of grafting. For people who study international relations, grafting, building on to something that works rather than to try and write an entire new law, has been far more successful historically. And so that's what we're looking at is the idea of can you graft onto the existing laws of war, take the values from them in terms of protecting civilians, trying to have a weapon that goes after its intended target, doesn't have collateral damage, all these sorts of things to - most importantly - the idea of accountability, that it's always traceable back, that people are taking ownership of what they send out. Those are the kind of values that we want to try and have in this space. GROSS: Yes. Well, one of the problems right now in the cyber world is it's sometimes hard to know who originated the attack. Because you can launch the attack through bots, through other computers, it's sometimes hard for a government to say this government attacked us. SINGER: Exactly. There's not the very clear and definable, you know, smoke plume coming out of the missile. And that's why when you hear these people using Cold War parallels of cyber deterrence, they fall by the wayside - even how we do, thread assessment. But it's not just the idea of the detection part of it, it's also how you respond - or maybe rather when you respond - is changed by this. You know, back in the Cold War, the idea was that you had to, if someone was launching a missile at you, you got to get your missiles off the ground immediately before their missile hits you. Well, that's impossible in this space when you're talking about things literally moving at, you know, the speed of light across a fiber-optic. But it also may not be good strategy. You may want to watch an attack play out inside your system, so you're understanding it, so you're able to do those kind of attributions. You may not always want to let the other side know that you know that they're attacking you. Your response, maybe you want to hit them back immediately, or maybe you want to let it settle a while and design something to go effective after them. And this is another part of it in terms of how we talk about cyber offense. There's this notion that it's incredibly easy. But if we look at examples like Stuxnet, which was this weapon that we used to go after the Iranian nuclear research, it takes a massive amount of research and time and collective effort to build a truly impactful cyber weapon. And so, again, the timelines are different from how they're described. GROSS: Is there any national or international body now whose job is to protect the security of cyberspace from state actors and from criminals? SINGER: It's a huge important question because how this plays out will shape the future of the Internet itself. There's been a push for the ITU - actually, it was originally the International Telegraph Union - it was originally created for the telegraph - there's been a push for this international group now to take over the governance of the Internet because of these kinds of security concerns. That's been the narrative that's been pushed. Now notably, that's been pushed by mostly authoritarian states, like the Russias and Chinas of the world. And they're using the cyber insecurity that's out there and the narrative over these kind of attacks. But their concern is a different kind of information attack. It's not in the West how we think about it of threats to infrastructure or the like, they're worried about a different kind of Wild West - open values, the free flow of information that might be threatening to their internal stability. And so what they're pushing for is a move away from the current Internet model of multi-stakeholder to states should be able to have this kind of control and build up walls, Balkanize the Internet, the Russian model of blacklisting over 82,000 websites. Where I come down on this is that we're all players on the Internet. And my concern in the year ahead is - and there's some major negotiations that are going to happen over this in the year ahead. And of note, because of the NSA's disclosures, the U. S. has lost a little bit of its swagger. We've also of concern, maybe lost some of our coalition partners on this, the swing states, like the Brazils, the Indias, the Germanys. And my concern is if we don't watch out, the Internet that's been so great for you and I is not going to be the ones that we give to our kids. GROSS: Would you elaborate on that concern? SINGER: The Internet started by two California universities connecting to each other. And it has been run, so to speak, with this underlying ethic that, you know, frankly comes out of, you know, 1970s California hippies. It's about sharing. It's about free flow of information. It's about openness. There's a huge amount of informality that's actually been incredibly effective. So, for example, some of the key decisions about certain technical standards are made by groups of people that voluntarily come together and they vote by humming. It sounds insane and yet it works. You now have pushing against this states saying we should be in charge of this. And, of course, states bring, in particular when you're talking about authoritarian states, a very different goal. And so I'm worried - and again, you can think about this in terms of the push by authoritarian states, like your Russias and Chinas of the world, and then the flip side, some of what's come out of the NSA disclosures about monitoring of a different kind of information. And so you've seen states start to - we're not there yet, but the ripple effects have been to, you know, almost poison the well. GROSS: You know, talking about cyber security, some of the security has been handled just by freelancers, you know, individuals on the Internet. And I want you to tell the story of Brian Krebs and what he exposed. SINGER: It's a great illustration of the power of individuals on the Internet. And Brian Krebs is this technical expert - a blogger - who also works for The Washington Post. And he got curious about not the individual cyber criminals, but the networks that they were using, the institutions, the markets and the like, and he dug a little and found that in fact, one key hub was responsible for this massive amount of cyber crime. And he contacted the organization and those that it was linking to and said hey, did you know this? And some did and now that they were, you know, notified by someone from The Washington Post, they took action; others didn't and said, wow, that's important to us. And so that hub, its activities got stopped. And low and behold, for a short period of time, 80 percent of all cyber crime on the Internet disappeared all because they went after this one hub. And it's a great illustration of how it's all a network. We're not just talking about a computer network, it's a network of people and relationships and that you can take real action if you mobilize them in a way that their underlying incentives are effective. And so in this situation it was the fact that he had the combination of technical expertise, but he also had this media side where the companies involved didn't want to be embarrassed and so they finally took action. GROSS: You write about something called The Internet of Things. What is meant by that? SINGER: The Internet of Things is one of the most important nutrients for the Internet itself, but also for you and I outside the Internet and, of course, cybersecurity and cyberwar impacts of it. So if you think about the way we use the Internet, our Internet-enabled devices, it's mainly been about communication between you and I, you know, me emailing you from my computer to your iPhone or the like. And that iPhone is a good illustration of one of the other trends that's out there, you know, becoming more and more mobile. But so basically, it's been about us having conversations of some sort, us sharing information online in some way shape or form. Cisco estimates that over the next five years, we'll see the number of Internet-enabled, Internet-linked devices go to as much as 40 billion. And what that means, as you see everything from refrigerators to cars to gadgets that no one's even dreamed up yet, all being linked up, it's no longer about you and I having conversations, it's about the things having conversations among them. And so that's when in The Internet of Things it really truly starts to change the real world. So we're already seeing little micro-examples of it. Like, for example, if you've bought a new car recently, when it detects that the brake pads are about to wear out, it'll automatically notify the manufacturer, who will automatically make you an appointment at the car dealership. The next step on this will be to link outside those networks, so your car, as its driving home, it will notify your smart thermostat that you're 10 minutes out. And the smart thermostat that's linked to a smart power grid, you know, it's been on an environmentally-efficient temperature in your house and now it's going to change it to the temperature that you just like for the time that you're there. All these great powerful impacts of The Internet of Things, but, of course it also comes with cyber threat consequences of a next level. We've already as an illustration seen car hacking. You know, not just stealing information from your car - where are you, with the GPS and the like - but now taking over certain actions of your car that is causing the car to do things contrary than what the driver of the car wants. And so it's a huge change in all our online life, but also our life in the real world. GROSS: What kind of precautions do you take in your personal life? SINGER: I try and practice what I preach. And in the book it goes through all of these things from, you know, password protocols to I can't tell you the number of conferences that I've gone to where you get this wonderful, really cool, you know, memory stick with the logo of you - the conference. Or recently it was a foreign government and they gave the silver memory stick; oh, isn't it beautiful? Isn't it wonderful? Sorry, going to toss that in the trash, it's not going into any of my networks. But look, there's another part of it which is understanding that everything that you do, it still is never going to give you 100 percent security. So if you can't bear to lose it, prepare to lose it. It's true whether you're talking about access for your power grid or your jetfighter designs to those pictures of your kids that you have saved online - prepare to back them up because you might lose them. GROSS: I want to thank you so much for talking with us. SINGER: Thank you for having me. GROSS: P. W.

Later, we want to hear about why a federal judge has rejected a nearly multibillion dollar settlement - sorry, a multimillion dollar settlement that the NFL reached with former players. We'll hear what that could mean going forward. But first, we want to talk about a new report from the Pew Research Center that finds that only 80 percent of African-Americans are Internet users compared with 87 percent of whites. And while that might not seem like a big difference, there is growing concern that this gap, which is even bigger when it comes to access to high-speed broadband at home, still puts African-Americans at a disadvantage. We've been particularly interested in growing the African-American and Latino presence in the so-called STEM fields. In other words, science, technology, engineering and math. We hope that you've heard or will go back and check out some of the conversations around our #NPRBlacksinTech and #NPRLatism series. We thought that this report gives us a good reason to invite some of our contributes back to weigh in on these issues. So joining us now Roxann Stafford. She is a design strategist at SecondMuse. That's a firm that works with businesses, nonprofits, communities and governments to create social change through innovation. Welcome back. ROXANN STAFFORD: Thank you. MARTIN: Ana Roca-Castro is CEO of Plaza Familia and founder of Latinos in Tech, Innovation and Social Media or LATISM. Welcome back to you as well. ANA ROCA-CASTRO: Thank you. MARTIN: And Mario Armstrong is a digital lifestyle expert. He collaborated with us in our NPR Blacks in Tech Series. Mario, welcome back to you. Thank you so much for joining us. MARIO ARMSTRONG: Thanks for having me. Thanks for having me here. MARTIN: So first of all, let's talk about this report. The Pew Research Center is doing snapshots of technology use among different groups of adults, and this is the first one. And as we said that there is a gap between blacks and whites when it comes to overall Internet use, but there's an even bigger gap when you look at Internet connection in the home. Seventy-four percent of white adults have some sort of broadband connection in the home compared with just 62 percent of African-Americans according to that Pew study. Now important to note, young college-educated higher-income African-Americans are just as likely to use the Internet and have broadband at home, but there's a big gap among older black Americans and blacks who've not attended college. They're much less likely to have broadband or Internet use than white seniors or whites with comparable educations. So, Roxann, I'm going to start with you - ask why do you think this gap exists and does it matter? STAFFORD: This gap definitely matters. You know, as we're talking about the need to grow an inclusive innovation economy - inclusive from the standpoint of different backgrounds, but also ages - so we must make sure that access is addressed. So when I start thinking about access in the communities that I'm working in, its, again, yes part of it is the broadband access, but the other part is really understanding how and why you're using these things. MARTIN: Well, why does it matter 'cause some people might say, well, that's just a lifestyle choice. I mean, you know, if people don't want to be on Twitter, so what? STAFFORD: Well, more and more we're seeing the ways in which we interact with our government, the ways in which we interact with each other, the ways in which we can even get day-to-day means are done on an Internet-based platform. And if we don't have access to that, and again, this can come through phones or other things, but not having access means your left out of the conversation and left out of the picture. We know if we want to move forward as a community, a collective community, everyone needs to be a part of that conversation. MARTIN: Ana, this isn't just an issue that affects African-Americans. Pew did a similar report on Latinos last year that found that around 78 percent are Internet users. And we've heard the other figures for sort of other communities. Your thoughts on why you think that is and if you think that matters? ROCA-CASTRO: It matters a lot and the gap definitely exists. And for us, it matters in many ways. We have family in our countries of origin still. So it matters in the interpersonal connection, in the inter-generational connections. But it also matters in the schools. So right now, no child can really do research or complete a full homework without going to Google or without having a good research tool, which is usually online. If they rely on the typical encyclopedia, that's it. You're outdated. And even for the jobs, I mean, you can't even get a McDonald's job without going online and applying online. So it's a huge digital divide, and of course, it affects kids in education, but it also affects adults when it comes to job and employment. MARTIN: You know, Mario, when it comes Internet access on mobile devices it does show that the gap is a lot lower there. That the numbers are of access and use. . . ARMSTRONG: Right. MARTIN: . . . Are a lot higher for mobile. . . ARMSTRONG: Right. MARTIN: . . . Devices. So, you know, are cell phones and tablets, for that matter - are those the great equalizer? Is that enough? ARMSTRONG: No that's nowhere near enough. And I think this is so critical for people to understand this. Just because there's data that's being put out there that suggests - that says oh, more African- Americans and minorities of color are using mobile devices, that means they're experiencing the full Internet. That is so far from the truth. Number one, you cannot create anything of really significant proportion on a mobile device. So you can consume a lot of everything. So the difference of what I want people to really think about when it comes to digital divide and the access is are we training people to become consumers or are we training people to become creators? And so I think when you look at that, yes we can all hop on Twitter on our mobile devices. We can search the Internet. We can shop. We can get entertainment information. But I can't build a webpage. I cannot build an app. I cannot program certain things and create certain things to a large degree from these mobile devices. So there's still a huge gap and a huge divide. And to your earlier point about that generational gap, I think that is a critical issue. We're talking about more Americans becoming older, needing the Internet, more and more healthcare options are going to be served online through mobile devices and technology. I just got back from the CES - Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. It's the World Cup of technology conferences. And the digital help section of that conference has expanded threefold. So this is really, really critical not only for literacy and education because I do believe if you can't use technology, you are illiterate - not just digitally illiterate, but just illiterate. Some people may argue with me on that point, but that's how passionate I am about people understanding the relevancy of using technology to better their life. MARTIN: Well, you know, I think you make an important point about how much of the health care - how much access to health care takes place online or even access to kind of those entry-level things. I mean, we've talked so much about, you know, Obamacare and the difficulties with that, but. . . ARMSTRONG: Right. MARTIN: I think many people don't understand how much is already online. And I also think, perhaps, the caregiver issue that many grandparents. . . STAFFORD: Yes. MARTIN: . . . Are raising children of school age. And if they have no connection to technology, how are they. . . ARMSTRONG: Great point. MARTIN: . . . In a position to mentor or offer access to the students that they are raising? If you're just joining us, we're talking about a new Pew report that looks at race and Internet use. We're talking about this with a few of our #NPRBlacksinTech and #NPRLatism contributors Ana Roca-Castro, Mario Armstrong and Roxann Stafford. The Pew study also pointed out that African-Americans and Latinos have a huge presence on social media sites, though like Twitter and Facebook. Now we've talked about this a lot, you know, before. So, Ana Roca-Castro, I wanted to ask you again, I mean, positive or negative because a lot of people think that this is just, you know, garbage time, basically. That there's really no - there's, you know, it's fun, it's entertaining, but that this doesn't kind of yield any bigger, you know, there's no bigger picture here. And I just wanted to get your thoughts on that as a person who's a consumer and a creator. ROCA-CASTRO: Well, you know, it's very positive simply because of the fact of that unified voice that speaks louder than just one person screaming I have rights or you forgot me and so on. So I think the collective voice is really when the power comes in. However, we over index in social media, but we don't over index when it comes to creating that content. So many times, we're just like parrots - repeating what others say. And I think that's the point of LATISM. Let's really start creating our own voices and our own messages and our own movement. MARTIN: I'm curious, though, if you worry at all about the silo effect - was it that people are, you know - they'll only talk to people who already agree with them anyway. That you really don't get the - kind of the benefit of a broader, you know - a broader society, you know, as it were. I mean, I'm not one of those, like, let's go back to the old days where everybody had to get the evening paper and a little kid with a hat was, you know, throwing it on your doorstep. So that's - for all kinds of reasons, we're not feeling that. But there was some sense of kind of a common shared base of information. Do you ever worry about that? ROCA-CASTRO: Well. . . MARTIN: It's another form of segregation. ROCA-CASTRO: Go to the #LATISM and you'll find everything but that same voice. I mean, you have Republicans and Democrats killing each other over that little hash tag. And I love it because it's the diverse level of voices and messages and so on. So no, I don't think there is a unified - but when it comes to rights and specific bills, there is a unification. MARTIN: Roxann, what do you think - social media use and as Ana Roca-Castro pointed out, you know, minorities - blacks and Latinos over indexed in presence on these sites. Is that a net positive or a net negative in your view? STAFFORD: I think it's a positive as long as we're connecting it to action. So I think both Ana and Mario talked about the piece of helping us move from consumers to creators. And I'd like to add another movement into entrepreneurs around that, right. So if you are having lots of your interaction and knowledge base coming from Twitter, coming from Facebook, my call to action is really asking you to step back and reflect on what is that conversation saying that could lead to action? Right. And so as long as this on-life presence leads to moving forward in the community, I'm all for it. And we know that it's a powerful way to get things started. If we look at the Arab Spring, if we look at lots of movements that have been started recently, these voices start with a tweet here, a tweet there, but the power comes when people move and collaborate together. Get in the streets, learn about the actual needs and start building and moving forward. So I want our youth today to really think about, again, that shift. We're consuming. We're starting to create. Now let's be entrepreneurs around what we're creating to see change. ARMSTRONG: And, Michel, to your point. . . MARTIN: Mario, your thoughts. ARMSTRONG: And to your point, yeah. To your point, I think we should help people understand the power of getting out of the echo chamber, being able to follow diverse voices so that you do have a more comprehensive understanding of what society is talking about and what issues mean what to certain demographics. I do believe the power of Twitter gives you the opportunity to brand yourself as an expert or as a source in some way. But I think a lot of people think of Twitter as something where it's frivolous. That you spend time talking about meaningless things. You don't have to talk about anything. The real power of Twitter is doing a lot of listening. So I think, you know, even in the way the software is set up, it's like hey, if you like Michel, you may also like this person because Michel follows that person. It almost pushes you into the echo chamber. So you really need to be aware of that point that you made - that astute point that you made so that you can really maximize using social for some meaningful impact. MARTIN: Well, you know, speaking about that. This kind of is a nice segue to the last thing I wanted to talk about, which is this whole question of mentorship and visibility. And one of the things that came out of both of our #NPRLatism and #NPRBlacksinTech discussions is the need - really the hunger for young people to pursue STEM careers - once again, science, technology, engineering and math - but also the need to see somebody or to connect with people who kind of show you a path to doing that. And, Roxann, you know, I still have to wonder, you know, how does that happen when, you know, we're used to this idea that mentors and mentees should share similar backgrounds. But, you know, as we've pointed out that African-Americans make up 5 percent of America's scientists and engineers. So how does that happen? How does that mentorship invisibility happen building from such a small base? STAFFORD: Well, one thing we can start with is the mechanism we were just talking about, like, social media can really play that role. So even if you don't have someone who is a coder in your direct community, you can start turning and figuring out who are those people and start following them. I think another important aspect of this and thinking about who is a mentor and how to, you know, really take advantage of mentorship is to understand that in addition to having a similar maybe racial ethnic background, we want, also, to have people who understand needs in your community. If they have a similar understanding that you do and want to grow, they can walk along that path with you and become a mentor. So as we are waiting - 'cause it's a process of building and growing that 5 percent to more - we can continue also to look to others that want to work in this space. MARTIN: Ana, what do you think about that? ROCA-CASTRO: I think it's a real commitment that we all, in STEM, have to make to the community and to the kids out there. You know, 5 percent of your time has to be spent going to the schools, going and talking to kids and volunteering in those programs that are already helping, you know. I have a great example. LPFI, Level Playing Field Institute, they do these match programs. And, you know, 58 percent of their graduates end up choosing STEM careers because they're finally exposed to STEM careers, which is not what happens in the regular high school in our minority communities. MARTIN: Well, what about that whole question, though? I mean, one of the things that came out of some of those conversations that we had on those two hasghtags is that minority professionals feel that they are already under a very great deal of pressure to succeed just on the professional side. And then to then ask them to take on this additional responsibility, I mean, a lot of them said that they'd love to, but they say, you know what? Their first responsibility is to excellence in their fields to show that they can do it and I - I mean, how do you balance that? ROCA-CASTRO: You know, I'm in that situation. I'm always pulled from a hundred places while at the same time, I'm trying just to make it happen. But we organize career fairs in the different schools, and it really takes one day every six months - one morning of your day. Just go. And the feeling of fulfillment and of giving back, paying it forward that you get is way better - trust me. It is just such a satisfaction that you feel when you see those kids that look like you and look like you were as a child. They look to you as a superhero when you tell them, oh, I develop games - wow, that's so cool. I think it's really - it pays back. That's all I can tell any professional out there. MARTIN: Mario, final thought from you on this. ARMSTRONG: Yeah, I just - I think that is absolutely ridiculous for people to actually think that they should not - that they don't have a responsibility to actually give back to the community. That's just. . . MARTIN: Well, my question really is more that is it all on the 5 percent or how about the 95 percent that isn't black? ROCA-CASTRO: Yeah. ARMSTRONG: But that's the. . . MARTIN: That's my question. ARMSTRONG: That's the whole point. See, I think we're - I think part of what we're focusing on is just that 5 percent. We don't need to focus on that 5 percent. There are many entrepreneurs, innovators, technologists that don't fall under computer science-related. . . ROCA-CASTRO: Yes. ARMSTRONG: . . . Degree that are amazing role models. STAFFORD: Absolutely. ARMSTRONG: And many of them are doing that type of work. But I got to tell you this - look, from your work on this series for both Hispanic as well as African-American on this series, I decided, you know what? I'm one of those 95 percenters. We're going to do something. So we're launching a free e-book called \"Dream, Create, Go. \" It's going to come out fall 2014 of this school year. It's an e-book that is free. It can be accessed on mobile devices, on the web. And all it's going to do is show original video of people of different diversity - women, adults, different ethnicities - and what their work is like. We're taking video into their jobs and showing young kids and young girls and young boys people that look like them that are working in these positions, that are happy, that are living a fulfilling life, how they got there, what their obstacles were, what their challenges that they face. So kids love video. And they want to be able to pinch and zoom and touch and highlight. And so I'm really excited about this educational product that we're going to put out to really help with helping kids find mentorship. My other really quick point is mentors out there, stop coming up with excuses. You don't need to be there physically. ROCA-CASTRO: Yes. ARMSTRONG: You can do so much online. STAFFORD: That's right. ARMSTRONG: You can do Skype. ROCA-CASTRO: Yes. ARMSTRONG: Webinars. There are so many things that we're trying to do within our book that's going to extend beyond people. . . MARTIN: OK. ARMSTRONG: . . . People just looking at an app or looking at book. MARTIN: Well, to your point. . . ARMSTRONG: But also creating stronger mentorship. MARTIN: To your point, I can't see you, which is why you can't see me saying wrap it up, Mario. ARMSTRONG: Yeah, I'm sorry. MARTIN: All right, Mario Armstrong is a digital lifestyle expert. He joined us from member station WYPR in Baltimore, Maryland. Ana Roca-Castro is CEO of Plaza Familia and founder of Latinos in Tech, Innovation and Social media or at LATISM. And she was here in Washington, D. C. along with Roxann Stafford, design strategist at SecondMuse. Thank you all so much for joining us. ROCA-CASTRO: Thank you. STAFFORD: Thank you. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  I'm Michel Martin and this is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. Later, we want to hear about why a federal judge has rejected a nearly multibillion dollar settlement - sorry, a multimillion dollar settlement that the NFL reached with former players. We'll hear what that could mean going forward. But first, we want to talk about a new report from the Pew Research Center that finds that only 80 percent of African-Americans are Internet users compared with 87 percent of whites. And while that might not seem like a big difference, there is growing concern that this gap, which is even bigger when it comes to access to high-speed broadband at home, still puts African-Americans at a disadvantage. We've been particularly interested in growing the African-American and Latino presence in the so-called STEM fields. In other words, science, technology, engineering and math. We hope that you've heard or will go back and check out some of the conversations around our #NPRBlacksinTech and #NPRLatism series. We thought that this report gives us a good reason to invite some of our contributes back to weigh in on these issues. So joining us now Roxann Stafford. She is a design strategist at SecondMuse. That's a firm that works with businesses, nonprofits, communities and governments to create social change through innovation. Welcome back. ROXANN STAFFORD: Thank you. MARTIN: Ana Roca-Castro is CEO of Plaza Familia and founder of Latinos in Tech, Innovation and Social Media or LATISM. Welcome back to you as well. ANA ROCA-CASTRO: Thank you. MARTIN: And Mario Armstrong is a digital lifestyle expert. He collaborated with us in our NPR Blacks in Tech Series. Mario, welcome back to you. Thank you so much for joining us. MARIO ARMSTRONG: Thanks for having me. Thanks for having me here. MARTIN: So first of all, let's talk about this report. The Pew Research Center is doing snapshots of technology use among different groups of adults, and this is the first one. And as we said that there is a gap between blacks and whites when it comes to overall Internet use, but there's an even bigger gap when you look at Internet connection in the home. Seventy-four percent of white adults have some sort of broadband connection in the home compared with just 62 percent of African-Americans according to that Pew study. Now important to note, young college-educated higher-income African-Americans are just as likely to use the Internet and have broadband at home, but there's a big gap among older black Americans and blacks who've not attended college. They're much less likely to have broadband or Internet use than white seniors or whites with comparable educations. So, Roxann, I'm going to start with you - ask why do you think this gap exists and does it matter? STAFFORD: This gap definitely matters. You know, as we're talking about the need to grow an inclusive innovation economy - inclusive from the standpoint of different backgrounds, but also ages - so we must make sure that access is addressed. So when I start thinking about access in the communities that I'm working in, its, again, yes part of it is the broadband access, but the other part is really understanding how and why you're using these things. MARTIN: Well, why does it matter 'cause some people might say, well, that's just a lifestyle choice. I mean, you know, if people don't want to be on Twitter, so what? STAFFORD: Well, more and more we're seeing the ways in which we interact with our government, the ways in which we interact with each other, the ways in which we can even get day-to-day means are done on an Internet-based platform. And if we don't have access to that, and again, this can come through phones or other things, but not having access means your left out of the conversation and left out of the picture. We know if we want to move forward as a community, a collective community, everyone needs to be a part of that conversation. MARTIN: Ana, this isn't just an issue that affects African-Americans. Pew did a similar report on Latinos last year that found that around 78 percent are Internet users. And we've heard the other figures for sort of other communities. Your thoughts on why you think that is and if you think that matters? ROCA-CASTRO: It matters a lot and the gap definitely exists. And for us, it matters in many ways. We have family in our countries of origin still. So it matters in the interpersonal connection, in the inter-generational connections. But it also matters in the schools. So right now, no child can really do research or complete a full homework without going to Google or without having a good research tool, which is usually online. If they rely on the typical encyclopedia, that's it. You're outdated. And even for the jobs, I mean, you can't even get a McDonald's job without going online and applying online. So it's a huge digital divide, and of course, it affects kids in education, but it also affects adults when it comes to job and employment. MARTIN: You know, Mario, when it comes Internet access on mobile devices it does show that the gap is a lot lower there. That the numbers are of access and use. . . ARMSTRONG: Right. MARTIN: . . . Are a lot higher for mobile. . . ARMSTRONG: Right. MARTIN: . . . Devices. So, you know, are cell phones and tablets, for that matter - are those the great equalizer? Is that enough? ARMSTRONG: No that's nowhere near enough. And I think this is so critical for people to understand this. Just because there's data that's being put out there that suggests - that says oh, more African- Americans and minorities of color are using mobile devices, that means they're experiencing the full Internet. That is so far from the truth. Number one, you cannot create anything of really significant proportion on a mobile device. So you can consume a lot of everything. So the difference of what I want people to really think about when it comes to digital divide and the access is are we training people to become consumers or are we training people to become creators? And so I think when you look at that, yes we can all hop on Twitter on our mobile devices. We can search the Internet. We can shop. We can get entertainment information. But I can't build a webpage. I cannot build an app. I cannot program certain things and create certain things to a large degree from these mobile devices. So there's still a huge gap and a huge divide. And to your earlier point about that generational gap, I think that is a critical issue. We're talking about more Americans becoming older, needing the Internet, more and more healthcare options are going to be served online through mobile devices and technology. I just got back from the CES - Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. It's the World Cup of technology conferences. And the digital help section of that conference has expanded threefold. So this is really, really critical not only for literacy and education because I do believe if you can't use technology, you are illiterate - not just digitally illiterate, but just illiterate. Some people may argue with me on that point, but that's how passionate I am about people understanding the relevancy of using technology to better their life. MARTIN: Well, you know, I think you make an important point about how much of the health care - how much access to health care takes place online or even access to kind of those entry-level things. I mean, we've talked so much about, you know, Obamacare and the difficulties with that, but. . . ARMSTRONG: Right. MARTIN: I think many people don't understand how much is already online. And I also think, perhaps, the caregiver issue that many grandparents. . . STAFFORD: Yes. MARTIN: . . . Are raising children of school age. And if they have no connection to technology, how are they. . . ARMSTRONG: Great point. MARTIN: . . . In a position to mentor or offer access to the students that they are raising? If you're just joining us, we're talking about a new Pew report that looks at race and Internet use. We're talking about this with a few of our #NPRBlacksinTech and #NPRLatism contributors Ana Roca-Castro, Mario Armstrong and Roxann Stafford. The Pew study also pointed out that African-Americans and Latinos have a huge presence on social media sites, though like Twitter and Facebook. Now we've talked about this a lot, you know, before. So, Ana Roca-Castro, I wanted to ask you again, I mean, positive or negative because a lot of people think that this is just, you know, garbage time, basically. That there's really no - there's, you know, it's fun, it's entertaining, but that this doesn't kind of yield any bigger, you know, there's no bigger picture here. And I just wanted to get your thoughts on that as a person who's a consumer and a creator. ROCA-CASTRO: Well, you know, it's very positive simply because of the fact of that unified voice that speaks louder than just one person screaming I have rights or you forgot me and so on. So I think the collective voice is really when the power comes in. However, we over index in social media, but we don't over index when it comes to creating that content. So many times, we're just like parrots - repeating what others say. And I think that's the point of LATISM. Let's really start creating our own voices and our own messages and our own movement. MARTIN: I'm curious, though, if you worry at all about the silo effect - was it that people are, you know - they'll only talk to people who already agree with them anyway. That you really don't get the - kind of the benefit of a broader, you know - a broader society, you know, as it were. I mean, I'm not one of those, like, let's go back to the old days where everybody had to get the evening paper and a little kid with a hat was, you know, throwing it on your doorstep. So that's - for all kinds of reasons, we're not feeling that. But there was some sense of kind of a common shared base of information. Do you ever worry about that? ROCA-CASTRO: Well. . . MARTIN: It's another form of segregation. ROCA-CASTRO: Go to the #LATISM and you'll find everything but that same voice. I mean, you have Republicans and Democrats killing each other over that little hash tag. And I love it because it's the diverse level of voices and messages and so on. So no, I don't think there is a unified - but when it comes to rights and specific bills, there is a unification. MARTIN: Roxann, what do you think - social media use and as Ana Roca-Castro pointed out, you know, minorities - blacks and Latinos over indexed in presence on these sites. Is that a net positive or a net negative in your view? STAFFORD: I think it's a positive as long as we're connecting it to action. So I think both Ana and Mario talked about the piece of helping us move from consumers to creators. And I'd like to add another movement into entrepreneurs around that, right. So if you are having lots of your interaction and knowledge base coming from Twitter, coming from Facebook, my call to action is really asking you to step back and reflect on what is that conversation saying that could lead to action? Right. And so as long as this on-life presence leads to moving forward in the community, I'm all for it. And we know that it's a powerful way to get things started. If we look at the Arab Spring, if we look at lots of movements that have been started recently, these voices start with a tweet here, a tweet there, but the power comes when people move and collaborate together. Get in the streets, learn about the actual needs and start building and moving forward. So I want our youth today to really think about, again, that shift. We're consuming. We're starting to create. Now let's be entrepreneurs around what we're creating to see change. ARMSTRONG: And, Michel, to your point. . . MARTIN: Mario, your thoughts. ARMSTRONG: And to your point, yeah. To your point, I think we should help people understand the power of getting out of the echo chamber, being able to follow diverse voices so that you do have a more comprehensive understanding of what society is talking about and what issues mean what to certain demographics. I do believe the power of Twitter gives you the opportunity to brand yourself as an expert or as a source in some way. But I think a lot of people think of Twitter as something where it's frivolous. That you spend time talking about meaningless things. You don't have to talk about anything. The real power of Twitter is doing a lot of listening. So I think, you know, even in the way the software is set up, it's like hey, if you like Michel, you may also like this person because Michel follows that person. It almost pushes you into the echo chamber. So you really need to be aware of that point that you made - that astute point that you made so that you can really maximize using social for some meaningful impact. MARTIN: Well, you know, speaking about that. This kind of is a nice segue to the last thing I wanted to talk about, which is this whole question of mentorship and visibility. And one of the things that came out of both of our #NPRLatism and #NPRBlacksinTech discussions is the need - really the hunger for young people to pursue STEM careers - once again, science, technology, engineering and math - but also the need to see somebody or to connect with people who kind of show you a path to doing that. And, Roxann, you know, I still have to wonder, you know, how does that happen when, you know, we're used to this idea that mentors and mentees should share similar backgrounds. But, you know, as we've pointed out that African-Americans make up 5 percent of America's scientists and engineers. So how does that happen? How does that mentorship invisibility happen building from such a small base? STAFFORD: Well, one thing we can start with is the mechanism we were just talking about, like, social media can really play that role. So even if you don't have someone who is a coder in your direct community, you can start turning and figuring out who are those people and start following them. I think another important aspect of this and thinking about who is a mentor and how to, you know, really take advantage of mentorship is to understand that in addition to having a similar maybe racial ethnic background, we want, also, to have people who understand needs in your community. If they have a similar understanding that you do and want to grow, they can walk along that path with you and become a mentor. So as we are waiting - 'cause it's a process of building and growing that 5 percent to more - we can continue also to look to others that want to work in this space. MARTIN: Ana, what do you think about that? ROCA-CASTRO: I think it's a real commitment that we all, in STEM, have to make to the community and to the kids out there. You know, 5 percent of your time has to be spent going to the schools, going and talking to kids and volunteering in those programs that are already helping, you know. I have a great example. LPFI, Level Playing Field Institute, they do these match programs. And, you know, 58 percent of their graduates end up choosing STEM careers because they're finally exposed to STEM careers, which is not what happens in the regular high school in our minority communities. MARTIN: Well, what about that whole question, though? I mean, one of the things that came out of some of those conversations that we had on those two hasghtags is that minority professionals feel that they are already under a very great deal of pressure to succeed just on the professional side. And then to then ask them to take on this additional responsibility, I mean, a lot of them said that they'd love to, but they say, you know what? Their first responsibility is to excellence in their fields to show that they can do it and I - I mean, how do you balance that? ROCA-CASTRO: You know, I'm in that situation. I'm always pulled from a hundred places while at the same time, I'm trying just to make it happen. But we organize career fairs in the different schools, and it really takes one day every six months - one morning of your day. Just go.

But yesterday a federal appeals court ruled that the Federal Communications Commission cannot require Internet providers to offer unfettered access. It was Verizon that brought the case against the FCC. The ruling could have far-reaching implications for what's known as net neutrality. Here's NPR's Laura Sydell to help us out with what all this means. Welcome. LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE: Hello. Good morning. MONTAGNE: First, do give us some background on the case, how it came about. SYDELL: Back in 2010, the FCC passed rules to support so-called net neutrality. And this means that broadband providers must treat all traffic on the Internet exactly the same. So you can't discriminate between a Democratic website and a Republican website. And the rules got set up after the FCC tried to punish Comcast for secretly slowing some traffic on its networks. Comcast got caught doing this when a guy who was sharing barber shop quartet songs noticed his network slowed down when he used the file sharing software Bit Torrent. The Associated Press confirmed his experience when it tried to upload the Bible with Bit Torrent, and the FCC took Comcast to court but lost. The court told the FCC that it didn't have rules in place to use against Comcast. So the FCC came up with the open Internet rules. And that is where we got to this moment. MONTAGNE: What was the basis on which Verizon challenged the rule? SYDELL: Verizon argued that the FCC had no right to make those rules in the first place because the FCC didn't give itself the right. A few years back the commission decided that the Internet would not be regulated like a telephone line. Phone lines are heavily regulated. They're considered common carriers and therefore they're necessary for public communications. The FCC decided it was going to be much lighter when it came to regulation on the Internet. It classified it differently. So Verizon essentially argued that since the FCC had classified it differently, it had no right to regulate the Internet so heavily and to tell them what to do. The FCC did try to reclassify Internet connections and what happened was the Republicans in Congress said we don't want you to reclassify it. They got upset because they didn't want more regulation on the Internet. MONTAGNE: OK then.  So what does this new ruling by this federal appeals court mean for us consumers? SYDELL: It means that theoretically your broadband provider can decide to slow or block particular websites. One of the arguments that the Internet service providers make is that Netflix and Google don't have to pay for fast access to your house, so that they might simply start charging companies if they want a faster line to the consumer, and that may bring up your prices. And it could make it a lot more expensive for the next startup that might challenge Netflix or YouTube. They'd have to pay extra for a fast connection to you or strike a deal with Verizon. And I should add that Google and Netflix do pay to connect to the Internet. This is really about the last mile into your house, and the Internet service providers want to charge extra for that. Netflix in particular is in the crosshairs here because more than 30 percent of Internet traffic at peak times comes from Netflix, according to studies. So Verizon might say, Netflix, you need to pay us more. Or maybe Verizon strikes a deal with Amazon and says your prime video service can get speedier delivery to the home and we're going to slow down Netflix. MONTAGNE: And so what does this mean, Laura? Is the battle over? SYDELL: Well, the FCC does have a few options here. It could appeal the decision. It could try and go back to the drawing board and come up with some new rules that fit with the decision, or it can try to reclassify broadband once again. MONTAGNE: NPR's Laura Sydell.

Last week after a three- month hiatus, his 120,000-plus followers noticed some activity on his Twitter feed. It was a retweet that started. . . TEJU COLE: . . . To a subway I saw a man on the ground. He sat on the sidewalk under trees, with his feet out to the quiet street. MARTIN: More than 30 retweets later, a short story written by Teju Cole emerged. COLE: . . . Four others were there - a young man busy with a phone, a young woman, a baby in a pram, a girl who was with the woman. There was a stillness in the scene as in an altarpiece. There's a helpless air in those who stood around him. The seated man was closer to 60 than to 50, dressed in an ordinary way - a button-down long sleeved shirt, trousers. His right hand was inside his shirt. He clutched at his heart and winced. MARTIN: And Teju Cole joins us now to tell us more about his latest experiment. Welcome back. Thank you so much for joining us. COLE: Thanks very much, Michel. It's nice to be talking to you. MARTIN: So how did the ideas start? Do you remember? COLE: Well, I think it was two different things. I think it was because this account had been dormant for a while. I was taking a much-needed break from the hectic environment that Twitter sometimes can be. I had been enjoying my break, but I had a notion that, you know, I wasn't done with Twitter for good. So the first thing was that there was this space that was open, I wanted to maybe get back in there. And then the second thing is that I had written this story and I was thinking to myself how I would publish it. And there are any number of places I could publish a short story, but I think I have a natural inclination to try new things when it comes to storytelling. I try to think about where is the audience, what kind of reading do I want of this thing? And out of those two ideas, you know, I worked out something to tell the story on Twitter without actually sending any tweets myself. MARTIN: Well, yeah, I was going to say - so you wrote the story and then you asked others to tweet it for you. COLE: Yes. MARTIN: Which is kind of spicy. Why did you decide to do it that way? COLE: Because, you know, then it occurred to me that the retweet had not really been used much as a tool. I mean, people sometimes retweet something into their feed to inform other people of something. Or as a way to show that somebody had tweeted something idiotic, so there's the ironic retweet. But as far as I was aware, nobody had actually used a retweet to create a narrative. And so I took advantage of the hospitality of my friends and followers online by asking them to tweet out certain things, which to people who are reading them on their feeds, would just be sort of random sentences. But when I retweeted all of these things in sequence, they all joined together to make a coherent story. It was just an idea. It's very much dependent on the generosity and kindness of the people I asked to participate. And I think it worked out quite interestingly. MARTIN: Was it a tricky decision, you know, who would be invited to participate? And I won't mention that I'm a little hurt that I was on your list, but. . . COLE: It wasn't. . . MARTIN: It's kind of like sending a list for a party, in a way. You know, you're like, who do you include? Who do you not include? COLE: You know, it wasn't actually that tricky because I kept it simple. I mean, I got this idea while I was in India. I happened to be traveling between cities. I was in the back of a cab with my phone when I started this project. And the first person I asked, Runty Reader, happens to be a good friend of mine. So I wrote to her and I said, look, I'm going to start this thing, I want you to send out a tweet. So she sent out the tweet. And then the second person I asked was George Szirtes, who is an English poet who is also a friend of mine. And he said, well, this sounds kind of strange, but of course I'll do it. But once two two people had participated and I had sent out these retweets, people started saying, hey, what's going on here, this is peculiar. And the rest of the participants actually, I largely selected on the basis of who was responding to what I was doing. So if one of my friends said, oh, what's going on there, this is interesting - I would send them a DM and say would you like to participate? So largely, it was people who showed interest that I ended up following. There was no grand strategy because this was not planned ahead of time. I needed it to be people who were online at that particular time because I was actually doing this one tweet at a time. It wasn't planned in advance at all. MARTIN: But you didn't start the story with the intention of distributing it that way. Right? COLE: No, I did not. MARTIN: No. Well, you know, I think one of the reasons - first of all, the story had a lot of positive attention, but I think a lot of people are intrigued by it because I think this is a time when a lot of artists are experimenting with how to get their art to their audiences in new ways. I mean, now, Beyonce made a big splash with the way she delivered her latest album on YouTube kind of. . . COLE: That's right. MARTIN: . . . In the middle of the night, you know. And it kind of made me think of that. COLE: You know, when Beyonce and I are discussing how to disseminate our art, we always - Jay-Z, Beyonce and I. . . MARTIN: Just get together. COLE: . . . Always talk about the importance of the element of surprise. Excuse me. Please go on. MARTIN: I thought it fly. I means, I'm just saying. I was - but is that kind of on your mind in a way? Or is it just kind of a happy, eureka moment - you say, you know what would be fun? COLE: Well, I mean, I just think it has to do with not feeling as if the audience owes me anything. That I actually do have to work hard for whatever attention my work gets. Sometimes it would involve publishing something in The New Yorker, which has a subscription base and an established audience. And sometimes it involves using media or a forum that is not necessarily associated with, you know, very serious work. Maybe it's just like a generational thing where I don't think that print media has to be the be-all and end-all. A lot of the people I want to be read by, a lot of people I want to speak to are not people who have subscriptions to The New Yorker or to The New York Times. So it's important for me to speak to them in this way also. MARTIN: Well, here's the tricky thing, though, you do need to get paid, don't you? Some kind of way for your work. COLE: I do need to get paid, but, you know, I'm. . . MARTIN: So this was a gift. COLE: This was a gift, but, I mean, I mentioned the word generosity earlier. You know, I've thought about ideas of hospitality. Sometimes it's just really important to be in a place together and do something. And that brings its own rewards in a way, you know. Yes, there are many things I do that I get paid for, you know. I - you know, I give talks, I'm a teacher, you know, I publish. But if you think about your work only in terms of what is generating income for you, I think that work would probably die on the vine. What you actually have to do is think of your work in the terms of the intensity and excellent that you want to bring to it. And so this story, for example, was something I worked on for many days. The fact that it went out on Twitter did not mean that I could allow myself to be sloppy in terms of how I wrote it. MARTIN: I was going to ask about that. Did you feel anything was lost or gained in having to meet the particular form of Twitter? COLE: Well, actually not much was lost in terms of, you know, the literariness of the peace, in terms of the sentences. Simply because my own personal style as a writer does tend towards short declarative sentences. So, no, there was no great loss there. But what interests me is polished language, language that one has worked on. The way that it can work inside this medium where a lot of the language that you're seeing in this medium is not carefully considered, and then you sort of put these very clean, simple sentences out there and people think, oh, that's having some kind of strange effect on me but I'm not sure why. But you as the writer know that it's because you have quite carefully thought about the placement of your commas and about your word choice and about using simple words and about using slightly unusual grammar or that sort of thing - basically, the same way that you would have an effect on your reader if you were writing an article for, you know, Harper's or The Atlantic or if you were publishing a novel. MARTIN: Well, congratulations. COLE: Well, thank you very much. And it's fun to talk you about this. MARTIN: So you're back on Twitter now? COLE: Am I back on Twitter? I don't know. We'll see when inspiration strikes. I think I'm going to post a bunch of photographs next. I don't know. MARTIN: Teju Cole is the author of \"Open City. \" And a new work of fiction, \"Every Day Is for the Thief,\" will be published by Random House on March 25. And he was kind enough to join us from our studio in New York. Thank you so much for joining us. COLE: Thank you. It was a pleasure to talk to you about this. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Teju Cole is a writer, a photography, an art historian and Distinguished Writer in Residence at Bard College.

SETH GODIN: If you look at Bob Marley's career, he didn't invent the Rastafarians but he certainly led them. And when there is enough need and demand for a leader like that, often but not always, someone stands up and says follow me. RAZ: This is Seth Godin, by the way, he's a blogger and entrepreneur. And the kinds of leaders Seth is talking about, they need two things. The first is, they need a tribe, a group of people, large or small, who've chosen to come together around a common interest or goal. And then the second thing, a vacuum. GODIN: When we sense that there's a vacuum at the PTA, or a vacuum, you know, in our local intramural hockey club, or a vacuum in our political party, someone feels enough push that they overcome that internal resistance and say, all right I'll do it. Let's go. RAZ: Yeah, they just show up. GODIN: Yeah. RAZ: Yeah, our local park needed a new playground and there's a volunteer group and I just sort of, like, showed up at the meetings. And lo and behold, I've got kids and they were like, hey, you got kids, you want to, sort of, be in charge of this? And, like, I'm in charge of it now. Like, people come to me and ask me questions about the progress of the new playground. GODIN: Bingo. And I would guess that they're lucky to have you. The thing that's interesting about your story is, it sounds like there was a little bit of permission given to you, that someone said, hey, Guy, do you want to do this? And part of my thesis is that more and more, we don't have to wait to be picked. RAZ: Here's Seth Godin on the TED stage. GODIN: The Internet was supposed to homogenize everyone by connecting us all. Instead what it's allowed is silos of interest. So you got the red-hat ladies over here. You got the red-hot triathletes over there. You got the organized armies over here. You got the disorganized rebels over there. You got people in white hats making food, and people in white hats sailing boats. The point is that you can find Ukrainian folk dancers and connect with them 'cause you want to be connected. The people on the fringes can find each other, connect and go somewhere. But we don't think about it that way and we haven't spent a lot of time talking about what that process is like. And I've been studying it for a couple years and I want to share a couple stories with you today. First, about a guy named Nathan Winograd. Nathan was the number two person at the San Francisco SPCA. And what you may not know about the history of the SPCA is it was founded to kill dogs and cats. Cities gave them a charter to get rid of the stray animals on the street and destroy them. And in a typical year, 4 million dogs and cats were killed. Most of them within 24 hours of being scooped off the street. Nathan and his boss saw this and they could not tolerate it. So they set out to make San Francisco a no kill city. Create an entire city where every dog and cat, unless it was ill or dangerous, would be adopted, not killed. And everyone said it was impossible. Nathan and his boss went to the city council to get a change in the ordinance and people from SPCA's and humane shelters from around the country flew to San Francisco to testify against them. To say it would hurt the movement and it was inhumane. They persisted and Nathan went directly to the community. He connected with people who cared about this,  non-professionals, people with passion. And within just a couple of years, San Francisco became the first no kill city. Running no deficit, completely supported by the community. Nathan left and went to Tompkins County, New York, a place as different from San Francisco as you can be and still be in the United States. And he did it again. And then he went to North Carolina and did it again. And he went to Reno and he did it again. RAZ: Now, one interesting thing Seth says he learned from studying leaders is that a lot of them, including Nathan Winograd from San Francisco, are not exactly textbook leadership material. They're not charismatic or inspiring. At least not at first. GODIN: Yeah, I mean, there's a nonsense belief, which is that leaders have this sort of, glib. George Clooney-like or even Adolf Hitler-like affect to them. And that's probably the first time both of them have ever been mentioned in the same sentence. And that you need to have that in order to lead. That charisma leads to leadership. But in fact, in all of my research the opposite is true. Charisma doesn't cause you to become a leader. Being a leader makes you charismatic. And when we look at someone like Nathan, who's quite shy, he doesn't come across as someone who, you know, could take a Jimmy Stewart role in a movie. RAZ: Or Bill Gates. GODIN: Right. You know, Bill has a lot of trouble making eye contact. Bill has a lot of trouble getting a room of strangers to come around to his point of view. RAZ: Yeah, I mean, he's kind of, like, an awkward guy. GODIN: Yeah. But now, because of the impact his foundation has had with, you know, he and Melinda, he gets charisma. People feel differently around him and one of the things we choose to hide is the idea that, oh, it's not for me. I don't have that thing. And my argument is, yeah, you do. We all do. RAZ: I'm still a little bit hung up on this idea of finding your tribe, right? Like, how would you know who those people are that want to join you? Do they come to you? Do you find them? Is it a little bit of both? GODIN: Well, it starts with this - you're not allowed to say, I'm going to make an average product for average people. And then go find a tribe that's going to adopt it. This is the mistake that people who grew up as you and I did with mass media make all the time. That our instinct is to make average stuff for average people, to have it appeal to lots of folks. When, in fact, tribes never want that. What the tribe wants is the obscure, the remarkable, the edgy, the thing that's worth talking about. And the fact that everyone has a platform right this minute means that the only reason you're not using it is 'cause you don't want to, not 'cause you're not allowed to. RAZ: It really is amazing 'cause we're going to look back at this time and just say, we didn't understand, we just didn't really understand what was happening. GODIN: That's right. I mean, if you and I had been around in the '30s and we knew what we knew today, the first thing we'd do is buy as many radio and TV licenses as we could afford because it was a license to print money for 70 years. Well, that's what's going on right now, except the licenses are free. And so the question is, who's going to invest the time? You know, I point out to people, I'm not the best blogger there ever was, but I've been persistent at it. Anyone could've done what I did. But they didn't. And we keep making the same mistake again and again where we say, oh, no, no. That's not for me, someone else is going to do that one. RAZ: I'm interested in this idea of disruption, right? 'Cause if you read, like, a business magazine or you hear a lecture from, like, a business school, they all talk about being disruptive. And yet, like, a lot of places don't want disruption. They don't want people to come in and lead it to a new, uncertain place. It's scary. GODIN: I think it's fair to say almost no one wants disruption. I think that what almost everyone does want is something better. And the art of disruption then is being able to figure out what is the likely path to get you from here to that better place with the least amount of appropriate fallout. So, you know, I spoke to the Newspaper Publishers of America 15 years ago and described in fairly startling detail, how the entire industry was going to fall apart and die. And that's not a useful form of disruption because I wasn't able to describe to them which boats they needed and which river they ought to start crossing right now. And if you want to be a leader, part of what you need to do is leverage the tools you've got, the people you have and the momentum you have to do something that might not be comfortable and might not be fun, but at least takes you to a new place in a way that's productive and useful. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)GODIN: Now, there's a million things I could share with you about the mechanics here. But let me just try a couple. The Beatles did not invent teenagers. They merely decided to lead them. You don't need permission from people to lead them. But in case you do, here it is. They're waiting. We're waiting for you to show us where to go next. So here's what leaders have in common. The first thing is they challenge the status quo. They challenge what's currently there. The second thing is they build a culture - a secret language, a seven second handshake. A way of knowing that you're in or out. They have curiosity, curiosity about the people in the tribe, curiosity about outsiders. They're asking questions. They connect people to one another. Do you know what people want more than anything? They want to be missed. They want to be missed the day they don't show up. They want to be missed when they're gone. And tribe leaders can do that. And finally, they commit. They commit to the cause. They commit to the tribe. They commit to the people who are there. RAZ: So it sounds like we're, I mean, we're in the middle of this, like, this revolutionary thing happening all around us and yet we haven't adapted this notion of leadership to the times yet. GODIN: Right. But if we look at, you know, let's say we take a fourth grade class - and statistics being what they are - 10 percent of the people in that class are in the top 10 percent when it comes to leadership. Take those people of the class. Now, we've taken the natural leaders out. If a problem shows up, someone else is going to come up, step up and lead to deal with that problem. Take that person out. It's going to keep going until there's only three people left. And what that ought to say to you is that the excuses that you are using when you hesitate to lead are just that. They are excuses from fear. They are not based on your particular abilities. But once you get taught that when you're 8 or 10 or 12 or 15 and it becomes a habit, it's going to change everything because you're not going to stop. RAZ: Seth Godin. Google Seth to find out more about him. Just try that. One word, Seth. Or find several of his talks at TED. com. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"PEOPLE IN CHARGE\")RAZ: By the way, do you know how much grief I get for being - like being the liaison of this playground? GODIN: I'm sure. RAZ: Oh my God - people are just - all the time they're like, why are you doing this? Why that? Why this? Why that? Sometimes I'm like, maybe I don't want to leave this thing. Just pack it in. GODIN: My small suggestion is you bring a clipboard with you and every time someone makes a suggestion, you hand them the clipboard and ask them to write it down. RAZ: That's actually - that's a good tactic. I think I'm going to do that. GODIN: Just the act of having them write it down is helpful.

GODIN: When we sense that there's a vacuum at the PTA, or a vacuum, you know, in our local intramural hockey club, or a vacuum in our political party, someone feels enough push that they overcome that internal resistance and say, all right I'll do it. Let's go. RAZ: Yeah, they just show up. GODIN: Yeah. RAZ: Yeah, our local park needed a new playground and there's a volunteer group and I just sort of, like, showed up at the meetings. And lo and behold, I've got kids and they were like, hey, you got kids, you want to, sort of, be in charge of this? And, like, I'm in charge of it now. Like, people come to me and ask me questions about the progress of the new playground. GODIN: Bingo. And I would guess that they're lucky to have you. The thing that's interesting about your story is, it sounds like there was a little bit of permission given to you, that someone said, hey, Guy, do you want to do this? And part of my thesis is that more and more, we don't have to wait to be picked. RAZ: Here's Seth Godin on the TED stage. GODIN: The Internet was supposed to homogenize everyone by connecting us all. Instead what it's allowed is silos of interest. So you got the red-hat ladies over here. You got the red-hot triathletes over there. You got the organized armies over here. You got the disorganized rebels over there. You got people in white hats making food, and people in white hats sailing boats. The point is that you can find Ukrainian folk dancers and connect with them 'cause you want to be connected. The people on the fringes can find each other, connect and go somewhere. But we don't think about it that way and we haven't spent a lot of time talking about what that process is like. And I've been studying it for a couple years and I want to share a couple stories with you today. First, about a guy named Nathan Winograd. Nathan was the number two person at the San Francisco SPCA. And what you may not know about the history of the SPCA is it was founded to kill dogs and cats. Cities gave them a charter to get rid of the stray animals on the street and destroy them. And in a typical year, 4 million dogs and cats were killed. Most of them within 24 hours of being scooped off the street. Nathan and his boss saw this and they could not tolerate it. So they set out to make San Francisco a no kill city. Create an entire city where every dog and cat, unless it was ill or dangerous, would be adopted, not killed. And everyone said it was impossible. Nathan and his boss went to the city council to get a change in the ordinance and people from SPCA's and humane shelters from around the country flew to San Francisco to testify against them. To say it would hurt the movement and it was inhumane. They persisted and Nathan went directly to the community. He connected with people who cared about this,  non-professionals, people with passion. And within just a couple of years, San Francisco became the first no kill city. Running no deficit, completely supported by the community. Nathan left and went to Tompkins County, New York, a place as different from San Francisco as you can be and still be in the United States. And he did it again. And then he went to North Carolina and did it again. And he went to Reno and he did it again. RAZ: Now, one interesting thing Seth says he learned from studying leaders is that a lot of them, including Nathan Winograd from San Francisco, are not exactly textbook leadership material. They're not charismatic or inspiring. At least not at first. GODIN: Yeah, I mean, there's a nonsense belief, which is that leaders have this sort of, glib. George Clooney-like or even Adolf Hitler-like affect to them. And that's probably the first time both of them have ever been mentioned in the same sentence. And that you need to have that in order to lead. That charisma leads to leadership. But in fact, in all of my research the opposite is true. Charisma doesn't cause you to become a leader. Being a leader makes you charismatic. And when we look at someone like Nathan, who's quite shy, he doesn't come across as someone who, you know, could take a Jimmy Stewart role in a movie. RAZ: Or Bill Gates. GODIN: Right. You know, Bill has a lot of trouble making eye contact. Bill has a lot of trouble getting a room of strangers to come around to his point of view. RAZ: Yeah, I mean, he's kind of, like, an awkward guy. GODIN: Yeah. But now, because of the impact his foundation has had with, you know, he and Melinda, he gets charisma. People feel differently around him and one of the things we choose to hide is the idea that, oh, it's not for me. I don't have that thing. And my argument is, yeah, you do. We all do. RAZ: I'm still a little bit hung up on this idea of finding your tribe, right? Like, how would you know who those people are that want to join you? Do they come to you? Do you find them? Is it a little bit of both? GODIN: Well, it starts with this - you're not allowed to say, I'm going to make an average product for average people. And then go find a tribe that's going to adopt it. This is the mistake that people who grew up as you and I did with mass media make all the time. That our instinct is to make average stuff for average people, to have it appeal to lots of folks. When, in fact, tribes never want that. What the tribe wants is the obscure, the remarkable, the edgy, the thing that's worth talking about. And the fact that everyone has a platform right this minute means that the only reason you're not using it is 'cause you don't want to, not 'cause you're not allowed to. RAZ: It really is amazing 'cause we're going to look back at this time and just say, we didn't understand, we just didn't really understand what was happening. GODIN: That's right. I mean, if you and I had been around in the '30s and we knew what we knew today, the first thing we'd do is buy as many radio and TV licenses as we could afford because it was a license to print money for 70 years. Well, that's what's going on right now, except the licenses are free. And so the question is, who's going to invest the time? You know, I point out to people, I'm not the best blogger there ever was, but I've been persistent at it. Anyone could've done what I did. But they didn't. And we keep making the same mistake again and again where we say, oh, no, no. That's not for me, someone else is going to do that one. RAZ: I'm interested in this idea of disruption, right? 'Cause if you read, like, a business magazine or you hear a lecture from, like, a business school, they all talk about being disruptive. And yet, like, a lot of places don't want disruption. They don't want people to come in and lead it to a new, uncertain place. It's scary. GODIN: I think it's fair to say almost no one wants disruption. I think that what almost everyone does want is something better. And the art of disruption then is being able to figure out what is the likely path to get you from here to that better place with the least amount of appropriate fallout. So, you know, I spoke to the Newspaper Publishers of America 15 years ago and described in fairly startling detail, how the entire industry was going to fall apart and die. And that's not a useful form of disruption because I wasn't able to describe to them which boats they needed and which river they ought to start crossing right now. And if you want to be a leader, part of what you need to do is leverage the tools you've got, the people you have and the momentum you have to do something that might not be comfortable and might not be fun, but at least takes you to a new place in a way that's productive and useful. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) GODIN: Now, there's a million things I could share with you about the mechanics here. But let me just try a couple. The Beatles did not invent teenagers. They merely decided to lead them. You don't need permission from people to lead them. But in case you do, here it is. They're waiting. We're waiting for you to show us where to go next. So here's what leaders have in common. The first thing is they challenge the status quo. They challenge what's currently there. The second thing is they build a culture - a secret language, a seven second handshake. A way of knowing that you're in or out. They have curiosity, curiosity about the people in the tribe, curiosity about outsiders. They're asking questions. They connect people to one another. Do you know what people want more than anything? They want to be missed. They want to be missed the day they don't show up. They want to be missed when they're gone. And tribe leaders can do that. And finally, they commit. They commit to the cause. They commit to the tribe. They commit to the people who are there. RAZ: So it sounds like we're, I mean, we're in the middle of this, like, this revolutionary thing happening all around us and yet we haven't adapted this notion of leadership to the times yet. GODIN: Right. But if we look at, you know, let's say we take a fourth grade class - and statistics being what they are - 10 percent of the people in that class are in the top 10 percent when it comes to leadership. Take those people of the class. Now, we've taken the natural leaders out. If a problem shows up, someone else is going to come up, step up and lead to deal with that problem. Take that person out. It's going to keep going until there's only three people left. And what that ought to say to you is that the excuses that you are using when you hesitate to lead are just that. They are excuses from fear. They are not based on your particular abilities. But once you get taught that when you're 8 or 10 or 12 or 15 and it becomes a habit, it's going to change everything because you're not going to stop. RAZ: Seth Godin. Google Seth to find out more about him. Just try that. One word, Seth. Or find several of his talks at TED. com. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"PEOPLE IN CHARGE\") RAZ: By the way, do you know how much grief I get for being - like being the liaison of this playground? GODIN: I'm sure. RAZ: Oh my God - people are just - all the time they're like, why are you doing this? Why that? Why this? Why that? Sometimes I'm like, maybe I don't want to leave this thing. Just pack it in. GODIN: My small suggestion is you bring a clipboard with you and every time someone makes a suggestion, you hand them the clipboard and ask them to write it down. RAZ: That's actually - that's a good tactic. I think I'm going to do that. GODIN: Just the act of having them write it down is helpful.

I'm Arun Rath. This was a bad week for advocates of net neutrality. A federal court struck down Federal Communications Commission rules intended to prevent broadband service providers from, for example, favoring one website over another. NPR's Laura Sydell says consumer advocates are worried, the decision could ultimately mean higher prices for your Internet service. LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE: The regulations said that your Internet service provider or ISP can't favor some kinds of Web traffic over others. So, say, your ISP strikes a deal with Amazon Prime for its video streaming service, but you subscribe to Netflix. Your ISP could put Amazon on a high-speed lane on its network and relegate Netflix to a slower lane, making it less appealing. Now, Netflix might offer to pay Verizon more to get in the fast lane, and they may pass that cost onto you. So no more 7. 99 a month for all you want to watch. There's even some concern here among political groups. For example, the Christian Coalition has been a supporter of network neutrality rules because they worry that if, say, Verizon was interested in lobbying for a particular cause, it might slow traffic or block access to websites with alternative points of view. RATH: Before the rules were made in 2010, was there any evidence that ISPs were blocking traffic? SYDELL: As a matter of fact, there was. And it's actually why these rules were put on the books. Here's what happened. Back in around 2007, a fan of barbershop quartet music was using the software BitTorrent to uploading Cher's favorite songs. And the upload started to slow to a crawl, and he went public about it. It turns out Comcast was slowing BitTorrent traffic. Some of our listeners may know that BitTorrent software is often used by people who are sharing unauthorized music and movie files, though it's also used by college professors sharing large research papers. But Comcast said BitTorrent traffic was hogging its pipes, so they slowed it. The FCC cited Comcast for slowing it, and Comcast took the FCC to court and it won. And that's when the FCC tried to write the open Internet rules that just go struck down. RATH: So then why did the appeals court strike down those rules? SYDELL: Even further back before Comcast - the Comcast case, the FCC made a decision that's been making it very hard for the commission to regulate traffic on the Internet. It split phone service and Internet service, so the FCC can regulate phones more heavily. But the FCC decided it didn't want to over regulate this new technology known as the Internet. So it put broadband in a different category, something called information services. Verizon didn't like the way the FCC tried to use open Internet rules. It said it looked an awful lot like telephone regulations. Verizon sued, and the D. C. circuit court agreed and ruled that the FCC had to classify Internet differently if it was going to make these kind of regulations. RATH: So where do we go from here? Are consumers going to see some changes to their service? Or is the FCC going to try another way to regulate? SYDELL: Well, theoretically, your ISP can start to make changes right away. But the FCC may not be out of tricks. They could appeal, though the word on the street is that's unlikely. The FCC could try to reclassify broadband and make it more like phone service. But every time they talk about that, some members of Congress go nuts. This decision, however, was not a total loss for the FCC. The court did say the agency has the right to regulate some aspects of Internet service. So it's possible and probably more likely that the agency is going to try and find a way to use the decision to rewrite the rules in a way that fits in with the language of the case. And we could end up going through all of this all over again. RATH: That's NPR's digital culture correspondent Laura Sydell. Laura, thank you. SYDELL: You're welcome.

S. surveillance programs have put President Obama in a tight spot. In a highly anticipated speech yesterday, Mr. Obama outlined his plans for reforming the National Security Agency. He said the U. S. must protect itself while also maintaining the people's trust. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)RATH: A lot of groups were scrutinizing the president's words, but none more closely than American technology companies, which have strongly criticized NSA surveillance practices. NPR's Steve Henn joins us to talk about the reception to the speech in Silicon Valley. Steve, briefly, what did the president propose yesterday? STEVE HENN, BYLINE: Well, I think the biggest news for most Americans will be the announcement that the administration is going to end the bulk collection of Americans' telephone records or end the system at least as we know it now. For the last few years, the NSA has been collecting information about every telephone call made in the United States, not the names of the people attached to the telephone numbers, but what numbers connect to what other numbers and how long those calls last. They built a massive database that allows them to search through networks of connections very quickly. And while the president insisted that this was an important tool that was necessary to preserve for the NSA, the way the system works now will end. Exactly what will replace the system is now unclear. The president also promised greater transparency in the legal process, greater limits on how foreign intelligence could be used in U. S. courts. And he suggested that Congress should pass a law to create a privacy advocate to represent the public's interest in classified national security cases that go before the FISA court. RATH: Because of the nature of NSA surveillance, there's been a direct effect on American tech companies. What were executives from companies like Google and Microsoft hoping to hear from the president yesterday? HENN: Well, they were actually hoping to hear a lot more. A lot of the reforms I just mentioned really spoke to Americans' concerns about surveillance of Americans. And tech executives have been much more focused on how the revelations about the NSA's spying have damaged their company's reputations abroad. They wanted the right to be completely frank with customers about what kinds of information the U. S. government is accessing from their data networks. They also wanted an explicit promise that the NSA would stop breaking into data networks overseas. There have been stories of the NSA tapping the fiber networks that link major tech companies' servers to each other and also breaking encryption. And finally, I think they were hoping for a firm commitment that foreign nationals' digital privacy would be protected in a meaningful way. RATH: And in terms of what the president actually did say, what was the reaction? HENN: Well, I think, really, it was frustration. Mozilla, the nonprofit that makes the Firefox browser, released a statement immediately after the speech arguing that the NSA revelations were pushing countries around the globe to create their own rules and attempts to protect their citizens' data. And whether these rules are really well-meaning or purely opportunistic, the effect that they could have is to sort of balkanize the net. For example, Brazil, which is considering a data protection system that would require all Brazilians' data to be held domestically, would force international companies like Microsoft or Google to start building servers in Brazil and holding all data affecting Brazilians there. For a startup with international ambitions, that's an impossible hurdle or nearly impossible hurdle to clear. So there are real business repercussions to the fallout for many entrepreneurs and executives in this part of the world. RATH: And is there anything the president could've said that would've addressed those concerns? HENN: I think the president tried. Unfortunately, the technology executives were looking for a couple things. First, I think they wanted a firm promise that the NSA would not try to break into the digital networks of American companies abroad. I think another really important thing that went unsaid would've been a commitment that the NSA and the intelligence community would never again try to undermine public encryption standards, that these companies and others all around the world use to protect consumer's data. Neither of those subjects came up, but I think there is a lot of disappointment about that. RATH: That's NPR's tech correspondent Steve Henn. Steve, thank you. HENN: My pleasure.

Firefox is built with open-source code, which means that outsiders and users can audit privacy and security. And the company prides itself on its efforts to protect people's data when they browse the Internet. Alex Fowler is Mozilla's chief privacy officer, and he joins me now from San Francisco. Mr. Fowler, welcome to the program. ALEX FOWLER: Thank you. Pleasure to be here. BLOCK: I was looking at your blog post from Friday, and you sounded pretty skeptical after the president's speech. You said the president didn't address the most glaring reform needs. So what, in your view, would be the most glaring reform need? FOWLER: Well, so right now, we have a policy approach in Washington which is focused on not closing security holes but actually un-hoarding information about security backdoors and holes in our public security standards and using those then to exploit them for intelligence needs. In our perspective, and I think certainly those of your listeners - as you think about the news related to Target data breaches and breaches with Snapchat and other common tools that we use every day - that what we really need is to actually focus on securing those communications platforms so that we can rely on them. And that we know that they are essentially protecting the communications that we're engaged with. BLOCK: Let me try to break this down just a little bit. Is one of the things that you're worried about the government subversion of encryption systems? In other words, the government might inject surveillance code into browsers. This is what's called the backdoor. FOWLER: Exactly. Those are exactly the type of issues where, you know, it's not just by leaving those types of exploits in place, it's not just our intelligence agencies that may be using them to protect national security, but it also leaves them there for hackers and other criminals engaged in trying to break into those particular systems. BLOCK: One of the things that you wrote about in your blog post on Friday was a concern about what you called a world of balkanization of the Internet. Why don't you explain what you mean by that. FOWLER: Yes. So one of the really critical values of the Internet is that it is global, it is distributed, it is very easy for people to gain access to it. And so one of the things that we're always concerned about is any kind of governmental action whereby those countries would be isolating themselves, creating their own versions of the Net and closing off that broader access to information and the ability to contribute back to the broader Internet community. So balkanization is really a notion where you would essentially have a separate Internet for, say, citizens in Brazil than what the same users outside of Brazil would see when they visit those sites. BLOCK: And do you think that's a realistic scenario at this point? FOWLER: Absolutely. A year ago, we were talking about balkanization in the context of Russia and China. And now, we're talking about that in the context of Brazil and Germany, in democratic countries, seeing that as a viable approach to protecting the privacy and security of their citizens. BLOCK: I want to get back to your blog post from Friday, Mr. Fowler. You wrote, Internet users around the world would be well served if the next director of the NSA makes transparency and human rights a true priority. Do you think that's a fair expectation for the head of a spy agency? FOWLER: We do, actually. I mean, we think that any agency, even a spy agency, has to operate in the context that they find themselves. And right now, we are seeing a changing set of public values and concerns as it relates to those particular activities. And so I think it's important to remind ourselves that even an intelligence agency isn't above and beyond the law. BLOCK: I wonder if you - you say there might be just a fundamental contradiction here, given that so much of our daily lives is now digitally recorded and preserved and transmitted, that there's going to be a huge temptation for both tech companies and the government to want to access that data. FOWLER: I'm not sure I would describe it as a contradiction and more as what the responsibilities are for any organization in the business of collecting and using information from users. And I think that that's an important set of concerns that are still evolving. We're still relatively new at this. And so, you know, I would say that, while some best practices exists and industry has been very proactive in thinking about the types of protections and safeguards that they can put in place but, you know, we still look at data breaches, so we know we need to do a lot better. And I think that's a critical area for us as a society in the 21st century to get very effective at. BLOCK: Alex Fowler is chief privacy officer with Mozilla. Mr. Fowler, thank you.

I'm Michel Martin. Coming up, we\u2019ll tell you about a young doctor who did something many thought impossible. She set up the first air ambulance service in Nigeria. She\u2019ll tell us how, and even more important, why she did it. That\u2019s in just a few minutes. But first we go back to a conversation you probably hear a lot these days - about the opportunities in the science and technology fields. For some time now, economists have been predicting that the STEM fields - science, technology, engineering and math - will provide a growing number of the jobs in the coming years. But at the same time, there is concern that people of color could be left behind. Today, we're going to drill down on just one group. According to a study by the National Science Foundation, African-Americans were just 5 percent of scientists and engineers working in their field in 2010, even though blacks represent 12 percent of the U. S. population. And yet there are African-Americans making their mark in the industry. I recently spoke with Freeman Hrabowski. He is the president of the University of Maryland Baltimore County. It is a leader in graduating students of color in the STEM fields. We were joined by digital tech commentator Mario Armstrong and Ayori Selassie. She is the cofounder and executive director of the Bay area-based Pitch Mixer Entrepreneur Forum. That\u2019s a group that helps aspiring tech entrepreneurs pitch their ideas. And I began our conversation by asking Freeman Hrabowski why people should be concerned about matters of race when it comes to science, technology, engineering and math. FREEMAN HRABOWSKI: It matters because the population in our country is becoming increasingly diverse. We know that well before the midpoint of the century - something like 2040 quite frankly - we will no longer talk about minority and majority. We're talking about people of color representing at least 50 percent of the population. And there's so many jobs to be filled. And so we need ways of increasing the number of people from all races - men and women - who can succeed in these areas. MARTIN: Mario, you've been on tour speaking to students across the country. MARIO ARMSTRONG: Yes. MARTIN: Your tour is called Dream, Create, Go! - what do you see as the biggest challenge facing black students in particular? We're focusing on that today. ARMSTRONG: You know what's interesting? I see this huge appetite. Kids want to go into these fields. The problem that I see quite often is that there's a disconnect between connecting why they should pursue these fields and their passions. In other words, a lot of times, I see people wanting to push technology down kids throats and get them to try to fulfill these pipeline issues. Where I think if you take a different approach, which we do on our show, is we try to find out what are kids' passions? And how do we tie - I call it STEAM 'cause we do add arts into this - STEAM - how do we tie that to their passions? Thereby giving them relevancy to wanting to learn math. If you want to become a video game programmer, you cannot do that if you don't understand trigonometry, geometry and the basics of laws of physics. So if you can tap into a child's passion, then you peel back the layers and find out what the STEM or STEAM is in those passions. MARTIN: Ayori, what about you? As we mentioned, you're based in San Francisco and you help aspiring tech entrepreneurs pitch their ideas to experts. What do you see as - why aren't there more African-Americans in Silicon Valley? AYORI SELASSIE: I think it's all social. I think it's all about community and how people gain exposure and how people gain support in those communities. So particularly in the Africa-American community, we've had - we've suffered from the digital divide for a long time. Now we see that closing with mobile devices and things of that nature, but that divide has affected our communities and our society until this point. And so parents are particularly unprepared to handle their children and to support their children in STEAM and STEM - STEM especially. And so we really need to address that social issue and help in that area. MARTIN: Well, could you talk a little more about that, Ayori, because, you know, we were talking about swimming, for example, and we were talking to a famous, you know, Olympic swimmer who's African-American. And he was saying that because a lot of parents of color - black parents in particular - don't have exposure to swimming, they say they treat water like fire. Stay away from it. But that's not really the case with tech is it? I mean, these parents are not discouraging their kids from engaging with it. I mean - so where do you think the gap is? Is it just that they don't know - they don't know how to steer their kids? What do you think it is? SELASSIE: Yeah. So I think that the parents don't discourage the children from going into STEM, but other areas do. Right? So, for example, if you look at the image of technology, if you look at the sciences - do you see African-Americans reflected there in highly visible areas and highly visible positions in the media? No, you don't. So that's an automatic discouragement. But then on the other side, with regard to encouragement, our parents don't generally encourage us to study these areas and say, you know what, you're really going to be great in this area and, by the way, here is how I'm going to support you. So we really need to support the parents and the families and give them that extra support so they know how to encourage them and they really feel supported in encouraging those students. MARTIN: Professor Hrabowski? HRABOWSKI: Right. You might be surprised to know, Michel, that a third of the students who go to college of all races, including African-Americans, go to college with an interest in majoring in STEM. So there is more interest than we know, that's number one. The problem is that most of the students, of all races, who go to college with an interest in STEM don't graduate in STEM. So there are two things to be done. Number one, to encourage more kids to know more about the possibilities. Mario's right, we need to be showing the connection between their passions and the technology. When we bring kids on campus from the city - from Baltimore - to our campus and they see students from 150 countries, including African-Americans, working in technology, really focused on the work - the kids get excited. They want to know about it. They want to know what does it take to get to this point. So we can do that by exposing the children to the possibilities and by helping teachers. We have to give teachers more exposure so that they can know how you use geometry one day in engineering, for example. But secondly, we've got much more to do at the college level in supporting students of all races - including African-Americans - to ensure that those who come with an interest in those areas actually succeed in those areas. MARTIN: If you're just joining us, this is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. This is an encore conversation with Freeman Hrabowski, President of the University of Maryland Baltimore County, Ayori Selassie of Pitch Mixer and digital lifestyle expert Mario Armstrong. We\u2019re talking about some of the challenges minorities face when trying to find support, while seeking education and employment in science, technology, engineering and math - so-called STEM fields. We also asked students from Howard University Middle School about some of their concerns and we heard this from a student named Miles. MILES: As a minority in America, why do you think it is so imperative to give back to the community and why do you think it's important to cooperate with other African-Americans to help other people? MARTIN: Mario do you want to take that? ARMSTRONG: Yeah, I just think that this is exactly what we're talking about, when people want to write off, if you will, kids' interest in really wanting to be positive, impact makers in their lives. This is a seventh-grade kid that's asking a very thought-provoking question. And he's trying to interpret and understand and get the resources and the steps to take. We have to take a more active role of embracing, picking up someone else's child to help them see a role model that they may have not seen before and answer these questions because it's all about - and Dr. Hrabowski will totally support this, and this is what he's all about - it's about problem solving. He's asking a question to solve a problem that he's dealing with. And if we can develop more problem solvers, we have more kids that we'll find into these disciplines. MARTIN: I have a different - I have a different question for Dr. Hrabowski. So, Mario, I'm going to ask you - ask you, though, to focus on his specific point, though. Do you think there is some special obligation? Some people don't think there is. I mean, some people feel that this kind of focusing on different ethnic groups is polarizing and destructive. ARMSTRONG: So look, I come from understanding that perspective as well as wanting to embrace a larger picture. So with that being said, you cannot leave behind - it is my obligation to make sure that I reach back - and in droves, not one or two. If I can impact one, that's great. If someone listening can impact one, that is phenomenal. But if we can impact many within our own culture, that is phenomenal. But I don't want to be exclusive to the broader impact and the broader culture. So, yes. MARTIN: I am going to ask you to answer that, Dr. Hrabowski. HRABOWSKI: I want to answer that. You know what I love about UMBC? Students of all races want to help children. And so I've got kids who are white, Asian-American and African-American working with Baltimore City kids. And what those children see is authenticity. I do want African-Americans to be interested in helping other students, including African-Americans, but I also want people to think about helping children. What happens is this - when those kids of any race see a student or any adult who cares, they connect to that person. And so I want to encourage us, in our country, to reach out to help these children - African-Americans, Hispanic, poor white kids and others. And it's amazing to me how children connect to authenticity. MARTIN: Ayori, I have a question for you. This is from Xavier, who's another student at Howard University Middle School. XAVIER: Do you have a portfolio in the stock market? And what made you want learn entrepreneurship? MARTIN: Drilling right down into your business, Ayori. ARMSTRONG: Love it. SELASSIE: Oh, my God. That's awesome. I do have a portfolio in the stock market. And I've wanted to pursue entrepreneurship because independence is important to me. I wanted to ensure that I was able to provide support for not only my daughter, but also my nieces, my nephews, my grandchildren. And it's really important for us to leave an inheritance for our next generations, and that is our social responsibility. And we really need to really charge forward in fulfilling that. And in order to do that, we have to work together. We have to share. We have to share knowledge. We have to - we can't have those behind us have to do the same struggles that we faced. And so it is our social responsibility to help each other. MARTIN: That was Ayori Selassie of Pitch Mixer. She joined us from member station KQED in San Francisco. Digital lifestyle expert Mario Armstrong was in our New York studios. And here in our Washington, D. C. studio \u2013 Freeman Hrabowski, the president of the University of Maryland Baltimore County.

For up to eight hours, some 500 million people could not get Web pages to load. And the leading theory about what happened is that the Chinese government mistakenly rerouted Internet traffic.

The truth though is equally intriguing and joining us to explain is Nicole Perlroth. She covers cyber security for The New York Times. Nicole, welcome. NICOLE PERLROTH: Hi, thanks for having me. BLOCK: And let's talk first, Nicole, about the extent of what happened. You had one Internet analyst tell you half the world's Internet users trying to access the Internet couldn't? PERLROTH: That's right. About 500 million Internet users in China trying to access the Internet couldn't reach various websites. This is something that didn't just affect Chinese Internet users, it affected major Chinese companies, like Baidu and Saina. So this was - we're calling it now the biggest Internet outage ever. BLOCK: And as you've been reporting, the suspicion is that all of this has to do with what's known as the Great Firewall in China. So what's the explanation for how this happened? PERLROTH: That's right. So the Great Firewall actually means Chinese Internet censors that decide which websites can be accessed and which cannot. But it appears that instead of blocking several websites, China's firewall actually inadvertently fired all of Chinese Internet traffic to those websites. BLOCK: So instead of blocking certain sites, what you're saying is that China actually reversed the flow in a huge way. PERLROTH: Sure, that's the working theory. Basically anyone trying to access these sites was being redirected to this one IP address. It was registered to a company called Sophidea Inc. that was registered to a physical address in Cheyenne, Wyoming. That does not mean that all this Internet traffic was flooding to this one physical address in Wyoming. It means that it was flooding to all the servers that support this one IP address that had a mailing address in Cheyenne, Wyoming. BLOCK: The New York Times had a headline for while, your own paper: Chinese Internet Traffic Redirected To Small Wyoming House. Turns out not quite the case, right? PERLROTH: Right, not quite the case. So when I looked at the address listed in Internet records it was the name of an address in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Wyoming Corporate Services acts as a physical address for thousands of businesses, and so Sophidea Inc. was just one of them. BLOCK: Tell us more about this company, Sophidea. Who is it? What do they do? PERLROTH: Sophidea, we don't know much about it. But it does look like the company appears to offer services that help people mask their Internet addresses. If someone wanted to send someone spam but not be traceable, for example, or if someone wanted to evade a firewall, like China's Great Firewall. So Sophidea's site would have been a target for a China's Internet censors. BLOCK: And this was the case for another company that had the same thing happen, too, right? Dynamic Internet Technology had the same thing happen, all of this traffic started flooding in. PERLROTH: That's right. A huge wave of traffic started flooding servers for DIT, as well. And DIT is operated by a Falung Gong supporter who supports various sites that have been critical of the Chinese government. And again, these are sites that the Great Firewall would take great pains to block. BLOCK: Is it clear, Nicole, that this was not deliberate, that this actually was accidental? PERLROTH: It does appear that it was accidental. We can't say for certain what happened. But the only entity that really has this capability would've been the Great Firewall itself. So the working theory is that in attempting to block some of these sites, the technology sort of backfired and may have accidentally redirected this huge flood of traffic from inside China at these sites.

I'm Celeste Headlee. Michel Martin is away. Coming up, hockey is gaining popularity among minorities. We'll talk with journalist and blogger William Douglas about what to watch for and whether the Sochi Olympics could bring America another miracle on ice, and why we're seeing more blacks on the ice as well. First, though, Americans are reading differently than they used to - more e-books, more audiobooks and more young people choosing not to read. Joining me now to talk about America's reading habits are Kathryn Zickuhr. She's a research associate at the Pew Research Center's Internet Project. And Elissa Malespina, school librarian at South Orange Middle School in New Jersey. Welcome to both of you. KATHRYN ZICKUHR: Thanks for having me. ELISSA MALESPINA: Thank you for having me. HEADLEE: I found that one of the more surprising things in the Pew report was the fact that, perhaps, the death of print were greatly exaggerated, right? I mean, people, Kathryn, are still reading books largely on traditional format, right? ZICKUHR: Yes, and this is something that we've seen throughout our research that print is still really the foundation of Americans' reading habits. They are reading more e-books. HEADLEE: Right. ZICKUHR: About 3 in 10 adults read an e-book last year. But really when it comes down to it, most people read in print as well. Very few people read - just about 4 to 5 percent of readers read only e-books and not print. HEADLEE: OK. So the Pew study caught up with people beginning at age 18. Elissa, what are you seeing in kids? What do they want to read? Do they want to go and take a Kindle or an e-book? Or how are they choosing to read? MALESPINA: You know what? I'm seeing them read on all different devices. It's my job as a school librarian to make sure that I have all these devices for my students because some like audiobooks, some like e-books and some do like print. But really, what we found, is - I have found as a librarian is that print is not dead by any means. Really, my Nooks don't get checked out nearly as much as my books do. And really when they're reading - when they want a fiction book, they want to read the print book. HEADLEE: Well, let's talk a little bit about e-books and audiobooks, though, because another interesting point, Kathryn, from the Pew study is that among blacks, you saw a lot of interest in audiobooks and e-books as well. Do we have any idea why? ZICKUHR: That is such a fascinating question because this is a case where there are no differences between whites and blacks for e-book reading and audiobook listening, which is really interesting because in the past we have - we often see differences. HEADLEE: There's been a big gap, yeah. ZICKUHR: And this is also really interesting because whites are more likely to own e-readers or tablets or e-readers, especially - those devices that are really made just for reading e-books. HEADLEE: A Kindle or a Nook. ZICKUHR: Yeah. So the experiences of African-Americans reading e-books might also be a little different because they might be more likely to read them on desktops or laptops or even on cell phones rather than just on these devices. HEADLEE: Now, Elissa, one of the supposed benefits or predicted benefits of, say, an e-reader was that it would attract younger readers, right? That they like gadgets. They like electronics. And they might be more likely to read if they had a digital device. What have you seen in that particular corner? MALESPINA: I think that if you give them just an e-reader, they love it because then they can read their books. They have numerous books on them. They have the ability to, you know, really go at it. But a lot of times these devices are not just an e-reader. They're also a tablet. So they get distracted by the apps and all of the other things that go along with it. And reading sometimes takes a backseat. I know in my library, I specifically bought devices that were just for books because I didn't want them to have that distraction. HEADLEE: Well, let's talk about distracted teens because there's a new Nielsen book report, Elissa, that shows that between 2011 and 2013, the number of U. S. teenagers who say they don't read for fun has gone up to 41 percent, which scares me, Elissa. I mean, are teenagers less interested in reading? Perhaps, they are too distracted by their smartphone and, as you say, like an iPad or another tablet? MALESPINA: You know what? It didn't shock me, the statistics, sadly. I wish I could say that it did. But with students having more access and kids having more access to computers, tablets, phones and all of that, they're not spending as much time, say, reading for pleasure. But the thing is, how do you define reading? And that was a good point that somebody brought up on Twitter today. If we're defining reading as, you know, reading a blog post, reading a fan forum, you know, reading the Minecraft forum, then, you know what, our kids are doing that. But if we're defining reading as just, maybe, books, then maybe it's not. So it's one of those statistics that I think is rather interesting 'cause kids are really getting pulled in a lot of different directions with extracurricular activities, lots of homework. So sometimes, sadly, reading takes a backseat. HEADLEE: So, Kathryn, what do you take away from this study? How have Americans' reading habits changed? ZICKUHR: Well, I think one of the first things to keep in mind just when we're talking about e-books, for instance, is just - people who read e-books are really big readers. HEADLEE: OK. ZICKUHR: They aren't different in many ways than other readers. They tend to skew a little younger, probably because the technological component, but they love to read. And they also really still value books as physical objects surprisingly enough. HEADLEE: An actual book, not a blog post, as Elissa was describing. ZICKUHR: Right. I mean, that reading is much harder to capture. I mean, if I were to ask you in a survey about what you've read yesterday, I mean, you could read so many things. HEADLEE: I could tell you. I just finished a novel called \"Night Film. \" But, yeah, I am an avid book reader. Yeah. ZICKUHR: But you probably also read, you know - you might've read Twitter. . . HEADLEE: Newspaper articles, right. ZICKUHR: . . . Facebook, newspaper articles, the side of a cereal box. Like, that's much harder. So we're really focusing on this - what we can quantify with books. And that's been really interest. And I know a lot of people are very interested in this younger generation, especially because for a lot of people reading today for the adults in our surveys. . . HEADLEE: Yeah. ZICKUHR: . . . They grew up reading print books. And they have, often, very warm memories around print books and reading. HEADLEE: Yeah. ZICKUHR: So that's still a big part of their habits. HEADLEE: The smell of a library book, you can't replace it. ZICKUHR: Exactly. HEADLEE: Kathryn Zickuhr is research associate at the Pew Research Center's Internet Project. And Elissa Maelspina is school librarian at South Orange Middle School in New Jersey. Thanks to both of you. MALESPINA: Thank you so much for having us. ZICKUHR: Thank you.

The L. A. Times reported last week that Paramount Pictures, the studio that made \"Anchorman 2,\" will move to a completely digital format to distribute its films to theaters. It's a shift with huge implications, not just for cinephiles who are attached to the warmth and quality of 35 millimeter film, but for archivists who rely on film as a medium that will stand the test of time. Jan-Christopher Horak is the director of the UCLA Film and Television Archive. It's one of the largest repositories of moving images in the world, so he's been playing close attention to the move toward digital. He joined us from our bureau at NPR West. Welcome to the program. JAN-CHRISTOPHER HORAK: Thank you for having me. MARTIN: So I want to start by talking about the idea of archiving. I can imagine that archiving digitally is a lot easier, right? Making this move to digital, a good idea? HORAK: Actually, it is not easier. It is more difficult. With 35 millimeter film, which we've had for the last 120 years, we can take a film - a negative or even a print - and we can put it into a vault. And as long as we store it cold and dry enough, we will know it will last for 500 to a thousand years. (LAUGHTER)HORAK: With digital there's the issue that the formats keep changing. So the life expectancy of most digital files, these days, is 18 months to two years. And so, when you put away or archive a digital film, you have to migrate it to a new format every five years, maybe outside 10 years, but probably not. And the cost for migrating one film is going to be about $20,000. MARTIN: And you talk about the risks of digital archiving, that things can just disappear. Can you give us some examples of important films that perhaps are no longer because of this? HORAK: It does happen but it also happens that just single files disappear. \"Toy Story 2,\" in production, they virtually lost everything. There is quite a funny animated film on the YouTube that you can see about how the only way they saved it was because of the makers had it on their home computer. And they literally, like with an ambulance, rushed to the house, packed this computer in cotton and gingerly brought it back to the studio because those were the only remaining files on over a hundred million dollar production. MARTIN: Oh, man. Why do studios want to do this? Why are they supporting this move to digital, if it's so risky and expensive? HORAK: It's expensive when we're talking about archiving. It is for the studios, of course, much cheaper when we're talking about distribution. In the old days, you know, a big film, they would have made five to 7,000 prints and had to ship them out all over the country. Nowadays, they put them on a DCP and, I think, in the very near future they're just going to shoot them up to a satellite and shoot them down into the theaters, so that distribution costs are significantly less. MARTIN: Sounds like the future is moving towards digital come what may. So how do you try to hedge against the risks that you've outlined? HORAK: Digital is the future and we are, of course, are not against digital. However, I strongly believe that in order to protect your investments, whether you're in the studio, or protect your artifacts, as in an archive, it is still necessary to at least make a negative on film so they know they have at least one copy that is safe and protected no matter what they do in the digital realm. MARTIN: Jan-Christopher Horak is the director of the UCLA Film and Television Archive. He talked to us from our studios at NPR West in Culver City, California.

Now, Apple is by no means in trouble. They had recorded more than $13 billion in profits last quarter. It has more than $160 billion in cash and is still setting new sales records. But as NPR's Steve Henn reports, Apple's fans and investors have been waiting for the next big thing for years. STEVE HENN, BYLINE: Apple wasn't the first computer company to introduce a mouse, and it wasn't the first tech company to use a touch-screen. But for millions - actually, for more than a billion people now, the Mac and then the iPhone and the iPad have transformed how we interact with machines. TIM COOK: This is still alive and kicking here in a big way - to create the next product and to see around the next corner. HENN: For Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, talking about the future of computing is a tricky business. Anything he says, any hint of interest in a new kind of device or service can set off a flurry of speculation. But let's leave behind whether or not Apple is going to release a smart watch or a new flat-screen TV, or revolutionize mobile payments. Because when I think about how this company has changed computing, I think the really big innovations have all centered around how people interact with the devices Apple makes. So when I interviewed Cook about the 30th anniversary of the Mac, I asked him how he thought people would interact with computers and devices 30 years from now, what role would the person play? COOK: There are things going on now in the labs that I can't talk about, but input is a huge, huge area for innovation, and it's not stopping in 2014. BUD TRIBBLE: We have tens of thousands times as much computing power today as we did 30 years ago. HENN: Bud Tribble is Apple's vice president of software technology and one of the original designers of the Macintosh. TRIBBLE: Apple's point of view is that one of the best uses of that computing power is to use that to adapt the computer to the person using it, not the other way around. COOK: A lot of what we do is explore things and keep pulling the string. And if you do that long enough and you have faith that it will lead you somewhere because your gut tells you so strongly this is unbelievable, that it's great, that's exactly what created the iPhone, was that kind of thinking. HENN: What is Tim Cook's team at Apple thinking about now? What strings are they pulling? Well, probably lots of them. And they aren't going to talk about it too much. But there are some intriguing clues about what they're up to. And for me, one of the most intriguing is Apple's recent purchase of PrimseSense. PrimeSense is a little Israeli company that makes a couple killer 3-D sensors. A year ago, I met a little robot named Turtle that was using a PrimeSense chip to see. ANDREA TUNBRIDGE: And when you turn it on, you just need to walk right in front of it and then it will follow you around. HENN: That's Andrea Tunbridge. So it's sort of like a little baby gosling that imprints, or a puppy dog? I turn it on, take a few steps. And when I stop, Turtle lightly nudges my shoe. Oh, my God. So now, it's following me. Now, if I just walk away, do I get to keep the robot? The same technology that allows Turtle to navigate through the world can also help a machine recognize gestures or someone's gait or an individual member of a family. These chips can be attached to a projector and transform a wall into a touch-screen. They're now small enough to be built into a tablet and used to map the world in three dimensions. Yaniv Vakrat was a VP at PrimeSense before Apple bought the company. YANIV VAKRAT: We believe that it's as revolutionary as anything that you've seen because it really is changing the way machines perceive their environment. HENN: Machines that can really see the world around them will be able to interact with people in all sorts of new ways. So does Apple have a plan to build these chips, these little sensors into its devices anytime soon? Frankly, I have no idea, but I'm pretty sure that inside Apple's labs right now, they're pulling on this string. Steve Henn, NPR News, Silicon Valley.

ALESSANDRO ACQUISTI: Hi there. RAZ: So there are a couple things I know about you. ACQUISTI: I'm curious. RAZ: This is Alessandro Acquisti. He teaches at Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh. So you're 40 or 41, roughly, right? ACQUISTI: Mhm. RAZ: You studied at Trinity in Dublin, at the LSC in London, PhD at Berkeley. ACQUISTI: That is true. RAZ: Your father's name is Giancarlo. He's a banker, but really his passion was for the piano. And together you wrote an opera about the painter Raphael and his lover. ACQUISTI: That's correct. RAZ: Alessandro studies the consequences of sharing private information. So that's just like a little bit of information, but even little things can become hugely sensitive information. ACQUISTI: Yes, you can start from little pieces, and you can build more and more personal, more and more interesting, and sometimes more and more sensitive information. RAZ: And how? Alessandro's about to blow your mind from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)ACQUISTI: Back in the year 2000, about 100 billion photos were shot worldwide, but only a miniscule proportion of them were actually uploaded online. In 2010, only on Facebook in a single month, 2. 5 billion photos were uploaded. Most of them identified. In the same span of time, computers' ability to recognize people in photos improved by three orders of magnitude. What happens when you combine these technologies together - increasing availability of facial data, improving facial recognizing ability by computers, but also cloud computing, which gives anyone in this theater the kind of computational power, which a few years ago, was only the domain of three letter agencies. Well, we conjecture that the result of this combination of technologies will be a radical change in our very notions of privacy and anonymity. RAZ: And Alessandro found that it's not that hard to use this technology to do some pretty unbelievable things like, identifying a stranger's name just from a snapshot or even predicting their Social Security number from when and where they were born. By the way, all stuff you can find on Google or Facebook. See, what I don't get is, as individuals, we are going to be on the hook for this, right, because we trade our privacy for convenience, right. Like, I like burritos, right, so sometimes I'll order a burrito from Chipotle, right. And I'll use the app on my phone because it is so convenient. And then I'll just walk in, and I'll just pick up my burrito. And it's already wrapped in that silver foil. It's perfect. And they know every burrito I have ever ordered from them because it comes from my phone through my app. Who knows what they're going to do with that information? ACQUISTI: When you give away personal information, nowadays, you must often get some kind of immediate discount, some kind of immediate benefits. It could be you having the convenience of ordering the burrito from your app, and the burrito is ready when you want it, exactly how you want it. It could be you uploading a photo in a social network, and your friends click on 'like,' 'like,' 'like,' which gives you these little, but important psychological boosts. Whereas, the potential cost of doing so are, first of all, uncertain. There could be no cost whatsoever or there could be a cost. If there is a cost, it will not appear, most likely, now. It will happen down the line. It could happen five years later when a potential employer sees this particular photo of you, and doesn't like this photo at all. Or from your eating habits, I can infer your likelihood of getting high cholesterol. . . RAZ: Yeah. ACQUISTI: . . . Or developing certain diseases. RAZ: So, like, insurers - insurance could look at your social media history. ACQUISTI: Yes. I can certainly imagine it. RAZ: I mean, they are - insurers and potential employers and university administrators, I mean, they all have access to this information. They can build a pretty good profile of almost anybody in the world who has ever been on the Internet and who has ever logged in. ACQUISTI: Well, the individual administrator, the individual employer or the individual insurance company - not yet have the ability of finding everything about anyone. That's something that maybe search engines and social networks can do. As we reveal more and more about ourselves, as the commerce and the trade in personal information becomes more accepted and prevalent - whether, indeed, there will be shops where I can go and buy all the information about you before, you know, I want to hire you or before, you know, we go on a date. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)ACQUISTI: In a movie which came out a few years ago - \"Minority Report,\". . . (SOUNDBITE OF MOVIE, \"MINORITY REPORT\")NARRATOR: A road diverges in the dessert. . . ACQUISTI: . . . A famous scene had Tom Cruise walk in a mall. (SOUNDBITE OF MOVIE, \"MINORITY REPORT\")NARRATOR: The road you're on, John Anderton, is the one less traveled. ACQUISTI: And holographic personalized advertising would appear around him. (SOUNDBITE OF MOVIE, \"MINORITY REPORT\")UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER #1: John Anderton. UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER #2: Try one night. . . UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER #3: You could use a Guinness right about now. UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER #4: John Anderton. UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER #5: Get away, John Anderton. ACQUISTI: Now the movie is set in 2054, about 40 years from now. And as exciting as that technology looks, it already vastly underestimates the amount of information the organization can get about you. And now they can use it to influence you in a way that you will not even detect. So as an example, imagine that an organization has access to your list of Facebook friends. And through some kind of algorithm, they can detect the two friends that you like the most. And then they create, in real-time, a facial composite of these two friends. Now studies prior to ours have shown that people don't recognize, any longer, even themselves in facial composites, but they react to those composites in a positive manner. So next time you are looking for a certain product and there is an ad suggesting you to buy it, it will not be just a standard spokesperson. It will be one of your friends. And you will not even know that this is happening. RAZ: That's creepy. I mean, that scares me. ACQUISTI: You suddenly don't want to order burritos with your app any longer? RAZ: I don't want to order burritos with my app anymore. No. ACQUISTI: Do you know the story about the frog and the boiling water? RAZ: That you put them in there slowly, and they kind of just hangout and heat it up slowly. But if you throw it in the boiling water, it jumps out. That one? ACQUISTI: Right. I've always been wondering when it comes to privacy, whether we are like the frog in the water. And the water is slowly getting hotter and hotter, and then it's boiling, and we just stay there. Because the need to disclose and to share is a very important human need, but so is the need for privacy. RAZ: Are you worried about where this is going? ACQUISTI: I am concerned, and not in the sense that I expect to live in a \"Big Brother,\" \"1984,\" kind of world anytime soon. In fact, I am more concerned about the brave new world kind of scenario where we have willingly given away our autonomy in exchange for a little bit of convenience, in exchange for an app, which makes buying the burrito we like much faster, much easier. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)ACQUISTI: I do believe that one of the defining fights of our times will be the fight for the control over personal information. The fight over whether big data will become a force for freedom rather than a force which will hiddenly manipulate us. Right now, many of us do not even know that the fight is going on, but it is whether you like it or not. And I will tell you that the tools for the fight are here - the awareness of what is going on in your hands just a few clicks away. Thank you. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: Alessandro Acquisti.

UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER #5: Get away, John Anderton. ACQUISTI: Now the movie is set in 2054, about 40 years from now. And as exciting as that technology looks, it already vastly underestimates the amount of information the organization can get about you. And now they can use it to influence you in a way that you will not even detect. So as an example, imagine that an organization has access to your list of Facebook friends. And through some kind of algorithm, they can detect the two friends that you like the most. And then they create, in real-time, a facial composite of these two friends. Now studies prior to ours have shown that people don't recognize, any longer, even themselves in facial composites, but they react to those composites in a positive manner. So next time you are looking for a certain product and there is an ad suggesting you to buy it, it will not be just a standard spokesperson. It will be one of your friends. And you will not even know that this is happening. RAZ: That's creepy. I mean, that scares me. ACQUISTI: You suddenly don't want to order burritos with your app any longer? RAZ: I don't want to order burritos with my app anymore. No. ACQUISTI: Do you know the story about the frog and the boiling water? RAZ: That you put them in there slowly, and they kind of just hangout and heat it up slowly. But if you throw it in the boiling water, it jumps out. That one? ACQUISTI: Right. I've always been wondering when it comes to privacy, whether we are like the frog in the water. And the water is slowly getting hotter and hotter, and then it's boiling, and we just stay there. Because the need to disclose and to share is a very important human need, but so is the need for privacy. RAZ: Are you worried about where this is going? ACQUISTI: I am concerned, and not in the sense that I expect to live in a \"Big Brother,\" \"1984,\" kind of world anytime soon. In fact, I am more concerned about the brave new world kind of scenario where we have willingly given away our autonomy in exchange for a little bit of convenience, in exchange for an app, which makes buying the burrito we like much faster, much easier. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) ACQUISTI: I do believe that one of the defining fights of our times will be the fight for the control over personal information. The fight over whether big data will become a force for freedom rather than a force which will hiddenly manipulate us. Right now, many of us do not even know that the fight is going on, but it is whether you like it or not. And I will tell you that the tools for the fight are here - the awareness of what is going on in your hands just a few clicks away. Thank you. (APPLAUSE) RAZ: Alessandro Acquisti.

I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, ideas around privacy - what's been taken and what we've actually given. So in Utah, in a place called Bluffdale - it's about 20 miles south of Salt Lake City - there's a building. And it's sole purpose is to store secrets. MIKKO HYPPONEN: We've only seen photos taken from far away of the building, but we know about the size of the facility. And it's 140,000 square meters, which means it's a massive, massive building. RAZ: So picture the largest Walmart, IKEA, Cosco, Tesco you've ever been in, and now picture five of them. HYPPONEN: It's, in fact, the largest data center on the planet. And that's where our future data and communication will be stored. RAZ: This is Mikko Hypponen. He's a white hat. HYPPONEN: It's my job to keep secrets so. . . RAZ: He's a hacker, but the good kind. He goes after the people who make computer viruses. HYPPONEN: This has been the last 25 years for me. And you also become paranoid in this line of business. You wouldn't believe the things I do to secure my systems and try to keep my own privacy. RAZ: Anyway, that data center in Utah, well, we have a better idea of what might be stored there thanks to Edward Snowden and his trove of classified data from the National Security Agency. And what we do know is that it's the first data storage facility in the world designed to store a yottabyte. So to put this into perspective if your personal computer has like 60 gigabytes of storage, a yottabyte is 16 trillion personal computers. Here's how Mikko described the place in his TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HYPPONEN: We estimate that just the electricity bill for running this data center is going to be in the tens of millions of dollars a year. And this kind of wholesale surveillance means that they can collect our data and keep it basically forever - keep it for extended periods of time, keep it for years, keep it for decades. And this opens up completely new kinds of risks to us all. And what this is is that it is wholesale blanket surveillance on everyone. Well, not exactly everyone because the U. S. intelligence only has a legal right to monitor foreigners. They can monitor foreigners when foreigners' data connections end up in United States or pass through United States. And monitoring foreigners doesn't sound too bad until you realize, in fact, 96 percent of the planet are foreigners, right. And if you look back about the forecasts on surveillance by George Orwell, well, it turns out that George Orwell was an optimist. We are right now seeing much larger scale of tracking of individual citizens than he could have ever imaginedRAZ: I mean, you say that Orwell was an optimist. I mean, you think Orwell was an optimist? It is that bad. HYPPONEN: Yes. RAZ: I mean, I have to admit that a part of me is still, like, not that bothered by it. I don't know. I mean, I am, I guess, a little bit, but most of me, like, I'm not losing sleep over this. It's just - why should any of us really be that bothered by it? HYPPONEN: Because surveillance changes history. In our case, it will change the future because we've come to the day where storing data doesn't cost almost anything anymore. It's so cheap to store all data. It's cheaper to keep it than to delete it. And that means people will change their behavior because they know anything they say online can be used against them in the future. And even though you might not be worried about your everyday chores, you don't really know how future will turn out. We don't want to give away any more of our rights than we absolutely have to because every right we give away, we'll never get it back. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HYPPONEN: And surveillance changes history. We know this through examples of corrupt presidents like Nixon. Imagine if he would've had the kind of surveillance tools that are available today. And let me actually quote the president of Brazil, Mrs. Dilma Rousseff. She was one of the targets of NSA surveillance. Her email was read. And she spoke at the United Nations headquarters. And she said if there's no right to privacy, there can be no true freedom of expression and opinion, and therefore, there can be no effective democracy. And when the leaks started, the very first thing I tweeted about this was a comment about how, you know, when you've been using search engines, you've been potentially leaking all that to U. S. intelligence. And two minutes later, I got a reply by somebody called Kimberly from the United States challenging me like, why am I worried about this? What am I sending to worry about this? Am I sending naked pictures or something? And my answer to Kimberly was that what I'm sending is none of your business, and it should be none of your government's business either 'cause that's what it's about. It's about privacy. Privacy is nonnegotiable. It should be built in to all the systems we use. And one thing we should all understand is that we are brutally honest with search engines. You show me your search history, and I'll find something incriminating or something embarrassing there in five minutes. We are more honest with search engines than we are with our families. Search engines know more about you than your family members know about you. And this is all the kind of information we are giving away. We are giving away to the United States. RAZ: But, I mean, everybody is sharing all this stuff, like, you know, online, on Facebook like what they like, who their friends are, what books they read, what music they listen to and their birthdays, where they live. I mean, they're voluntarily giving away all this information. HYPPONEN: Absolutely they do. And it really makes sense for many people to do exactly that. It's so convenient, it's so nice, it's so easy and everybody else seems to be doing it. But we don't really understand the long-term implications of all of this. That we all share all of our information to the whole world to be recorded and to be stored forever. There is a difference between the stuff that people put online themselves like pictures and their trips and flights and meals they've eaten than the stuff that they don't realize is also going into foreign computers. Like, for example, copies of your emails or every single online search you ever do 'cause all that is being recorded as well. And this applies to normal people. I mean, a normal everyday person who right now has no problem with any government on the planet probably isn't very worried about his Google searches being tracked or his emails being stored. But who knows about the future? Maybe that same person becomes an interesting person in 10 years or 20 years. And with today's technology, that information can be saved and stored for decades and then later used against him. RAZ: I mean, but how? HYPPONEN: Well, let's take an example. I live in Finland. Here in Finland, being gay was illegal in the 1970s. If you were gay in 1970s, you would've been jailed for it, which, of course, nowadays sounds outrageous. However, if our government would have had the same surveillance tools at their disposal in 1970s as they have today, it would've been trivial to find all the gay people and jail all the gay people and keep them in jails, which probably would've meant that the laws would have never changed. And it would still be illegal to be gay. So we don't really know how these new tools that government have at their disposal will change the future, but it's clear they will change the future. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HYPPONEN: Yes part of it is war on terror, and, yes, there are terrorists. And they do kill and maim, and we should fight them. But we know, through these leagues, that they've used the same techniques to listen to phone calls of European leaders, to tap the email of presidents of Mexico and Brazil, to read email traffic inside United Nations' headquarters and EU Parliament. And I don't think they're trying to find terrorists from inside EU Parliament. And there are terrorists, but are we really thinking about terrorists as such an existential threat, we are ready to do anything at all? But people are caring about terrorists. And then they think that maybe that surveillance is OK because, you know, they have nothing to hide. Feel free to survey me if that helps. And whoever tells you that they have nothing to hide, simply haven't thought about this long enough. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: But, I mean, how are we ever going to stop - I mean, Mikko, the train has left the station, right. Like, we can have moral and philosophical and even legal discussions, but that technology is just going to get better and better and better. I guess I wonder whether, in some ways, we just kind of have to surrender and say that most of our lives just won't be private in the future. HYPPONEN: The world is changing. We shouldn't just blindly accept the change. Just because something is technologically possible, it might not be right. And we really have to think about these things now when we can still change them. And if countries that don't like to be surveilled by wholesale blanket surveillance or foreign countries targeting every single citizen, they should do something about that at a political scale. So we the citizens of the world should tell that to our politicians and demand change. RAZ: Mikko Hypponen, white hat hacker. You can watch his entire talk on the NSA and privacy at TED. NPR. org.

BETH NOVECK: Or is privacy dead and we should all get over it? RAZ: Yeah right, and just walk around naked. NOVECK: There's - we have to leave something to the imagination. RAZ: This is Beth Noveck, and her big idea - open up the government. Does that worry you, though, that privacy is disappearing? NOVECK: Does it worry me? Sure. But I think we need to stop, in this conversation, viewing ourselves as the passive victims where data is collected about us, and where we are being manipulated. Those things are true, and they are very urgently worrisome. What we need to do is to think about ourselves as active participants in the conversation. You know, we can go out and gather data, and contributing it to projects and to communities that are interested in using that data to do good. RAZ: And that is exactly what Beth wants all of us to do - citizens, governments, everyone to break open the doors and start an open government revolution. And she actually did that for a while at the Obama White House. Here's the start of her TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)NOVECK: I came in to become the head of open government, to take the values and the practices of transparency, participation and collaboration and instill them into the way that we work - to open up government to work with people. But when I got to the White House at the beginning of 2009 at the start of the Obama administration, the White House was anything but open. Bomb blast curtains covered my windows. We were running Windows 2000. Social media were blocked at the firewall. We didn't have a blog, let alone a dozen Twitter accounts like we have today. So when we wanted to create our open government policy, what did we do? We wanted, naturally, to ask public sector employees how we should open up government. Turns out that had never been done before. We wanted to ask members of the public to help us come up with a policy, not after the fact, commenting on a rule after it's written, the way it's typically the case, but in advance. There was no legal precedent, no cultural precedent, no technical way of doing this. In fact, many people told us it was illegal. Here's the crux of the obstacle. The way that our institutions are designed in our rather 18th-century centralized model is to channel the flow of values through voting once every four years, once every two years, at best, once a year. This is a rather anemic and thin way in this era of social media for us to actually express our values. Let me be clear that I think openness in government doesn't refer simply to transparency alone. It's not just about opening a window onto how government works. It's about raising the barn. We've long had the notion for many years that transparency will help government function better. It will be less corrupt, but as we evolve the technology that causes us and enables us to gather much more information, what we're quickly realizing is that transparency by itself is not enough. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)NOVECK: Today, we have the opportunity and we have the imperative to create thousands of new ways of interconnecting between networks and institutions. The citizen jury, the carrot mob, the hack-a-thon - we are just beginning to invent the models by which we can co-create the process of governance. And we don't fully have a picture of what this will look like yet, but we're seeing pockets of evolution emerging all around us. Maybe not even evolution. I'd even start to call it a revolution in the way that we govern. First phase is in getting better information and the second phase is in getting decision-making power out. Participatory budgeting has long been practiced in Puerto Alegre, Brazil. They're just starting it in the 49th Ward in Chicago. Russia is using wikis to get citizens writing law together, as is Lithuania. When we start to see power over the core functions of government - spending, legislation ,decision-making, then we're well on our way to an open government revolution. RAZ: Like, open government sounds great, right, but that assumes that the government isn't just going to not spy on us, but also, like, if they are going to spy on us, they're not going to let that information get out. Like, how can we trust an open government system when that happened? NOVECK: You know, the revelations of massive surveillance, I think, revealed to us is not, I would say, simply that we can't trust our government, but that our government doesn't trust us. And I think that's the much greater danger and the much better opportunity here for us to confront. And the way that we're going to do that, I would argue, is by being more open about how we design systems that work. You know, one of the saddest outcomes of the Snowden affair is that we have so eroded the trust between government and the American people, and especially between government and the technology industry that it's going to be very hard to get the smartest technologists, whether they're in industry or academia, to work together with government to really figure out how do we protect ourselves and our communities from terrorists and from criminals and from bad guys. RAZ: But, I mean, even with something as simple as Facebook, when you click 'like' on somebody's page, I mean, that's a data point, right. And then say you do participate in, like, open government. I mean, how do you know that that data point isn't going to be used against you? I mean, I know it sounds a little paranoid. I admit it. NOVECK: No, it doesn't. It doesn't sound paranoid at all. I mean, it may sound paranoid in the U. S. but it surely doesn't sound paranoid if you're in Syria. RAZ: Exactly. NOVECK: And it surely doesn't sound paranoid if you're in many countries where we've seen how social media postings has led to somebody being hauled off to the police or to prison or worse. Participating in many cultures is actually actively dangerous. And here it's potentially just viewed as a waste of time because there's the general consensus that no one's listening and no one cares. RAZ: So Edward Snowden gave this video message. And he said that kids born today will never experience privacy. I mean, do you think that's true? NOVECK: I don't think it's true that we've ever experienced privacy by that token. We used to live in small villages and communities, and maybe now even live in an apartment building with a doorman or you go to a school and you live in a workplace. None of us truly experience privacy unless we live in a cave because we are observed, we are watched, we talk about others, they talk about us. I think the point that we are increasing the volume by which that happens with people who are unknown to us is increasingly discomforting to us. And we are having to come to terms as individuals and as a society with what is acceptable. And it's a conversation that I'm glad we're having as a result of recent events. RAZ: Beth Noveck on opening up the government source code. And in a moment, another TED speaker who thinks we can do the same thing with medical research. We're talking ideas around privacy and openness - what we get to keep, what we give away. And if you want to weigh in, check out our collaboration with the Huffington post on this episode.

But when I got to the White House at the beginning of 2009 at the start of the Obama administration, the White House was anything but open. Bomb blast curtains covered my windows. We were running Windows 2000. Social media were blocked at the firewall. We didn't have a blog, let alone a dozen Twitter accounts like we have today. So when we wanted to create our open government policy, what did we do? We wanted, naturally, to ask public sector employees how we should open up government. Turns out that had never been done before. We wanted to ask members of the public to help us come up with a policy, not after the fact, commenting on a rule after it's written, the way it's typically the case, but in advance. There was no legal precedent, no cultural precedent, no technical way of doing this. In fact, many people told us it was illegal. Here's the crux of the obstacle. The way that our institutions are designed in our rather 18th-century centralized model is to channel the flow of values through voting once every four years, once every two years, at best, once a year. This is a rather anemic and thin way in this era of social media for us to actually express our values. Let me be clear that I think openness in government doesn't refer simply to transparency alone. It's not just about opening a window onto how government works. It's about raising the barn. We've long had the notion for many years that transparency will help government function better. It will be less corrupt, but as we evolve the technology that causes us and enables us to gather much more information, what we're quickly realizing is that transparency by itself is not enough. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) NOVECK: Today, we have the opportunity and we have the imperative to create thousands of new ways of interconnecting between networks and institutions. The citizen jury, the carrot mob, the hack-a-thon - we are just beginning to invent the models by which we can co-create the process of governance. And we don't fully have a picture of what this will look like yet, but we're seeing pockets of evolution emerging all around us. Maybe not even evolution. I'd even start to call it a revolution in the way that we govern. First phase is in getting better information and the second phase is in getting decision-making power out. Participatory budgeting has long been practiced in Puerto Alegre, Brazil. They're just starting it in the 49th Ward in Chicago. Russia is using wikis to get citizens writing law together, as is Lithuania. When we start to see power over the core functions of government - spending, legislation ,decision-making, then we're well on our way to an open government revolution. RAZ: Like, open government sounds great, right, but that assumes that the government isn't just going to not spy on us, but also, like, if they are going to spy on us, they're not going to let that information get out. Like, how can we trust an open government system when that happened? NOVECK: You know, the revelations of massive surveillance, I think, revealed to us is not, I would say, simply that we can't trust our government, but that our government doesn't trust us. And I think that's the much greater danger and the much better opportunity here for us to confront. And the way that we're going to do that, I would argue, is by being more open about how we design systems that work. You know, one of the saddest outcomes of the Snowden affair is that we have so eroded the trust between government and the American people, and especially between government and the technology industry that it's going to be very hard to get the smartest technologists, whether they're in industry or academia, to work together with government to really figure out how do we protect ourselves and our communities from terrorists and from criminals and from bad guys. RAZ: But, I mean, even with something as simple as Facebook, when you click 'like' on somebody's page, I mean, that's a data point, right. And then say you do participate in, like, open government. I mean, how do you know that that data point isn't going to be used against you? I mean, I know it sounds a little paranoid. I admit it. NOVECK: No, it doesn't. It doesn't sound paranoid at all. I mean, it may sound paranoid in the U. S. but it surely doesn't sound paranoid if you're in Syria. RAZ: Exactly. NOVECK: And it surely doesn't sound paranoid if you're in many countries where we've seen how social media postings has led to somebody being hauled off to the police or to prison or worse. Participating in many cultures is actually actively dangerous. And here it's potentially just viewed as a waste of time because there's the general consensus that no one's listening and no one cares. RAZ: So Edward Snowden gave this video message. And he said that kids born today will never experience privacy. I mean, do you think that's true? NOVECK: I don't think it's true that we've ever experienced privacy by that token. We used to live in small villages and communities, and maybe now even live in an apartment building with a doorman or you go to a school and you live in a workplace. None of us truly experience privacy unless we live in a cave because we are observed, we are watched, we talk about others, they talk about us. I think the point that we are increasing the volume by which that happens with people who are unknown to us is increasingly discomforting to us. And we are having to come to terms as individuals and as a society with what is acceptable. And it's a conversation that I'm glad we're having as a result of recent events. RAZ: Beth Noveck on opening up the government source code. And in a moment, another TED speaker who thinks we can do the same thing with medical research. We're talking ideas around privacy and openness - what we get to keep, what we give away. And if you want to weigh in, check out our collaboration with the Huffington post on this episode.

I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, the end of privacy. So John Wilbanks believes that we will all be a lot healthier and that we could potentially conquer big diseases like cancer if we just stop obsessing so much about medical privacy. And start to understand that the things that were designed to protect our privacy are actually making medical breakthroughs a lot harder to achieve. And it starts with a concept called informed consent. Here's John's explanation from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)JOHN WILBANKS: Informed consent is an idea that we should be very proud of as a society, right. It's something that separates us from the Nazis in Nuremberg and forced medical experimentation. It's the idea that agreement to join a study without understanding isn't agreement. It's something that protects us from harm, from hucksters, from people that would try to hoodwink us into a clinical study that we don't understand or that we don't agree to. And so you put together the thread of narrative, hypothesis, experimentation in human and informed consent and you get what we call clinical study. And it's how we do the vast majority of medical work. It doesn't really matter if your in the north, the south, the east, the west. Clinical studies form the basis of how we investigate. So if we're going to look at a new drug, right, we test it in people. We draw blood, we do experiments and we gain consent for that study to make sure that we're not screwing people over as part of it. And the way we gain informed consent - this tool that was created to protect us from harm - now creates silos. So the data we collect for prostate cancer or for Alzheimer's trials goes into silos where it can only be used for prostate cancer or for Alzheimer's research, right. It can't be networked. It can't be integrated. It cannot be used by people who aren't credentialed. So a physicist can't get access to it without filing paperwork. A computer scientist can't get access to it without filing paperwork. And this is an accident. These are tools that we created to protect us from harm, but what they're doing is protecting us from innovation now. What really depresses me is that all these studies on prostate cancer and all these studies on skin cancer can't be combined. The answer to prostate cancer may be in skin cancer and vice versa. We don't know. I mean, the chief argument for sharing this information, to me, is the ability to make unanticipated discoveries. RAZ: And this is all because of our misreading of privacy? WILBANKS: Privacy is a piece of it. It's an attempt to protect us from harms that are far less potent than the benefits that we could receive. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)WILBANKS: And that wasn't the goal. It wasn't the point, right. It's a side effect, if you will, of a power we created to take us for good. We cannot take the information from past trials and put them together to form statistically significant samples. And that sucks, right. So 45 percent of men develop cancer. Thirty-eight percent of women develop cancer. One in four men dies of cancer. One in five women dies of cancer, at least in the United States. And three out of the four drugs we give you, if you get cancer, fail. And this is personal to me. My sister is a cancer survivor. My mother-in-law is a cancer survivor. Cancer sucks. And when you have it, you don't have a lot of privacy in the hospital. You're naked the vast majority of the time. People you don't know come in and look at you and poke you and prod you. And when I tell cancer survivors that this tool we created to protect them is actually preventing their data from being used, especially when only three to four percent of people who have cancer ever even sign up for a clinical study, their reaction is not thank you, God, for protecting my privacy - it's outrage that we have this information and we can't use it, and it's an accident. So the cost in blood and treasure of this is enormous - 226 billion a year is spent on cancer in the United States, 1,500 people a day die in the United States, and it's getting worse. RAZ: So how would that change, you know, if, like, more of that information was available to researchers, like, if more of that data from cancer patients wasn't kept behind walls? WILBANKS: What I hope would happen is that we would be able to find some of the patterns that are driving cancer. And we're studying it in such small sample sizes right now. You know, when we have to go out and enroll people with skin cancer, it costs, anywhere from $500 to $5,000 per patient just to enroll them in the study. And at the same time, we've got, you know, tens of thousands of people a day with melanoma and others kinds of skin cancer about whom very valuable data is being generated that could form a natural study. And we're basically throwing that data away. And so what I'm hoping we could do is is basically explode the number of people who participate in clinical studies by not having them be forced to enroll in some sort of complex study that they see on the subway, but be able to join a clinical study by routing a copy of their data to someone doing the research. RAZ: But, I mean, if more of this medical data was available and, like, easy to combine and cross reference, I mean, do you think we would have made, like, more progress on finding out better treatments for cancer and other diseases? WILBANKS: I do. I do. At a minimum, we'd be able to figure out who shouldn't be taking cancer drugs. Cancer drugs have an astonishingly high failure rate, right. Anywhere between 50 percent and 80 percent of the time when we give a cancer drug to a person, all they get is the toxicity. If we knew, right, what the genetic variation were of those people and we could run complex math on it like we run on NSA data, like we run on Google data, like we run on Amazon data, we could probably come up with a list of a thousand rare variations that strongly correlate with the drug failing. RAZ: So you want people to give this information over voluntarily like they give information over to Facebook or any other social media platform. WILBANKS: I do. But I want them to have more agency involved in the decision. And what I want is for people with their eyes open, right, understanding the choice they're making to begin contemplating whether or not to make the choice to share. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)WILBANKS: So the thing that I'm proposing we do here is that we reach into our bodies and we grab the genotype. And to reach into the medical system and we grab our records, and we use it to build something together, which is a commons. We do it voluntarily. We do it through standardized legal tools. We do it through standardized technologies, right. That's all a commons is. It's something that we build together because we think it's important. So that's what I do. I've actually started what we think is the world's first fully digital, fully self-contributed, unlimited in scope, global in participation, ethically approved clinical research study where you contribute the data. And you can actually upload your information and have it syndicated to the mathematicians who will do this sort of big data research. And the goal is to get a hundred thousand in the first year and a million. . . RAZ: OK, this sounds incredible, right. But, I mean, you could see how all that information could be abused, right, 'cause, like, information is control. WILBANKS: Right. There are all sorts of great science fiction scenarios for the bad things that could happen if your genetic information becomes available. And I don't particularly think that those are very likely. I worry more about bullying. I worry more about trolling 'cause these are things that we know people do anyway. And that's why it's so important not to take the informed consent issue and throw it out with the bathwater, but to find a way to harmonize it so that the people who are in this vast database, about whom we're collecting lots of information, understand and agree to the risks that they're running. And so one of the great ironies, to me, of the Snowden era is that it has illustrated the value of meta-data to people that aren't nerds. The exact same thing that makes you identifiable makes your data scientifically valuable. RAZ: John Wilbanks. He's on a crusade to change medical research.

I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, ideas around privacy or what's left of it anyway, and whether privacy is going to mean anything in the future. So there's a guy in Maryland. His name is Hasan Elahi. He's an artist. He teaches at a university. And you could say that Hasan doesn't have much privacy at all. And the end of his privacy began about a decade ago at Detroit Metro Airport. HASAN ELAHI: So I had an exhibition in West Africa. So I was flying back, and, you know, I mean, as an artist, you go wherever there's work. So I'm flying back, and I landed in Detroit. And, you know, you're going through customs - the usual thing - and immigration. And the guy like swipes the passport through and just, like, freezes. And I mean, like, completely white. I'm thinking, OK, what's going on here? RAZ: Yeah. ELAHI: And he says follow me, please. Walks me through, and I end up in an INS holding cell. And I'm sitting in this huge room and, you know, I was, like - there's all these people from every far corner of the Earth. You know, you can see the fear in everyone's face. This is their first day in the U. S. , and things aren't going well. And then, literally, like, it's like a scene out of the movies. Like, this guy in a black suit walk straight up to me, and just looks at me - says I expected you to be older. Just bizarre, you know, this stuff. So I'm like, you mind explaining what's going on here? And he said something like, well, you've got some explaining to do yourself. RAZ: The agent had all kinds of questions for Hasan - where he'd been, who he'd seen, who paid for the trip. But not just questions about that trip. The agent wanted to know details of where Hasan had been over the past two years. ELAHI: Yeah, he's like, where were you on this day? Where were you around September 12th? Where were you on this date? So we read my calendar of appointments. You know, back then, it was my old Palm 505. So we read, literally, months and months and months of my appointments. RAZ: This is at the airport. ELAHI: At the airport. RAZ: He's asking you where you were on specific dates? ELAHI: Yeah. Yeah. So it turns out that I had rented a storage unit in Tampa, Florida where I was living at the time. So he's like, you know, what did you have in the storage unit? I was like, winter clothes, like, furniture that I can't fit in my ratty apartment, you know, assorted garage sale material. And he's like, OK, no explosives. RAZ: OK, so it turns out Hasan was mistakenly put on an FBI watch list. And eventually, he got through that interrogation in Detroit. He picked up his stuff, and he caught the next flight home to Tampa. And a couple days later, he got a call from an FBI field agent. And he asked Hasan if he could stop by to answer a few more questions. Now by this point, Hasan was hoping to put any doubt to rest so he volunteered to take a series of polygraph tests. Hasan picks up the story from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)ELAHI: One of the polygraph questions was - well, the first one was is your name Hasan? Yes. Are we in Florida? Yes. Is today Tuesday? Yes - 'cause you have to base it on a yes or no. Then of course in the next question is do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States? I work at university. (LAUGHTER)ELAHI: You know, so I was like, well, maybe you want to ask some of my colleagues that directly, but - I mean, I said, OK, aside from what we had discussed, do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States? I was like, no. All right, so at the end of - after the end of six months of this and nine consecutive polygraphs, they said, hey, everything is fine. I was like, I know. That's what I've been trying to tell you guys all along. I know everything's fine. So they're sitting at me, and they're looking at me. It's really odd. And it's like, guys, you know, I travel a lot. This is with the FBI, and I was like, you know, all we need is Alaska not to get the last memo, and here we go all over again. And there was a sincere concern there. And they said well, you know, if you get into trouble, give us a call. We'll take care of it. So ever since then, before I would go anywhere, I would call the FBI. I'd tell them, hey guys, this where I'm going. This is my flight, OK. Northwest flight 7 coming into Seattle on March 12 or whatever. And it wasn't that I had to, but I chose to. I just wanted say, hey guys, don't want to make it look like I'm making any sudden moves. (LAUGHTER)ELAHI: You know, I don't want you guys to think that I'm about to flee, just letting you know. Heads up. And so I just kept doing this over and over and over. And then the phone calls turned to emails, and the emails got longer and longer and longer. RAZ: I mean, so, like, you had, like, your FBI agent, which, by the way, is insane. You had your own - it's like your own therapist. He was your own FBI - and he was on your speed dial on your cell phone. ELAHI: Well, yeah. Then I started realizing, well, wait a minute, wait a minute. Why is this guy so special? Why is it that only he gets to know everything? RAZ: OK, so this is where it gets a little weird because if you go to Hasan's website, it will show you exactly where he is at this very moment. And also timestamped photos of places he's been throughout the day. ELAHI: This was the parking lot where I was trying to find a parking space this afternoon right before I walked into here. . . RAZ: . . . The meal he ate this morning, points along his commute. . . ELAHI: . . . At the light before I get on the main road. That's at work. . . RAZ: . . . The toilet he used a few minutes ago. ELAHI: By the way, you guys have great toilets. . . RAZ: We have nice toilets. ELAHI: . . . in the new building. RAZ: Definitely nice toilets here. ELAHI: Yeah. RAZ: Hasan Elahi tracks himself. He turned his interrogation into a nonstop art project to tell the entire world where he is at any given moment. And he calls it Tracking Transience. ELAHI: These are the airports that I hang out in because I like to - I like airports. Kennedy Airport, May 19th, Tuesday. This is in Warsaw. Singapore. This is a parking lot in Elko, Nevada, at a Korean supermarket buying my kimchi 'cause I like kimchi. RAZ: But why would anyone want to give up their privacy voluntarily? Here's Hasan's explanation from his TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)ELAHI: When I first started this project, people were looking at me, saying why would you want to tell everybody what you're doing, where you're at? Why are you posting these photos? Well, this was before an age before people were tweeting everywhere and 750 million people were posting status messages or poking people. So in a way, I'm actually kind of glad that I'm completely obsolete. I mean, I'm still doing this project, but it really is obsolete because you're all doing it. This is something that we all are doing on a daily basis, whether we're aware of it or not. So we're creating our own archives and so on. The other thing that's also interesting that's going on here is the fact that intelligence agencies - and it doesn't matter who they are - they all operate in an industry where their commodity is information or restricted access to information. And the reason their information has any value is, well, because no one else has access to it. And by me cutting out the middleman and giving it straight to you, the information that the FBI has has no value so thus devaluing their currency. And I understand that on an individual level, it's purely symbolic. But if 300 million people in the U. S. started doing this, we would have to redesign the entire intelligence system from the ground up 'cause it just wouldn't work if everybody was sharing everything. And, you know - and some of my friends have always said, hey, you're just paranoid. No one's, you know - well, why are you doing this because no one's really watching, no one's really going to bother you? So one of the things that I do is I actually look through my server logs very carefully 'cause, you know, it's about surveillance so I'm watching who's watching me. And I came up with these. So these are some of my sample logs. And I cleaned up the list a little bit so you can see that the Homeland Security likes to come by. Department of Homeland Security. You can see the National Security Agency likes to come by. I actually moved very close to them. I live like, right down the street from them now. Central Intelligence Agency, Executive office of the president. Not really sure why they show up, but they do. I think, you know, they kind of like to look at art. And I'm glad that we have patrons of the arts in these fields. RAZ: So, Hasan, what - like, say somebody, like, emails you and says, hey let's hang out. I totally want to hang out. And you can't say, oh, I'm really sorry. I'm visiting people out of town today because all they have to do is go to the website and see that you are in Maryland. . . ELAHI: Yeah. RAZ: . . . At your house. ELAHI: Yeah. Yeah. RAZ: So you can't - like, you can't do that. ELAHI: No. No. It gets even weirder when you just don't post for several days. It's, like, well, wait a minute. What happened? RAZ: What's going on? ELAHI: What's going on? RAZ: What are you hiding? ELAHI: What are you hiding? RAZ: Yeah. ELAHI: Yeah. And we might say, look, I don't participate in this. I'm disconnecting, but that's not the case. That's not an option. Your water company knows what time you shower every day. I mean, that's kind of creepy when you think about it. Bruce Schneier said a really interesting thing about Gmail reading your emails so it knows how to pop up those ads. And he's kind of like, well, it's like your dog looking at you naked. I mean, are you bothered by that? RAZ: But, I mean, like, my dog doesn't have like a bionic eyeball that goes to the NSA. ELAHI: Well, this is the thing so. . . RAZ: Yeah. I don't have a dog, by the way. ELAHI: But here's the thing. RAZ: A cat. ELAHI: A cat. Yes. RAZ: Yes. ELAHI: I like cats. RAZ: Me too. I love cats. ELAHI: Yeah. I know. RAZ: We have two. And they have seen me without clothes, and - but see I know that. . . ELAHI: But does it feel weird? RAZ: No 'cause they're not sending that information to Google or to the NSA. It just stays in the cat. ELAHI: I don't know, you know, I mean, I've changed my behavior around my cat. But, you know - but I think this is the beautiful thing is that, you know, now there are literally billions of people doing this. There's a billion people on Facebook alone. That is the third largest country in the world. That completely changes this perspective. RAZ: What does that say about privacy and about, like, whether it means anything? ELAHI: It means something completely different than it meant. And the concepts and the technology are changing so quickly. But when it comes to regulating these things, that's when things get tricky. And I can't tell you whether it's for better or for worse, but I can certainly tell you that this idea of what we think of privacy today is going to be different. RAZ: I mean, I guess, like, we should expect that the idea of private things are just not really going to be private anymore, and that we should kind of surrender to it. ELAHI: Well, maybe not. Maybe not necessarily in that same sense because if you go back to say, you know, a 100, 200 years ago, maybe we don't even have to go that far back in time. Maybe there's plenty of places in the world right now where you go to that small village where everyone knows everyone's business. And essentially, we're kind of having a similar reverting to that. RAZ: Yeah. ELAHI: But except now, it's like billions of people. RAZ: We're back to the medieval village. . . ELAHI: Yes. RAZ: . . . Where the vicar knew, like, what everybody was doing. ELAHI: Yes. Except now, the vicar just happens to be the NSA. RAZ: Hasan Elahi. His web project is called Tracking Transience. Check out his talk at TED. com. GUY RAZ, HOST:  It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, ideas around privacy or what's left of it anyway, and whether privacy is going to mean anything in the future. So there's a guy in Maryland. His name is Hasan Elahi. He's an artist. He teaches at a university. And you could say that Hasan doesn't have much privacy at all. And the end of his privacy began about a decade ago at Detroit Metro Airport. HASAN ELAHI: So I had an exhibition in West Africa. So I was flying back, and, you know, I mean, as an artist, you go wherever there's work. So I'm flying back, and I landed in Detroit. And, you know, you're going through customs - the usual thing - and immigration. And the guy like swipes the passport through and just, like, freezes. And I mean, like, completely white. I'm thinking, OK, what's going on here? RAZ: Yeah. ELAHI: And he says follow me, please. Walks me through, and I end up in an INS holding cell. And I'm sitting in this huge room and, you know, I was, like - there's all these people from every far corner of the Earth. You know, you can see the fear in everyone's face. This is their first day in the U. S. , and things aren't going well. And then, literally, like, it's like a scene out of the movies. Like, this guy in a black suit walk straight up to me, and just looks at me - says I expected you to be older. Just bizarre, you know, this stuff. So I'm like, you mind explaining what's going on here? And he said something like, well, you've got some explaining to do yourself. RAZ: The agent had all kinds of questions for Hasan - where he'd been, who he'd seen, who paid for the trip. But not just questions about that trip. The agent wanted to know details of where Hasan had been over the past two years. ELAHI: Yeah, he's like, where were you on this day? Where were you around September 12th? Where were you on this date? So we read my calendar of appointments. You know, back then, it was my old Palm 505. So we read, literally, months and months and months of my appointments. RAZ: This is at the airport. ELAHI: At the airport. RAZ: He's asking you where you were on specific dates? ELAHI: Yeah. Yeah. So it turns out that I had rented a storage unit in Tampa, Florida where I was living at the time. So he's like, you know, what did you have in the storage unit? I was like, winter clothes, like, furniture that I can't fit in my ratty apartment, you know, assorted garage sale material. And he's like, OK, no explosives. RAZ: OK, so it turns out Hasan was mistakenly put on an FBI watch list. And eventually, he got through that interrogation in Detroit. He picked up his stuff, and he caught the next flight home to Tampa. And a couple days later, he got a call from an FBI field agent. And he asked Hasan if he could stop by to answer a few more questions. Now by this point, Hasan was hoping to put any doubt to rest so he volunteered to take a series of polygraph tests. Hasan picks up the story from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) ELAHI: One of the polygraph questions was - well, the first one was is your name Hasan? Yes. Are we in Florida? Yes. Is today Tuesday? Yes - 'cause you have to base it on a yes or no. Then of course in the next question is do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States? I work at university. (LAUGHTER) ELAHI: You know, so I was like, well, maybe you want to ask some of my colleagues that directly, but - I mean, I said, OK, aside from what we had discussed, do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States? I was like, no. All right, so at the end of - after the end of six months of this and nine consecutive polygraphs, they said, hey, everything is fine. I was like, I know. That's what I've been trying to tell you guys all along. I know everything's fine. So they're sitting at me, and they're looking at me. It's really odd. And it's like, guys, you know, I travel a lot. This is with the FBI, and I was like, you know, all we need is Alaska not to get the last memo, and here we go all over again. And there was a sincere concern there. And they said well, you know, if you get into trouble, give us a call. We'll take care of it. So ever since then, before I would go anywhere, I would call the FBI. I'd tell them, hey guys, this where I'm going. This is my flight, OK. Northwest flight 7 coming into Seattle on March 12 or whatever. And it wasn't that I had to, but I chose to. I just wanted say, hey guys, don't want to make it look like I'm making any sudden moves. (LAUGHTER) ELAHI: You know, I don't want you guys to think that I'm about to flee, just letting you know. Heads up. And so I just kept doing this over and over and over. And then the phone calls turned to emails, and the emails got longer and longer and longer. RAZ: I mean, so, like, you had, like, your FBI agent, which, by the way, is insane. You had your own - it's like your own therapist. He was your own FBI - and he was on your speed dial on your cell phone. ELAHI: Well, yeah. Then I started realizing, well, wait a minute, wait a minute. Why is this guy so special? Why is it that only he gets to know everything? RAZ: OK, so this is where it gets a little weird because if you go to Hasan's website, it will show you exactly where he is at this very moment. And also timestamped photos of places he's been throughout the day. ELAHI: This was the parking lot where I was trying to find a parking space this afternoon right before I walked into here. . . RAZ: . . . The meal he ate this morning, points along his commute. . . ELAHI: . . . At the light before I get on the main road. That's at work. . . RAZ: . . . The toilet he used a few minutes ago. ELAHI: By the way, you guys have great toilets. . . RAZ: We have nice toilets. ELAHI: . . . in the new building. RAZ: Definitely nice toilets here. ELAHI: Yeah. RAZ: Hasan Elahi tracks himself. He turned his interrogation into a nonstop art project to tell the entire world where he is at any given moment. And he calls it Tracking Transience. ELAHI: These are the airports that I hang out in because I like to - I like airports. Kennedy Airport, May 19th, Tuesday. This is in Warsaw. Singapore. This is a parking lot in Elko, Nevada, at a Korean supermarket buying my kimchi 'cause I like kimchi. RAZ: But why would anyone want to give up their privacy voluntarily? Here's Hasan's explanation from his TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) ELAHI: When I first started this project, people were looking at me, saying why would you want to tell everybody what you're doing, where you're at? Why are you posting these photos? Well, this was before an age before people were tweeting everywhere and 750 million people were posting status messages or poking people. So in a way, I'm actually kind of glad that I'm completely obsolete. I mean, I'm still doing this project, but it really is obsolete because you're all doing it. This is something that we all are doing on a daily basis, whether we're aware of it or not. So we're creating our own archives and so on. The other thing that's also interesting that's going on here is the fact that intelligence agencies - and it doesn't matter who they are - they all operate in an industry where their commodity is information or restricted access to information. And the reason their information has any value is, well, because no one else has access to it. And by me cutting out the middleman and giving it straight to you, the information that the FBI has has no value so thus devaluing their currency. And I understand that on an individual level, it's purely symbolic. But if 300 million people in the U. S. started doing this, we would have to redesign the entire intelligence system from the ground up 'cause it just wouldn't work if everybody was sharing everything. And, you know - and some of my friends have always said, hey, you're just paranoid. No one's, you know - well, why are you doing this because no one's really watching, no one's really going to bother you? So one of the things that I do is I actually look through my server logs very carefully 'cause, you know, it's about surveillance so I'm watching who's watching me. And I came up with these. So these are some of my sample logs. And I cleaned up the list a little bit so you can see that the Homeland Security likes to come by. Department of Homeland Security. You can see the National Security Agency likes to come by. I actually moved very close to them. I live like, right down the street from them now. Central Intelligence Agency, Executive office of the president. Not really sure why they show up, but they do. I think, you know, they kind of like to look at art. And I'm glad that we have patrons of the arts in these fields. RAZ: So, Hasan, what - like, say somebody, like, emails you and says, hey let's hang out. I totally want to hang out. And you can't say, oh, I'm really sorry. I'm visiting people out of town today because all they have to do is go to the website and see that you are in Maryland. . . ELAHI: Yeah. RAZ: . . . At your house. ELAHI: Yeah. Yeah. RAZ: So you can't - like, you can't do that. ELAHI: No. No. It gets even weirder when you just don't post for several days. It's, like, well, wait a minute. What happened? RAZ: What's going on? ELAHI: What's going on? RAZ: What are you hiding? ELAHI: What are you hiding? RAZ: Yeah. ELAHI: Yeah. And we might say, look, I don't participate in this. I'm disconnecting, but that's not the case. That's not an option. Your water company knows what time you shower every day. I mean, that's kind of creepy when you think about it. Bruce Schneier said a really interesting thing about Gmail reading your emails so it knows how to pop up those ads. And he's kind of like, well, it's like your dog looking at you naked. I mean, are you bothered by that? RAZ: But, I mean, like, my dog doesn't have like a bionic eyeball that goes to the NSA. ELAHI: Well, this is the thing so. . . RAZ: Yeah. I don't have a dog, by the way. ELAHI: But here's the thing. RAZ: A cat. ELAHI: A cat. Yes. RAZ: Yes. ELAHI: I like cats. RAZ: Me too. I love cats. ELAHI: Yeah. I know. RAZ: We have two.

Each week, he joins us to talk about what's new and what's next. Welcome back, Carlos. CARLOS WATSON: Arun, always good to be with you. RATH: So big game tomorrow, of course, the Super Bowl. This week, Ozy examines some of the buzzy commercials and found that there are more that are catering to women this year. WATSON: Well, you know, it's interesting. Now, nearly half the viewership of the Super Bowl are women, so it's been an interesting change in migration over the last 20 years. And yet, many of the ads that we've seen in the past have clearly still been geared towards men. But seems that things are changing. The group known as Axe Body Spray, that in the past was doing things that were a little more risque, are now running a documentary style video called \"Make Love Not War. \"(SOUNDBITE OF AXE VIDEO, \"MAKE LOVE NOT WAR\")RATH: Yeah, that Axe commercial proves that they can be completely offensive without being sexist at all, which is an interesting trick. Let's hear a little bit of that mock PSA by Sarah McLachlan. (SOUNDBITE OF AUDI ADVERTISEMENT)WATSON: That's an Audi ad. And last year, Audi got critiqued for running an ad that some people said glorified sexual assault at a high school prom. So. . . RATH: Oh, this - the nerd kind of forcing the kiss on the prom queen. WATSON: Correct. That one. So something very different and, again, signaling a wider change in recognition on the part of advertisers that they've got a big female and male audience that's watching. RATH: OK. One more nut on the Super Bowl. Ozy reminded us that this week - I can't believe this - it's been 10 years since the wardrobe malfunction with Janet Jackson at the Super Bowl. WATSON: It is hard to believe that it was 10 years ago. But there was a really interesting speech a couple of years ago by one of the co-founders of YouTube, who said that that event where Justin Timberlake seemed to rip off and expose part of the breast of Janet Jackson, not only did that turn out to produce the most searched term ever in Internet history at the time but, maybe more importantly, he said part of the inspiration for YouTube came from how popular that was and his recognition and his co-founder's recognition that many people wanted to be able to watch video again, over and over again on the Internet. And in fact, that might be a bigger audience than the audience that sees the original on classic standard television. RATH: Well, you know, we were joking a little bit about the halftime show kind of being like a multimillion-dollar bathroom break, which makes the natural transition to one more Ozy story. You have this piece about an interesting toilet that really could help save a lot of water. WATSON: It's called SinkPositive. And a couple years ago, a young woman who was still in college at Wake Forest encountered an interesting kind of toilet that was a classic toilet underneath but on the top someone had put a true faucet. And the idea was that I wash my hands in the faucet, the water runs down, fills up the toilet, and that that's ultimately the water that's flushed. And it came out of a recognition that something like 30 percent of the wasted water in America, or about $5 billion worth of water, comes from us flushing clean water, which, when you think about, is kind of a little crazy. So she said, why don't we flush dirty water? Makes a ton of sense. And while she thought originally people were going to get excited about it for environmental reasons, it turns out that some people like it also for space reasons. In crowded cities where you have small apartments, some people like the idea of combining their sink and the toilet in an environmentally friendly way.

JENNINGS: If you ever play \"Name the Artist\" and you're against some novice with a vaguely \"Jeopardy! \" themed name, that might be me as you're kicking my butt. CORNISH: The QuizUp app is a game you play with other users, from strangers in another country to friends just a few feet away. The topics range from important moments in history to literature. JENNINGS: Crime fiction - \"Fifty Shades of Grey,\" \"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. \"CORNISH: To music. JENNINGS: There's a Britney Spears category, there's a Bowie category, Justin Bieber - oh, I got to do that one. CORNISH: Well, we asked Ken Jennings to play a round of QuizUp in real-time, using a category he knew little about. Here's a hint. (SOUNDBITE OF MOVIE)CORNISH: Jennings wasn't. And he sent us this app review. JENNINGS: So I'm going to choose \"Twilight. \"(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)JENNINGS: I'm playing someone named Terry at Twilight Trivia. And the questions come fast: The only female wolf in the Quileute pack? I guessed Leah and I guessed right. Oh, and Terry got it wrong. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)JENNINGS: Terry, why are you playing Twilight Trivia if you don't know those kind of stuff? What is Edwards and middle name - you got to be kidding me. I'm going to go - Edward. Edward James. Oh, I got it wrong. It's Anthony. And Terry knew it. I'm wasting my life. What is Edward's condition for changing Bella into a vampire? Five years of waiting, maybe? Oh, I hope that book was all about the sex waiting. Marriage, apparently - even better, marriage. The other option was attending Dartmouth. That would be a good book. The first human with whom Bella interacts outside her family? Ugh, I don't know any of these people. I said Max. Oh, and I got it right. But guess what? Terry was a little faster than me and wins by two points. That was intense. I mean, my heart rate is a little too high for Public Radio right now. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)JENNINGS: QuizUp is a very strong app. I played a lot of trivia games and it avoids all the bugaboos. The questions are smart and clever, and so far I haven't seen one that's wrong. There's hundreds of categories, hundreds of thousands of questions, so you don't see a lot of duplicates. You go up against some very smart people in whatever kind of quiz you like. I would recommend QuizUp wholeheartedly and I'm actually playing right now.

If you see a charge for that amount on your next credit or debit card statement, give it some thought. You could be the victim of a new scam that's getting more public notice after the recent data breaches at Target and Neiman Marcus. Instead of hitting you with big clearly fraudulent charges, this latest scheme depends on victims not noticing they're being ripped off. NPR's Cheryl Corley reports. CHERYL CORLEY, BYLINE: So let's begin with an extremely informal survey at Chicago's Navy pier. That's where I asked people if they'd notice a charge of $10 or less on their credit card statement. ISABELLA BOYKEN: Yes, because that $10 adds up. CORLEY: Housekeeper Isabella Boyken(ph) is certain. Thirty-year-old Marcel Sequor(ph), a food company worker, isn't. MARCEL SEQUOR: Probably, I wouldn't care much. Like, I wouldn't pay much attention. CORLEY: Steve Barnas, with the Better Business Bureau, says that's what scammers count on. And there's another reason why some consumers may ignore small charges. STEVE BARNAS: Usually, if it's a joint credit card, the husband thinks the wife charged it and the wife thinks the husband charged it. CORLEY: But Barnas says the Better Business Bureau is hearing from consumers across the country about credit charges for $9. 84 for what look to be very innocuous purchases. BARNAS: Most of them we're seeing are saying: customer support. They say: website support. And basically, they are really trying to do is get really pedestrian, in essence, so it flies underneath the radar. CORLEY: But Lois Greisman with the Federal Trade Commission, says it's an old scam and cleaver. LOIS GREISMAN: Nine, eighty-four makes you think you actually purchased something. But the idea of illegally putting unauthorized charges on somebody's credit card statement and doing it in a particularly low amount that's not likely to jump off the sheet, assuming anyone's even reading it in the first place, is a fairly known tactic by scammers. CORLEY: No one's sure how big this con is, but after complaints starting piling up on website forums, Brian Krebs of KrebsonSecurity. com began investigating. He doesn't think the $9. 84 scam is tied to the recent data breaches at Target or other big retailers. BRIAN KREBS: When I look back at the domain names and the different website names and so on that were involved, it was pretty clear this has gone back many, many months before Target, and that this operation had just been, you know, going on for quite some time. CORLEY: Krebs says the fraudsters hired call centers in India and set up websites that were fronts to look legitimate. The Better Business Bureau, Steve Barnas, says that's why scam artists who steal credit card numbers hope consumers will overlook small charges. BARNAS: Because they can change it from $9. 84 to, you know, twenty dollars tomorrow. CORLEY: If you notice a problem, he suggests you call the credit card company right away for a new card. The FTC's Greisman also has some common-sense advice. GREISMAN: There's no substitute for reading line by line your credit card statement.

It is an array of 12 cameras that can be mounted on the belly of a small plane. Over the course of several hours, they can intermittently photograph an area the size of a small U. S. city. When police get word of a crime, they simply consult the cameras' footage starting at the scene of the crime and following the perpetrator's car - either forward to his current whereabouts or backward to where he started his day, often at home. For more on how it works and why some critics are sounding alarms, we're joined by Craig Timberg. Welcome to the program. CRAIG TIMBERG: Thanks for having me. CORNISH: So I want to be clear here, this is not video surveillance, right? This is basically an array that takes photographs over an extended period of time. TIMBERG: That's right. It takes one picture every second for six hours and in some cases for the longer flights, nine hours. CORNISH: And just how good a resolution are we talking about? I know in the spy movies it seems like you can zoom in and see someone's face, you know, like, from outer space. TIMBERG: Right. You couldn't tell that they're reading a copy of The New Yorker or anything. But an individual appears as a single pixel, so like, basically, almost like a speck of dust. A vehicle is a little easier to see. The crucial thing about this technology is they can watch your movements over time. So even if you're a speck of dust, if they watch you as a speck of dust move between your home and your workplace, in fact, they know who you are. CORNISH: Now, talk about where these cameras have already been used and where have they actually helped solve crimes. TIMBERG: They've been used most heavily at this point in Mexican border cities such as Juarez, where they've helped solve quite a few murders. But they've also been flown on a demonstration basis over Baltimore, Philadelphia, Dayton, Compton. They've been flow over NASCAR races and they were even flown over Sarah Palin's announcement as vice presidential nominee in 2008 in Dayton, Ohio. CORNISH: Now, talk about where they have been helpful in terms of investigations. TIMBERG: Because they've been used much more widely over the border in Mexico, the largest number of successes, if you will, are over there. But in flying over Dayton, they have, for example, been able to help track down who a robber is as they get reports of shots fired, for example, at a Subway sandwich shop. They'll look and see who is leaving the Subway sandwich shop at that moment and where they go next. And with that, they can help solve crimes. In one case in Dayton, they had a report of a burglary, and they were able to report that to police, you know, go look for a white truck leaving such and such an address at this time. And they were able to catch up with the truck before it got home and the stolen goods were right in the back. CORNISH: So in your report, you say that the inventor essentially crafted a kind of privacy policy on his own, right? He worked with the ACLU to come up with some restrictions. Describe what those safeguards are. TIMBERG: The privacy policy the company has adopted limits who can look at these images and under what circumstances. So police can't just sort of troll through the - across the ground and watch everybody and every vehicle's kind of looking for things to go wrong. What they do is if there's a report of a crime or shots fired, they can turn on this imagery and see what's happening both in the future and what happened in the past as people come together for a crime and then scatter after it's committed. CORNISH: Now, the Supreme Court has been wrestling with the constitutionality of surveillance technology like this. Do we have any sense about whether this system crosses any legal lines? TIMBERG: I don't think there's any reason to think that it crosses any legal lines as they exist now. The Supreme Court has basically said, you know, if you're flying over something and you're looking at something that's visible to the naked eye, the police have a right to take pictures of it. Now, the civil liberties groups have been arguing fairly strenuously that this kind of technology is really a game changer, that if you can loiter over a place for hours, that it's really a different kind of technology that the courts need to rethink. And there's a push toward that end. I think the courts will have to revisit this at some point. CORNISH: Washington Post reporter Craig Timberg. Thanks so much for speaking with us.

I'm Michel Martin. We're going to talk about technology on the program today. And we want to talk about some of the ways it's being used to solve social problems or social issues. And as part of that conversation, we want to talk about who gets to decide just what is constructive and what isn't. We'll be having that conversation in a few minutes when we talk about how some observers are saying that too many of the feminist debates playing out online too often cross the line these days from constructive dialogue to destructive personal attack. We're coming out of that article in The Nation called \"Feminism's Toxic Twitter Wars. \"We will talk to some of the people who were quoted in the piece and who are part of that debate. That's coming up. But first, we want to talk about how some hackers are trying to use technology to solve social problems. Organizers of a hackathon in Oakland, California are asking whether an app could have saved Trayvon Martin. It's part of Startup Weekend in Oakland, it's being called the first global event for black male achievement. And we are joined now by two organizers of the event. Kalimah Priforce is cofounder of Qeyno Labs. Welcome, thanks for joining us. KALIMAH PRIFORCE: Thank you. MARTIN: And Ayori Selassie is project manager at SalesForce. com, as well as cofounder and director at Pitch Mixer. You might remember from our #BlacksinTech series last year. Ayori, welcome back to you. Thanks for joining us once again. AYORI SELASSIE: Thank you. Excited to be here. MARTIN: Kalimah Priforce, could you just start by telling folks who don't know, what is a hackathon? PRIFORCE: Sure. So a hackathon is an event that usually last 24 hours - 48 hours, and in that moment where developers - that's people who are technologists, designers, artists and innovators, people with ideas to solve big problems - come together and it's kind of a sort of immersive experience. And in those moments that they are together they are able to create a solution, build a solution. MARTIN: And just to clarify, it isn't just black males who are invited to this hackathon. Just to be clear about that. You know, everybody who wants to participate is invited to participate, but why this particular focus on black male achievement? How did this particular idea come about? PRIFORCE: So, like - so with hackathons, anyone who walks into your day-to-day hackathon - a hackathon that happens every week, especially in Silicon Valley - what you find is that they tend to be homogenous environments. Hackathons emerge out of big tech companies. They emerge out of sort of Ivy League institutions. And they're predominately white. They're predominately male. And they're predominately sort of middle to upper-income class. And so recently, people have been exploring this idea of inclusion verticals. And that is hackathons that are able to tackle social issues around, let's say, women's issues. And - but there haven't really been a lot of hackathons that are focused on issues like black male achievement. And so we decided to create that, to create the sort of deeper level of engagement of young black males, their issues and with the larger sort of Silicon Valley, Oakland community. MARTIN: Ayori, do you want to pick up the thread here? I mean, is part of the idea that if you change the conversation that more people will want to participate in the conversation? SELASSIE: Oh, yeah. It's even beyond that. Just last night we did a venture design workshop in Oakland at the Impact Hub Oakland, and I was wondering who was going to show up. This was in preparation for our hackathon, which starts on Friday. And we had four young black men in high school, and then we had a bunch of adults as well, and primarily African-American, but there were some Indians there. There were some Asians there as well. And the thing is that - it doesn't shock me anymore - is that when you make a space for them and you say, we especially want you to show up, they show up, and they're excited. MARTIN: So I have to ask you about this Trayvon Martin issue. It's all over the literature for your event - could an app have saved Trayvon Martin? How? PRIFORCE: That's a great idea. I mean, that's a great question. So it's - what it points to is that that because of the sort of homogenous environments that exist within the tech world and even in the social entrepreneurship innovation world, then that means that a lot of the problems and solutions become sort of limited in scope. And so could an app have saved Trayvon Martin is a great place to start when we start thinking about OK, are we really building sort of an app ecosystem that is inclusive? And yeah, so when George Zimmerman approached Trayvon Martin, Trayvon Martin had a phone in his hand. And so it engaged people to think about, is there a button that he could have pressed that may have sort of altered the situation? But even bigger than that situation is, well, maybe Trayvon - the app that could have saved Trayvon Martin is an app that probably should have been built by Trayvon Martin. And how do we start building apps for the Trayvon Martins of the world rather than the George Zimmermans? MARTIN: Well, you know, to that end, though, as - Ayori, as you know 'cause you were part of our series in December about #BlacksInTech, and we had, you know, conversations both on the radio, and we also had conversations on social media where we kind of addressed some of these questions. I just want to remind you of a conversation we had with Ciara Chase who's a middle school student. And we spoke with this as part of the series. And she had this idea of an app to help solve kidnapping cases, you know, flowing from the idea that, you know, some people seem to come to the attention of the authorities more quickly than others. And I just want to play a short clip from the conversation we had with her. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVAL RECORDING)CIARA CHASE: For our app, it's basically so a parent can post their child's kidnapping because without the app, you have to go through, like, a lot of police reports or post signs and stuff to find your child. But for the app, if you find that your child is missing, you're able to post it. And anyone that has information about the child is able to comment under the post so they can help you in a faster way. MARTIN: So, you know, Ayori, as I said, this is a middle school student. So I think it speaks to your point that if you ask people the question, you know, sometimes they come up with the answer. You know, but to that end, it's my understanding that some of the big names like Google and Facebook are not participating. Do they normally come to hackathons? And why do you think they're not coming to this one? SELASSIE: Well, absolutely they are coming. Actually, several of our mentors are from companies like Google, like - not like, but actually from Google, from Salesforce. And so what we've really seen is that the employees have really responded to this, this concept of solving social problems using technology. And what we've done is we've given them the space and the structure to say this is going to be an event where we're able to do all the outreach to actually bring the young people and make sure that the folks who are here are incredibly gifted and talented and really able to leverage the opportunity for mentorship and support that we're giving during this hackathon. MARTIN: Kalimah, I obviously want to keep the space open for kind of the ideas to come wherever they come from. But what - do you have an idea in your head of what would constitute success for this? Do you need to walk away with a specific app or a specific product, or is it just the fact of people getting together to think about this issue? Is that enough? PRIFORCE: Well, I believe that - that we're looking at success through several ways. I mean, the metrics of, OK, yes. We have over 50 young black males who we call our trailblazers who are going to be engaged in this process, and an app is going to be produced - several apps are going to be produced. Wonderful. That's great. But, you know, on the other side is the effect that it will have on these professionals who are working alongside them. And that the problem is that - and I've gotten emails where you have developers from Google, from Facebook, from a lot of these companies who are saying, well, I am uncomfortable working with young black males. MARTIN: Really? PRIFORCE: And I think. . . MARTIN: Wait, wait, wait. You've had people say this to you directly. . . PRIFORCE: Yes. MARTIN: . . . That they are uncomfortable working with young black males? Why? PRIFORCE: Yes. I believe it's a distance thing. I believe it's - of course, it's sort of media perceptions, depictions that a lot of conversations that are around black males, especially young black males, tend to be deficit conversations, tends to be what the issues are. Here are the statistics, and here are the problems. But they don't tend to be sort of focused on black male strengths - their potential, their untapped potential. So there aren't asset conversations. And so, of course - I mean, you know, it's - I don't think it's wholly their fault. It's just a society that we live in where these young black males are attached to these stereotype threats. And so, yeah - so this is really - so if they haven't interacted with young black males in the towns that they're from, from the cities that they're from and also in the companies where they work at, then here it is. They're in Oakland. They're interacting with these young black males. And so I can imagine what the kind of trepidation that they may have. So I don't think it's a harsh judgment coming from them. MARTIN: Are they going to come? Are some of the people who sent you these emails going to come, or are they saying - or did they say to you, that's why I am not coming 'cause I'm not comfortable? PRIFORCE: Well, I think that that's been the work that Ayori and I have in trying to communicate what the black male achievement - what the black male achievement message is, is that we - that when we work together, especially as Americans, you know, in this country - that when we work together and we start to sort of tear down the walls that separate us, especially the walls in our minds, then we can build some really amazing things together. And so when we convey that message, that's what lets them go, OK, all right, I'm there. And what's really important that I have to add as well is that when we found out that a lot of our trailblazers don't have laptops to participate, some of them have said, hey, you know, I have an extra laptop, or I have a Chromebook or something I want to provide. And so it's been a really community-driven support. MARTIN: Ayori. . . SELASSIE: Yeah, I wanted to. . . MARTIN: . . . You only have 30 seconds left. Give me a final thought, please. SELASSIE: Yeah, I think the main thing that we're focused on is empathy, community engagement and passion and excitement. And what we really want to do is give all of these young people, all of these people in our community, an opportunity to get addicted - joyfully addicted to entrepreneurship and technology. And I believe that's exactly the outcome that we're going to get from this event. And it's going to be a game changer, and we're going to see this replicated all around the world. And I'm excited for thatMARTIN: OK, well, you got to come back and tell us what are some of the ideas that they came up with, assuming they're not secret. OK, Ayori Selassie is product manager at SalesForce. com, as well as cofounder and director of Pitch Mixer. Kalimah Priforce is cofounder of Qeyno Labs. They both joined us from member station KQED just ahead of Startup Weekend Oakland - Black Male Achievement, which runs this weekend. Thank you both so much for joining us. PRIFORCE: Thank you. SELASSIE: Thank you. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  This is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. I'm Michel Martin. We're going to talk about technology on the program today. And we want to talk about some of the ways it's being used to solve social problems or social issues. And as part of that conversation, we want to talk about who gets to decide just what is constructive and what isn't. We'll be having that conversation in a few minutes when we talk about how some observers are saying that too many of the feminist debates playing out online too often cross the line these days from constructive dialogue to destructive personal attack. We're coming out of that article in The Nation called \"Feminism's Toxic Twitter Wars. \" We will talk to some of the people who were quoted in the piece and who are part of that debate. That's coming up. But first, we want to talk about how some hackers are trying to use technology to solve social problems. Organizers of a hackathon in Oakland, California are asking whether an app could have saved Trayvon Martin. It's part of Startup Weekend in Oakland, it's being called the first global event for black male achievement. And we are joined now by two organizers of the event. Kalimah Priforce is cofounder of Qeyno Labs. Welcome, thanks for joining us. KALIMAH PRIFORCE: Thank you. MARTIN: And Ayori Selassie is project manager at SalesForce. com, as well as cofounder and director at Pitch Mixer. You might remember from our #BlacksinTech series last year. Ayori, welcome back to you. Thanks for joining us once again. AYORI SELASSIE: Thank you. Excited to be here. MARTIN: Kalimah Priforce, could you just start by telling folks who don't know, what is a hackathon? PRIFORCE: Sure. So a hackathon is an event that usually last 24 hours - 48 hours, and in that moment where developers - that's people who are technologists, designers, artists and innovators, people with ideas to solve big problems - come together and it's kind of a sort of immersive experience. And in those moments that they are together they are able to create a solution, build a solution. MARTIN: And just to clarify, it isn't just black males who are invited to this hackathon. Just to be clear about that. You know, everybody who wants to participate is invited to participate, but why this particular focus on black male achievement? How did this particular idea come about? PRIFORCE: So, like - so with hackathons, anyone who walks into your day-to-day hackathon - a hackathon that happens every week, especially in Silicon Valley - what you find is that they tend to be homogenous environments. Hackathons emerge out of big tech companies. They emerge out of sort of Ivy League institutions. And they're predominately white. They're predominately male. And they're predominately sort of middle to upper-income class. And so recently, people have been exploring this idea of inclusion verticals. And that is hackathons that are able to tackle social issues around, let's say, women's issues. And - but there haven't really been a lot of hackathons that are focused on issues like black male achievement. And so we decided to create that, to create the sort of deeper level of engagement of young black males, their issues and with the larger sort of Silicon Valley, Oakland community. MARTIN: Ayori, do you want to pick up the thread here? I mean, is part of the idea that if you change the conversation that more people will want to participate in the conversation? SELASSIE: Oh, yeah. It's even beyond that. Just last night we did a venture design workshop in Oakland at the Impact Hub Oakland, and I was wondering who was going to show up. This was in preparation for our hackathon, which starts on Friday. And we had four young black men in high school, and then we had a bunch of adults as well, and primarily African-American, but there were some Indians there. There were some Asians there as well. And the thing is that - it doesn't shock me anymore - is that when you make a space for them and you say, we especially want you to show up, they show up, and they're excited. MARTIN: So I have to ask you about this Trayvon Martin issue. It's all over the literature for your event - could an app have saved Trayvon Martin? How? PRIFORCE: That's a great idea. I mean, that's a great question. So it's - what it points to is that that because of the sort of homogenous environments that exist within the tech world and even in the social entrepreneurship innovation world, then that means that a lot of the problems and solutions become sort of limited in scope. And so could an app have saved Trayvon Martin is a great place to start when we start thinking about OK, are we really building sort of an app ecosystem that is inclusive? And yeah, so when George Zimmerman approached Trayvon Martin, Trayvon Martin had a phone in his hand. And so it engaged people to think about, is there a button that he could have pressed that may have sort of altered the situation? But even bigger than that situation is, well, maybe Trayvon - the app that could have saved Trayvon Martin is an app that probably should have been built by Trayvon Martin. And how do we start building apps for the Trayvon Martins of the world rather than the George Zimmermans? MARTIN: Well, you know, to that end, though, as - Ayori, as you know 'cause you were part of our series in December about #BlacksInTech, and we had, you know, conversations both on the radio, and we also had conversations on social media where we kind of addressed some of these questions. I just want to remind you of a conversation we had with Ciara Chase who's a middle school student. And we spoke with this as part of the series. And she had this idea of an app to help solve kidnapping cases, you know, flowing from the idea that, you know, some people seem to come to the attention of the authorities more quickly than others. And I just want to play a short clip from the conversation we had with her. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVAL RECORDING) CIARA CHASE: For our app, it's basically so a parent can post their child's kidnapping because without the app, you have to go through, like, a lot of police reports or post signs and stuff to find your child. But for the app, if you find that your child is missing, you're able to post it. And anyone that has information about the child is able to comment under the post so they can help you in a faster way. MARTIN: So, you know, Ayori, as I said, this is a middle school student. So I think it speaks to your point that if you ask people the question, you know, sometimes they come up with the answer. You know, but to that end, it's my understanding that some of the big names like Google and Facebook are not participating. Do they normally come to hackathons? And why do you think they're not coming to this one? SELASSIE: Well, absolutely they are coming. Actually, several of our mentors are from companies like Google, like - not like, but actually from Google, from Salesforce. And so what we've really seen is that the employees have really responded to this, this concept of solving social problems using technology. And what we've done is we've given them the space and the structure to say this is going to be an event where we're able to do all the outreach to actually bring the young people and make sure that the folks who are here are incredibly gifted and talented and really able to leverage the opportunity for mentorship and support that we're giving during this hackathon. MARTIN: Kalimah, I obviously want to keep the space open for kind of the ideas to come wherever they come from. But what - do you have an idea in your head of what would constitute success for this? Do you need to walk away with a specific app or a specific product, or is it just the fact of people getting together to think about this issue? Is that enough?

I'm Arun Rath. It's hard for me to imagine life without Wikipedia, and I'm not alone. It's the sixth most visited Web page on the planet. Along with everything else, Wikipedia has become a major source of medical information. A recent study names Wikipedia as the single leading source of health care information for both patients and their doctors. Unfortunately, some of that information is wrong. Dr. Amin Azzam is a professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco. He teaches a course that encourages medical students to use their knowledge to improve Wikipedia, one article at a time. DR. AMIN AZZAM: I think it's important to acknowledge that there's a lot of information on Wikipedia in the medical space or the health care space that is currently still low quality, lots of gaps in the information or lots of sentences that are unreferenced. So we don't know if somebody has just merely put that there because they believe it or because there's scientific knowledge behind it. So there is a lot of room for improving the quality of Wikipedia, particularly in the medical domain. We're sort of latecomers to Wikipedia. RATH: Why do you think that is? AZZAM: I think it's because in the health care community, we're used to learning from wisened professors above us. And those generations above us didn't look favorably on Wikipedia or social media or even the concept of crowdsourcing as the wisdom of the crowd. So my generation absolutely pooh-poohed Wikipedia, and now I'm finding that all my med students go there first because it's written in a way they can understand as they are learning to become doctors. RATH: What were some of the examples of bad medical information on Wikipedia? AZZAM: This came from one of my former medical students who first adjusted the idea to me over a coffee. An example that he used was that a friend asked him about when you go and get an HIV test, how long could it possibly be a false negative result? And so he looked that up on Wikipedia and saw a number, and then looked it up in a more reliable medical source and saw that those two were not in agreement with one another. So he went and fixed it on Wikipedia immediately. So that's an example of where the quality of information that is or was then on Wikipedia was inaccurate. RATH: Now, this being Wikipedia, isn't the problem, though, that just any old person could come on then and take down that good information and put up bad stuff? AZZAM: That's true, and I think that's the double-edged sword of Wikipedia. Because anyone can edit, we don't necessarily know the expertise of the people doing the editing. On the other hand, the reason it's so popular is because everyone can contribute. What I think we're doing is bringing medical students who have a certain amount of expertise to the table to be adding to the wisdom of the crowd, if you will. They have certain (unintelligible) knowledge so they're reading other reliable sources and adding information that's missing from the Wikipedia pages. But, for example, if we think about a diagnosis that has a list of symptoms, when the students would write those symptoms, they may add the missing symptoms. Then they had to think, well, what order shall we put the symptoms list - should it be most serious first, should it be alphabetical, should it be most common first? And those kinds of decision-making things are where their emerging expertise, I think, adds value. It's not just adding references and not just improving the gaps, but thinking about how to make it more readable and more digestible for the people that are reading Wikipedia. RATH: That's Dr. Amin Azzam. He teaches a course at the University of California, San Francisco, that enlists knowledge of medical students to improve Wikipedia. Amin, thank you. AZZAM: My pleasure.

But the first car Ferdinand Porsche designed in 1898, when he was just 22, was boxy-looking and sputtered over streets at 21 miles per hour. And the P-1 was powered by electricity. The car has been parked in a garage in Austria since 1902. It is now on display at the Porsche Museum in Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen. We're joined by the director of that museum Achim Stejskal. Thanks very much for being with us. ACHIM STEJSKAL: Good morning, Scott. SIMON: So to look at it, would it look like a car or more of a carriage with the horses gone? STEJSKAL: Honestly, it looks totally different than a Porsche looks like today. It looks more like a carriage. SIMON: Now, why was this powered by electricity as opposed to gas? STEJSKAL: In the time when Ferdinand Porsche invented the first cars, there were three engine types competing to each other. This was gas, steam and the other engine was electrical power. And for Ferdinand Porsche, his true interest was in the field of electricity, and so he was very keen on creating very efficient electrical cars. SIMON: Efficient, so that was a consideration even then, in 1898? STEJSKAL: Yes, of course. Even other aspects which are today very interesting, for example, pollution or noise reduction, so this was also the interest of Ferdinand Porsche to create an electric car, because there was no admission, there was no noise. Ja. SIMON: So why didn't it go into production widespread? STEJSKAL: It went into production a few years later. In the year 1900, he further developed the idea of an electrical car with a hybrid system. So in addition to the electrical power supply, he placed two combustion engines in another car, and a few cars were sold as the first hybrid cars in the world in the year 1902. SIMON: So why did the combustion engine become predominant in the industry, do you think? STEJSKAL: The problem was the weight of the cars. This battery pack weighs around 500 kilograms, so this was almost half the weight of the whole car. And the combustion engines, they were much smaller then. So I think it turned from the electrical engines into the combustion engines. And then they made their way to the successful, still successful, power supplies for the cars of the future. SIMON: Have you been in the car, Mr. Stejskal? STEJSKAL: Yes, of course. Ja. SIMON: Does it work? Have you taken it for a spin? STEJSKAL: We intentionally avoided to drive the car. But what is really interesting, after 162 years, we conducted this - we call it octagon engine because of the shape of the exterior of the engine. And we connected it to a battery supply and the engine is still working today. SIMON: So you've started it up. STEJSKAL: We started it up and it's working. SIMON: Well, Mr. Stejskal, thanks. Happy trails to you, sir. STEJSKAL: Thank you, likewise. And it was great talking to you. SIMON: Achim Stejskal is director of the Porsche Museum. This is NPR News.

It's part of a growing death toll. A total of 15 skiers, hikers, snowboarders and snowmobilers have now died in U. S. avalanches since Christmas. Now, a rescue technology that's been used in Europe for more than a decade is finally gaining wider acceptance in the United States: avalanche airbags. NPR's Ted Robbins reports on skis. (SOUNDBITE OF A SKIER)TED ROBBINS, BYLINE: So let's say you're skiing the backcountry, which I am most definitely not doing here in Utah, but you get the picture. You're looking for some powder, a thrill. Instead, you trigger an avalanche. (SOUNDBITE OF A SKIER)ANDY WENBERG: Pretty much as soon as you see that snow start to move, know you're going to get caught. See it coming towards you, no hesitation, just pull the trigger. (SOUNDBITE OF AN AIRBAG INFLATING)ROBBINS: Andy Wenberg yanks the cord inflating the airbags in his backpack. They come out like wings. Wenberg is with Backcountry Access, one of several companies making airbags. We're on solid ground but if we were in an avalanche, he says the backpack would keep him close to the surface and easier to dig out. WENBERG: And the whole idea is when you deploy that thing in an avalanche, you're eliminating burial death. ROBBINS: They look something like car airbags but they work on an entirely different principle. Car airbags lessen injury by stopping you from crashing into the dashboard. Avalanche airbags don't stop you from crashing at all. They keep you safe simply by turning you into a larger object. BRUCE TREMPER: And larger objects rise to the top of avalanche debris. ROBBINS: Bruce Tremper, of the Utah Avalanche Center, says it's about the physics of granular flow. TREMPER: Take a bag of tortilla chips and, of course, you want the big pieces not the little crumbs. And so, you shake the bag up and down and the big pieces come to the surface. I mean most everybody knows that. ROBBINS: Geologists noticed that big trees and big rocks rose to the surface in avalanches. So why not make people bigger. One reason avalanche airbags have been slow to catch on in the U. S. is because the TSA doesn't allow passengers to fly with the canisters used to inflate the airbags. Ski resorts and backcountry guides are beginning to keep canisters on hand so people don't have to fly with them. (SOUNDBITE OF SKIING)ROBBINS: Amie Engerbretson is a professional skier. She says she wears an airbag backpack whenever she skis into the backcountry. She needed it a couple of months ago near Alta, Utah. AMIE ENGERBRETSON: I made my turn and very quickly after I made my turn, I felt the snow shift under my feet and then I saw cracks visibly shoot everywhere. And at that moment, I immediately reached up and released my airbag. ROBBINS: The next thing she knew, she was being carried along. She came to rest at the bottom of a gully under two feet of heavy snow. ENGERBRETSON: Obviously it's scary. But without an airbag, I probably would've been buried five to seven feet deep which is a very dangerous burial depth. ROBBINS: Instead, rescuers used beacons and probes to find her and dig her out in less than five minutes. Bruce Tremper of the Utah Avalanche Center says if every backcountry skier, snowboarder, or snowmobiler wore them. . . TREMPER: They would probably save about half the people who would otherwise have died in avalanches. So they work pretty well. ROBBINS: Avalanche airbags can cost more than a thousand dollars.

You may remember that last week we spoke with organizers of a hackathon in Oakland, California. It was a gathering of developers who were asked to consider ideas for, say, a smartphone app that could've saved Trayvon Martin or perhaps solve other social problems. But the bigger question was how to get young black males into tech careers, along with other people who might not usually find a seat at the table. Kalimah Priforce is back with us. He is cofounder of Qeyno Labs. He helped launch Startup Weekend Oakland Black Male Achievement. And we decided we wanted to check back in with him again so we called him in San Francisco. Welcome back. Thanks for joining us. KALIMAH PRIFORCE: Thank you. Thank you for having me. MARTIN: So I want to ask how things went, but I want to pick up where we left off. In our conversation, you know, you made a statement I think might have surprised and, you know, disturbed some people. You said that a lot of people at these big Silicon Valley companies just aren't comfortable working with young black men, and they told you that. And why is that? PRIFORCE: Yeah, it's very interesting. Yeah, so we definitely had gotten those emails. I definitely got those e-mails and, yeah, you know, I think that it has a lot to do with their own sort of - their own biases as it relates to interacting with people who don't look like them. And so there is the sort of racial, you know, ethnic side to it, but there's also the issue side to it. It's the - I don't know what are the issues or concerns of young black males and so I don't feel comfortable building anything related to those issues. MARTIN: So what happened? I mean, did you get the turnout that you hoped for? Did - what was it like? PRIFORCE: It was an overwhelming success. It was an overwhelming success. When - we thought we would get 150 people, and it was a rainy weekend that weekend. There was rain all over the place. And thank goodness that California got that rain, but we thought we would get 150, we planned for 150, we got 200. For our Saturday evening - I guess we call gala - we thought we were going to get 300 people and we ended up getting 400 people. And so - and that was the theme. The theme was that this hackathon was so much in demand that people really showed up. And that was really exciting. MARTIN: Well, it's interesting, so maybe those perceptions and reality were not the same at all. So tell us, what were some of the ideas that came out of it? What was exciting to you? PRIFORCE: So there were some really amazing ideas. But going back to the point - so there were definitely some challenges during the hackathon. So when we announced on Friday night that, hey, this is - you are required to have a trailblazer, which is what we call our young black males - and it's very inclusive, we have girls who are part of that group and, you know, we have Latinos who are part of that group - but primarily young black males. There were some people who left. There were some people who explained to me and said, well, I don't see why that has to be a requirement and - which is interesting because in hackathons that are focused on women, for example, it doesn't make sense that at the end of a weekend that an all-male team will come up and pitch at a hackathon that's designed for women. And so I just want to say that there definitely were some challenges during the hackathon. But some great apps came out of this hackathon, which was - HelpCircle, which is a social service there, they were the first-place winner. A social service that makes it easy to text a close friend or family when you're feeling unsafe. So they were really addressing that whole could an app have saved Trayvon Martin. And then this CourtDateApp, which was second- place winner. And they won their (inaudible) which is an SMS app that helps teens remember their court dates and avoid jail time for failure to appear in court. So - which was really interesting because because these developers, these designers, and our young people because they were aware of how powerful text and SMS messaging is in these communities - in these communities involving young black males - they built their apps around that. MARTIN: Now, Kalimah, you know I'm going to have to ask - any stereotyping there? Any stereotyping at work there? PRIFORCE: Yeah. I mean, I think they were really aware - I think that - I think even some of the developers were - they hadn't been aware of - they were aware that not all young black males have iPads, you know. Like, I mean, that was just something that they kind of just sort of woke up to. They said, oh, wow, you know, SMS, text messaging, and they said, yeah, the flip phone. Yeah, they just weren't aware of what were the actual tools that were in their hands. And so I think that that was something - and so they began to develop around that. MARTIN: OK, but they didn't develop an app so that they could remember their piano lessons, for example? I guess that's what I'm reacting to there. Why - you know. (LAUGHTER)PRIFORCE: Yeah, I think they were looking at what were some of the pressing issues and problems. And, of course, we had - so there was one app by - and they were our third-place winner - and the people's choice award - they were - it's called Connectthedots. And it's a counseling social network for students of color who attend private schools to build community amongst themselves. And so - and it was really amazing because there was this young man who pitched it on Friday night. And, you know, and he said, hey, you know, and I'm a young man of color and when I'm at private school, you know, I feel lonely. And I think there needs to be something for us to help us connect to one another and I think that that would help us be better students and help us better connect to our school. And so those are kind of the solutions that - and there were 11 apps that were produced that weekend. MARTIN: What was the vibe? What was the vibe like? I mean, again, particularly given that it started on what one might argue was a bit of a sour note - in some respects, in the sense that people were - on the other hand, honesty, you have to appreciate the honesty of people who said I'm uncomfortable with this because I don't know anybody like this, this is not part of my world. PRIFORCE: Yes. MARTIN: And yet, people came anyway. So what was the vibe? I mean, did you feel this kind of sense of hesitation? Or was it kind of jump right in or - what was the atmosphere? Was it similar to other hackathons you've been a part of? PRIFORCE: Yeah, the vibe was very - so the vibe was very village, if that makes sense. That the people - there were a couple of people, I would say maybe 20 people at most, who definitely didn't think that this was the Startup Weekend that they expected, which was sort of the generic homogenous environment of Silicon Valley hackathons. And so they left. OK, great, all right. You know, they got some food and they left, that's good. But for everyone else, it was a village environment. So even at the end, after the judging and we gave awards and all that, we actually had to rite of passage ceremony where all the trailblazers were on stage and everybody, everyone who was in the building, were shouting positive affirmations to them to let them know that they're all winners. And so that was the environment. We got a tremendous amount of volunteers - Kaiser Permanente and Dropbox, they - last minute they were able to provide us with laptops. And so that was the atmosphere there. And that's why people keep calling this hackathon amazing, I've heard magical. And I think it's because of that. It's because we actually - for something that is usually sort of technical - it actually became sort of a village environment in just a weekend. MARTIN: Where do you think you might go from here to build on this idea? PRIFORCE: So my. . . MARTIN: No pressure, by the way. PRIFORCE: No. So my investors and advisors want to have a serious conversation with me because and so they - 'cause they were involved. And that was really interesting. So going back to the whole village environment, they were involved and they were planning to be there for maybe about two or three hours. But they ended up staying the entire weekend. And then their wives also stayed the entire weekend. And then their husbands stayed the entire weekend. And so at the end, many of them pulled me to the side and said, Kalimah, we have to do this again, we need to look at what Qeyno is doing and how we can make this - how we can spread this. And so - yeah - so I need to go back to the drawing board and think of how to make this possible again, you know. So, yeah. MARTIN: Well, keep us posted. PRIFORCE: Will do. MARTIN: Kalimah Priforce is cofounder of a Qeyno Labs and an organizer of Startup Weekend Oakland. And we caught up with him in San Francisco. Thanks so much for joining us. Keep us posted.

They conjure images of terrifying wood-munching insects that can take down a house. But in Africa and Australia, termites are better known for their feats of construction rather than destruction. Termite colonies can build huge, elaborate mounds that rise up from the ground like insect skyscrapers. As NPR Nell Greenfieldboyce tells us, scientists recently took some lessons from termites to design a team of robot construction workers. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: Some insects are good at building things, think of a wasp's nest or an underground labyrinth of ant tunnels. But Justin Werfel says those insect homes are nothing compared to a big termite mound. JUSTIN WERFEL: Termites are the real masters of construction in the insect world. The largest termite mound on record was 42 feet tall. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says each mound has a complicated network of tunnels inside. The overall shape of the amount depends on the species. WERFEL: Some of them have an open chimney in the center and hot air can come rising out of that. Some of them are closed mounds. There are what are called cathedral mounds, they have all these elaborate ridges on the outside like flight buttresses. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Millions of insects were together to build these complex, large-scale structures by doing stuff like pushing bits of mud around. And yet they're not following a blueprint or listening to orders from some termite supervisor. Instead, they seem to sense what's around them and apply some simple rules to decide what to do next. That's what inspired Werfel and his colleagues at Harvard University to create robot termites. WERFEL: We've created this system of multiple independent robots that build things we ask for. And they do it more like the way insects act than the way that robots normally act. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The robots don't look like termites. They look more like black, mechanical beetles. They're about eight inches long. They have just a few onboard sensors that let them navigate around a work site set up in a lab. Each robot can grab a specially-designed square brick, carry it on its back, and then set it down. Werfel says that he and his team program the robots to follow some simple rules. WERFEL: They build things that are much larger than themselves. They climb on what they are working on building to get to higher places, and they coordinate what they are doing using a tool that termites use. Rather than talk to one another directly, they coordinate indirectly by changing their shared environment. So one puts down some material, another one comes along and reacts to that material, and uses that to help it decide later whether to put more material down. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The termite-inspired robots are described in the journal Science. Researchers show how programming the robots to follow different sets of rules can produce a variety of structures, from castles to pyramids. So far, the robots have only made modest structures and they do it slowly. For example, they built one that's shaped like a trident. WERFEL: And that involves only eight bricks and that takes half an hour. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The vision is that, someday, swarms of robots could stack up sandbags to protect against flooding, or go to Mars and build living quarters for astronauts. That's still a long way off. But this study is a proof of principle that robots can work together like termites to build complex structures. And Hod Lipson says that's a big deal. He's an engineer at Cornell University who specializes in robotics. HOD LIPSON: It's one of these things where the idea has been around for a while, that you can have robots cooperate to construct something larger than themselves, but no one has really been able to get that to work. And it's not because of any specific detail, but it's sort of coordinating everything together. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He thinks this study opens up a lot of new possibilities for thinking about how to use machines as builders in the future. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News. SIEGEL: This is NPR News. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  Termites don't have a very good reputation. They conjure images of terrifying wood-munching insects that can take down a house. But in Africa and Australia, termites are better known for their feats of construction rather than destruction. Termite colonies can build huge, elaborate mounds that rise up from the ground like insect skyscrapers. As NPR Nell Greenfieldboyce tells us, scientists recently took some lessons from termites to design a team of robot construction workers. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: Some insects are good at building things, think of a wasp's nest or an underground labyrinth of ant tunnels. But Justin Werfel says those insect homes are nothing compared to a big termite mound. JUSTIN WERFEL: Termites are the real masters of construction in the insect world. The largest termite mound on record was 42 feet tall. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says each mound has a complicated network of tunnels inside. The overall shape of the amount depends on the species. WERFEL: Some of them have an open chimney in the center and hot air can come rising out of that. Some of them are closed mounds. There are what are called cathedral mounds, they have all these elaborate ridges on the outside like flight buttresses. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Millions of insects were together to build these complex, large-scale structures by doing stuff like pushing bits of mud around. And yet they're not following a blueprint or listening to orders from some termite supervisor. Instead, they seem to sense what's around them and apply some simple rules to decide what to do next. That's what inspired Werfel and his colleagues at Harvard University to create robot termites. WERFEL: We've created this system of multiple independent robots that build things we ask for.

I'm Michel Martin. So here's a problem you might have had if you are a journalist or if you edit a neighborhood or a company newsletter or you just like to be correct and up-to-date in your written expressions. If you want to write about the hip-hop mogul who is married to Beyonce - and let's face it, who doesn't - do you write Jay Z with a dash or without? Is fat shaming one word or two? What pronouns do you use for a transgender woman? For writers searching for a clue, the website Buzzfeed has created a new style guide for the digital age. Emmy Favilla is Buzzfeed's chief copy editor, and she helped develop the guide. And she's with us now to tell us more about it. Welcome. Thanks so much for joining us. EMMY FAVILLA: Thanks for having me, Michel. MARTIN: How did you come up with this idea, or how did your team come up with this idea? Was it just the - exactly the kind of thing we were just talking? You were noticing that you were all making different choices? FAVILLA: So basically, you know, we had an in-house style guide that has been - you know, it's been in the works for, you know, the past year or so. And my editor-in-chief thought, you know, hey, why don't we just put our in-house style guide on the site and make it a public-facing document? MARTIN: Why did you think you needed it? I mean, were you all having arguments about this? Or were people - were people constantly coming up with different ways to address the same issue? FAVILLA: Not really. I mean, you know, we had this in-house style guide circulating, you know, amongst the staff. So it was accessible to the staff, and our intent in putting it on the web was really, you know - Buzzfeed, we have serious journalism and news on our site, and we have, like, you know, the fun, shareable silly lists and quizzes. And that's kind of reflective of what's on the Internet at large. So it's like, hey, you know, wouldn't it be helpful to have a set of guidelines to look for for web-specific questions and words and terms that you might not necessarily find, you know, in the AP style book? MARTIN: Were there any great debates over whether to hyphenate side-eye or whether it was OK to just call Lebron James Lebron? Were there any point in the process that were particularly contentious? FAVILLA: Not really. I mean, there were discussions. And, yeah, I mean, it's more fun - there's never any serious argument really about things in the style guide. And a lot of times, I actually take to Twitter when there are things that are kind of points of contention, I'll take to Twitter and be like, hey, should we hyphenate side-eye? Should we - how do we treat Vine-ing? To create a Vine as a verb, things like that. MARTIN: You know, you have extensive - an extensive section on how to deal with issues of particular concern to the LGBT community and individuals. And it's interesting because these are issues that have come up more frequently. I'm thinking about Bradley Manning, who then disclosed that he was transgender and then, henceforth, wished to be described by the female pronoun and by his chosen new name. And I was interested in whether - you know, how you develop these protocols, particularly because everybody doesn't always self-disclose. You know, people don't self-disclose and don't make clear what their choice is and how they wish to be described. FAVILLA: Well, I mean, I guess our - I can't take credit, you know, for all of the stuff that's in the LGBT section because we do credit the GLAAD transgender glossary of terms, and there's a link to the full document and that guide, which is great. We kind of adhere to the rule that whatever a person chooses as the pronoun by which they want to be referred to, whether it's he or she or they or, you know, anything else. If a person doesn't disclose, then that's - I mean, you know, then it's a case-by-case basis. But, you know, we just feel like every person should be treated with respect in terms of how they want to be referred to. MARTIN: So let me ask you a dilemma here. Plus-size is hyphenated, but ride share and ride sharing is not. FAVILLA: Oh, God. MARTIN: How come? FAVILLA: You're putting me on the spot here. We use the dictionary. We use Merriam-Webster's dictionary, and we use that and AP sort of together. And then if we decide that the way that, you know, certain words are treated - whether they're hyphenated or one word or two words - isn't reflective of how most people on the Internet are using it, then we'll have a discussion about it. So I can't pinpoint exactly when we decided to hyphenate one and not the other. MARTIN: I see that rom-com is hyphenated. So glad to know that. But here's a term - well, it's Valentine's Day, so I felt that we should, you know, highlight this - some of the romantic terms. But this was new to me - 'shippers - when referring to viewers who celebrate a fictional TV couple's romantic arc. And there's an apostrophe before 'shippers. FAVILLA: Yes, that one was actually just added, I think, a week or two ago because - I'll be honest - I had never heard that term before. MARTIN: That goodness. FAVILLA: Yeah. MARTIN: I feel so much better now. Greatly relieved. FAVILLA: No. Yeah. No, no. I was, like, is this a typo? What? So I was talking with one of our entertainment editors, and he explained what the term was. You know, he was like, that's the prevailing style for it, and we want what's in our style guide to be easy to read and easy to understand. And if most people are spelling it that way, with an apostrophe, then we're going to do that, too. MARTIN: OK. I'll let other people look up some of the other terms that I'm sure they're very concerned about, like, that refer to a part of the business that we don't really engage with. It has to do with porn and things like that. But I'll let people figure out some of the things that they're most concerned about. Is there. . . FAVILLA: I think I know what you're talking. MARTIN: Yeah, exactly. Is there one rule that you would want everybody to adhere to, something that people are continually getting wrong that you would like to kind of correct? FAVILLA: Not getting wrong so much, but I don't know why this is such a divisive thing. But we chose to use the percent sign rather than spelling out the word percent, and I guess it's just because, you know, people who come from, like, the New York Times and, you know, other places like that are used to spelling it out. And everyone's like, why aren't we using the symbol? It's totally not right. And it's kind of a silly thing, but, yeah. MARTIN: And if all else fails, then you can decide with rock-paper-scissors, which is spelled with a hyphen or two. FAVILLA: Yes. MARTIN: Emmy Favilla is Buzzfeed's chief copy editor. She was kind enough to join us from our bureau in New York. Emmy, thanks so much for joining us. FAVILLA: Thank you. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  This is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. I'm Michel Martin.

The political thriller is an original series produced by Netflix. And today, all 13 episodes of the new season, the show's second, are available. Our own David Greene got a sneak peek. DAVID GREENE, HOST: \"House of Cards\" paints one nasty picture of Washington. It's the story of Frank Underwood, a cold and calculating congressman. His wife, Claire Underwood, is just as evil. The couple thirsts for power and usually gets what they want. Right from the start of Season 2, we see Claire as her manipulative self. She's confronted by a former employee who is suing her. The woman is pregnant, in need of medication. Claire has arranged to cut off her health care to pressure the woman into a deal. (SOUNDBITE OF NETFLIX SERIES, \"HOUSE OF CARDS\")UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (as character) You realize what you are doing is. . . ROBIN WRIGHT: (as Claire Underwood) Is civil, criminal. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (as character) Have you thought this out 'cause when we go to court. . . WRIGHT: (as Claire Underwood) You mean six months from now? You're expecting in four, no? That's four months without the medicine you need. I'm willing to let your child wither and die inside you, if that's what's required. But neither of us wants that. Now tell me, am I really the sort of enemy you want to make? GREENE: Robin Wright plays Claire Underwood. She earned an Emmy nomination for the role. She and the creator of the series, Beau Willimon, came in to chat with us. Welcome to you both. BEAU WILLIMON: Hi. WRIGHT: Hi. GREENE: Robin Wright, I want to begin with you. Do you like the character you're playing here? She's evil. WILLIMON: Oh, I don't see her as evil. She's just very responsible. (LAUGHTER)GREENE: OK. WILLIMON: I have to like her. I love playing it. Actually, it's the most fun to be a scheming and calculating and successful. How great. The characters certainly don't see themselves as evil. Frank and Claire don't necessarily operate on the same ethical spectrum that a lot of people do. The choices they make are for political expediency and the advancement of their own ascent to power. And one of the big questions that \"House of Cards\" asks is: What are these two people capable of? It's a question that they're constantly forced to answer, both to themselves and to us, the audience. GREENE: Well, Beau Willimon, what is your fascination with power? WILLIMON: Power is something that pervades all of our lives, not just in the workplace but at home between our loved ones, and sometimes in very simple ways. If someone butts in front of you in line at the grocery store, that's an act of power. You know, with this show, what we see are two people who make a living masterfully playing the power game. GREENE: You bring up the interplay between Frank and Claire. And this marriage, I mean it is so transactional in a way. It's so calculating. Can love exist in a relationship like that? WILLIMON: First of all, I'd say all relationships are transactional. Love is transactional; how much you give yourself to someone, how vulnerable you are willing to let yourself to be. And that's no different for Francis and Claire. I think they deeply love one another. There's extreme mutual respect and they rely on each other's strength. If they didn't have love then I don't think they would be able to persist the way they do for as long as they have. WRIGHT: A great quote that I read that did the article on Beau, for the New York Times, I think. And he said that the new vows for Francis and Claire Underwood would be: In ambition and venality and mutual gain for ever and ever. (LAUGHTER)WRIGHT: You couldn't sum it up better than that. GREENE: Very nice - not a wedding I'd want to go to. But it's - but there do seem, Robin Wright, to be some moments where love doesn't feel transactional, where there's a real purity and vulnerability to it. WRIGHT: I mean yes, absolutely. And if you're referring to Season 1, what was beautiful in that that Beau wrote is how it came to the surface, how it started to emerge, the vulnerability. Which is at the end of the day, we're all human as venal. . . (LAUGHTER)WRIGHT: . . . as it can be and corrupt, they're still human underneath it all. GREENE: In the first season there was one character, a female reporter, who tried to sleep with the Congressman Frank Underwood to get scoops. And ultimately she was basically being used, being played by him. There were some female journalists in Washington who suggested that that wasn't a really accurate portrayal. I mean what do you think overall is this show's betrayal of women? WILLIMON: Well, we're not trying to portray all of media through Zoe Barnes. GREENE: She's was the reporter, right? WILLIMON: She's not meant to be a prototype for the way that all journalists work. And I actually think you characterized it a little wrong in terms of the relationship with Francis, because she does show up that first time to his house. And when she tries to play the sexual card that does not impress him, he has no interest in that. And it's her intelligence, her insight, her perceptiveness that ultimately makes Francis think that she might be formidable. And the bargain is not necessarily one of: If we sleep together you get your scoops. It becomes a complicated dance between these two people, one who has power and one wants access to it. GREENE: Robin Wright, did some of that criticism get to you at all? WRIGHT: No. Because, you know, we're doing a fictionalized serial. It's a political drama. Yeah, it's sensationalized in many ways. And it's also, it's a great template like any fictionalized piece. You know, don't they get so personally. . . (LAUGHTER)WRIGHT: . . . even though it's true. In Washington, had a couple of people - politicians approach me - and I said can you tell me what is inaccurate about the show? And they said: Well, I have to tell you tell you it's about 99 percent accurate, if we're talking about. . . GREENE: Really? WRIGHT: It's like an instruction manual almost for D. C. And I. . . GREENE: That's a little frightening. (LAUGHTER)WRIGHT: What's the 1 percent? And he said: You wouldn't get an education bill passed that fast. (LAUGHTER)GREENE: Oh. You know the series that your show is often compared to is \"West Wing. \" And in the late '90s, some people saw that that show portrayed the Washington that people were dreaming of at that time. What role does \"House of Cards\" play, if we think about Washington at this moment? WILLIMON: There's something very attractive about a congressman like Frank Underwood. You may not condone what he does but you cannot deny the fact that he gets things done. He poses the question, or the show does: Do the ends justify the means? We don't answer that question but at least there's ends there. And right now, in Washington, we often don't even have the ends. GREENE: You feel like you're tapping into a certain frustration with Washington right now that some people feel. WILLIMON: I think so. I mean there's also something delicious about a character - well, and this is true of both Francis and Claire - who refuse to play by the rules. We often wish that we could unshackle ourselves from rules and convention. And these two people have. We see two liberated people. That doesn't mean that they don't brush up against reality all that time, they don't have obstacles they need to overcome or push through. But they themselves are bound to no one but each other. GREENE: Well, \"House of Cards\" the second season is released by Netflix today. We've been speaking to the show's creator Beau Willimon and actress Robin Wright. Thank you both so much for taking the time. We appreciate it. WRIGHT: Thank you. WILLIMON: Thanks for having us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MONTAGNE: You're listening to MORNING EDITION from NPR News.

It's a question that they're constantly forced to answer, both to themselves and to us, the audience. GREENE: Well, Beau Willimon, what is your fascination with power? WILLIMON: Power is something that pervades all of our lives, not just in the workplace but at home between our loved ones, and sometimes in very simple ways. If someone butts in front of you in line at the grocery store, that's an act of power. You know, with this show, what we see are two people who make a living masterfully playing the power game. GREENE: You bring up the interplay between Frank and Claire. And this marriage, I mean it is so transactional in a way. It's so calculating. Can love exist in a relationship like that? WILLIMON: First of all, I'd say all relationships are transactional. Love is transactional; how much you give yourself to someone, how vulnerable you are willing to let yourself to be. And that's no different for Francis and Claire. I think they deeply love one another. There's extreme mutual respect and they rely on each other's strength. If they didn't have love then I don't think they would be able to persist the way they do for as long as they have. WRIGHT: A great quote that I read that did the article on Beau, for the New York Times, I think. And he said that the new vows for Francis and Claire Underwood would be: In ambition and venality and mutual gain for ever and ever. (LAUGHTER) WRIGHT: You couldn't sum it up better than that. GREENE: Very nice - not a wedding I'd want to go to. But it's - but there do seem, Robin Wright, to be some moments where love doesn't feel transactional, where there's a real purity and vulnerability to it. WRIGHT: I mean yes, absolutely. And if you're referring to Season 1, what was beautiful in that that Beau wrote is how it came to the surface, how it started to emerge, the vulnerability. Which is at the end of the day, we're all human as venal. . . (LAUGHTER) WRIGHT: . . . as it can be and corrupt, they're still human underneath it all. GREENE: In the first season there was one character, a female reporter, who tried to sleep with the Congressman Frank Underwood to get scoops. And ultimately she was basically being used, being played by him. There were some female journalists in Washington who suggested that that wasn't a really accurate portrayal. I mean what do you think overall is this show's betrayal of women? WILLIMON: Well, we're not trying to portray all of media through Zoe Barnes. GREENE: She's was the reporter, right? WILLIMON: She's not meant to be a prototype for the way that all journalists work. And I actually think you characterized it a little wrong in terms of the relationship with Francis, because she does show up that first time to his house. And when she tries to play the sexual card that does not impress him, he has no interest in that. And it's her intelligence, her insight, her perceptiveness that ultimately makes Francis think that she might be formidable. And the bargain is not necessarily one of: If we sleep together you get your scoops. It becomes a complicated dance between these two people, one who has power and one wants access to it. GREENE: Robin Wright, did some of that criticism get to you at all? WRIGHT: No. Because, you know, we're doing a fictionalized serial. It's a political drama. Yeah, it's sensationalized in many ways. And it's also, it's a great template like any fictionalized piece. You know, don't they get so personally. . . (LAUGHTER) WRIGHT: . . . even though it's true. In Washington, had a couple of people - politicians approach me - and I said can you tell me what is inaccurate about the show? And they said: Well, I have to tell you tell you it's about 99 percent accurate, if we're talking about. . . GREENE: Really? WRIGHT: It's like an instruction manual almost for D. C. And I. . . GREENE: That's a little frightening. (LAUGHTER) WRIGHT: What's the 1 percent? And he said: You wouldn't get an education bill passed that fast. (LAUGHTER) GREENE: Oh. You know the series that your show is often compared to is \"West Wing. \" And in the late '90s, some people saw that that show portrayed the Washington that people were dreaming of at that time. What role does \"House of Cards\" play, if we think about Washington at this moment? WILLIMON: There's something very attractive about a congressman like Frank Underwood. You may not condone what he does but you cannot deny the fact that he gets things done. He poses the question, or the show does: Do the ends justify the means? We don't answer that question but at least there's ends there. And right now, in Washington, we often don't even have the ends. GREENE: You feel like you're tapping into a certain frustration with Washington right now that some people feel. WILLIMON: I think so. I mean there's also something delicious about a character - well, and this is true of both Francis and Claire - who refuse to play by the rules. We often wish that we could unshackle ourselves from rules and convention. And these two people have. We see two liberated people. That doesn't mean that they don't brush up against reality all that time, they don't have obstacles they need to overcome or push through. But they themselves are bound to no one but each other. GREENE: Well, \"House of Cards\" the second season is released by Netflix today. We've been speaking to the show's creator Beau Willimon and actress Robin Wright. Thank you both so much for taking the time. We appreciate it. WRIGHT: Thank you. WILLIMON: Thanks for having us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MONTAGNE: You're listening to MORNING EDITION from NPR News.

I'm Arun Rath. It has been an ugly winter. In the past two weeks, a pair of storms has made life miserable across the Eastern U. S. On Thursday, much of the south and northeast were buried in snow and ice. At least 26 people have died. Tens of thousands of flights have been canceled, rail service delayed, and roads in many cities are still impassable. Meanwhile, more than a million customers lost power during the storm. Thousands of homes and businesses are still without electricity. From the Deep South to the northeast, forecasters are working double time. (SOUNDBITE OF WEATHER REPORTS)RATH: So who takes the blame when cities are unprepared for weather disasters, weather forecasters or politicians? Thomas Bogdan heads up the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research. It's a group that oversees national weather studies, and he says that forecasting can definitely get a lot better. THOMAS BOGDAN: Forecasts have improved a lot over the years, but the demands on those forecasts have probably increased even faster than they have. You know, as society gets increasingly complex and interconnected, and we operate closer and closer to the margins of our systems, we're increasingly vulnerable to winter storms such as the one that hit Atlanta last month. So first of all, it's trying to improve our models to deal with the timing and location, which are critical to what's going on. And then it's also completing that forecast, finding a way to take the information we have about the physical system and translate it into information that the average person can use to make good decisions about whether they go out, when they come home from work, if they pick up the kids from day care and things like that. RATH: What are some of the things that can be done on the ground to make weather forecasting more accurate? BOGDAN: Certainly on the ground, one of the key things is to bring more data into the forecast. What's exciting now is the potential of crowdsourcing. You think about smart automobiles. They know the temperature outside, they know whether they've been using their antilock brakes, they know whether the high beams are on or whether they've used the windshield wipers. The Department of Transportation has funded a winter study in the states of Michigan, Minnesota and Nevada where they are deploying small sensors on plows. Even your cellphone, if you think about it, knows some critical things about the weather around you, and so each and every one of us with a smartphone can potentially be a small weather station. And that knowledge, that very dense knowledge is what we need to nudge the forecasts and keep them accurate. RATH: You've also pointed out that we're good at predicting two things: That would be immediate weather, say, that there's a big storm coming in tomorrow; and long-term trends like an ongoing drought. But you've noted we're terrible at predicting weather over the medium term, like months or a year. Why is that? BOGDAN: Indeed. The intermediate forecast is an area where scientists are very excited about trying to make some progress. We're talking about timescales from maybe one month to one decade as this intermediate area that I like to refer to as wimate or cleather, where you put weather and climate together and make a word that's unpronounceable. And this area, it's fascinating that the ocean is the planet's memory on these timescales. And so the atmospheric sciences community and the oceanic community are really marshaling their forces to try to put together global earth system models that really include the ocean on the same par as the atmosphere. Of course, we will never be making predictions that it's going to rain at 2:30 on February 17, 2018. That's not the way it's going to work. It's going to be probabilistic, but the economic impacts of getting this right are huge. If you think about companies, water resource managers, people in agriculture - there are so many decisions that our society has to make. And right now, without really good information on those timescales, they are encountering a lot of risk. RATH: What are some of the ways that meteorologists can get better at delivering their message to the public? BOGDAN: I think part of it is working with public officials that actually have to make decisions and understand what their criteria are. What is the threshold at which they have to begin considering taking actions that are out of the ordinary to respond to a situation? And once those thresholds are understood by the weather community, then you don't give information before you're at that threshold because it's not information that's actionable. RATH: Now, in terms of the decisions that affect people's lives, obviously, the meteorologist, the National Weather Service, don't decide when to close schools and that sort of thing. So on the side of local governments, are there things that they could be doing that could - to be doing a better job? BOGDAN: Well, I think communication is the key here. Atlanta's a really interesting situation to observe. They had the same type of event come back basically one week later after the first event, and the reaction was totally different from what they did there. And it was because relationships had formed between the officials and the weather people that provide that information. That trust was there, and lessons had been learned from the first time through. RATH: That's Thomas Bogdan, president of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, on a rough couple of weeks of winter weather. ARUN RATH, HOST:  It's ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR West.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RATH: RATH: Carlos Watson is the co-founder of the online magazine Ozy. Each week, he joins us to talk about what's new and what's next. Welcome back, Carlos. CARLOS WATSON: Arun, always good to be with you. RATH: So a lot of people are familiar with Snapchat. This is a texting service that lets you send photos. You could put messages on them and they disappear after a certain period of time. You have a piece about a new texting service, but it seems like it might be Snapchat for grown-ups, for people who want their texts to be completely unhackable. WATSON: You bet. So there's a new company called Privatext that realizes more and more people wanted to send risque, or just important and confidential texts to each other but there was a concern about how, you know, easily they could keep it private. And so now, Privatext allows you to send a text from one person to another; where you've got a special pincode, they've got a special pincode, and you can keep it private, you could have it disappear. You can keep it going for as long as 30 seconds and up to 24 hours. But it's up to you how long the text remains in the other person's phone. RATH: So who do you think this is for? WATSON: Privatext is, interestingly enough, finding interest in two areas. One, among business people - imagine someone in the middle of some kind of important deal or negotiation - and then hospitals. You've got really confidential information that you want to share with a patient or a doctor or someone else; this might be an opportunity to kind of conform with the law and the rules. RATH: Finally, we have another business story. When people think about big corporations, you don't usually think about, you know, them looking after the little guy. But there's an interesting piece you have about how people are trying to kind of turn corporate culture upside down, almost. WATSON: For years, when companies were created, they became what were called C corps. , or sometimes they're referred to as S corps. But there's a whole new designation, something called a B corp. , which stands for benefit corp. And the idea there is that not only do profits matter, but that you're also able to measure its impact on the planet as well as its impact on people. And so it's a triple-bottom-line kind of company that now, 20 states have authorized. And you're seeing a lot of hot companies make that decision - Etsy, if you know Etsy; or Warby Parker; or even Patagonia. RATH: Etsy is an online marketplace for handmade goods. WATSON: Correct. That now, you know, last year alone saw more than a billion dollars in sales and trading happen on its platform. And some people, Arun, are saying that Etsy may be the first benefit corp. to go public - if indeed, as some are speculating, it does so in the next 12 to 18 months. RATH: Wow. That would be - has a corporation like this ever gone publicly traded before? WATSON: Not yet. And that's why people are intrigued. Now, the other wrinkle here is that it's one thing to be a so-called certified B corp. , which is done by a nonprofit group called B Labs, as in Benefit Labs. But it's another thing to truly register with the state of Delaware, or the state of Maryland, and to go through that process. Now, Etsy hasn't registered formally as a B corp. They're a good old-fashioned C corp. , but they're certified. So that's a fancy way of saying if they were to go to public, would they still be able to care about the planet, and about people, as much as they do about profits? Or would all that just end up being nice talk, and could any shareholder sue them to the extent they weren't maximizing profits? RATH: Right. It'd be interesting to find out. WATSON: Look, it could upend 100-plus years of major corporate culture, in a world in which millennials and others are increasingly saying we want more out of our companies. Boy, this could be a shot across the bow, and could change things in a major way. RATH: Carlos Watson is the co-founder of the online magazine Ozy.

Now, for years you had to ask somebody why they were happy in order study what makes somebody happy, but that's been hard to do every minute of every day until now.

But it's hard to know for sure what's causing what and it's ever harder to know what can people actually change and have an impact in their lives. RAZ: So Matt, he came up with a solution. An app on your smartphone. He calls it track your happiness and you can sign up online and a couple times a day Matt will send you a text with a link to a survey. KILLINGSWORTH: And the idea is that you want to respond as fast as you can and tell me about your experience at the instant right before you got that text message.

Do you have to do what you're doing? Do you want to do what you're doing? Yes or no. RAZ: Thirty-five thousand people have answered these questions for Matt.

RAZ: And Matt thinks all of these data points - who we spend our time with, how we think about ourselves and other people, where our attention is focused - might just add up into an equation for happiness. So what is it? (LAUGHTER)KILLINGSWORTH: So when I look across all the different activities that people engage in, they are universally happier when they're fully engaged in that activity and not mind wandering, no matter what they're doing. RAZ: Even when you're doing something you dislike like your morning commute, it's better when you are in the moment, when your mind isn't wandering.

I'm Audie Cornish. And now to All Tech Considered. (SOUNDBITE OF THEME MUSIC)CORNISH: Today is a tricky business of keeping some American technologies out of foreign hands. When a man from Hong Kong met with an aerospace company in Seattle last week, he was really dealing with an undercover Homeland Security agent. See Kee Chin allegedly tried to buy $85,000 worth of highly specialized accelerometers. He was arrested and charged with trying to smuggle the parts to China. The bust is just one example of a constant U. S. effort to keep certain technologies under wraps. Accelerometers are widely used - you can even find them in Smartphones. But as NPR's Martin Kaste reports, the ones Mr. Chin is accused of trying to buy could be used in missiles. MARTIN KASTE, BYLINE: Adam Bruckner is a professor in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at the University of Washington. And he's old-school. In his office, he has stacks of paper that haven't been sorted since the '80s and spaceship models that date back to Apollo. He offers this old-school description of what an accelerometer does. ADAM BRUCKNER: The simplest approach to an accelerometer is to hang a small weight from a spring. And the spring will stretch or shrink, depending on how fast this thing is accelerating. And the little pointer shows you, on the dial, what your acceleration is. KASTE: Back in the 1950s, that concept was used to guide missiles around the world. Imagine the challenge of that - using weights, springs and spinning gyroscopes - they could steer a rocket all the way to Vladivostok. Nowadays, accelerometers track movement inside your Smartphone and they've also changed. BRUCKNER: If you rattle your iPhone, you're not going to hear anything rattling around in it. So it's all solid state, basically. KASTE: In some modern accelerometers, movement is captured by micro-electromechanical structures flexing almost imperceptibly on a silicon chip. In others, special kinds of ceramic or crystal generate power when they're squeezed by a tiny test weight. To engineers, these methods are mostly old hat but some accelerometers are more impressive than others. BRUCKNER: The Chinese can make these crystals or these ceramics just as well as we can. It's what goes with them that allows this device to do what you want it to do. KASTE: The Chinese citizen arrested in Seattle last week was trying to buy accelerometers made for spacecraft - Honeywell's QA-3000 line, in case you're in the market. Bill Argue runs counter-proliferation investigations for Homeland Security. And while he can't discuss the case in Seattle, he says guidance systems in general are very much on China's shopping list. BILL ARGUE: China is developing, you know, their next-generation combat aircraft in part by seeking out U. S. origin goods. KASTE: Those accelerometers in Seattle were export-restricted, governed by something called the International Traffic in Arms Regulations or ITAR. It's an acronym that strikes fear in the hearts of law-abiding engineers. KRISTI MORGANSEN: Very bad, don't mess with it. KASTE: Kristi Morgansen is also on faculty at the University of Washington, where she often builds projects with these ITAR-restricted devices. MORGANSEN: Don't go there. If we - if anybody at the university is ever accused of violating ITAR, the university will not back you. You're on your own and they're very clear about this. KASTE: ITAR is a bright red line but foreign buyers keep trying. Investigators say they're seeing purchase attempts now through front companies, as well as through recent immigrants who don't always understand the legal risks. Morgansen says she doesn't think the law can keep these technologies bottled up forever. But she says it might stall things long enough to allow American accelerometer makers to keep their technological edge. Martin Kaste, NPR News, Seattle.

Bittner was at a genealogy conference in Salt Lake City recently, where I also met Rhonda McClure of the New England Historic Genealogical Society.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RATH: Carlos Watson is the co-founder of the online magazine Ozy. Each week, he joins us to talk about what's new and what's next. Welcome back, Carlos. CARLOS WATSON: Arun, great to be with you. RATH: So here's a situation that anybody who's been a freelancer in the last 10 years has faced: you need that precious Wi-Fi at the coffee shop, but how many cappuccinos do you have to buy to justify sitting there all day? And finally, someone saw an opportunity there, right? WATSON: So for those who are not shameless, like you and me, and are willing just to buy one and sit there for eight hours, there's now a new option called pay-as-you-go cafes, where instead of paying for the coffee, you actually just pay for the amount of time you're there. Some of the spots are only literally a nickel a minute, so about $3 an hour. But it's taken off in Europe as well as South America. RATH: It's great because, I mean, if you've been in that situation, as I have, you're doing this constant, like, moral math in your head. Well, it's not too crowded, so I can hang around a bit longer or do I need to have a second one to justify my spot or - it's surprising nobody thought about this before. WATSON: One of the places called Urban Station has been around since 2009. And the other place called Ziferblat, which now you can enjoy in London, among other places, really got its start in Russia. But a lot of young people and a lot of just freelancers in general are finding this makes all the sense in the world. And for less than five bucks an hour, I have kind of a clean, safe place to do my work without any kind of moral shame or discomfort. RATH: It's nice to work without moral shame. So I'm hearing Russia, Europe, Latin America - so are we going to get some of these in America? WATSON: You know, at the moment, we have not. And the answer's kind of simple - it hasn't been profitable enough. Again, people are charging the equivalent of about a nickel a minute. And, you know, when you talk about some of the real estate prices and other things here in the States, it may be harder to make it work here than it is, say, in Istanbul or Bogota. RATH: So that double Frappuccino or whatever might actually make more money than charging you for the space. WATSON: You know, indeed. RATH: Well, that's too bad. Well, hopefully, it'll work out here soon enough. Finally, you have a very interesting story about a biotech boom in a place that people might not expect. I'll set it up by quoting \"Spinal Tap\": \"Hello, Cleveland. \"(LAUGHTER)WATSON: Cleveland, which is my hometown, by the way, Arun. . . RATH: I did not know that. WATSON: Very, very true. RATH: I'll hold the jokes. (LAUGHTER)WATSON: Please do. It is no longer the mistake by the lake. We now refer to it as the fury by the Erie. While lots of folks thought about the Rust Belt and thought about the struggling manufacturing sector there, a whole new area has boomed, and in particular medical technology companies that are spinning out of the Cleveland Clinic and several other universities there and now are providing just under half-a-million jobs. RATH: Wow. I know about this because I actually have visited the Cleveland Clinic. They have a brain health center that's actually in Nevada, of all places, doing, you know, amazing cutting-edge work. WATSON: The Cleveland Clinic recognize that a lot of the brilliant research they were doing had practical application, and close to 100 companies have spun out of some of the work that's happened there and its surrounding institutions. And, in fact, the city of Cleveland has set aside a 1,600-acre parcel where you see lots of innovative companies, including one that we profiled this week called HeartLab, are doing lots of good and important work. RATH: So are you moving back? WATSON: Not anytime soon. I love this California weather. I'm still a Cleveland Browns fan, love the Cleveland Indians, even the Cavaliers - but happy to see that there's more than just sports to cheer for these days. RATH: Great.

And they range from really, really graphic rape threats to really graphic death threats to threats of at both of it at once. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: That is the voice of Melissa Anelli. She's been the victim of cyberstalking for more than five years. The perpetrator is thousands of miles away from her, in New Zealand. There's even an FBI warrant for her arrest if she were to come to this country. But, for Anelli the barrage of e-mails and messages are an imminent mental threat. Anelli runs a popular website for Harry Potter fans called The Leaky Cauldron, which is how she became a target. This past week, she broke her silence about the woman who's been stalking her since 2008. Anelli wrote on her blog that it's time to show the effect it has had on her life. Melissa Anelli is our Sunday Conversation. ANELLI: I had heard from moderators of our forum that she was harassing one of our volunteer staff. And I wasn't a hundred percent sure why at the time, but the words I had heard were: I'll only stop if Melissa asks me to. And so, I wrote her an e-mail with all of my staff cc'd asking her to please listen to my staff. And she told me she would immediately. And the next morning I woke up to a death threat. MARTIN: Clearly, when you get a death threat you call in the authorities. It's a clear case of stalking at that point, right? ANELLI: Yeah. We went to the police and the police said: Well, I'm sure we could get you a restraining order but it's a piece of paper that's only useful if she's in New York, where I live. So they said: You know, this is not going to end this. And so, then we started trying every agency we could go to because they weren't stopping. They started coming in frequently. Every time I would turn around on Twitter there was a new account adding me. It became very quickly that I had to shut down any method of anyone contacting me if I didn't know you already. And finally, somebody said why don't you try the FBI? And I wasn't aware that the FBI would be the most useful place, but immediately somebody got back to us. The agent was a massive Harry Potter fan, which helped I think. And she was the first one to say to us: No, you absolutely shouldn't be going through this, and we can help. MARTIN: So I understand in 2011, there was some kind a breakthrough in the case, right? Can you explain what happened? ANELLI: In December 2011, we received a message from the FBI saying that she was arrested for criminal harassment in New Zealand. It was a big deal because they warned me that, not only are stalking cases notoriously hard because until the person actually harms you, it's hard to get it prioritized. But international stalking cases where old school thinking deems that if they're not in your physical proximity and they can't harm you with a knife, you know, or something like that, then it's less important. And that couldn't be further than from the truth because the mental toll is exorbitant. And she was arrested and but on bail and was given a diversion program, they call it down there. And there are terms to this diversion program where she would not contact me and she had to stay away from the Internet for a while. And that was through March of '12. And the day, I believe, that it expired, I got my first, you know, comment from her again. And it only exacerbated the situation. And so we were fairly sure that, well, OK, they've arrested her, she's doing it again. Maybe they'll go and get her again. And it's been now two and a half years since that. And it hasn't happened again. So. . . MARTIN: That had to have been disappointing at that point. ANELLI: Very, because the release that we felt the night that she was arrested was palpable because not only was there a chance this would all finally stop. I mean but maybe she would also get the help she needs. She has tattoos that supposedly represent me. She sent my nephew, when he was just born, a package and a note that said: Enjoy your family while you can. She found my cell phone number. She found my mother's number. She sends me satellite photos of my house. It's really beyond the extreme with her and we thought that maybe there was relief coming. And so when two months were quiet, you know, we had careful hope and then she only got more vociferous when she came back. MARTIN: So, I'm wondering how you cope. ANELLI: I do take solace that she's a long way away. I agree when people remind me that at least she's not going to actually knock on my door, but that doesn't stop you from fearing what's behind the door every time somebody unexpected is there. I've woken up at 4 o'clock in the morning scared that I had forgotten to lock my door. I've sought therapy and it has helped. I've tried to just lock down all my privacy channels. And even the FBI has told me we are astonished at how long this woman is hanging on. Usually people, you know, they give up. And so sitting and being quiet sometimes leaves you with pretty bad moments. There are times when I'll see, you know, other cases having progress and I'm still sitting there waiting for this one to go forward or I'll just get frustrated or I'll get angry about unrelated things that I realize were related to the situation. And it's incredibly frustrating. The mental toll that cyberstalking takes on people can't be overstated, because you're not allowed to engage, so you're not allowed to be part of the solution. Whereas, with a lot of other crimes, as hard it is to come forward for some other crimes, when you do, it's not making the crime worse - the crime happened already. This actually does potentially makes the crime worse and I'm taking a big chance even doing it. But it just finally felt like enough was enough. MARTIN: Did you ever consider shutting down your website altogether, just saying I'm done with this whole thing? ANELLI: No. As much as she's affected me and harmed my ability to trust, I won't let her win in that way, I won't let her. I won't let her make it bad for other people in that way. The website has done way more good than any bad she could conjure. And so, while I've had the moment of thinking, man, that it would be easier if there was nothing, it would feel like a defeat. So I've never considered it. MARTIN: Melissa Anelli, author and webmaster for the Leaky Cauldron. Thanks so much for talking with Melissa and sharing your story. We appreciate it. ANELLI: Thank you for having me. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MARTIN: You're listening to NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MELISSA ANELLI: I'll get 20 messages, you know, in a day. And they range from really, really graphic rape threats to really graphic death threats to threats of at both of it at once. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  That is the voice of Melissa Anelli. She's been the victim of cyberstalking for more than five years. The perpetrator is thousands of miles away from her, in New Zealand. There's even an FBI warrant for her arrest if she were to come to this country. But, for Anelli the barrage of e-mails and messages are an imminent mental threat. Anelli runs a popular website for Harry Potter fans called The Leaky Cauldron, which is how she became a target. This past week, she broke her silence about the woman who's been stalking her since 2008. Anelli wrote on her blog that it's time to show the effect it has had on her life. Melissa Anelli is our Sunday Conversation. ANELLI: I had heard from moderators of our forum that she was harassing one of our volunteer staff. And I wasn't a hundred percent sure why at the time, but the words I had heard were: I'll only stop if Melissa asks me to. And so, I wrote her an e-mail with all of my staff cc'd asking her to please listen to my staff. And she told me she would immediately. And the next morning I woke up to a death threat. MARTIN: Clearly, when you get a death threat you call in the authorities. It's a clear case of stalking at that point, right? ANELLI: Yeah. We went to the police and the police said: Well, I'm sure we could get you a restraining order but it's a piece of paper that's only useful if she's in New York, where I live. So they said: You know, this is not going to end this. And so, then we started trying every agency we could go to because they weren't stopping. They started coming in frequently. Every time I would turn around on Twitter there was a new account adding me. It became very quickly that I had to shut down any method of anyone contacting me if I didn't know you already. And finally, somebody said why don't you try the FBI? And I wasn't aware that the FBI would be the most useful place, but immediately somebody got back to us. The agent was a massive Harry Potter fan, which helped I think. And she was the first one to say to us: No, you absolutely shouldn't be going through this, and we can help. MARTIN: So I understand in 2011, there was some kind a breakthrough in the case, right? Can you explain what happened? ANELLI: In December 2011, we received a message from the FBI saying that she was arrested for criminal harassment in New Zealand. It was a big deal because they warned me that, not only are stalking cases notoriously hard because until the person actually harms you, it's hard to get it prioritized. But international stalking cases where old school thinking deems that if they're not in your physical proximity and they can't harm you with a knife, you know, or something like that, then it's less important. And that couldn't be further than from the truth because the mental toll is exorbitant. And she was arrested and but on bail and was given a diversion program, they call it down there. And there are terms to this diversion program where she would not contact me and she had to stay away from the Internet for a while. And that was through March of '12. And the day, I believe, that it expired, I got my first, you know, comment from her again. And it only exacerbated the situation.

Boyd is a respected researcher in the world of social media. She spent about eight years studying teenagers and how they interact online. Her findings are in a new book called \"It's Complicated. \" NPR's Elizabeth Blair reports. ELIZABETH BLAIR, BYLINE: Danah Boyd is one of those people who seems to have memorized the maps of the World Wide Web. DANAH BOYD: Hold on one second. BLAIR: She roams like the rest of us, but she also seems to know exactly where to go and what to do when she gets there. She's got a variety of different Twitter accounts. BOYD: So, I have both my formal professional Zephoria account, but then I actually have a personal account, which is me joking around with friends. And then I have an even sillier account where I pretend to be my seven-month-old son. BLAIR: When she wants to share photos with friends, she goes to Flickr. BOYD: Flickr has been a home for a long time. BLAIR: For work, she goes to LinkedIn. BOYD: This is when I want to engage with, you know, a professional world. I'll write posts here. BLAIR: Then, with some eye-rolling, Danah Boyd says, yes, she's on Facebook. But, she says, it's a hard space to manage. BOYD: I have to simultaneously deal with professional situations, friends from the past, friends from the present, all in one environment. And I don't share the same thing in those worlds. For me, it's just, you know, a world of context collapse. BLAIR: Context collapse. Danah Boyd, who attended MIT and works for Microsoft, isn't sure whether she or a fellow social scientist coined the phrase, but she refers to it a lot. She says, like adults, teenagers are figuring out how to present themselves in different contexts. One of the chapters in her new book is all about why teenagers seem to behave so strangely online. BOYD: They're trying to figure out the boundaries with regard to their peers. So, what is cool, what, you know, what is funny, what will, you know, get them a lot of attention, good or bad? BLAIR: And, as they get older, they want to look cooler. BOYD: And so you'd see people being, like, you know, CareBear3344, and then they'd realized that, you know, they're no longer 13, and talking about Care Bears is no longer cute. And so they have to write something more sophisticated. And so then we pick up, you know, a Jack Kerouac reference, and all of the sudden, somebody is Dharma Bum. BLAIR: To write \"It's Complicated,\" Danah Boyd spent about eight years studying teenagers and their social media behavior. She traveled to 16 different U. S. states, different communities - rich and poor, urban and rural. She interviewed over 160 teenagers. She promised them confidentiality. So, I went to talk to some high school students in Washington, D. C. about some of the issues raised in Boyd's book, like context collapse. Fourteen-year-old Faith Sydnor told me that she and her friends use social media to talk to each other, and that's why they've left Facebook. FAITH SYDNOR: Because older people are getting on there, and we want, like, our own social network to ourselves, I guess, so we won't get in trouble. BLAIR: Teenagers, Danah Boyd writes in her book, are desperate to have access to a social world like that which adults take for granted. Jamahri Sydnor thinks a lot of adults don't understand that her smartphone is a place to relax and have fun. JAMAHRI SYDNOR: My phone is my escape from, like, all of the things in school. So, like, and also other things that stress me out. So, I think that being on your phone is, like, a good thing. And, like, games and social networking is a good thing, because you can, like, escape. BLAIR: Danah Boyd says, for the most part, teenagers are doing online what they've always done. The difference now is that if that teenager isn't careful, the world can see it. For her book, she also talked to a lot of adults: parents, ministers, teachers. Once, an admissions officer from any Ivy League school contacted her about an essay they'd received from an African-American teenager from South Central Los Angeles. BOYD: And he wrote really beautifully about wanting to leave behind the gangs that were, you know, surrounded him growing up. BLAIR: The school loved the essay, says Boyd, but then they checked out his Myspace profile and found out it was full of references to gang activity. Boyd says the admissions officer asked her: Why would he lie to us? BOYD: And this question was, you know, sort of fascinating to me, because, you know, I didn't know this particular kid. But my guess, having spent a lot of time in that region of Los Angeles, is that he was working on survival. BLAIR: Boyd believes it's possible he needed to affiliate with a gang for his own safety. BOYD: And so what happened was Myspace became a place of performing those gang affiliations. Those Myspace profiles were never designed for the college admissions officer. And so here's this college admissions officer not understanding a context in which this teenager is operating. BLAIR: Context is everything, says Boyd. She believes teenagers' behavior online is often misinterpreted without it. Amanda Lenhart, a senior researcher and director of Teens in Technology at the Pew Research Center, agrees. Lenhart says Danah Boyd digs deeper. AMANDA LENHART: She goes out and she does the leg work, and she spends the time to talk with a bunch of these kids, and then kind of glean it and digest it and put it out there for the rest of us to use. BLAIR: Danah Boyd says she was going to call her new book \"Like Duh,\" because so many of the teenagers she interviewed think all of this is obvious. But instead, perhaps to help adults feel better, it's called \"It's Complicated: The Social Lives of Network Teens. \" Elizabeth Blair, NPR News.

I'm Michel Martin. We've spent a lot of time lately talking about the technology business and why more women and minorities aren't more present in those fields and how to get more diversity into those fields. But let's say you're already there. Let's say you're one of the people who already has the interest and the background and not only that, you're ready to do your own thing. Where do you go from there? We wanted to have a conversation with a diverse group of people who are in the business of helping a diverse group of people get their enterprises off the ground. Jewell Sparks is the CEO and founder of BiTHouse, that's a group that helps connect technologists of color with entrepreneurs and investors. Also with us is Brian Dixon.  He's an investment associate at Kapor Capital. That's a venture capitalist firm focused on companies that pursue social change. Also with us, Deldelp Medina,  she's with the Latino Startup Alliance.  That's a nonprofit group that connects Latino-led startups to support networks and funding. Welcome to you all. Thank you all so much for joining us. DELDELP MEDINA: Thank you. BRIAN DIXON: Thanks for having us. MARTIN: OK.  Everybody - so Jewell, let's start with you. Let's just - can we just briefly get your perspective on this whole question? 'Cause I know you've talked about this endlessly, but we do want to just set the table. We've talked a lot about underrepresented minorities. We're doing a whole series on women in tech through March. I just wanted to ask why you think there is still a lag here with these groups getting involved in tech, particularly when we know that there's a lot of entrepreneurial energy in those groups, at least before the recession started, you know, women and minorities actually had a higher rate, you know, of business development than some other groups. So why this lag in tech? JEWELL SPARKS: I think that there's a lag just because of lack of financial resources that are available. And so also, if you're an entrepreneur, there's a lot of risk taking that's involved, and so that's also a issue for minority entrepreneurs. MARTIN: Brian Dixon, your company actually focuses on investing in diverse tech founders. Why do you think there's a need for a group like yours, and your thoughts on just the broader question? DIXON: Absolutely. So there's a couple barriers. I mean, one, technical teams. So looking at founding teams, you have to have somebody technical on the team to really build out the product. At this point, at least in Silicon Valley, you really can't get funded by just an idea. You really have to have a minimal, viable product or a working product and some traction as well. And then, two, I think it's really understanding the ecosystem of how to get introductions. What is the right time to pitch your business? And then, who are the people to pitch it to? There's different stages of investment, and you want to make sure that your pitch is tailored to the investor as well. MARTIN: Deldelp, what about you? Thoughts on that? MEDINA: Well, I think that one of the issues we have is, to kind of piggyback on what the two of you said right before, is that lack of capital is an issue, but lack of capital is an issue because most of our communities have a lack of capital. We don't come from wealthy people so being able to ask your friends and family for help and support financially is not a viable thing. And so if you're going to take a risk by being entrepreneurial, you're going to take a risk in such a way that you can actually perform and start bringing in money. And so going back to looking at technical teams, the reality is that our pipeline, our folks that are actually trained to be able to build a minimal viable product, if they're going to have an opportunity, they're going to take it at a place where they have a steady salary, not a place where they're going - they're going to want to spend time and effort and money on something that might or might not happen. And so I think that those are some huge barriers that we try to address on a regular basis at Latino Startup Alliance, and that they're real for people. These are not just some sort of, like, airy fairy ideals. This is an actual everyday problem - money in the bank. MARTIN: Well, you were saying, in fact, you know, that there's this narrative in the tech world that if you're smart enough and you've got the great idea, you can drop out of college, you can work out of the basement until you somehow make that next big idea work, and then you're a multimillionaire. So you're saying that that storyline is just, you know, it's kind of a fantasy for a lot of people. But you're saying that particularly, for people from particular backgrounds, it really makes no sense at all. MEDINA: Yes, exactly. I mean, your ability to stop earning a salary, to take a risk on an idea is financially, sometimes, catastrophic for people. Let's just be clear about that. And those of us who have the ability to do that, it is emotionally difficult because it's - your family and your friends and your community kind of look at you and they are like, what are you doing? SPARKS: Exactly. MEDINA: . . . Why are you taking such a huge risk? DIXON: Yeah. MEDINA: Why don't you just get a job? What are you - what's your end goal here? And they don't really understand the possibility or the options that this can bring to your life and that it is an investment that you're making. And I like to think of this investment you're making on short-term in yourself in a way that you're not making for other people. And I think that, culturally, that's a lens that you have to take a look at and actually acknowledge exists as a barrier. MARTIN: It reminds me of an earlier generation when, you know, sometimes an earlier generation of minorities or women or people of color wanted to go to professional school, say to be a doctor or a lawyer. . . MEDINA: Yes. MARTIN: . . . And family members would say, why don't you get a good government job? Like, what's wrong with you? MEDINA: Yeah, or. . . MARTIN: . . . Or why don't you go to the factory? Or what's wrong, you know, what's wrong with you? MEDINA: Work at - be a secretary. That's what my grandfather used to tell my mother. Like, why aren't you a secretary? MARTIN: So, Brian Dixon, what's the business case for having more women and people of color leading tech startups? DIXON: Yeah. So we look at it as an advantage. I mean, at Kapor Capital, in our impacting portfolio, 46 percent are women or people of color. I mean, founders from diverse backgrounds bring a different perspective, a different lived experience. You know, they really see problems and opportunities that others don't so we think of it as an advantage. I'll give you an example. One of our founders from Dominican Republic, Edrezio, created a startup called Regalii. And he created it after sending money back home to his family. It uses SMS, and it really goes to paying the bills, to cable, to buying groceries, etc. And this was just out of his lived experience. He really saw a problem that, you know, no one else wanted to tackle in the that way he's tackling it, at a low cost solution because we really think, you know, it's about leveling the playing field. And diverse entrepreneurs see those opportunities. MARTIN: Jewell, what's your take on how - on these affinity groups that have started up?  That, you know, we've reported a number of people who participate in them. They're kind of focused. Very often, they're focused around people from particular backgrounds, like, there's - like Deldelp's group, that's the Latino Startup Alliance, and then there's an African-American group and I think there's probably an Indian-American group as well. What is your take on that? Do you think that that's productive or not? SPARKS: I think that those groups are very productive because if you're going to take a risk, like becoming an entrepreneur and starting your own company, you really need to have a support system. And as Del mentioned before, you sometimes don't get that from your family. So I think these groups are very important to provide that support. MARTIN: But is there a chance, though, that people are kind of replicating the kind of isolation that they're already experiencing? SPARKS: Yes, I mean, that is true that they're doing that. But at the same time, I think now the groups are getting to a point where they're realizing, you know, after they go through the sessions of I'm not in this position or I wasn't hired on this leadership team or there's not many minorities in technology - I think now we're getting to the point where some of the groups are focusing and telling people within their network, you know, focus on what you want to be and where you want to go and how you are going to get there. And I think when - since we're in that space now, I really think that we'll see a lot of production and productive activities and entrepreneurs that are coming out and being more successful as well. MARTIN: If you're just joining us, we're talking about building diversity in tech startups. Our guests are Jewell Sparks from BiTHouse, that's who was speaking just now, Brian Dixon from Kapor Capital and Deldelp Medina from the Latino Startup Alliance. You know, Brian, you know, there was a recent report on the Marketplace program that pointed out - public radio, of course - and it pointed out that it wasn't that long ago that Indian-Americans and immigrants were shut out of leadership in tech. And now, of course, Satya Nadella has been named Microsoft CEO, and Indian tech thinkers are a force in Silicon Valley. Is there a lesson that other underrepresented groups can draw from that experience? Or is there - or is that just a unique set of circumstances, for example, that these entrepreneurs are not just, you know, players in their own right but they're seen as connected to another larger international market? I mean, is that the secret sauce or is there something else? DIXON: Well, I'll start off with this. I mean, if you look at the - the degrees, right, computer science degrees, 9 percent were earned by African-American and Latino, right. So becoming more technical, looking at that achievement gap, those numbers really do have to rise. And that kind of leads to the next of kind of the access, right, of looking at the workforce it's about 7 percent Latino in tech and 6 percent in African-American in tech. So there is a lot of work to be done, but the problem will be solved, right. And it's going to be solved from everybody working together. You mentioned a lot of partners. You think about who's out in the field of, right, of Hidden Genius, Black Girls Code, Latino Startup Alliance and Black Founders. Those are all organizations that are really helping to provide that support that Jewell mentioned earlier and also that network. So I think, going back to the original question, I think it's becoming more technical, right. And really starting as you leave those larger companies, right, and go off to start your own companies, that's really going to make the huge shift that we're looking for. MARTIN: Jewell, what are your thoughts about that? SPARKS: I think that's true. I think the demand is definitely going to be there. So in the future, I don't think as minorities we can say, oh, there's not a lot of minorities that are in technology because the jobs are going to be there. And the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that there's going to be about 8 million jobs that exist in the future, and on top of that, there's just going to need people to fill those jobs. But I think educational resources need to improve as well as we need to just encourage students earlier to get involved and have an interest in STEM as well. MARTIN: Deldelp, what do you think? MEDINA: Well, just a reminder to all of us that the reason Indian-Americans are in the position they are is because they created an organization to make sure that they're in that position. Indus was, you know, pivotal in being able to say, we're not just code monkeys. We're not just the IT guy.  We're actual leaders. And we're going to help each other form associations to be able to create networks within ourselves so that we can be successful. And we at Latino Startup Alliance have taken a look at that model, and that's who we, you know, we aspire to be. It's, you know, it's not just - it isn't coincidence that, you know, Indian-Americans are in position as a power. They actually worked at it and worked at it smartly. One of the things that I do want to remind people is that in terms of Latinos, like, we are some of the fastest adopters of technology across the board. Pew Hispanic says that we - you know, we love mobile, we love all of these things, but we can't just be passive consumers. We actually have to be active creators. And I think, like, all our associations by creating networks, it isn't just amongst people of color or women, that we're associating ourselves. You know, there's a lot of people that come to our meetings. I've gone to Black Founders meetings. We associate with each other because we see the opportunities that are out there. So you know, what Brian's saying is, like, opportunity - opportunity's out there, but we need to be savvier, more educated and better networkers with each others' and others for us to elevate our voices and our products. MARTIN: Jewell, could you talk a little bit more about what we - about what Del was just talking about here, this - the question of what lessons perhaps can be learned from the Indian-American experience? I mean, is it - those networks, I mean, that whole networking thing is always tricky for, I think for minorities and also for women. I mean, when other groups kind of rely upon their networks, sometimes it's seen as valuable, but sometimes there's a backlash when people of color do it. I mean, I think that's some of the experience that President Obama's had. It's, like, oh, it's favoritism when you draw upon your network, but when other people do, then it's considered an asset. And I'm interested in how you navigate something like that. SPARKS: Well, I think, like I mentioned before, I think having these groups are very important just for, like, a basic support network. But then I think you need to go beyond those groups, and you need to be more inclusive of other groups and other networks that are more mainstream because, for example, if I want to be in technology and if I know that maybe I'm not going to be able to obtain financing, maybe as a minority entrepreneur, I would want to have a cofounder that I know won't have as difficult of a time accessing financing. And so I think we're kind of at a point and a stage where we should be kind of proud with who we are, be really focused on what we want to do and just really try to find solutions of how to get there versus focusing on why we aren't there. So I really think inclusiveness is very important. MARTIN: But. . . SPARKS: . . . You can't just stay with your one group and then expect everybody to come towards you without you also going towards them. MARTIN: Jewell, can I just ask you about this?  Can I  just push you on this point? I mean, this sounds of like a strategy from back in the day. I mean, I remember when John H. Johnson first went and was founding Ebony and Jet magazine. He made it clear that he had to have, he literally had to hire a white guy to go and get - and negotiate the building for him, and he pretended to be his building engineer. I mean, he literally put on some coveralls and pretended to be the building engineer inspecting the building for the building that he wanted to buy. Is that what you're saying? That you need kind of a front person or you need an outward face person? Is. . . SPARKS: I'm not saying. . . MARTIN: . . . Who's of a different background? Is that what you're saying? SPARKS: I'm not saying you need one, but I'm saying it can definitely can be useful. I've done that several times. There's a lot a people that I've done business with, and they really don't know who I look - or what I look like until, you know, once the paper's signed and maybe I'll go to meetings. But I have a diverse group of people that are on my team that, you know, they help in areas because like attracts like. So, you know, I'm definitely inclusive of people who are different. MARTIN: Brian, what do you say about that? DIXON: Yeah, I mean, I think about the teams that we fund, and it really comes down to we do want a diverse team. We also care a lot about, for teams that - what are they going to do in the future as far as hiring goes, right. And it also comes down to, you know, you think of it from the venture capital side of - VC's want to fund the best businesses, right. And for us, we also have the - we want to fund the best businesses but we want them to have a commitment to diversity, commitment to serving communities and really leveling the playing field. A lot of times, we do investments in education, and when we think about those teams, right, of, who are - we think about the students as well, right. And how do you get a product out to a school that also is kind of a free and reduced lunch school and also a private school, right? So we want a product, and we wanted a team that's thinking about both of those parties. We don't just want a product that only works in the private school, right. And I think that goes back to the team, right, of if you have a team where, if everybody went to private school, right, it might get left out, right. So those different backgrounds I think is a key to having a team that's going to tackle all these issues because I think it's easy to say that start-ups aren't easy, and there's going to be a lot of challenges along the way. So that's where - that's where I'm at. MARTIN: Del, let me give you a final word here, final word of wisdom. MEDINA: Well, a final word of wisdom. . . MARTIN: I'm asking for it. I'm not going to give you one, you're going to give me one. I don't have any for you. SPARKS: Give it to us. MEDINA: First of all, thank you because I feel like this is a much-needed conversation, and sometimes I feel like I live in this little bubble in Silicon Valley and people don't want to engage in a larger conversation. So thank you for doing this and doing this series of conversations. And the other thing is that this is not an easy lifestyle. It's not easy if you're a white guy and you went to MIT and were top of your class. It's not easy for anybody. It is easier in some ways, but it is not easy. And so if you can find people to support you, to help you along the way, it doesn't really matter what they look like, but having a sense of your cultural background and where you can go forward is what's important. MARTIN: All right. Deldelp Medina of the Latino Startup Alliance, Jewell Sparks of BiTHouse, Brian Dixon of Kapor Capital, thank you all so much for joining us. DIXON: Thank you. SPARKS: Thank you. MARTIN: And please tune in throughout March as we take a deeper look at the gender gap in the tech industry. We're talking to some of the women who are big players in tech. We'd like to get input from you if you are a leading lady in tech or an interested observer. Let us know what you're up to on Twitter. Use the hashtag, #NPRWIT. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  This is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. I'm Michel Martin. We've spent a lot of time lately talking about the technology business and why more women and minorities aren't more present in those fields and how to get more diversity into those fields. But let's say you're already there. Let's say you're one of the people who already has the interest and the background and not only that, you're ready to do your own thing. Where do you go from there? We wanted to have a conversation with a diverse group of people who are in the business of helping a diverse group of people get their enterprises off the ground. Jewell Sparks is the CEO and founder of BiTHouse, that's a group that helps connect technologists of color with entrepreneurs and investors. Also with us is Brian Dixon.  He's an investment associate at Kapor Capital. That's a venture capitalist firm focused on companies that pursue social change. Also with us, Deldelp Medina,  she's with the Latino Startup Alliance.  That's a nonprofit group that connects Latino-led startups to support networks and funding. Welcome to you all. Thank you all so much for joining us. DELDELP MEDINA: Thank you. BRIAN DIXON: Thanks for having us. MARTIN: OK.  Everybody - so Jewell, let's start with you. Let's just - can we just briefly get your perspective on this whole question? 'Cause I know you've talked about this endlessly, but we do want to just set the table. We've talked a lot about underrepresented minorities. We're doing a whole series on women in tech through March. I just wanted to ask why you think there is still a lag here with these groups getting involved in tech, particularly when we know that there's a lot of entrepreneurial energy in those groups, at least before the recession started, you know, women and minorities actually had a higher rate, you know, of business development than some other groups. So why this lag in tech? JEWELL SPARKS: I think that there's a lag just because of lack of financial resources that are available. And so also, if you're an entrepreneur, there's a lot of risk taking that's involved, and so that's also a issue for minority entrepreneurs. MARTIN: Brian Dixon, your company actually focuses on investing in diverse tech founders. Why do you think there's a need for a group like yours, and your thoughts on just the broader question? DIXON: Absolutely. So there's a couple barriers. I mean, one, technical teams. So looking at founding teams, you have to have somebody technical on the team to really build out the product. At this point, at least in Silicon Valley, you really can't get funded by just an idea. You really have to have a minimal, viable product or a working product and some traction as well. And then, two, I think it's really understanding the ecosystem of how to get introductions. What is the right time to pitch your business? And then, who are the people to pitch it to? There's different stages of investment, and you want to make sure that your pitch is tailored to the investor as well. MARTIN: Deldelp, what about you? Thoughts on that? MEDINA: Well, I think that one of the issues we have is, to kind of piggyback on what the two of you said right before, is that lack of capital is an issue, but lack of capital is an issue because most of our communities have a lack of capital. We don't come from wealthy people so being able to ask your friends and family for help and support financially is not a viable thing. And so if you're going to take a risk by being entrepreneurial, you're going to take a risk in such a way that you can actually perform and start bringing in money. And so going back to looking at technical teams, the reality is that our pipeline, our folks that are actually trained to be able to build a minimal viable product, if they're going to have an opportunity, they're going to take it at a place where they have a steady salary, not a place where they're going - they're going to want to spend time and effort and money on something that might or might not happen. And so I think that those are some huge barriers that we try to address on a regular basis at Latino Startup Alliance, and that they're real for people. These are not just some sort of, like, airy fairy ideals. This is an actual everyday problem - money in the bank. MARTIN: Well, you were saying, in fact, you know, that there's this narrative in the tech world that if you're smart enough and you've got the great idea, you can drop out of college, you can work out of the basement until you somehow make that next big idea work, and then you're a multimillionaire. So you're saying that that storyline is just, you know, it's kind of a fantasy for a lot of people. But you're saying that particularly, for people from particular backgrounds, it really makes no sense at all. MEDINA: Yes, exactly. I mean, your ability to stop earning a salary, to take a risk on an idea is financially, sometimes, catastrophic for people. Let's just be clear about that. And those of us who have the ability to do that, it is emotionally difficult because it's - your family and your friends and your community kind of look at you and they are like, what are you doing? SPARKS: Exactly. MEDINA: . . . Why are you taking such a huge risk? DIXON: Yeah. MEDINA: Why don't you just get a job? What are you - what's your end goal here? And they don't really understand the possibility or the options that this can bring to your life and that it is an investment that you're making. And I like to think of this investment you're making on short-term in yourself in a way that you're not making for other people. And I think that, culturally, that's a lens that you have to take a look at and actually acknowledge exists as a barrier. MARTIN: It reminds me of an earlier generation when, you know, sometimes an earlier generation of minorities or women or people of color wanted to go to professional school, say to be a doctor or a lawyer. . . MEDINA: Yes. MARTIN: . . . And family members would say, why don't you get a good government job? Like, what's wrong with you? MEDINA: Yeah, or. . . MARTIN: . . . Or why don't you go to the factory? Or what's wrong, you know, what's wrong with you? MEDINA: Work at - be a secretary. That's what my grandfather used to tell my mother. Like, why aren't you a secretary? MARTIN: So, Brian Dixon, what's the business case for having more women and people of color leading tech startups? DIXON: Yeah. So we look at it as an advantage. I mean, at Kapor Capital, in our impacting portfolio, 46 percent are women or people of color. I mean, founders from diverse backgrounds bring a different perspective, a different lived experience. You know, they really see problems and opportunities that others don't so we think of it as an advantage. I'll give you an example. One of our founders from Dominican Republic, Edrezio, created a startup called Regalii. And he created it after sending money back home to his family. It uses SMS, and it really goes to paying the bills, to cable, to buying groceries, etc. And this was just out of his lived experience. He really saw a problem that, you know, no one else wanted to tackle in the that way he's tackling it, at a low cost solution because we really think, you know, it's about leveling the playing field. And diverse entrepreneurs see those opportunities. MARTIN: Jewell, what's your take on how - on these affinity groups that have started up?  That, you know, we've reported a number of people who participate in them. They're kind of focused. Very often, they're focused around people from particular backgrounds, like, there's - like Deldelp's group, that's the Latino Startup Alliance, and then there's an African-American group and I think there's probably an Indian-American group as well. What is your take on that? Do you think that that's productive or not? SPARKS: I think that those groups are very productive because if you're going to take a risk, like becoming an entrepreneur and starting your own company, you really need to have a support system. And as Del mentioned before, you sometimes don't get that from your family. So I think these groups are very important to provide that support. MARTIN: But is there a chance, though, that people are kind of replicating the kind of isolation that they're already experiencing? SPARKS: Yes, I mean, that is true that they're doing that. But at the same time, I think now the groups are getting to a point where they're realizing, you know, after they go through the sessions of I'm not in this position or I wasn't hired on this leadership team or there's not many minorities in technology - I think now we're getting to the point where some of the groups are focusing and telling people within their network, you know, focus on what you want to be and where you want to go and how you are going to get there. And I think when - since we're in that space now, I really think that we'll see a lot of production and productive activities and entrepreneurs that are coming out and being more successful as well. MARTIN: If you're just joining us, we're talking about building diversity in tech startups. Our guests are Jewell Sparks from BiTHouse, that's who was speaking just now, Brian Dixon from Kapor Capital and Deldelp Medina from the Latino Startup Alliance.

That includes work done not only at home but anywhere outside one's regular office. The study also looks at who teleworks. As NPR's Jennifer Ludden reports, the finding may surprise you. JENNIFER LUDDEN, BYLINE: When I say remote worker, who do you picture? Maybe a harried mom in her bathrobe, a millennial at a coffee shop? Wrong, says workplace flexibility strategist Cali Williams Yost. CALI WILLIAMS YOST: A remote worker, someone who does most of their work outside of their employer's location, is not a woman, is not a parent and is not a Gen-Y millennial. LUDDEN: In fact, the study she commissioned finds three out of four remote workers are men of all ages, just as likely to have kids as not. Yost and others attribute part of this gender gap to the kind of work women are more likely to do, jobs that can't be done remotely; think teachers and nurses. Her study also finds women are much more likely to work in a cubby or open office space rather than a private office. YOST: And those cubicle, open-office-space workers were significantly more likely to say that they did not increase or improve their flexibility last year for fear of being perceived as not working hard and fear it will hurt their career. LUDDEN: To test this, I walk into a Starbucks near my home in Washington. There in the back is a middle-aged man with a grande and a laptop. MICHAEL GERSON: I do have an office, but I do most of my writing in coffee shops. LUDDEN: Michael Gerson is a columnist who writes for The Washington Post. But even when he was head of speechwriting with a nice office at the White House, he says he often worked at Starbucks. GERSON: When you're in the office, people are asking you to do things. When you're at the Starbucks, you're both with people but isolated, and can actually get things done. LUDDEN: So telework helps people escape the chaos of the office. But what about that modern quest to balance the conflicting chaos of work and family? JENNIFER GLASS: For most people, most of the time, telecommuting is simply a facilitator of longer work hours. LUDDEN: Jennifer Glass, of the University of Texas at Austin ,studied thousands of teleworkers over two decades. She found that for most, that remote work was overtime, above and beyond the at least 40 hours they'd put in at the office. GLASS: We tend to give people autonomy and control over their work hours as they ascend the career ladder and get in more and more upper-level positions of responsibility. The problem with that is that the work hours also increase. So all that flexibility is really just about where you're going to do your 80 hours of work per week. LUDDEN: Glass has also found that when workers ask for a flexible work schedule, managers are far more likely to say yes to men and no to women. All this helps explain a conundrum experts see. Remote work and flexible hours may be more popular and accepted than ever, but they still seem hardest to get for those who need them the most. Jennifer Ludden, NPR News. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  A new survey finds that nearly a third of full-time employees do most of their work remotely. That includes work done not only at home but anywhere outside one's regular office. The study also looks at who teleworks. As NPR's Jennifer Ludden reports, the finding may surprise you. JENNIFER LUDDEN, BYLINE: When I say remote worker, who do you picture? Maybe a harried mom in her bathrobe, a millennial at a coffee shop? Wrong, says workplace flexibility strategist Cali Williams Yost. CALI WILLIAMS YOST: A remote worker, someone who does most of their work outside of their employer's location, is not a woman, is not a parent and is not a Gen-Y millennial. LUDDEN: In fact, the study she commissioned finds three out of four remote workers are men of all ages, just as likely to have kids as not. Yost and others attribute part of this gender gap to the kind of work women are more likely to do, jobs that can't be done remotely; think teachers and nurses. Her study also finds women are much more likely to work in a cubby or open office space rather than a private office. YOST: And those cubicle, open-office-space workers were significantly more likely to say that they did not increase or improve their flexibility last year for fear of being perceived as not working hard and fear it will hurt their career. LUDDEN: To test this, I walk into a Starbucks near my home in Washington. There in the back is a middle-aged man with a grande and a laptop. MICHAEL GERSON: I do have an office, but I do most of my writing in coffee shops. LUDDEN: Michael Gerson is a columnist who writes for The Washington Post. But even when he was head of speechwriting with a nice office at the White House, he says he often worked at Starbucks. GERSON: When you're in the office, people are asking you to do things. When you're at the Starbucks, you're both with people but isolated, and can actually get things done. LUDDEN: So telework helps people escape the chaos of the office. But what about that modern quest to balance the conflicting chaos of work and family? JENNIFER GLASS: For most people, most of the time, telecommuting is simply a facilitator of longer work hours. LUDDEN: Jennifer Glass, of the University of Texas at Austin ,studied thousands of teleworkers over two decades.

In fact, the very first movies were shorts. This year, 15 short films have been nominated for Academy Awards. For a long time, actually seeing these films for most people was all but impossible. As NPR's Neda Ulaby reports, this is no longer the case. NEDA ULABY, BYLINE: If you, an ordinary non-Academy member, wanted to see an Oscar-nominated short a few years ago, you couldn't, not unless you lived in a city with an art-house theater that happened to be showing them. Now, if you want to see the Oscar-nominated shorts like \"Mr. Hublot,\" an animated gem about a steampunk Paris filled with mechanical Victorian gadgetry. . . (SOUNDBITE FROM FILM, \"MR. HUBLOT\")ULABY: . . . all you have to do is download them on iTunes or Amazon. Or you can watch them on video on demand. They are also playing in more than 400 theaters across the country. The Oscar nominated shorts have become an increasingly hot ticket. CARTER PILCHER: Since 2006 we've probably had over an 800 percent increase in box office. ULABY: That's Carter Pilcher, president of ShortsHD, a company dedicated to making shorts more accessible. PILCHER: Short films used to be kind of out there and nobody saw them. I would say the technology has caught up with the content. ULABY: Now we have YouTube. It's created an insatiable appetite for short, easily digestible chunks of content, ones we can watch on our mobile devices. And over the past 15 years, shorts have been redefined by Pixar. It's hard to remember now, but Pixar used to be mainly a hardware company teetering on bankruptcy. Its owner, one Steve Jobs, hired someone to show off what its animation technology could do. That someone, John Lasseter, thought, Why not shorts? He created one about a trembling little toy tormented by an oversized sadistic baby. (SOUNDBITE OF BABY)ULABY: Scientists and engineers gave that short, \"Tin Toy,\" a standing ovation in 1988 at a computer-graphics conference, says Pilcher. PILCHER: And because of that short, they were able to go on and make and get financial backing for big ones. ULABY: Namely \"Toy Story,\" directed by John Lasseter. Since 1998, every Pixar movie in theaters has been shown with little shorts. They're fun, they add buzz, and for years Pixar's shorts division was run by Osnat Shurer. OSNAT SHURER: We think of them a little like an hors d'oeuvre before the main course. ULABY: Or a digestif after. Now Shurer works for Walt Disney Animation Studios, where, as at so many other media companies, shorts have become a trendy way to try things out. SHURER: The stakes are a little lower, you have permission to take greater risks in shorts. ULABY: With technology, ideas, and people. At Disney's animation studios, Shurer says, everyone in the company gets to pitch ideas for shorts, from the president to the janitor. This year's Oscar-nominated short from Disney was originally proposed by a story artist. (SOUNDBITE FROM SHORT FILM, \"GET A HORSE\")ULABY: You've seen \"Get A Horse\" if you've seen the movie \"Frozen. \" It takes some of the oldest existing animated footage of Mickey Mouse, complete with voicing from Walt Disney, and throws just about every kind of new technology imaginable into the mix, says Osnat Shurer. SHURER: With \"Get A Horse,\" I had never seen anybody break barriers between 2-D CG and 3-D all within one shot. ULABY: Shorts are also a way for filmmakers to gather feedback, explore tertiary characters, and hype other projects. There's also something liberating about shorts that's not limited to animation. Nick Reed felt freed by the idea that his movie could be just as long as it needed to be. NICK REED: My feeling was that I wanted to make a film that, when you finished it, you went, I want more. ULABY: Reed produced the Oscar-nominated short documentary \"The Lady in Number 6: Music Saved My Life. \" It's about Alice Herz-Sommer, a Holocaust survivor who lived to be 110. She died this week. Sommer was a musician in the Theresienstadt concentration camp. ALICE HERZ-SOMMER: With music I was always happy.  I (unintelligible) without music - even thinking of music makes me happy. REED: As amazing as she is, my fear was if you make it a 90-minute or a two-hour film, you lose the power. ULABY: And because shorts don't need to fit into some sort of pre-determined format, it's being shown along with all the other shorts on the ShortsHD channel that reaches 30 million people worldwide. In the U. S. , it's on DirectTV and U-verse. Not surprisingly, the channel's popular in France, and Romania, where the company says it's one of the most watched movie channels in the country.

RATH: So Mardi Gras is coming up on Tuesday. And, well, let's start off.  Here's a little Mardi Gras music with a particularly Mardi Gras problem. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"AIN'T NO PLACE TO PEE\")UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: (Singing) Ain't no place to pee on Mardi Gras day, Mardi Gras day. Ain't no place to pee on Mardi Gras day. . . RATH: And you're hearing right. He's saying there ain't no place to pee on Mardi Gras day, which, it is a problem. It's a crowded place, not a lot of public bathrooms. But there's a technological fix in the works. WATSON: Indeed, there is. You know, more than a million people show up at Mardi Gras - more arrests, than anything, for public urination. And so, of course, two young millennials show up and say we've got an idea. It's called AirPnP. And, of course, it's a little bit of a play on Airbnb, the very successful business in which people rent out rooms in their homes to travelers. What they say is, look, a lot of people need a bathroom. There aren't a lot of facilities, porta-potties are fewer in supply, and so would you be willing to rent out access to your porcelain god? You know, turn Mardi Gras for a little penny. So they created an app, which just launched a week ago and is doing incredibly well. So how do you like that for a little New Orleans genius? RATH: So you go and you pay, I'm assuming, to use the facilities. And then do you rate it like a uber car or. . . WATSON: Without a doubt. All the good stuff's in there, and there's proper sharing economy. So you pay a buck or two or three, or if it's high demand, who knows what you could end up paying? And it's actually really interesting to think about how that could spread to other places where there are big festivals. You know, who knows? RATH: Now, I can see the demand for this, but it'd be hard for me to imagine wanting to open my bathroom to a Mardi Gras reveler. WATSON: Yeah. You know, so it. . . RATH: I might charge a premium for that. WATSON: You'd - yeah. It makes you wonder a little bit. And we could have all sorts of interesting interactions between people, right? And bathroom cleanliness is always an issue for any public facility. So we'll see how long this lasts. But certainly creative, huh? Little bold. Little interesting. RATH: Yeah. WATSON: Yeah. RATH: So another new technology - this one is still in the testing phase, though. The kids at MIT have come up with a different kind of electronic book. WATSON: No doubt about it. So a trio said that books are often about sparking emotion, stimulating all sorts of feelings. And so they said what if we helped that along a little bit? And, of course, they're at MIT, so it involves technology. And so they've basically added a book and a vest. And involved in the vest and the book are certain sensors and even kind of a little heart stimulator so that if the character in the book starts to feel sad, maybe you feel a little cold, a little sad. If the character is under stress, you know, all of a sudden, you know, the book may vibrate or the vest may vibrate. It's kind of the natural successor to what's going on with video games. RATH: Ha. And I can see that's just the sort of thing that I imagine the kids at the MIT labs working on. WATSON: Right. Yeah, of course, sensory fiction. But here's one of the things, Arun, I thought was very interesting: they've only created a prototype. They say they're not taking it commercial because more than anything - at the moment, at least - they say they want to spark debate about this question. It's certainly already - if you look at some of the comments that we got on our site - we certainly had people who said, well, that's dumb. Why, you know, the whole point of being an author is that you successfully stimulate emotion. Why do we want someone else to play with it? But certainly is a conversation even in surround sound movies and movies that have some kind of smell as part of it in certain parts of the world. People are toying with that.

I'm Scott Simon. Not everyone attending the Oscars tomorrow night will be on the red carpet. Hundreds of visual effects artists are planning to picket the Academy Awards for the second year in a row. NPR's Neda Ulaby says they're hoping to bring attention to what's been happening in their industry. NEDA ULABY, BYLINE: Let's start with a little context. The contemporary visual effects industry kicked off back in 1976 with \"Star Wars. \"(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ULABY: George Lucas's Industrial Light and Magic changed over the years. At first, it was mostly engineers creating special effects with cameras, high-speed motors and models. Now, it's generally about digital artistry. That means special effects do not have to be done in movie studios but anyplace in the world. Daniel Lay is a Hollywood visual effects artist who writes the blog FX Soldier. He drove over to NPR's L. A. studios to discuss the job layoffs and relocations wracking his industry. On his way, he passed someplace he used to work that offered one convenient example. DANIEL LAY: Sony Pictures Image Works, which is located in Culver City, right nearby where we're doing this, they readily had about 1,000 workers and now whittled down to less than 200. ULABY: And just this week, Lay says, many of those remaining workers, were given an ultimatum. LAY: To move to British Columbia or they will be fired. DAVID S. COHEN: Everybody's in a race to give a bigger subsidy to steal work from another place that has a smaller subsidy. And if you have no subsidy at all, it's very difficult to compete. ULABY: It all comes down to foreign tax incentives, says David S. Cohen. He covers the special effects beat for Variety. Cohen says California cannot compete with the lavish subsidies studios get from Canada, Australia, the U. K. and New Zealand. COHEN: Ten, 20, 30 possibly over 50 percent back on the labor costs for visual effects. ULABY: Cohen says that's driving Hollywood's own respected Oscar-winning special effects production houses out of business. Hundreds, even thousands of jobs are vanishing and going abroad. Now, labor isn't cheap in places like Canada or New Zealand, but the incentives are too good for studios to resist. This is corporate welfare, says David S. Cohen. COHEN: Why Warner Brothers needs the support of the taxpayers of New Zealand in order to make \"The Hobbit\" is beyond me. ULABY: Cohen says part of the problem is that digital effects artists lack unions or guilds. That's extremely rare in show business. Special effects is a major craft in Hollywood but it arose after the age of unionization. So, it's disorganized, lacks lobbying power and no one's counting how many jobs are being lost or what the long-term economic consequences might be. Meanwhile, the Motion Picture Association of America, which represents the studios, told NPR in a statement that digital artistry is a service that's not protected by trade agreements, so they can send their work anywhere they want. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ULABY: Digital effects artist Daniel Lay has worked on \"X-Men,\" \"Shrek Forever\" and \"Tron Legacy. \" Now, he's trying to start a trade association to protect digital effects artists in America. LAY: Without us, what do you see on the screen? ULABY: Lay says what he and his colleagues do is not like stamping out widgets in a factory. Their work is extremely technical and highly specialized. LAY: So, there are people painting skin textures, people who are animating lips, eyebrows, people who do explosions, people who do, you know, crumbling buildings. (SOUNDBITE EXPLOSION AND WRECKAGE)ULABY: \"Man of Steel,\" \"Iron Man,\" \"Gravity\" - most of Hollywood's biggest, most profitable movies are all about special effects. People buy tickets to see the effects, Lay says, just as much as the stars. Neda Ulaby, NPR News. SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. I'm Scott Simon.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ULABY: Digital effects artist Daniel Lay has worked on \"X-Men,\" \"Shrek Forever\" and \"Tron Legacy. \" Now, he's trying to start a trade association to protect digital effects artists in America. LAY: Without us, what do you see on the screen? ULABY: Lay says what he and his colleagues do is not like stamping out widgets in a factory. Their work is extremely technical and highly specialized. LAY: So, there are people painting skin textures, people who are animating lips, eyebrows, people who do explosions, people who do, you know, crumbling buildings. (SOUNDBITE EXPLOSION AND WRECKAGE) ULABY: \"Man of Steel,\" \"Iron Man,\" \"Gravity\" - most of Hollywood's biggest, most profitable movies are all about special effects. People buy tickets to see the effects, Lay says, just as much as the stars. Neda Ulaby, NPR News.", "section": "Business", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2014 NPR.  All rights reserved.

That data profile is then bought and sold, and the price is a lot lower than you might think. While your age, income, race, and other factors play a role, the cost of an individual profile is just a fraction of a penny. So what makes the data brokerage industry big business? Emily Steel is a correspondent for the Financial Times, and has spent a lot of time looking into how this works. Emily, welcome to the program. EMILY STEEL: Thank you. CORNISH: So, you've actually developed an online calculator that shows how much an individual's data might be worth. Explain how it works? STEEL: Yeah. So what we did is on the very basic level, most all of these companies know basic information about you, such as your age, your gender, and your location. So the price for that is very, very cheap. That sells for about . 0005 cents per person or about 50 cents per a thousand people. But you add in more specific details, like if you're influential in your social network, then that jumps up to . 00075 cents per person or 75 cents per a thousand people. CORNISH: So, Emily, let's try the calculator here. I'm going to check off a couple of boxes. Am I a millionaire? No. (LAUGHTER)CORNISH: Nonprofit, that's the business I'm in. It goes up to and 80th of cent. And then things get interesting when it says, like: Are you expecting a baby, no; are you a new parent, no. But I gather this health section is really important. STEEL: Yes, the health section is very important. As soon as you start checking off those items that say: do you have acid reflux or ADHD, depression, or cancer, then the price really jumps up. CORNISH: I'm going to check arthritis than high cholesterol. Oh, and I checked off obesity and it went up to 60 cents right away. STEEL: Right, I guess the lesson from that is that the more sensitive the data, the harder it is for these data brokers to get their hands on that information. And, at the same time, the demand from pharmaceutical companies, marketers, and others to use that information is at a very big high. CORNISH: I'm trying to get up over a dollar here. I feel like I would be a very unhealthy person. (LAUGHTER)STEEL: So, one of the things that really kind of changes the way that the state has valued is there's a couple of times in a person's life where they are making huge life decisions that are likely to influence purchases they make for years to come. One of those times is when you are engaged, and then another time is when you're having a baby. CORNISH: Now, ultimately the level of detail that these companies have about us, I mean it's really astounding. And you write of a Senate Commerce Committee investigation which found that a list of rape victims, their information, was worth quite a bit. STEEL: Yeah. So, the Senate Commerce Committee, led by Senator John Rockefeller, has conducted a series of investigations. And one of the topics that he is most concerned about is how data brokers are collecting information about people who are financially vulnerable, or have certain health conditions. So during one of the hearings, there was a woman who revealed that this one company, MEDbase, she had found that they were selling lists of rape victims for as little as seven cents a name. And that really shocked people because they thought, number one, why does a company need to sell that information? And number two, if they're selling it, there is probably a market for that data. And how in the world are companies using that information? And then number three, is that something that could really take advantage of people who are in a dire situation?

And you may fall into one of two camps here - love them or at least you understand why people can spend hours playing them, or hate them and you associate them with mindless violence, sexism and or just a waste of time. Well, if you're in the hate or don't-understand-them category, you might not be familiar with Minecraft. But it's one of the most popular games out there right now. It has more than 100 million registered users. (SOUNDBITE OF COMMERCIAL)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Let's go to a place where everything is made of blocks, where the only limit is your imagination. Let's go wherever you want to go, climb the tallest mountains, venture down to the darkest caves, build anything you want. MARTIN: Well, as you just heard, Minecraft is a game of strategy in which players build, create and go on adventures in the virtual world. A lot of people who play the game are children and teens. And while they are playing, our next guest says they might actually be absorbing some important lessons about technology and coding. Rey Junco is our guest. He's an associate professor of Library Science at Purdue University and a fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University. And he visits us from time to time to talk about technology and learning. And he's here with us in Washington, D. C. Welcome. REY JUNCO: Thanks, Michel. It's great to be here. MARTIN: Tell us a little bit more about Minecraft for people who've never seen it? JUNCO: OK, well, it's an interesting game. If you're familiar with typical videogames, the graphics aren't as pretty. They are pretty retro and lower grade. But the game is an open world environment where players can just build a world. There are two different modes. And one is creative that allows for just building and having, you know - having fun, you know, building a home or spaces or landscapes. And then there's a survival mode that's more like a typical game where users have to watch out for their health and their enemies that might attack them, and they have to eat and stay alive. And like many other games now, there are multiplayer modes. People can join a server and play with other people online. MARTIN: So you can play by yourself. You can play with other people. What's good about it, particularly speaking to people who generally feel that these kinds of experiences are a waste of time? JUNCO: Minecraft I think is a little different than other games because when I think about Minecraft, I don't just think of it as a videogame. I think of it as, perhaps, a videogame slash building toy. So not only are youth learning visuospatial reasoning skills and, you know, construction and being creative, but they're also learning things like being able to have some control over their environment and not being rule-based so they can explore. I like to talk about with our kids that we like to let them get bored so they can be more creative. And they can do that on Minecraft because there aren't the, you know, limits on their space or time that are out there in the real world. MARTIN: So you can say do whatever you want. I mean, it does - and it has some kind of connection to reality. But you're not actually coding? JUNCO: Well, actually, there is a coding element to Minecraft for those youth who do mods. So you can change the game around to your liking, and you can share those mods with other people. One of my colleagues just this past week said, it's the only way that I can get my young daughter interested in coding. And so here she is on Minecraft doing all of this coding. And I think in that sense, it's a really interesting equalizer. In my experience, there seems to be more of a gender balance in Minecraft players than other video games, certainly other games like Halo or Lego Star Wars or things like that. And so, in that sense, it can get women - young girls and then women interested in coding and then, perhaps, also in STEM fields. MARTIN: You know, one of the things we've talked to you about before is security online and the concern that many parents, caregivers, guardians, educators have about people, kids in particular, interacting with adults online who may be masquerading as kids, right? So is there any concern about that since, as we've noticed, that the game has evolved to the point where you could either be by yourself or you could play with other players? You can connect with other players. You don't know who they are. JUNCO: Sure. MARTIN: Any concern there? JUNCO: I think that it's important to not just talk with your kids about what they're doing online, but not make it a shameful activity, you know. Encourage them to talk about it. Set limits on it. You're the parent, so you need to set limits on your kids. And if you're upset that they're playing too much, then you need to do something about it. MARTIN: But can you keep people out of the game whose behavior disturbs you? For example, somebody who seems to just show up wherever you are or follow you around the game. . . JUNCO: Yeah. MARTIN: . . . Even if you find their attention and participation unwelcome? JUNCO: Yeah. There are moderators on servers that can help protect that. MARTIN: I'm interested in something you just said, which is that that's why it's important not to shame people. . . JUNCO: That's right. MARTIN: . . . In participating in these kinds of experiences. JUNCO: Right. MARTIN: Could you talk a little bit more about that? JUNCO: Sure. I think if children feel like they're doing an activity that is bad or shameful, they're going to be less likely to talk with their parents about it. So if we don't create an environment where they're feeling that way about it, then they're more likely to share it with us. MARTIN: If you're just joining us, we're talking about what you can learn from a game like Minecraft. It's not your, perhaps, typical videogame or at least it's not the kind of game that many people think it is. I'm speaking with Rey Junco, and we're talking about the fact that maybe there are some things that you can learn from Minecraft that are actually useful and not just fun. And you're saying that Minecraft is a little different from other video games. . . JUNCO: Sure. MARTIN: . . . And that is because why? Because hurting somebody's not the object or. . . JUNCO: Right. MARTIN: . . . Following people, blowing things up is not the object? You can blow things up if you want. JUNCO: You can. MARTIN: You can. JUNCO: Yeah, TNT seems to be, you know, like an interesting thing. Like, you know, kids are like, oh, you can get TNT in this mode, or, you know, you can get TNT in the computer version. But that's not the object of the game. The object of the game is seeing how to build things and how cool your building or objects are. As a matter of fact, there are YouTube videos. Stampy Longnose is one of the real famous ones where he will post videos of him creating things. And those videos are really popular with game players. And so it used to be that - you and I grew up, you know, watching cartoons before and after school. Now kids get home and they say, hey, you know, can I watch YouTube? Can I watch Stampy? And so, in addition to playing. . . MARTIN: And he gives them ideas. They're ideas thatJUNCO: Absolutely. MARTIN: . . . You can do things that you might not have thought that you could do. And then you can do it. JUNCO: Right. And it sets an expectation for the game culture, too that, oh, look, we're building things. That's what the game is about. It's not about tearing down. It's about these neat things that we could do. MARTIN: And you share. JUNCO: Yeah. MARTIN: You share knowledge. JUNCO: Right, you collaborate. MARTIN: . . . Which I think a lot of people think is an important value. Well, finally, Rey, screen time. How much screen time? It's this ongoing preoccupation. . . JUNCO: Yeah. MARTIN: . . . Of parents, caregivers and educators everywhere. JUNCO: Yeah, yeah. MARTIN: How would you - how would you want us to think about this issue given that what you're telling us is that not all screen time is the same? JUNCO: Well, I think about screen time in this way - the younger the child, the less time they should be in front of the screen, right. So. . . MARTIN: Period. JUNCO: Period, right. I mean, I would think before, at least, you know, the age of 2 or 3, a child should never be around a screen. And then I think it depends on the child, and it depends on the activity. Screen time is still screen time. So when they're doing Minecraft, which I think is a fantastic game for these informal learning objectives that we've discussed, it's still screen time. And so I think it's important for kids to be connected with others. But then if you look at teenagers, right, they're spending screen time on connecting with their friends. And so it's important for them to do that. They've just spent a whole day at school and, perhaps, extracurricular activities, you know, doing things that other people are telling them to do, and now they want to socialize. And they do that online. So I think it really depends on the child's age, and it depends on your child. And it depends on your goals for raising your child. MARTIN: Rey Junco is an associate professor of Library Science at Purdue University and a fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society. And we caught up with him in Washington, D. C.

So I'm sure you've been asked this question before like, a hundred times, but I have to ask you this question 'cause the first time I saw your TED talk, I'm thinking - I'm thinking of Steve Austin. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW \"THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN\")UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: He's alive. He lost an arm, two legs and one eye, but he's alive. RAZ: I'm thinking, gentlemen, we can rebuild him. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW \"THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN\")SPEAKER: We have the capability to make the world's first bionic man. RAZ: Do you remember what they said about him? I mean, they said Steve Austin will be that man, better than he was before. KUIKEN: Well, you know, I loved that show as a kid. And I think it's inspiring, and Lord knows we would love to get there. RAZ: I mean, we are kind of at this sort of bionic human place. KUIKEN: Yes, we have, I believe, crossed a big hurdle by developing a way for a person to control their prosthetic limb that's not just, you know, goofy movements, unintuitive things. We've developed a system where a person thinks about what they want to do and it happens. RAZ: A system where someone with an artificial hand or arm just thinks about moving it and it happens. And Todd isn't actually focused on the robotic arm or hand alone, but his big idea is to literally rewire the human body, to make those arms and hands work better. KUIKEN: Instead of just making a machine for the human, we've changed the human to be able to use the machine better. RAZ: Well, what really amazed me was this - I'm moving my - like, when I want to close my hand or bend my elbow, it's just intuitive, right. Like, we don't - we're not thinking about that. You just do it, but these patients are literally thinking in their brains bend elbow, move hand, and that happens. How does that happen? KUIKEN: Well, think of the brain as where thoughts start, right? That's where you first decide you want to move your hand. And even though you're not thinking about it, you send signals down your neck, and you make the nerve fire. It has little electrical signals that hops down your nerve all the way to the end of the nerve, where little chemicals go across to the muscle and make the muscle have a little electrical spark that hops down the muscle fibers telling them to contract. RAZ: And then your hand just closes, like, without even thinking about it. KUIKEN: Yes. But what happens when you lose your arm above the elbow? RAZ: Right, you don't have those muscles to move your hand anymore. KUIKEN: That's right. You've lost not only the muscles and bones, but the controller. RAZ: OK, so here's where the rewiring comes in, right, because you've lost those critical muscles that control your arm and your hand, but the nerve endings, they're still there. KUIKEN: I could tap the end of a nerve of a World War II amputee and they'd still feel their missing hand. So they're alive and they work. They're like the data cables. RAZ: So the nerve endings and the nerve signals are still there, right, but without those muscles, it's really hard to figure out what those nerve signals are actually saying. KUIKEN: The signals are really, really, really tiny, and you have to listen to it a single nerve fiber at a time. Can't we plug them in someplace better? RAZ: A place that might be able to amplify those nerve signals, and then rewire those nerves to other muscles. Todd explains how this can be done on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)KUIKEN: We're using a biological amplifier to amplify these nerve signals - muscles. Muscles will amplify the nerve signals about 1,000 fold so that we can record them from on top of the skin. So our approach is something we call targeted reinnervation. Imagine with somebody who's lost their whole arm, we still have four major nerves that go down your arm. And we take the nerve away from your chest muscle, and let these nerves grow into it. Now you think close hand, and a little section of your chest contracts. You think bend elbow, a different section contracts. And we can use electrodes or antennas to pick that up and tell the arm to move. That's the idea. RAZ: That's just unbelievable. I mean, you can go into the body and basically say, like, we're going to attach this nerve to that nerve and that nerve to this muscle. It's like you're tricking the brain into, like, thinking a hand is there. KUIKEN: Well, you know, frankly, I'm an engineer and they wouldn't let me rewire people. It's really sad. So my colleague Greg Dumanian at Northwestern is a talented surgeon, and he goes in there and finds the right nerves and the ends of them, and then we redirect them to where we have spare muscle. I guess the analogy I use is that the nerve is a wire, and we've lost the phone at one end, and so we just take the wire and hook it up to a different phone so that we can talk. RAZ: And that's exactly how it works. A computerized, prosthetic arm can pick up the nerve signals and then tell the prosthetic hand to open or close. So, for example, Todd did this with a patient of his, Amanda Kitts, who also joined him on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)KUIKEN: So, Amanda, would you please tell us how you lost your arm. AMANDA KITTS: Sure. In 2006, I had a car accident. And I was driving home from work, and a truck was coming the opposite direction, came over into my lane, ran over the top of my car and his axle tore my arm off. After that, I woke up in the ICU. I didn't know what had happened, and when I realized, you know, that I'd lost my arm, you know, it was completely torn up - I couldn't stop crying for days. KUIKEN: With Amanda, she lost her arm a couple inches above the elbow. So she had a nice, long, residual limb, if you will. RAZ: And that is the place where Todd's team rewired Amanda's nerves. KUIKEN: And we can take the biceps, which has two parts, leave one alone to do the bicep's control of an elbow, but take the other one and put a hand closing nerve into it. And when that nerve grows in, you think close your hand. You aren't thinking bend you're biceps or contract your biceps. You're thinking close my hand, but we've rerouted the nerve, the wire to a different amplifier. KITTS: And then that's when it was like magic after that. I could just open my hand and the hand would open. I didn't have to use any funny movements to work the arm. So it became like, you know, a natural part of me. RAZ: And Todd, he was delighted, but he wanted to take it just a step further. So he started to think more about the nerve. KUIKEN: The nerve actually controls each of your fingers, your thumb, your wrist. Now my colleagues have developed computer decoding algorithms that are a lot like voice recognition. And so we listen to the signals from the muscle, and these computer programs decode it so that we can tell whether you want to close your hand, bend your wrist, turn your wrist or even what type of hand-grasp pattern you want to make. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)KITTS: So I have the elbow that goes up and down. I have the wrist rotation that goes. . . (LAUGHTER)KITTS: . . . And it can go all the way around. And I have the wrist flexion and extension. RAZ: At this moment when everybody laughs, she's just turned her entire wrist 360 degrees. KUIKEN: Yeah, well, that's quite a bar trick for you because you give somebody something they can do and they will use it. So sometimes that's functional 'cause you can flip it into a position that isn't even humanoid. RAZ: And the thing about rewiring those nerves is that when you do that, it means that prosthetic hands are actually getting a lot closer than ever before to a real human hand because the nerves, they can still feel and touch. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)KUIKEN: I want you to watch closely. CLAUDIA MITCHELL: Oh. KUIKEN: That's Claudia and that was the first time she got to feel sensation through a prosthetic. She had a little sensor at the end of her prosthesis that then she rubbed over different services, and she could feel different textures of sand paper, different grits, ribbon cable, as it pushed on her reinnervated hand skin. She said that when she just ran it across the table, it felt like her finger was rocking. It was one of those scientific surprises. In those nerves to your hand, actually two thirds of them are for sensation. Only one third are for controlling muscles. So there's thousands and thousands of nerves that are trying to grow out into something, and most of them are sensation. And they grew into any little sensory end organ they could. RAZ: So earlier in the show, we spoke to Neil Harbisson who calls himself a cyborg, right. I mean, his antenna is literally screwed into the bone of his skull. And I wonder if that's sort of the direction we're headed with sort of bionic technology. I mean, could you imagine half-human half-machines who can function normally despite having been born with disabilities or limitations? KUIKEN: Well, I certainly imagine and we're progressing to having machines help people with disabilities and on even more and more intimate ways. As far as half-human half-machine, I take challenge to that because the essence of human is in our minds and what we think and what we do. And I don't see that ever being replaced. I hope we have things to augment, but I don't ever feel my humanity is going to be integrated with any form of machine. RAZ: I was thinking about this idea of like, energy that travels through our body. And that energy travels from person to person. Like, when I hold my son's hand, you know, there's that feeling of holding a kid's hand, you know. And I wonder if you could ever replicate that in a prosthetic hand? KUIKEN: Wow, that's a tough - that's an exciting one. And the question is how much do you get from having it being your own hand? So let me put it this way - something is always better than nothing. So you're holding your son's hand with a very rich, sensory-normal hand, and you get all of these delicate feelings. But for a man with no hands, no arms, if we put a sensor in the prosthesis so that as he touches that child's hand, and it's nothing more than a little squeeze that he feels, but yet it's his squeeze, and it's his kid's hand. So perhaps the fidelity of the feeling is not near as important as the identity of the feeling, and the fact that it's my hand that is touching something, and gosh, that's my kid. RAZ: Todd Kuiken runs the Center for Bionic Medicine at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago. You can watch his amazing, full talk at TED. NPR. org.

What is the future of the human race? Are we alone in the universe? GUY RAZ, HOST: So this is a voice you probably know - physicist Stephen Hawking, of course. But the weird thing about this voice is that it's not just his voice. This is the exact same computerized voice that's used by thousands of people around the world who cannot speak on their own. And we know this at Stephen Hawking because, well, he's Stephen Hawking. RUPAL PATEL: But there's little girls and older women and lots of other people who are using that voice, even though he thinks of that as being his voice, right. And so do the other people who are using those voices. They think about them as being their voice. RAZ: This is Rupal Patel. PATEL: I'm a speech scientist and a professor at Northeastern University. RAZ: And Rupal has figured out a way to create new voices, customized voices for people who use synthetic speech, people whose actual voices, for whatever reason - autism or cerebral palsy or stroke - can't speak. And the story of how it all came about - Rupal explains from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)PATEL: This lack of individuation of the synthetic voice really hit home when I was at an assistive technology conference a few years ago. And I recall seeing a little girl and a grown man having a conversation using their devices. UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER #1: Nice to meet youUNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER #2: Nice to meet you, tooPATEL: Different devices. SPEAKER #1: How long have you been coming to this conference? PATEL: But the same voice. SPEAKER #2: This is my first year. PATEL: I looked around, and I saw this happening all around me. UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER #3: I've never been there. UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER #4: Where is the registration table? UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER #5: What time should we meet back at the hotel? PATEL: Voices that didn't fit their bodies or their personalities. UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER #6: Where are you staying? UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER #7: How long are you in town? UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER #8: Our flight was late coming in from Detroit. PATEL: We wouldn't dream of fitting a little girl with a prosthetic limb of a grown man. So why then the same prosthetic voice? It really struck me, and I wanted to do something about this. I'm going to play you now a sample of two people, actually, who have severe speech disorder. They're saying the same utterance. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Unintelligible). UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Unintelligible). PATEL: You probably didn't understand what they said, but I hope that you heard their unique vocal identities. I wanted to find out how we could harness these residual vocal abilities and build a technology that could be customized for them, voices that could be customized for them. So we decided to do exactly that. RAZ: With a girl named Samantha. Samantha has a very rare speech disorder, which makes it impossible for her to speak. But she can make sounds, vowel-like sounds, which turned out to be enough of a sample for Rupal and her team of researchers. (SOUNDBITE OF RECORDING)SAMANTHA: Ah. PATEL: That sound is just what Samantha can produce. That's her ah. And from that, we can gather the pitch of her voice. (SOUNDBITE OF RECORDING)SAMANTHA: Ah. PATEL: The quality of her voice, meaning things like is it raspy, is it breathy. RAZ: So you are hearing all of these things. I mean, she can't create words or sentences, but she can make some basic sounds. PATEL: Right. And we take what we can from those vocalizations and use them in the process for - we generate a voice for her that sounds like her. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)PATEL: So how do you go about building this voice? Well, you have to find someone who's willing to be a surrogate. For Samantha, her surrogate came from somewhere in the Midwest - a stranger who gave her the gift of voice. Being a surrogate donor only requires you to say a few hundred to a few thousand utterances. The process goes something like this. UNIDENTIFIED SURROGATE: Things happen in pairs. I love to sleep. The sky is blue without clouds. PATEL: Now she's going to go on like this for about three to four hours. The idea is to cover all the different combinations of the sounds that occur in the language. From this voice bank, we can now say any new utterance like, I love chocolate - everyone needs to be able to say that - fish through that database and find all the segments necessary to say that utterance. WOMAN: I love chocolate. PATEL: What happens next is best described by my daughter's analogy. She's 6. She calls it mixing colors to paint voices. It's exactly that. Samantha's voice is like a concentrated sample of red food dye, which we can infuse into the recordings of her surrogate to get a pink voice. SAMANTHA: Ah. PATEL: So now Samantha can say this. . . SAMANTHA: This voice sounds like the real me. I helped make my new voice. I can't wait to use my new voice with my friends. RAZ: That's incredible. PATEL: I'm so glad you think that's incredible because, you know, as a scientist, though - I mean, there's been so many versions of that process. And even if they're not perfect, even if they have crackliness to the voice, even if they're not absolutely perfect in terms of speech quality, they're made with a little bit of them. And that is such a powerful thing. So for Samantha, when she heard her voice, there's this smile that spread across her face when she heard it for the first time. What I love about that is it's not her jumping up and down and saying, you know, yeah, this is my voice. It's this sort of slow realization that this is who I am. RAZ: Speech scientist Rupal Patel. In a moment, we'll hear more about her research and another young girl who just got a brand-new non-Stephen Hawking-like voice. I'm Guy Raz. Stay with us. You're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. (MUSIC)RAZ: It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, extrasensory - technology and behavior that can actually stretch our senses. And we were just talking with speech scientist Rupal Patel who designs devices for people who can't speak because she wants them to sound more like humans, like themselves rather than robots. PATEL: Many times, people who have these communication devices don't use their devices that often. And that's, you know, that's terrible because it kind of closes the world for them. I hope that this technology opens their door for them. SHANNON WARD: My name is Shannon. RAZ: And how old are you? S. WARD: I'm 13 years old. RAZ: This is Shannon Ward, and she was born with cerebral palsy. And a few months ago, Rupal essentially gave Shannon her own voice, and she built it on the vowel-like sounds that Shannon is able to make. S. WARD: Yes. I think everyone deserves to be heard. RAZ: So, Shannon, like, the voice you had before the one you have now, did you like it? S. WARD: Not so much. RAZ: So tell me about your new voice. S. WARD: Totally love it. RAZ: Does it feel like it's you? S. WARD: That's a big fat yes. JANINE WARD: To hear it, I was just stunned because I can hear my daughter, especially in certain words. RAZ: This is Shannon's mom, Janine. J. WARD: And when she says mom, in particular, I hear her. And that is a wonderful thing for any parent to experience. RAZ: Does she seem like it's changed her? J. WARD: Absolutely. It just increased her confidence, it increased her desire to want to use her device. I know, personally, that she loves to talk with her friends more. She stands out, and I think people take her differently when they hear a voice that sounds like a 13-year-old girl as opposed to a voice that sounds like a robot of an adult. RAZ: OK, you have a 13-year-old daughter. She is now a teenager. If she's talking more, is she arguing more with you? J. WARD: Absolutely. I know it might sound so bizarre, but there are times I'm like, can we unplug the device for a little bit because I have a kid that does not stop. RAZ: So back to Rupal Patel, the speech scientist who started all of this - she's trying to get people all over the world to become voice donors to help people like Shannon. PATEL: Yeah, and I think the beautiful thing about this is that as someone grows, what we'd like to see is that many people who use augmentative communication devices, these communication aids, use the same voice for much of their life. But you and I don't have the same voice today as we had a decade ago and a decade before that, certainly. It's layers and layers of experiences and changes in our body that change our voice. That should be afforded to these individuals as well. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)PATEL: What I want to share with you next is how I envision taking this work to that next level. I imagine a whole world of surrogate donors from all walks of life, different sizes, different ages coming together in this voice drive to give people voices that are as colorful as their personalities. About five years ago, we built our very first voice for a little boy named William. When his mom first heard this voice, she said this is what William would have sounded like had he been able to speak. And then I saw William typing a message on his device. I wondered what was he thinking? Imagine carrying around someone else's voice for nine years and finally finding your own voice. Imagine that. This is what Williams said. Never heard me before. Thank you. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: Rupal Patel is a speech scientist at Northeastern University. She and her collaborator Tim Bunnell started a project where almost anyone can donate their voice to people like Shannon and Samantha. And you can do it, too. If you want to help out, go to Vocalid. org and give them some of your voice. And of course, you can watch Rupal's full talk at TED. com. STEPHEN HAWKING: Where did we come from? What is the future of the human race? Are we alone in the universe? GUY RAZ, HOST:  So this is a voice you probably know - physicist Stephen Hawking, of course. But the weird thing about this voice is that it's not just his voice. This is the exact same computerized voice that's used by thousands of people around the world who cannot speak on their own. And we know this at Stephen Hawking because, well, he's Stephen Hawking. RUPAL PATEL: But there's little girls and older women and lots of other people who are using that voice, even though he thinks of that as being his voice, right. And so do the other people who are using those voices. They think about them as being their voice. RAZ: This is Rupal Patel. PATEL: I'm a speech scientist and a professor at Northeastern University. RAZ: And Rupal has figured out a way to create new voices, customized voices for people who use synthetic speech, people whose actual voices, for whatever reason - autism or cerebral palsy or stroke - can't speak. And the story of how it all came about - Rupal explains from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) PATEL: This lack of individuation of the synthetic voice really hit home when I was at an assistive technology conference a few years ago. And I recall seeing a little girl and a grown man having a conversation using their devices. UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER #1: Nice to meet you UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER #2: Nice to meet you, too PATEL: Different devices. SPEAKER #1: How long have you been coming to this conference? PATEL: But the same voice. SPEAKER #2: This is my first year. PATEL: I looked around, and I saw this happening all around me. UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER #3: I've never been there. UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER #4: Where is the registration table? UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER #5: What time should we meet back at the hotel? PATEL: Voices that didn't fit their bodies or their personalities. UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER #6: Where are you staying? UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER #7: How long are you in town? UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER #8: Our flight was late coming in from Detroit. PATEL: We wouldn't dream of fitting a little girl with a prosthetic limb of a grown man. So why then the same prosthetic voice? It really struck me, and I wanted to do something about this. I'm going to play you now a sample of two people, actually, who have severe speech disorder. They're saying the same utterance. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Unintelligible). UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Unintelligible). PATEL: You probably didn't understand what they said, but I hope that you heard their unique vocal identities. I wanted to find out how we could harness these residual vocal abilities and build a technology that could be customized for them, voices that could be customized for them. So we decided to do exactly that. RAZ: With a girl named Samantha. Samantha has a very rare speech disorder, which makes it impossible for her to speak. But she can make sounds, vowel-like sounds, which turned out to be enough of a sample for Rupal and her team of researchers. (SOUNDBITE OF RECORDING) SAMANTHA: Ah. PATEL: That sound is just what Samantha can produce. That's her ah. And from that, we can gather the pitch of her voice. (SOUNDBITE OF RECORDING) SAMANTHA: Ah. PATEL: The quality of her voice, meaning things like is it raspy, is it breathy. RAZ: So you are hearing all of these things. I mean, she can't create words or sentences, but she can make some basic sounds. PATEL: Right. And we take what we can from those vocalizations and use them in the process for - we generate a voice for her that sounds like her. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) PATEL: So how do you go about building this voice? Well, you have to find someone who's willing to be a surrogate. For Samantha, her surrogate came from somewhere in the Midwest - a stranger who gave her the gift of voice. Being a surrogate donor only requires you to say a few hundred to a few thousand utterances. The process goes something like this. UNIDENTIFIED SURROGATE: Things happen in pairs. I love to sleep. The sky is blue without clouds. PATEL: Now she's going to go on like this for about three to four hours. The idea is to cover all the different combinations of the sounds that occur in the language. From this voice bank, we can now say any new utterance like, I love chocolate - everyone needs to be able to say that - fish through that database and find all the segments necessary to say that utterance. WOMAN: I love chocolate. PATEL: What happens next is best described by my daughter's analogy. She's 6. She calls it mixing colors to paint voices. It's exactly that. Samantha's voice is like a concentrated sample of red food dye, which we can infuse into the recordings of her surrogate to get a pink voice. SAMANTHA: Ah. PATEL: So now Samantha can say this. . . SAMANTHA: This voice sounds like the real me. I helped make my new voice. I can't wait to use my new voice with my friends. RAZ: That's incredible. PATEL: I'm so glad you think that's incredible because, you know, as a scientist, though - I mean, there's been so many versions of that process. And even if they're not perfect, even if they have crackliness to the voice, even if they're not absolutely perfect in terms of speech quality, they're made with a little bit of them. And that is such a powerful thing. So for Samantha, when she heard her voice, there's this smile that spread across her face when she heard it for the first time. What I love about that is it's not her jumping up and down and saying, you know, yeah, this is my voice. It's this sort of slow realization that this is who I am. RAZ: Speech scientist Rupal Patel. In a moment, we'll hear more about her research and another young girl who just got a brand-new non-Stephen Hawking-like voice. I'm Guy Raz. Stay with us. You're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. (MUSIC) RAZ: It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, extrasensory - technology and behavior that can actually stretch our senses. And we were just talking with speech scientist Rupal Patel who designs devices for people who can't speak because she wants them to sound more like humans, like themselves rather than robots. PATEL: Many times, people who have these communication devices don't use their devices that often. And that's, you know, that's terrible because it kind of closes the world for them. I hope that this technology opens their door for them. SHANNON WARD: My name is Shannon. RAZ: And how old are you? S. WARD: I'm 13 years old. RAZ: This is Shannon Ward, and she was born with cerebral palsy. And a few months ago, Rupal essentially gave Shannon her own voice, and she built it on the vowel-like sounds that Shannon is able to make. S. WARD: Yes. I think everyone deserves to be heard. RAZ: So, Shannon, like, the voice you had before the one you have now, did you like it? S. WARD: Not so much. RAZ: So tell me about your new voice. S. WARD: Totally love it. RAZ: Does it feel like it's you? S. WARD: That's a big fat yes. JANINE WARD: To hear it, I was just stunned because I can hear my daughter, especially in certain words. RAZ: This is Shannon's mom, Janine. J. WARD: And when she says mom, in particular, I hear her. And that is a wonderful thing for any parent to experience. RAZ: Does she seem like it's changed her? J. WARD: Absolutely. It just increased her confidence, it increased her desire to want to use her device. I know, personally, that she loves to talk with her friends more. She stands out, and I think people take her differently when they hear a voice that sounds like a 13-year-old girl as opposed to a voice that sounds like a robot of an adult. RAZ: OK, you have a 13-year-old daughter. She is now a teenager. If she's talking more, is she arguing more with you? J. WARD: Absolutely. I know it might sound so bizarre, but there are times I'm like, can we unplug the device for a little bit because I have a kid that does not stop. RAZ: So back to Rupal Patel, the speech scientist who started all of this - she's trying to get people all over the world to become voice donors to help people like Shannon. PATEL: Yeah, and I think the beautiful thing about this is that as someone grows, what we'd like to see is that many people who use augmentative communication devices, these communication aids, use the same voice for much of their life. But you and I don't have the same voice today as we had a decade ago and a decade before that, certainly. It's layers and layers of experiences and changes in our body that change our voice. That should be afforded to these individuals as well. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) PATEL: What I want to share with you next is how I envision taking this work to that next level. I imagine a whole world of surrogate donors from all walks of life, different sizes, different ages coming together in this voice drive to give people voices that are as colorful as their personalities. About five years ago, we built our very first voice for a little boy named William. When his mom first heard this voice, she said this is what William would have sounded like had he been able to speak. And then I saw William typing a message on his device. I wondered what was he thinking? Imagine carrying around someone else's voice for nine years and finally finding your own voice. Imagine that. This is what Williams said. Never heard me before. Thank you. (APPLAUSE) RAZ: Rupal Patel is a speech scientist at Northeastern University. She and her collaborator Tim Bunnell started a project where almost anyone can donate their voice to people like Shannon and Samantha. And you can do it, too. If you want to help out, go to Vocalid. org and give them some of your voice.

CARLOS WATSON: Arun, always good to be with you. RATH: So I was very surprised to read that South Korea, a country I just tend to think of as very tech-friendly, it's actually a terrible place to start up a tech company. But that may be changing, right? WATSON: Indeed, it is. South Korea has always been ahead of the game, as you were saying, technology-wise. They were the first country to go 100 percent broadband. All sorts of interesting electronics companies have come out of there, including Samsung. But they haven't had much of an entrepreneurial culture. One entrepreneur said to us: Starting a company is for people who can't find a decent job. (LAUGHTER)WATSON: But led by new president Park Geun-hye, she's ushering in something she calls the creative economy and is encouraging entrepreneurship with a $4 billion government investment fund, in effect. RATH: Are Park's ideas catching on? Are they boring up to this idea? WATSON: You know, increasingly, they are. It's been an interesting dance. You know, you see companies like the education technology company KnowRe, that now has been able to not just raise money from a place like the Silicon Valley, but actually raise domestic venture capital there in South Korea, there in Seoul. You've seen a couple thousand startups get going in the last few years; some of that, again, fueled by the money she set aside but some of that set up by some of the confidence that Koreans have seen as their culture's become popular abroad. So whether it's been music - referred to as K-Pop - or increasing success with Korean fashion abroad, all of those things have made more and more young Koreans confident that their ideas can play on a global stage. RATH: Interesting. Now, for a story a little bit closer to home - especially close to us at NPR West, here in Southern California - there's a strange phenomenon going on at Disneyland. WATSON: Something very, very cool has happened, which is, you know, there have been Disney fans for years. But now, they've started to gather on a regular, coordinated basis wearing similar clothes at the parks. Some people would somewhat sniffly describe them as the gangs of Disneyland. But they think of themselves as clubs. You'll see several hundred people, sometimes even several thousand over the course of a week, get together and kind of celebrate their love of Disney. RATH: And these clubs or gangs, they have names that play on specific attractions, right? They have different interests. WATSON: They do. And sometimes they're on the attraction; sometimes, they are on a certain street; sometimes, they're on a certain section within Disneyland. So Walt's Misfits are - one of the names. Jungle Cruisers are yet another; the Neverlanders. RATH: So do they have gang signs or, you know, are there gang initiations like horrible things a fairy has to do to gain her wings, or anything like that? (LAUGHTER)RATH: I just want to keep running with this. I've got about 10 more jokes. WATSON: Absolutely not, although there have been numerous rumors to that effect, as they become more and more popular. No. Instead, what you tend to see, you see a lot of vests with insignia on the back. And increasingly, what's interesting is, it's almost become almost a little bit of a fraternity and sorority, where they will do public service with and for each other. So talk about the rise of geekdom - there's a very LA and Disney-friendly version of it. RATH: Nice. Carlos Watson is the co-founder of the online magazine Ozy.

And now, it's also part of this Oculus Rift. So what are we talking about? SYDELL: All right, yeah. Oculus Rift is a set of goggles. It kind of looks like ski goggles. But what the Oculus Rift can do is make you feel - you don them, and you actually feel as if you are in a completely different world. So you turn your head, and you see the same world. And I got a chance to try the Oculus Rift because they set up a \"Game of Thrones\" display here. And what happens is, you get into this box, and it makes it seem like you are going up the winch elevator at Black Castle and that you reach the top, and look out over the mountains.

He offered up a proposal to connect just about every computer on Earth. That was the seed of the World Wide Web back in 1989. When he shared his idea, a lot of people didn't bother to read the memo.

But I was allowed to do it on the side in between two other big projects. SHAHANI: He was at CERN, the world's biggest particle physics lab in Switzerland where scientists work on smashing atoms. BERNERS-LEE: I was sitting in an office in building 31. SHAHANI: Berners-Lee had a nice view and some very fancy computers. His job officially was to figure out how to get them to talk to each other better. But he wanted to go one step further and create a universal language, a set of rules and system of addresses for all computers to talk across servers. And on March 12, 1989, he sent a memo off to peers and mentors. A year later, a lot of them asked, what ever happened to that project? He had to remind them. BERNERS-LEE: I did give you - send you a memo. Oh, really? Oh, are you sure you sent it to me? Oh, well, send it to me again. So when I sent it around again, I dated it March, 1989, May, 1990 just to rub it in.

He's looking for support for a long-planned high fidelity music player and online store called Pono. Young told an audience at the South by Southwest music festival that he wants to make digital music sound better. Here's NPR's Laura Sydell. LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE: Young was plain-spoken as he explained what motivated him to develop a new digital music player. He says he's watched the world turn digital, and a lot of stuff has gotten better. NEIL YOUNG: Everything, you know, cameras, you know, got easier to use. Everything went up. Everything went up, and music went down. SYDELL: Young says mp3 files and the similar ones you get on iTunes actually hurt his ears. MP3 is a format that compresses audio to make it move faster over the Internet and take up less room on your computer. But the compression process takes away a lot of subtle highs and lows in the music. Young says his player and the music to be sold on the Pono store will let fans hear the music the way the artist intended. YOUNG: What we decided to do was to come out with a new system that was not a format, had no rules, respected the art, respected what the artist was trying to do and did everything that it could to give you what the artist gave. SYDELL: Young says Pono will let you listen to music in whatever format the artist picks. He says the quality will be anywhere from five to 25 times better than mp3s. The Pono player will play those files and just about any other format.  It's shaped like a bar of Toblerone chocolate and Young says you can hook it up to a stereo system. It will cost about $400. Nevertheless, within hours of launching the Kickstarter campaign, it exceeded its $800,000 goal. There were fellow musicians in the audience who were excited by what Young was saying. Todd Fink is with The Giving Tree Band. TODD FINK: We record at a very high resolution so I think it would be really neat for the people who listen to our music, you know, to be able to hear the things that we're actually doing in the studios. SYDELL: All over South by Southwest, there was respect for Young from musicians. But, some analysts, like Gartner's Mike McGuire, think Young might be coming a little late to the music player game. MIKE MCGUIRE: A lot of consumers are opting for the convenience of streaming. So people there are kind of showing their preference for being able to carry it around and access it from any device. SYDELL: But even proponents of streaming music would like to see better audio quality. D. A. Wallach is the musician-in-residence for the streaming music service Spotify. Wallach wants his little sister to be able to hear, oh, for example, Pink Floyd's \"Dark Side of the Moon\" in something other than mp3. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WELCOME TO THE MACHINE\")D. A. WALLACH: She doesn't even know what the experience is like of imagining the music in sort of three dimensions in between the speakers and that's always part of what I've found so magical about music is actually how visual it can be when the conditions are right for listening. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WELCOME TO THE MACHINE\")SYDELL: As more people get faster Internet connections, Wallach is hopeful that streaming music services will deliver higher fidelity audio. But, he says he's rooting for Young because he hopes the effort will raise awareness and build demand for better audio. In fact, Neil Young made it clear that it would be fine with him if that's all he achieved. YOUNG: If we fail, we've made enough noise so people know something's wrong and they can hear it. If some big, huge company comes along and kicks our ass with millions and millions of dollars, that's great for music, that's what matters. If they'll do what we do, it's a no lose situation, we win. Everybody wins. (APPLAUSE)SYDELL: But Young still wants you to buy his player. Laura Sydell, NPR News, Austin. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  The musician Neil Young launched a Kickstarter campaign yesterday.

I'm Robert Siegel. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: And I'm Melissa Block. The retail giant Target is still reeling from a massive breach of its payment systems during last year's holiday shopping season. Hackers stole 40 million credit and debit card numbers, and tens of millions of other pieces of personal information - addresses, phone numbers and more. The company faces more than 90 lawsuits and has already spent tens of millions of dollars dealing with the fallout from the breach. And now, a Bloomberg Businessweek story, out today, contends that Target itself could have prevented the attack. Mike Riley is co-author of that story, and he joins me here in our studios. Welcome to the program. MIKE RILEY: Thanks very much. BLOCK: And let's go back and explain. You found out that six months prior to the attack, Target had installed a very sophisticated malware detection system called FireEye, which actually worked exactly as it was intended to work. Tell us a bit about the system and what happened with it. RILEY: Yeah. Security systems are changing, and this is one of the sort of cutting-edge, really, sort of behavior-based ones. The interesting thing about it, it was initially funded by the CIA. What it does is, it essentially sets up a series of virtual computers. Anything that's coming in Target's network, in terms of data, goes through these virtual computers, which are - configure exactly like Target's own computers. So essentially, what does is, it tricks the hackers into believing that they are in Target's networks. It also has this nice trick where it can advance the clock of a computer. So when malware comes into a network, it can actually see what happens to the malware - over a period of days, weeks or even years - in a split second. Once that starts to happen, it sends out an alert that says hey, there's a piece of hacking malware in your system; you should go fix it. BLOCK: And that's what happened here. This detection system did exactly that - right? - told Target, something bad is going on here. RILEY: That's right. That part of the function worked. So on Nov. 30th - and keep in mind, this is before any of the data leaves Target's network - the alerts begin to go off. And for some reason that's not clear, Target didn't act on it in time. BLOCK: So these malware detection alerts are coming in Nov. 30th, Dec. 2nd. Target says they weren't alerted about the breach until Dec. 12th, by federal authorities. They don't tell consumers until Dec. 19th. Why the delay? RILEY: That's right. Well, whatever was going on inside Target's security team, they didn't recognize this as a serious breach. There was no serious investigation that went on. They didn't go to the server itself to figure out what the malware was doing. What they've said publicly is that they didn't know anything about the hack until the U. S. attorney and the Secret Service knocked on their door on Dec. 12th and said, you've got a problem. And it takes them about three days to figure out that all this malware is not just on that one server but on every single - or many, many POS systems through the entire store network in the United States. BLOCK: You write in your story, Mike, Target stood by as 40 million credit card numbers gushed out of its mainframes. You asked them for a response to your story. What did they tell you? RILEY: You know, the response was pretty minimal. They pointed out that they are doing a complete review of the security systems that they have in place, and that they are trying to figure out how to improve those systems. At this point, it's really - the lawyers have sort of taken control of what their response can or should be. BLOCK: It does seem that - I mean, if Target was aware of a massive breach like this, with these huge implications for them, they would have done something about it. I mean, they would have acted if they had known the seriousness of the problem. RILEY: Yeah, no, I think that's exactly right. I don't think they knew exactly what was going on. It's one thing to sort of get an alert from a system that says you may have malware on your server. It's entirely different thing to know that 40 million credit cards are leaving your network. It's not that they sat by while they watched 40 million credit cards go out. No responsible company is going to do that. But they had all the pieces of the puzzle. If they'd simply put them together, they could have stopped this. BLOCK: We've been focusing on the hack itself. But let's talk also about the hackers. . . RILEY: Sure. BLOCK: . . . because you do a lot of reporting on who they are. Your research led to Ukraine and Russia, to cybergangs notorious for their successes in just these kinds of breaches. Who are these people, and why can't the U. S. go after them? RILEY: It's a very boisterous, very well-oiled machine. And there are literally, millions and millions of credit cards that are stolen around the world every day. They have a very good system for distributing, selling, repackaging. One of the ways that it works is once the credit cards are stolen, they get posted on quarter websites. These are websites that really look like Amazon. com. They'll run anywhere from 8- to $50, depending on the quality of the cards, things like the credit limit. And then you'll pop them into an electronic basket, just like Amazon, and check out. It's a fascinating world to look in. It's just fascinating to see how efficient this is. On some level, these guys have found the perfect crime. You can sit and hack a major Fortune 500 company from your couch in Ukraine. You can steal data that has value. You can sell that value on an automated website. You can make money from it. And you're really not at much risk. BLOCK: Mike Riley, reporter for Bloomberg Businessweek, thanks for coming in. RILEY: You're welcome.

She was born without fingers on one hand. And now, thanks to 3D printing technology, she has an affordable prosthetic. As Dan Carsen of member station WBHM reports, her story is one example of life-altering changes on the horizon. DAN CARSEN, BYLINE: Kate Berkholtz is a smiley, active two-year-old who's happy to have a new tool that helps her pick things up. Right now, she's trying very hard to hold still before a gymnastics class. Can you tell me your name? KATE BERKHOLTZ: Kate. CARSEN: Do you like to run around and play here? BERKHOLTZ: Yeah. CARSEN: OK, go. Those fast feet hit at hurdles for people who need or manufacture pediatric prosthetics. Kids are hard to keep still for fittings. They reject things. They lose things. Most consistently, they grow. And prosthetics made in traditional ways are expensive, says tech entrepreneur Jason Hundley. JASON HUNDLEY: The barrier to entry is, you know, the cost for the normal industry - you're talking something that's in the five-figure range - talking like the price of a car. That's crazy, especially, you know, when it's going to not be useful in six months to a year. CARSEN: Enter 3-D printing. (SOUNDBITE OF PRINTING MACHINE)CARSEN: This is the microwave oven-sized printer that made Kate's plastic hand. Since key patents expired several years ago, printers like it are much cheaper. Basic models are a few hundred dollars. Small businesses, researchers and regular people have them. That and expertise from Hundley's firm are why Kate has a working, affordable prosthetic. Here's Kate's mom, Jessica Berkholtz. JESSICA BERKHOLTZ: This is huge for our family and for other families because it's not a commitment. It's not, you know, fighting with an insurance company or spending thousands of dollars on a prosthesis that your kid might not want or use. She loses one and it's not that big a deal. It's $5, and so I can call over to Jason and he can print us a new one for five bucks. CARSEN: Jason Hundley's firm, Zero Point Frontiers, took on the project for free with the goal of sharing the design. Intern Shawn Betts did much of the work with help from company engineers and an online design archive called Thingiverse. Now that Betts has refined several prototypes, he says making a hand for Kate is easy. SHAWN BETTS: A day or two to print one out and assemble it. You've got to print out all the parts and then just pop some pins in place and run some wires through it. But it's a very simple process. CARSEN: Kate bends her wrist to pull those wires and plastic fingers grasp. The ease of 3-D printing means low-cost, low-risk and high adaptability. The plans can be scaled up as children grow or customized to fit unique limbs or even unique situations. Hundley plans to make a paddle when Kate learns to swim. But that's not all. HUNDLEY: We've talked about modularizing it. You know, for lack of better term, like a Swiss Army knife. We're talking maybe just make a locked hand so she could ride a bike. And you could do that with the 3-D printing because my cost of printing those - the plastic on that is like sixty cents. Print it, see if it works. If it doesn't work, interchange it. CARSEN: That's doable because there's no packaging, no shipping, no factory, and no paying engineers to find the cheapest way to make, say, 10,000 units to recoup all those costs. Again, Jason Hundley. HUNDLEY: When you can get a fully automated, robotic, neuro-controlled prosthetic for $5, that'll be fun. CARSEN: How far away is that? HUNDLEY: Probably about 10 years. CARSEN: Researchers have already connected sensors to nerves so people can feel through prosthetics. And some are gearing up to print organs. But right now, a simple plastic printed hand is making a little girl and her parents happy as she picks things up in ways she couldn't before. For NPR News, I'm Dan Carsen. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:  Next, we're going to meet a little girl in Huntsville, Alabama. She was born without fingers on one hand. And now, thanks to 3D printing technology, she has an affordable prosthetic. As Dan Carsen of member station WBHM reports, her story is one example of life-altering changes on the horizon. DAN CARSEN, BYLINE: Kate Berkholtz is a smiley, active two-year-old who's happy to have a new tool that helps her pick things up. Right now, she's trying very hard to hold still before a gymnastics class. Can you tell me your name? KATE BERKHOLTZ: Kate. CARSEN: Do you like to run around and play here? BERKHOLTZ: Yeah. CARSEN: OK, go. Those fast feet hit at hurdles for people who need or manufacture pediatric prosthetics. Kids are hard to keep still for fittings. They reject things. They lose things. Most consistently, they grow. And prosthetics made in traditional ways are expensive, says tech entrepreneur Jason Hundley. JASON HUNDLEY: The barrier to entry is, you know, the cost for the normal industry - you're talking something that's in the five-figure range - talking like the price of a car. That's crazy, especially, you know, when it's going to not be useful in six months to a year. CARSEN: Enter 3-D printing.

(SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO, \"KIDS GUIDE TO THE INTERNET\")MONTAGNE: Ha-ha, David. That's from an instructional video called \"Kids Guide To The Internet\" from the mid-1990s. Today, find a kid needing a guide to the Internet. From birth, it seems, it's now an integral part of our lives, and to explore how the Web has evolved over these 25 years, we reached Kevin Kelly. He's one of the founders of Wired magazine. Good morning. KEVIN KELLY: Good morning. MONTAGNE: Take us back to 1989. What did you think of the Web? KELLY: I have to say, my very first exposure to the Web and seeing the first Web pages was, oh, that's good. I have to say there was not a revelation saying, oh my gosh, the world will never be the same. It just seemed a kind of a natural step. But within the next year or so as the speed and acceleration of people bringing stuff on, when I saw how fast that was happening, that's when we realized, oh my gosh, this is going to change everything. MONTAGNE: So I'm kind of wondering what the very early uses were for the Web. KELLY: Well, it was geeky. And, you know, in the very beginning, nobody knew whether this was permanent. It seemed to almost be kind of more archive-ish, where people had a bunch of documents that they wanted to share with the world and oftentimes there's a tendency to want to go there and kind of copy them. We had to be educated to the idea that it was like a library, this was our memory, and that we could kind of go back to that site anytime and it'll still be there. MONTAGNE: Do you remember something that was thought that it would happen that just never did or never took off? KELLY: There was lots of surprises and we got lots of things wrong about what we thought the Web would become. In the very beginning, we actually know from some surveys that were done about what people expected the Web to do or what they were going to use it for. They listed a kind of a list of very noble things and they kind of, you know, started off very high-minded and descended down. So they were going to use it for educational purposes, for research, going to be electronic voting, there would be, you know, health information, and it would go all the way down. And at the very bottom would be kind of games and gossip and video. Well, 20 years later or 25 years later, that list is completely inverted. And the second thing that we got wrong in a big way, including Wired magazine, where I was editing, was we all kind of expected this to be like television, but better, like TV 2. 0. And we were imagining five million channels of specialty information that was all going to be kind of produced by experts and TV channels and Time Warner and AOL and all the big media companies, and maybe lots of small media companies who were producing the Saltwater Aquarium Channel and et cetera. And we missed all the stuff that was going to be produced by the audience, by the users, by a gazillion small time people producing YouTube videos or blogs or twittering, that the entire content of it would be made by the pro-sumer, by the person who was producing it and watching it at the same time. That was the big thing that we missed in our expectations. MONTAGNE: That is such a big idea. It's actually, in a way, not surprising that it wasn't predicted. But you yourself, back in the mid '80s, you were involved with a community called The Well. Tell us a little bit about The Well. KELLY: The Well started off with what they called at that time an online bulletin board, which meant that you dialed in a specific number and you were typing text and every week you could read other people's text and you could send email to someone else who was on that service. So all the services in the early '80s were the AOL and the Prodigy and the CompuServe were little closed gardens. And The Well allowed the users great freedom to start their own topics, to write whatever they wanted to write and had a lot of interesting people, and so it become sort of an online salon or virtual community very, very quickly because we kind of, again, let the users direct everything. And from that experience very early I saw that this was, one thing, a sharing economy. People were just going overboard to help each other in a way that we hadn't seen in a long time. And the second thing is, is that almost immediately the virtual citizens demanded to meet face to face. We did monthly Well meetings. This was technology that wasn't kind of like industrial or steam engine-like and mechanical and alien. This was more organic. This was more human-like. This was more like an Amish barn raising, and that was a big thing for us in shifting our idea of what technology could be itself. MONTAGNE: Although I wonder what you think now of people's massive use of social networks, where it does seem like the face to face is not often in the equation. KELLY: Yes. Right now I think it's a little bit of a phase, like an adolescent phase. I think young people tend to do things with obsessions and I think we're kind of - the Internet was in its teenage adolescent phase and we became obsessed with some of this and I think as this generation gets older, I think they'll be less obsessed with this and they'll even out and round out and have actually more face to face interaction than they are right now. MONTAGNE: Well, that's interesting. Probably be encouraging to a lot of people, the idea that living our lives in a virtual reality is just a moment or that few years in time. KELLY: Yeah. So we're still very early in this. We, you know, okay, we're celebrating the 25th year of the Web. Right now, in the history of the world, nothing has happened on the Internet yet. I mean, we're at the beginning of the beginning. Twenty years from now we'll look back and we'll say, oh, nothing had happened by 2014. It all happened afterwards. And so the changes that we have seen in the last 25 years are going to pale compared to what's going to happen in the next 25 years. MONTAGNE: Kevin Kelly is senior maverick at Wired magazine, which he co-founded. He joined us to talk about the 25th anniversary of the World Wide Web. Thank you for joining us.

I'm Robert Siegel. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: And I'm Melissa Block. It's now been a week since Malaysian Airlines flight 370 vanished on its way to Beijing. The search for the missing aircraft now stretches from the original search zone in the Gulf of Thailand to the Andaman Sea, hundreds of miles to the west. Adding to the mystery comes news that the plane appears to have been in contact with a satellite for several hours after it vanished. And joining me to discuss these developments is NPR science correspondent Geoff Brumfiel. Geoff, tell us more about this satellite transmission. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: Well, basically this Boeing 777 aircraft is equipped with a satcom antenna, and so, a satellite orbiting way above the Earth was in contact with it. Every hour, the satellite would send a little signal going, are you still there? And the plane would send a signal back saying, yep, I'm here. Now, as far as we can tell, that's the only data that was being transmitted. But it may be possible that the company that owns the satellite, Inmarsat, might be able to use that signal to sort of get a sense of where the plane was, where it was moving and what it was doing, basically. The signal went on for at least five and a half hours after the plane vanished off radar scope, so it really is a mystery what's going on. BLOCK: Well, why wasn't the plane transmitting more data? BRUMFIEL: You know, this satcom link could have transmitted more data, and one reason it may not have is that Malaysian Airlines may have not paid to have the data sent. Inmarsat told me that it could cost as little as $2 an hour to send really basic flight data but it's not clear the airline was paying for any sort of service like that. The other theory, though, that's coming to light here is that somebody may have intentionally shut off the systems designed to transmit data. BLOCK: And what's behind that theory? BRUMFIEL: Well, it has to do with the way this airplane disappeared. Airplanes have transponders that tell air traffic control where they are. And at 1:30 in the morning, about an hour after the plane took off, those transponders went dark. A little while later, Malaysian military radars saw what they thought was a plane heading the other way to the west. And so that's led people to speculate that maybe somebody tried to make this plane vanish. BLOCK: And if you wanted to do that, to make a plane vanish, how easy is that to do? BRUMFIEL: On a 777 like this, it's really not very easy to do at all. Airplanes have communications that's both voice and text, kind of like your cellphone. And, I mean, those communications are pretty hardwired into the systems of a modern aircraft. I spoke to four commercial aviation pilots, two 777 pilots, and they said they had no idea how to turn these systems off. They said you would have to go through big checklists. You would have to possibly pull the circuit breakers if you want to deactivate them. So to make this happen would really require some degree of premeditation and a lot of knowledge of the aircraft. BLOCK: Is there anything in all these scenarios, as you talk to people, that lines up? Or are people really stumped by what they're seeing with this plane? BRUMFIEL: I think if you've been following the media coverage all week, you know that there really isn't a single theory emerging about what happened to this aircraft. And frankly, one of the really troubling things is the facts just don't line up. I mean, any one theory just doesn't really, you know, it's not borne out by what all the facts give us.

To talk about that, I'm joined by Brian Weeden, who studies space systems and security. He's technical advisor for the nonprofit Secure World Foundation. Brian, welcome to the program. BRIAN WEEDEN: Glad to be here. BLOCK: Let's talk first about the Malaysian Airlines jet in flight. If we assume that it kept flying for hours after it disappeared from radar, would satellite images possibly show that plane in flight? WEEDEN: There is a theoretical possibility but it is so remote that the satellites probably would not be of any real use in detecting the airplane while it's flying. It would have to be a very fortuitous set of circumstances where the satellite was just happening to take an image of an area while the plane is flying through that area, and you are able to find the plane amongst all the other clutter and cloud and everything else going on with the image. Many of these satellites are in low earth orbit. They're orbiting a few hundred kilometers up, and they don't stay over any one part of the Earth for very long. BLOCK: Do you know of any cases where satellites have captured an image of a plane crashing or exploding? WEEDEN: So there have been instances where there's been reports of satellites that are designed to detect infrared heat that have detected massive airplane explosions. And these satellites are primarily used to detect ballistic missile launches around the world. And in the case of TWA flight 800, that was reportedly detected by these satellites. So if it was a large explosion that generate a lot of heat, then there are some satellites that are going to pick that up. But in this case, officials from the U. S. government have said that those satellites have not detected anything that looked like an explosion anywhere near the projected flight path of this aircraft. BLOCK: If we assume that the plane crashed, either on land or on water, how helpful do you think satellites might be in finding wreckage? WEEDEN: So if the plane crashed on the water, then satellites in that scenario could be useful. In that case, they're looking for debris on the surface of the water. Radar satellites that are coming over and imaging sections of the water may be able to find debris, and optical satellites that are taking visible pictures, again, may be able to find debris. The challenge there is going to be picking out what might be debris from clouds and all the other potential things that could show up in the image as something that looks like debris but isn't. BLOCK: Yeah. And, of course, we had that confusing story the other day of the image from a Chinese satellite that was thought to be debris. And then that was debunked. WEEDEN: Absolutely. And that shows you the difficulty of doing this. It's something that kind of looks like debris, but you're taking this image from hundreds of miles away and it's just a couple of little pixels that happen to be colored a certain way. And so it's very, very hard to tell and you're always going to need someone on the ground to go by that location and try and follow up on it. BLOCK: You know, there clearly would be sensitivities about national security, right? And I wonder how that might impede the sharing of satellite images or of revealing just how much they've been able to pick up through these satellites. WEEDEN: We've already seen in the case of this Malaysian military radar that reportedly may have tracked the aircraft at some point, but the Malaysian government has been extremely reluctant to provide details on what that radar may have seen or even what its capabilities are. And I think that's symbolic of a bigger challenge that probably many governments are having. There's a lot of governments and a lot of militaries out there that have some extremely specialized capabilities for collecting intelligence and different types of information. And so there's going to be a lot of discussions about which of those technologies and capabilities may be able to help in this situation and, conversely, what the risks may be of revealing those capabilities if they happen to find something connected to this flight. BLOCK: I've been talking with Brian Weeden. He studies space systems and security. He's a technical advisor for the nonprofit Secure World Foundation. Brian, thanks very much. WEEDEN: You're welcome. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:  We wondered if satellite imagery might show something about the missing plane, either in flight or after. To talk about that, I'm joined by Brian Weeden, who studies space systems and security. He's technical advisor for the nonprofit Secure World Foundation. Brian, welcome to the program. BRIAN WEEDEN: Glad to be here. BLOCK: Let's talk first about the Malaysian Airlines jet in flight. If we assume that it kept flying for hours after it disappeared from radar, would satellite images possibly show that plane in flight? WEEDEN: There is a theoretical possibility but it is so remote that the satellites probably would not be of any real use in detecting the airplane while it's flying. It would have to be a very fortuitous set of circumstances where the satellite was just happening to take an image of an area while the plane is flying through that area, and you are able to find the plane amongst all the other clutter and cloud and everything else going on with the image. Many of these satellites are in low earth orbit. They're orbiting a few hundred kilometers up, and they don't stay over any one part of the Earth for very long. BLOCK: Do you know of any cases where satellites have captured an image of a plane crashing or exploding? WEEDEN: So there have been instances where there's been reports of satellites that are designed to detect infrared heat that have detected massive airplane explosions. And these satellites are primarily used to detect ballistic missile launches around the world. And in the case of TWA flight 800, that was reportedly detected by these satellites. So if it was a large explosion that generate a lot of heat, then there are some satellites that are going to pick that up. But in this case, officials from the U. S. government have said that those satellites have not detected anything that looked like an explosion anywhere near the projected flight path of this aircraft. BLOCK: If we assume that the plane crashed, either on land or on water, how helpful do you think satellites might be in finding wreckage? WEEDEN: So if the plane crashed on the water, then satellites in that scenario could be useful. In that case, they're looking for debris on the surface of the water. Radar satellites that are coming over and imaging sections of the water may be able to find debris, and optical satellites that are taking visible pictures, again, may be able to find debris. The challenge there is going to be picking out what might be debris from clouds and all the other potential things that could show up in the image as something that looks like debris but isn't.

I'm David Greene. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: And I'm Renee Montagne. In its standoff with Ukraine, Russia has imposed its will but it's tried to hide its hand. Russian troops moved into Crimea but in uniforms bearing no Russian insignia. And there are other tools Russia's is believed to have used that leave virtually no trace: cyber operations. They're part of the modern arsenal. Now U. S. officials want to know if the use of cyber weapons could lead to cyber war. Here's NPR national security editor Bruce Auster. BRUCE AUSTER, BYLINE: Like some conventional military weapons, cyber ops have names - evocative names. What's being used in Ukraine is no exception. There's Snake. That's a malware tool. It hides on a computer network and steals information. And Snake goes by a bunch of names: there's Ouroboros, Greek for a serpent in mythology. It's also called Agent BTZ, a label with no mythological meaning whatsoever. No matter what it's called, it's important enough that American officials won't talk about it publicly. VICE ADMIRAL MICHAEL ROGERS: In terms of specifics I would respectfully ask that this that is perhaps best shared in a classified setting. AUSTER: That's Vice Admiral Michael Rogers. He was testifying to Congress this week because he's been picked to lead the U. S. Cyber Command. And while he wouldn't get into specifics, he left no doubt that conflict today means computers - not just troops and tanks. ROGERS: Clearly, cyber will be an element of almost any crisis we're going to see in the future. AUSTER: And in Ukraine, the term cyber covers a multitude of sins. There are reports that Ukrainian politicians had their phones blocked. And that Russian troops cut the cables of telecom equipment. Websites have been defaced. Ukraine has done this to Russia substituting the word Nazi for Russian. Think of this as cyber graffiti. LAURA GALANTE: Not hard to do, pretty simplistic. AUSTER: Laura Galante is an intelligence analyst with the cyber security firm FireEye. She thinks that the use of the sophisticated malware Snake shows that a serious player, like Russia, is in the game. There's evidence Snake's lurked on Ukraine's government networks since long before the current conflict, a sign that cyber operations are happening all the time, war or peace. A version has also been linked to a break-in of secret Pentagon computers back in 2008. Its use now in Ukraine has experts paying attention. GALANTE: People think, oh wow, here's a window in Russia's cyber capabilities. AUSTER: Again Laura Galante. GALANTE: Russia has long been vaunted as this uber-capable almost bogeyman of an actor - they're so good, we just don't see them. So any data points that us in the analytic community can use to understand Russia's real capabilities would be massively useful. AUSTER: Now, Snake is not cyber war. It's a kind of intelligence gathering. But will Russia cross the line? Will it venture into outright cyber war? It's hard to answer that question. The rules for cyber war have yet to be written. Catherine Lotrionte is director of the Institute for Law, Science, and Global Security at Georgetown University. She says the rules could be taking shape right in front of our eyes. CATHERINE LOTRIONTE: And so, watching how the Russia-Ukraine conflict rolls out will tell us a lot about the practice that states are going to be conducting in the cyber realm when it comes to conflict and what rules they're comfortable with accepting or not. AUSTER: Rules like: How do you know when force has been used? What's a legitimate target? Even what's a weapon? Clearly there's a lot to work out. Bruce Auster, NPR News, Washington.

COM COMMERCIAL AD)(SOUNDBITE OF FARMERSONLY. COM COMMERCIAL AD)RATH: Now, there's a new site for an even more niche audience: missionaries and other Christians moving abroad. GERIN ST. CLAIRE: If they're overseas making the world a better place one way or another, we want to empower them to stay there. RATH: Gerin St. Claire is one of the founders of the new dating site CalledTogether. us. CLAIRE: It could be someone who's founding an orphanage or somebody who is working for an NGO, because a lot of them are coming back to America because of loneliness, because they don't have a spouse and they don't have hope of finding one overseas. And so they return. RATH: You know, I don't know where I get this from, but I have this idea in my mind of what a missionary is like. And I imagine someone who is already married and settled with a family in a way. CLAIRE: Yeah. You know, I think in America in general, about 50 percent of the population is single. But among missionaries, it's more like two-thirds is married, only one-third is single. You tend to be correct that usually, people don't go overseas unless they already have a spouse. Moving overseas can be a lonely thing. You might be over there for five to eight years before you know the local language well enough to really converse and build meaningful community. And so for a lot of missionaries, it's difficult in general to have close connections. And then for singles, it's doubly hard because they also don't have a spouse to rely on and to have that support from. RATH: So is the idea to link people up before they go on their missions, or could it happen so that somebody actually ends up getting pulled out of a life because they get connected to someone who's somewhere else? We hope to link them up both before, during and after they go overseas. What oftentimes happens is someone would meet someone here in America and then kind of have to choose between, do I want to go overseas and chase my dream or do I want marriage? But we hope to be able to offer this resource so that they don't have to make that decision. It's easy to understand how being in a place, especially if it's a very foreign place, by yourself can make one feel pretty lonely and cut off. But are there specific things about being a missionary, doing the Christian work out there that also make that harder? CLAIRE: Yeah. I think that for missionaries, it's going to be extra isolating because a lot of the times they're in a culture that not only doesn't understand them but also might not approve of their faith. And so there's going to be an extra isolation from that. RATH: Where do you see this - where do you want to see this in five years? CLAIRE: We could definitely see it expanding to being a multinational effort for any Christian who wants to live in a culture other than their own. Because, I mean, if they use eHarmony or Match or one of those sites, probably 95 percent of the people that they get matched with will have no interest in relocating to a foreign country. But with our site, they can answer that question from the beginning. They can know from the beginning that this person would be willing to come where I am. And that would hopefully make it a lot easier for them to find someone. RATH: Gerin Sinclair is one of the founders of the new dating site CalledTogether. us.

That is the consensus of investigators still struggling to understand what happened to Malaysia Airlines flight 370. Today, the Malaysian defense minister announced the authorities were refocusing their investigation on all crew and passengers. Last week, Interpol confirmed that two passengers aboard the flight were traveling on stolen passports. While there's no evidence that those passengers are behind the plane's disappearance, aviation experts say it highlights a major security gap at many airports. It is still possible to board an airplane with a fake photo ID. How could that be the case? A new study of facial recognition finds that people are shockingly bad at picking out fake photo IDs. Megan Papesh is one of the authors of that study. MEGAN PAPESH: When you are tasked with matching somebody to a photo ID that had been taken days, months, even years prior, all of the many changes that occur in people - gain weight, lose weight, shave, put on glasses - you know, myriad changes occur, and that makes people really willing to accept a lot of changes. RATH: So how did you do the study? How did you take a look at this? PAPESH: We took pictures of students at Arizona State University and got their permission to download their student ID photos. And then at Louisiana State University, we presented those photos to students and asked them to make - basically match mismatched decisions to those where we manipulated how frequently we showed them IDs that mismatched. So those are the critical ones. Those are the bad guys. RATH: Mm-hmm. And how often did they get it wrong? PAPESH: Well, when they see the mismatches frequently - so that's 50 percent of the time - they would get it wrong about 20 percent of the time. So they would be about 80 percent accurate. But when they only saw the mismatches 10 percent of the time, their error rates actually skyrocketed. They went up to 45 percent. RATH: Just for some real-world examples, say, if you're a bouncer at a bar, you're checking IDs, are you more or less likely to get those right compared to other situations? PAPESH: That situation's actually really interesting. So a lot of my research assistants have told me that bouncers at clubs are really good at spotting fake IDs despite the motivation to let people in and sell alcohol to them because they encounter so many of them, which is part of why we're interested in providing training to individuals who are tasked with doing this in more security contexts with those bursts of fake IDs, kind of like they would get if they were bouncers at a club. RATH: So TSA agents could learn something from the bouncer community. PAPESH: I hesitate to put them on that spot, but it's possible. (LAUGHTER)RATH: Potentially. And in terms of the ID itself, is there anything that could be done with that or photographic techniques that could make them less fallible? PAPESH: Well, I hear for passport photos, you have to put your hair behind your ears if you have long hair because most people don't change their ears. But driver's licenses don't have those sort of constraints. But there are some researchers in the U. K. that have found that having multiple photos of the same person helps people identify faces to photographs. RATH: You know, I know that we know from computer modeling that facial recognition is extremely complicated. And your work would seem to indicate that humans actually aren't as good at it as we might have thought we were. Is this simply a bad way to identify people? PAPESH: Unfortunately, it's simultaneously the best and the worst way that we have. Computer face recognition software is making tremendous strides. But unfortunately, that software doesn't perform at the level of humans yet, so it can't be deployed in applied contexts. And barring anything much more invasive, like retinal scans or thumbprint ID, face matching is really the best way to go without being too terribly invasive.

What is the most used travel app on your portable device right now? SAMILJAN: Kayak. com I like the most because not only can you search for plane tickets, but you can also get hotels, car rentals. You can manage all of your travel information there. So, it'll send you updates if a flight is delayed. Another place to check out is Yapta. Yapta is. . . MARTIN: Yapta? Can you spell that for me? SAMILJAN: Yes. It's Y-A-P-T-A. And Yapta lets you set an alert. So, say you'll search a specific itinerary on a specific airline at a specific time. Yapta will send you an alert any time that price of that particular flight goes up or down. MARTIN: What about accommodation? SAMILJAN: Lately, I've been using Booking. com, which is dedicated to hotels. And one of the reasons I really like Booking. com is in many cases it will let me book my hotel and cancel my reservation up to 24 hours before without charging my card. A lot of other places will charge the amount of the entire stay, like, the minute you book it. You can also use a search engine. There's one called Tango - this is less of an app, more of a website, but you can access from your mobile phone. And if you buy through them, they'll automatically upgrade you to a better room, if that becomes available, for the same price, or if a cheaper room becomes available and the price goes down, they'll rebook your reservation to a less-expensive room. I mean, of course, it's the same room but less-expensive rate. MARTIN: What about travel guides? More and more of these are now moving online - no more do we lug around these well-loved travel guides dog-eared and underlined. There's an app called Triposo. What can you tell us about that? SAMILJAN: Well, Triposo is a really interesting app/service. Basically, it's sort of automatically ingests information from places like Wiki Travel, a lot of online sites that have information about various travel destinations and sticks them sort of automatically into these, like, online guides that very much look like your traditional travel guide except it's a compilation of the best of what the Web has to offer. And what's really nice about those is that you can just download them onto your phone and access them online. You don't have to worry about racking up any roaming fees. MARTIN: What about navigating public transport? This is something that's always kind of intimidating, right, when you land, especially if you're traveling internationally. You land in a new country, you don't speak the language, you're traveling on a budget and you just kind of want the experience of using the local transportation system. Has anyone developed an app that can help you navigate those systems? SAMILJAN: Yes. There are a few apps. Probably my favorite is Hopstop, which has a bunch of different cities. So, in one app you can get automatic directions to how to get from one subway stop to another. You can also use Google Maps. Google Maps has a public transportation feature, so you can put the address where you're leaving from or your location and then where you want to go and then press the public transportation button and it'll give you the public transportation directions. MARTIN: And that works internationally? SAMILJAN: That works internationally but it will use data. So, if you're in another country, you're going to want to use the Wi-Fi zone or you're going to want to make sure that you've bought a roaming plan so data roaming is included in your plan. MARTIN: And I imagine it's somewhat limited to major European capitals or if you're in some tiny village in Morocco and there's a bus, it's not going to help you out. SAMILJAN: In a tiny village in Morocco, it might not help you, but there is actually another really interesting site called Roam to Rio that actually will tell you how to get to that tiny village in Morocco all the way from your place in, say, you know, anywhere in the United States it'll tell you the public transportation part, the flights you would have to take and then the local train then maybe even the bus that you'd have to take after. It's amazing what it'll provide. There's apps also like Maplets, where you can download local maps for places all over the world. So, you could just get the local public transportation map as sort of a PDF file on your phone. So, that might be another option for super-local directions. MARTIN: Is there any benefit to just abandoning all the online guides, getting out the paper maps and getting lost and confused? SAMILJAN: I do like paper maps also, I have to say. I like paper maps. Sometimes it's easier just to see an overview of where you are and you may not know where you want to go. Maybe you don't want specific directions. Maybe you want to have a slightly more serendipitous route. And if that's the case, then I think that having a paper map is definitely preferable to something that tells you the best way to get somewhere. MARTIN: Room for your iPhone and your paper map. SAMILJAN: Yes. MARTIN: Tom Samiljan. He's the tech correspondent for Travel and Leisure. He joined us from our studios in New York. Thanks so much, Tom. SAMILJAN: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MARTIN: Is there a travel app you can't live without? If so, you can leave your tips on the NPR WEEKEND EDITION Facebook page. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Spring break is not far away. So, it's time to start planning that trip, if you haven't booked it already. This is when those smartphones and tablets come in handy, right? I mean, they are supposed to help us be more organized. It's not really working for me. On this week's Wingin' It, though, we're going to attempt to help you make best use of your digital devices when traveling. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: Here to help us out is Tom Samiljan. He is the tech correspondent for Travel and Leisure magazine. We've asked him to help us sort through some of the many travel apps on the market - some apps that could make your trip planning a little less stressful - we hope. Tom joins us from our studios in New York. Hey, Tom. TOM SAMILJAN: Hi. MARTIN: So, I'm just going to start off with, like, the million-dollar question. What is the most used travel app on your portable device right now? SAMILJAN: Kayak. com I like the most because not only can you search for plane tickets, but you can also get hotels, car rentals.

This week, two best-selling authors - Brad Meltzer and AJ Jacobs - teamed up to tweet a story for the second-annual Twitter Fiction Festival - #TwitterFiction. There are a lot of people who've become really good at writing fiction in the form of tweets - also known as twitterature, seriously. The online festival for Twitter writers wraps up today. Famous authors, like RL Stein and Alexander McCall Smith, along with a couple of dozen amateurs, took part. Sometimes the story came in a single tweet. Others were conveyed in mini-episodes. Or sometimes the story, as it were, was pretty similar to an exchange you might see on Twitter between two friends. Brad Meltzer, famous author of thrillers like \"The Inner Circle\" and host of the History Channel's \"Decoded,\" joins us to tell us more about his role in the online festivities. He joins us on the line from his home in Miami. Brad, thanks so much for being with us. BRAD MELTZER: Thank you. MARTIN: So, you and AJ Jacobs chose to create your Twitter story as a sort of back and forth. Can you describe the conceit? MELTZER: They said to us give us a story that we could put out over Twitter. And, you know, listen, I could take one of my novels and cut it down into 140-word segments in bursts and put it out there. That doesn't mean it's a Twitter story. So, what we tried to do is turn our story into something that really embraced the medium it was in. We made an imaginary fight with each other. I thought that's how you do a story. You want to see some fiction? We're going to show you how much we hate each other. MARTIN: The story - this is all about what the two of you would proclaim as your last words before you die. Can you read us a little bit of your exchange? MELTZER: Absolutely. AJ says to me: Do you have a ghostwriter to work on your final words because you're so busy with your thriller factory? And then I say back to him: I haven't written my books in years. They're done by kids in Singapore. MARTIN: A little dark humor there. MELTZER: And, you know, the best part is, is I'm actually pretending that that's true. MARTIN: So, is this just like a fun exercise, a gimmick of sorts, or is there some real value in triggering a new dimension of creativity when you write like this? MELTZER: Listen, everything can be an art form. I can't say that what we produced was. But here's what is interesting. My canvas as a novelist is usually 500 pages. Now, I'm supposed to tell a story on what's pretty much a postage stamp. I do think as an exercise, it's fascinating, because it really makes you think about what it takes to tell a story. MARTIN: What was the response like? MELTZER: You know, I think the best response we got was some guy on Twitter. Again, it always comes down to some guy, right? Who just simply wrote: AJ Jacobs and Brad Meltzer just won the Internet today. For me, if you win the Internet, you're having a good day. MARTIN: You're done. MELTZER: That was it. I take my bow.

You can find out all about the world's best fakes at Engadget. com. The tech magazine prints a regular feature online called Keepin' It Real Fake, or K-I-R-F, KIRF. Joining us now to go through a few of his favorites is Engadget's senior editor Michael Gorman. Welcome to the program. MICHAEL GORMAN: Thanks for having me. MARTIN: OK. Let's start off with the telescoping antenna phone. Why? Why, Michael? (LAUGHTER)GORMAN: So, it's something that kind of U. S. people and maybe even Europeans might not be so familiar with. But particularly in Japan and Korea, there are phones that actually allow you to pull down TV directly with an antenna. So, I assume that's what this was. Why you needed to put it on a fake iPhone 4 is an entirely separate question that certainly kind of screws up all that beautiful design that Apple spends so much time and effort, you know, perfecting. MARTIN: Do you know who made it or where it was made? GORMAN: I do not know. A lot of times it's very difficult to kind of track down these companies that make KIRFs, as we call them, really just kind of cloned phones for, I guess, somewhat obvious reasons. Basically, you know, if you're making fake phones, you don't want Apple to come after you. So, a lot of these companies tend to be in China for most - Shenzhen region. It's many major companies that actually make the real deal are manufactured in there. So, it's kind of logical that a lot of these clones come out 'cause people have easy access to parts. You know, you get one guy who manages to sneak a piece out of a factory somewhere or something and all of the sudden it's very easy to clone it and just make it somewhere else, you know? MARTIN: OK. Do you have other favorites? GORMAN: There are so many that are I would call them bizarrely terrible. So, Nokia came out with a phone last year that had a really, really nice camera in it, right. And it's a 40-megapixel camera. And there was some company in Shenzhen that decided they wanted to a make phone that looks like that. Obviously, they didn't have access to kind of the camera technology that Nokia did. So, to look the same, they just stuck an extra-large speaker in the back of the phone. On the real thing, there's this hump in the back to accommodate this bigger, better camera on the real phone. And on the fake one, they just decided, well, I guess slotting in a speaker is as good as use for any, which I thought was an interesting choice. I don't think too many people are looking to their phones to be, you know, pumping out serious audio. But that one was one of my favorites.

Investors are pooling their money together online to buy real estate. And as KERA's Lauren Silverman reports, the first crowdfunded real estate deal in North Texas just closed. LAUREN SILVERMAN, BYLINE: Since new owners acquired this apartment complex in the Dallas suburb of Mesquite, there have been a lot of changes. Even the ducks living in the pond got a diet upgrade. LESLIE KUHLMAN: The previous ownership used to feed them three bowls a day of popcorn. SILVERMAN: These days, it's fresh bread. Leslie Kuhlman, whose company is involved in the deal, says of course the tenants are getting upgrades, too. KUHLMAN: We've got our playgrounds going in, barbecue grills, exterior kitchens - things like that. SILVERMAN: This 267-unit complex, known as Trinity Place, will soon be rebranded Park Centre; that's C-E-N-T-R-E. The idea is renovations drive higher rental rates, and that drives higher returns for investors. The new investors, they're not part of your typical private equity group. BOB GUJAVARTY: I'm Bob Gujavarty, and I live in Austin, Texas. SILVERMAN: Bob Gujavarty is one of 46 investors who went online to a crowdfunding site called Realty Mogul, to put money into this property. That wouldn't have happened until last year, when the SEC voted to allow companies to use the Internet to sell shares directly to the public. Now, for the first time, real estate developers can market their projects online to so-called accredited investors - people with a net worth of $1 million, or an annual income of at least $200,000. That means people like Gujavarty can buy into properties for as little as $5,000. GUJAVARTY: I think it's important to diversify your investments, and I think that's very difficult in real estate. SILVERMAN: The way the vast majority of small investors use real estate to diversify is through something called a real estate investment trust - a REIT. It's like a mutual fund for real estate. But with those, you choose the fund and pay a management fee. You don't choose the specific housing project. That's where crowdfunding comes in. JILLIENE HELLMAN: We open up a world that investors historically didn't have access to. SILVERMAN: Jilliene Hellman is the 27-year-old CEO of Realty Mogul, based in Los Angeles. HELLMAN: We're allowing them to invest in geographies where they might not have known a real estate company, or might not have known anything about the underlying property. And we're allowing them to invest in different property types as well. SILVERMAN: Since it started in 2013, Realty Mogul has raised more than $10 million and funded almost 30 properties. More than a dozen online platforms for crowdfunding real estate have launched in the past few years. The thing is, they're a lot riskier than a REIT fund. PETER CHINLOY: It's a good thing if you know what you're doing, and it's a bad thing if you don't. SILVERMAN: Peter Chinloy is a professor of real estate and finance at American University. CHINLOY: Certainly, one of the good things is that some of the transaction costs are removed, but then the bad thing is that you are on your own. So this is really a buyer beware type of investment. SILVERMAN: Most of the investors in that apartment complex in North Texas have never physically seen it. Bob Gujavarty, in Austin, says he scoured the prospectus online, even called up the founder; but he didn't drive up to inspect the property. GUJAVARTY: Realty Mogul certainly could have been a scam. I did as much due diligence as I could, but I think all investments entail some risk and hopefully, this turns out well. SILVERMAN: Jilliene Helman, of Realty Mogul, admits crowdfunding can be a risky game. HELLMAN: Fundamentally, crowdfunding is a bad idea. And I am the CEO of a crowdfunding company. And that may sound absolutely insane for me to say, but there are going to be thousands of crowdfunding companies that come up, and there's going to be investors who invest with those companies, and they're not all going to survive. SILVERMAN: Although companies like Realty Mogul are still only allowed to do business with accredited investors, the SEC is considering opening sales up to non-accredited investors - your average Joe on Facebook or Twitter. That could spawn a real-life Monopoly game for the masses. For NPR News, I'm Lauren Silverman in Dallas. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  And crowdfunding has hit home - literally.

SILVERMAN: The way the vast majority of small investors use real estate to diversify is through something called a real estate investment trust - a REIT. It's like a mutual fund for real estate. But with those, you choose the fund and pay a management fee. You don't choose the specific housing project. That's where crowdfunding comes in. JILLIENE HELLMAN: We open up a world that investors historically didn't have access to. SILVERMAN: Jilliene Hellman is the 27-year-old CEO of Realty Mogul, based in Los Angeles. HELLMAN: We're allowing them to invest in geographies where they might not have known a real estate company, or might not have known anything about the underlying property. And we're allowing them to invest in different property types as well. SILVERMAN: Since it started in 2013, Realty Mogul has raised more than $10 million and funded almost 30 properties. More than a dozen online platforms for crowdfunding real estate have launched in the past few years. The thing is, they're a lot riskier than a REIT fund. PETER CHINLOY: It's a good thing if you know what you're doing, and it's a bad thing if you don't. SILVERMAN: Peter Chinloy is a professor of real estate and finance at American University. CHINLOY: Certainly, one of the good things is that some of the transaction costs are removed, but then the bad thing is that you are on your own. So this is really a buyer beware type of investment. SILVERMAN: Most of the investors in that apartment complex in North Texas have never physically seen it. Bob Gujavarty, in Austin, says he scoured the prospectus online, even called up the founder; but he didn't drive up to inspect the property. GUJAVARTY: Realty Mogul certainly could have been a scam. I did as much due diligence as I could, but I think all investments entail some risk and hopefully, this turns out well. SILVERMAN: Jilliene Helman, of Realty Mogul, admits crowdfunding can be a risky game. HELLMAN: Fundamentally, crowdfunding is a bad idea. And I am the CEO of a crowdfunding company. And that may sound absolutely insane for me to say, but there are going to be thousands of crowdfunding companies that come up, and there's going to be investors who invest with those companies, and they're not all going to survive. SILVERMAN: Although companies like Realty Mogul are still only allowed to do business with accredited investors, the SEC is considering opening sales up to non-accredited investors - your average Joe on Facebook or Twitter. That could spawn a real-life Monopoly game for the masses. For NPR News, I'm Lauren Silverman in Dallas.", "section": "Technology", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2014 NPR.  All rights reserved.

It's the 49th public meeting of ICANN. That's the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. It's the organization that manages domain names for websites and email servers, a thing most of us take for granted. But this meeting is a bigger deal than usual. The Obama administration has announced that the U. S. will give up its control of ICANN. Some of the headlines: America's Internet Surrender, and: ICANN Move Doesn't Equal Net Armageddon. Here to explain is Wall Street Journal technology reporter Gauthem Nagesh. Welcome to the program. GAUTHEM NAGESH: Thanks for having me. CORNISH: So first, just so we're totally clear, what exactly does ICANN do? NAGESH: ICANN is a policymaking body that's in charge of the main phone directory for the Internet. They manage domain names and IP addresses, which essentially point users towards different servers or websites, things like the dot-com or dot-org or dot-gov domain. CORNISH: Now, I've seen the U. S. described as a bodyguard for ICANN. Who actually runs it? NAGESH: It's an international nonprofit. It's based here in the U. S. Every country has one vote at ICANN. The relationship the U. S. is stepping back from is a contractual relationship between ICANN and the Commerce Department. Because the Internet's pretty new, originally, a scientist named John Postel, computer scientist at USC in Southern California, used to manage the Internet names and addresses himself. When he passed away, the Commerce Department realized there was a need for someone to manage this increasingly important and large function, so they issued a contract to ICANN to handle it. CORNISH: Now, the contract between the U. S. Commerce Department and ICANN is set to expire next fall. But who or what is going to take over? NAGESH: That's the point of the process they're kicking off in Singapore. Basically, ICANN is going to convene all the relevant stakeholders, the engineers, the administrators of the top-level domains, the various countries that are involved, and they're all going to get together and try to come up with a new model. But the real point is to just ensure that ICANN is doing its job the way it's already been done. The Commerce Department largely just rubber stamps what ICANN does. They're going to try and create a new structure without any governmental involvement that will do the same thing. But we're still not sure what that will look like. CORNISH: At the same time, we've been hearing about a push for some sort of United Nations-related group to do it, with countries like Russia and China stepping up to talk about this. And, you know, critics say, look, China is best known for its censorship of the net. I mean, are opponents actually right to worry here? NAGESH: Well, in terms of the ICANN move itself, this should not affect censorship. China and Russia should not really gain any leverage through this move. If anything, this move is aimed to quiet people like China and Russia, who complain that the U. S. has a hand in the plumbing of the Internet and therefore is capable of doing things that maybe they don't support. The U. S. position and that of its allies is that the Internet should be free and open and the government shouldn't interfere with it. That position has been undermined by the wrath of disclosures regarding surveillance from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. And China and Russia, who have always pushed for a more hands-on, top-down approach to the Internet that some people would label as censorship. Well, that approach has gained traction because while the U. S. has been loudly decrying this, they've also been doing a lot of stuff that people don't feel corresponds with the idea of Internet freedom. CORNISH: Gauthem Nagesh, if ICANN is really more about a kind of maintenance than governance, why are people so upset about this? I mean, what do they see further down the line that people think is a concern? NAGESH: Well, I think that this strikes at a few key issues, the primary being the U. S. has always been the steward of the Internet. And the contract with ICANN is the most outward example of that. If ICANN's relationship with the U. S. changes, there's fear that eventually it could move to another country or it would no longer be under the auspices of American law, which it is currently, and that would change the nature of the Internet itself in some people's view. I think if you're of the view that the Internet is best when it's under the supervision, essentially, of the American government or heavily influenced by American values, then, yes, you could see this as a more of an international turn, which could be viewed as a negative.

I'm Audie Cornish. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: And I'm Robert Siegel. Another day of searching, another day of frustration in the effort to find Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. Planes searching the southern Indian Ocean for possible aircraft debris have found nothing. They're looking for two large floating objects detected by satellite about 1,500 miles off the southwest coast of Australia. One object is almost 80 feet long, the other is about 15 feet. This is not just like finding a needle in a haystack. In this case, the haystack is vast and the needle could be moving. Here to talk about the debris search is David Gallo of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who worked on finding the Air France jet that crashed off Brazil in 2009. Welcome to the program. DAVID GALLO: Thank you, Robert. SIEGEL: Let's start with the question of time here. It's almost two weeks since the plane's disappearance and the satellite photos of the possible debris are already days old. I assume that time would be the enemy here in finding this wreck. GALLO: Yeah, Robert, from the moment this tragedy began, it's been just getting harder with every day that passes, so this is certainly not helping with time passing the way it is. SIEGEL: Is there some way of inferring through very complex algorithms if a piece of debris is at point X today, then we think that five days ago or 12 days ago it might likely have been here? GALLO: Yeah. You can infer that and it's actually a science and we've got some of the best people that do that here at Woods Hole Oceanographic. And it's fascinating because it's not just the object, it's the shape of the object and whether it sticks above the water and acts like a sailboat and pushed by the winds or looks like an iceberg and moved more by the currents and then there's plenty in between. SIEGEL: Well, what are the special challenges posed by the Indian Ocean and the part of the Indian Ocean where the search for the debris is underway now? GALLO: Well, one, it's remote, it's a long way from anyplace, almost 1,500 miles from Perth. So getting a boat out from Perth takes days, a week. The other thing we're dealing with is a very deep sea floor, from a mile and a half down to three miles, potentially, and also weather that can be horrific. SIEGEL: You said that people at Woods Hole are working on this problem from the mathematical end? GALLO: Not officially. So we have a team that did work on the Air France 447 issue and I know they've had a look at this part of the world to see what they can tell, whether it's doable or not. And I think they feel that, you know, we're getting towards the edge of the time window where you can accurately predict backwards two weeks or more. But, you know, even if they come close, it's going to cut down that huge search area to something a little bit more manageable. SIEGEL: But to use your phrase, to predicting backwards, running the movie backwards in effect here, what you have to do is figure out ocean currents, but also winds, all sorts of things. GALLO: They all play in and they don't operate in the same direction at the same speed every day, so you've got - they might fight against one another, the currents and the winds. And also, every piece has its own trajectory. Even if they began together, depending on their shape and size, they'll end up in different places at the end of a certain amount of time. SIEGEL: And give me a sense of your reaction to how big a problem this is if you're confronted with the Indian Ocean. There is something under the Indian Ocean and bits of it might be floating 1,000 miles off the Australian coast. Does that suggest to you, ah, some evidence to work with at last or no way to solve that? GALLO: You know, Robert, at this point, any evidence that lasts for more than a day to me is really welcome. And you might say, well, what do you have to do with - why do you care? You're an oceanographer. Our job begins on the surface or beneath the surface. Well, you know, before we want to deploy our teams and our equipment to an area, we want to be pretty sure that we're not being sent on a wild goose chase. And so we follow this pretty closely about what the evidence is and the reasoning is and it's been, you know, difficult. There's no doubt in my mind that given the will of the governments and the time and the resources that this plane will be found, but right now, there's not a single shred of evidence, none, that that plane has crashed, either on land or in the ocean.

The weeklong event brings together, not the people who buy video games, but the people who make them - the engineers, artists, writers and companies big and small that they work for. Brian Crecente is there covering it for Polygon, a video game news website. He joined us from San Francisco to talk about it. Good morning. BRIAN CRECENTE: Good morning. WERTHEIMER: I want ask you first about the big news out of the conference from Sony, which has announced something called Project Morpheus. It seems to me that the very strange name. What is it? CRECENTE: Project Morpheus is a virtual reality headset. So this is the thing that would cover your face, sort of like a pair of ski goggles or maybe a scuba mask, and inside the headset is a high definition screen. And this device, if it ever comes out, is designed to plug into a PlayStation 4 and allow people to play games using the console's motion tracking move controllers. WERTHEIMER: Motion tracking what? (LAUGHTER)CRECENTE: So the move controllers are basically, they look a little bit like, I'd say, like ice cream cones. So you would hold these things in your hands and if you had this headset on, you would look down and perhaps see, for instance, not just your hands but you would see a sword in your hands and, of course, your hands moving around as well. So it allows you to sort of move around in this virtual world. It is worth noting that this isn't the first or only virtual reality headset out there. Oculus VR is also showing off their latest headset, which is called a Rift. The key difference between these two is that the Rift is designed to plug into a computer, where the Project Morpheus is going to be working for a PlayStation 4. WERTHEIMER: This conference has long drawn international developers from places like Japan and Korea. What about China? Is there any kind of a presence from Chinese developers? CRECENTE: Yes. China is a growing force in game development and gaming. And one of the biggest Internet companies in the world, Tencent, is actually here. And earlier this week, they said that they expect an influx of cheap phones in China to bring with it nearly another half billion or so mobile gamers to China alone. And their expectation is that those mobile gamers will, over time, sort of become people who play PC games and console games. WERTHEIMER: Well now, there must be - I assume - some unusual, creative, quirky things that you are seeing out there. Give us an example of one of the stranger things you've noticed. CRECENTE: Well, I have to say, so this is not your typical tech convention. It's not like a bunch of loud booths. They have a lot of panels where people learn tricks of the trade, but they also hear about experimental games. One of my favorite talks this year was from Tracy Fullerton, who is the director of USC's Game Innovation Lab. What she talked about was how it seemed there is working on turning Henry David Thoreau's \"Walden\" into a video game. So the idea is that players will have to survive through eight seasons of living on Walden Pond. (LAUGHTER)WERTHEIMER: That is very strange. CRECENTE: It is. What's neat about it is that players can spend all their time sort of on the daily grind trying to complete their chores. That's not really fun, though. So if they tend to wander around in the woods, they'll discovery these sorts of small wonders - things like finding a mother partridge and her chick or maybe seeing the perch leap from the pond. And the coolest thing is that the game is logging all of this and then what it does is it uses that journal to write the player's own version of \"Walden,\" which I think is just fantastic. WERTHEIMER: Brian, thank you very much. CRECENTE: Thank you. WERTHEIMER: Brian Crecente is the news editor of \"Polygon. \" He joined us from San Francisco.

CRECENTE: Well, I have to say, so this is not your typical tech convention. It's not like a bunch of loud booths. They have a lot of panels where people learn tricks of the trade, but they also hear about experimental games. One of my favorite talks this year was from Tracy Fullerton, who is the director of USC's Game Innovation Lab. What she talked about was how it seemed there is working on turning Henry David Thoreau's \"Walden\" into a video game. So the idea is that players will have to survive through eight seasons of living on Walden Pond. (LAUGHTER) WERTHEIMER: That is very strange. CRECENTE: It is. What's neat about it is that players can spend all their time sort of on the daily grind trying to complete their chores. That's not really fun, though. So if they tend to wander around in the woods, they'll discovery these sorts of small wonders - things like finding a mother partridge and her chick or maybe seeing the perch leap from the pond. And the coolest thing is that the game is logging all of this and then what it does is it uses that journal to write the player's own version of \"Walden,\" which I think is just fantastic. WERTHEIMER: Brian, thank you very much. CRECENTE: Thank you. WERTHEIMER: Brian Crecente is the news editor of \"Polygon. \" He joined us from San Francisco.", "section": "Technology", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2014 NPR.  All rights reserved.

I'm Robert Siegel. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: I'm Audie Cornish and now, to All Tech Considered. (SOUNDBITE OF THEME MUSIC)CORNISH: Botox, plastic surgeries, an obsession with youth - we're not talking about Hollywood. That's the new culture of Silicon Valley, according to writer Noam Scheiber. His article for the New Republic is titled \"The Brutal Ageism of Tech. \" And it describes how the infusion of power and money in Silicon Valley has sidelined older workers. Noam Scheiber joins me in the studio. Welcome. NOAM SCHEIBER: Thanks for having me. CORNISH: All right. So to begin, give us some context. Just who is considered old in Silicon Valley? SCHEIBER: I think it's helpful to break Silicon Valley down broadly into two groups: the engineers and the entrepreneurs. On the engineering side, 35 really starts to be considered quite old. The computer languages change so quickly that people are quickly perceived to be out of date. On the entrepreneur side, people value experience a little more but there, even 40 and over tends to be perceived as quite old. CORNISH: Now, what did this mean for the workers you encounter who were above these cutoff ages? I mean, what did you see them doing to try and make things easier for themselves? SCHEIBER: Well, it ranged quite dramatically; from people, you know, trying to be hip at work - roller hockey, play music, guitar with young colleagues, to actually getting Botox treatment. I talked to a cosmetic surgeon in San Francisco, Dr. Seth Matarasso, who by his own calculation, is the second-largest dispenser of Botox in the world. His clientele is varied, but there is a very large tech-industry component to it - things just to subtly make them look a little more youthful so they feel more comfortable surrounded by people 15, 20 years younger than them at the office. CORNISH: And then, you know, this is not just about workers. You write, also, about venture capital - which surprises me 'cause I think of venture capital maybe being older folks, right? I mean, why would they discriminate against their own? SCHEIBER: They are older folks. But you have to keep in mind that venture capital investing, investing in startups, is incredibly risky. And so in order to sustain themselves, they have to have enormous returns on the handful of successful investments. And when they think enormous returns, they tend to think young people. If they look at a more experienced person, they think, well, if they were really capable of returning a hundred or a thousand times my investment, they would have done it by now. CORNISH: And to play devil's advocate here - I mean, is there not something to be said for innovation coming from youthful minds and that in this industry, in particular, that's of high value? SCHEIBER: There is no question that young people can be a source of innovation. But I think venture capitalists who fund these ideas, and who fund these companies, often overlook the fact that it takes 10 or 15 years of living in the world, interacting in the world, to understand where the biggest needs are, where the biggest problems are; and the most efficient ways to attack it. And I think that's what older entrepreneurs offer. And time and again, when you see really revolutionary innovation, it tends to come from those people. CORNISH: Now, in your view, what's the net effect of this ageism on products and ideas? And what does this mean for the ideas that are generated out of these technology firms? SCHEIBER: Well, look, I think the problem when you empower very young people with a lot of money and a lot of the resources, is that you end up getting solutions that are responses to problems that young people have. I write about one company in my piece, called Outbox, that received $5 million in venture capital money. And the business model of this company was to send Toyota Priuses around to people's snail mailboxes, pick up their mail, scan it, and send it to their email inbox.

Bad weather may be a recurring problem there as the Southern Hemisphere edges toward winter. Satellite data points investigators to those remote seas. There have also been satellite images of floating objects. But so far, no debris has been positively identified, and the search area is still huge. Experts say the disappearance of the Boeing jet wouldn't be such a mystery if it had been streaming its location data. Here's NPR's Brian Naylor. BRIAN NAYLOR, BYLINE: Flight 370 disappeared from radar screens when the plane's transponder, which sends out its location, for some reason stopped transmitting. But what if the Boeing 777 had streamed at least some of the data out in real time? We might have a much clearer picture of what happened to the plane, and why. Advocates have been calling on airlines to install such devices for years. Matt Bradley is president of FLYHT Aerospace Solutions, a Canadian company that's developed a system that can transmit data continuously or when triggered by an unexpected event like engine failure or cabin depressurization. MATT BRADLEY: In the event that that happens, an alert is sent to the airline operational control center where a screen lights up, there's an oral alert; and there is - in no uncertain terms do you know there's an abnormality on that aircraft, and we need to look out. NAYLOR: Computer science professor Krishna Kavi, of the University of North Texas, says not all of the data available in a black box needs to be streamed in real time. KRISHNA KAVI: So if you are over an ocean and the satellite is expensive, only send your altitude, your direction of travel - or GPS coordinates, if you want - and state of the engines; are they running OK? So minimal information you know that you need so that if you detect there is something wrong, then you ask for additional information. NAYLOR: The Malaysia Airline jet's last contact was with a satellite system run by Inmarsat. The company's vice president, Chris McLaughlin, says technology is already available to send short bursts of data every few minutes. He says the Air France jetliner that went down in the Atlantic in 2009 had that technology, and it meant recovery crews could quickly narrow the search area. The Malaysia Airline jet, McLaughlin says, did not. CHRIS MCLAUGHLIN: The Air France had elected to adopt a system of bursting information from the plane every four minutes. Malaysian, because it's not mandated, didn't do anything. Now, that's nobody's fault, that's just not mandated. I mean, if one thing is to come out of this tragedy, it should be that all aircraft are mandated to give their position on a regular interval. NAYLOR: Cost is clearly one obstacle to more widespread deployment of streaming technology. The system developed by the Canadian firm FLYHT would cost airlines $100,000 per plane to install. Another concern involves the pilots, who see too much information readily available as an invasion of their privacy. Sean Cassidy is first vice president of the Airline Pilots Association International, the pilots union. Cassidy, an Alaska Airlines captain, is fine with aircraft streaming more data, but he draws the line at cockpit conversations. SEAN CASSIDY: Say I go on an eight-hour trip with my copilot. And every single conversation, every single personal story, stories about our families and everything else, is being streamed live to somewhere? How is that information going to be safeguarded? NAYLOR: It will likely take the FAA to mandate real-time data transmissions for them to be adopted by all carriers. The agency's next generation air traffic control system is based on satellite navigation, but it's unclear when next gen will be fully in place. Brian Naylor, NPR News, Washington.

Matt Bradley is president of FLYHT Aerospace Solutions, a Canadian company that's developed a system that can transmit data continuously or when triggered by an unexpected event like engine failure or cabin depressurization. MATT BRADLEY: In the event that that happens, an alert is sent to the airline operational control center where a screen lights up, there's an oral alert; and there is - in no uncertain terms do you know there's an abnormality on that aircraft, and we need to look out. NAYLOR: Computer science professor Krishna Kavi, of the University of North Texas, says not all of the data available in a black box needs to be streamed in real time. KRISHNA KAVI: So if you are over an ocean and the satellite is expensive, only send your altitude, your direction of travel - or GPS coordinates, if you want - and state of the engines; are they running OK? So minimal information you know that you need so that if you detect there is something wrong, then you ask for additional information. NAYLOR: The Malaysia Airline jet's last contact was with a satellite system run by Inmarsat. The company's vice president, Chris McLaughlin, says technology is already available to send short bursts of data every few minutes. He says the Air France jetliner that went down in the Atlantic in 2009 had that technology, and it meant recovery crews could quickly narrow the search area. The Malaysia Airline jet, McLaughlin says, did not. CHRIS MCLAUGHLIN: The Air France had elected to adopt a system of bursting information from the plane every four minutes. Malaysian, because it's not mandated, didn't do anything. Now, that's nobody's fault, that's just not mandated. I mean, if one thing is to come out of this tragedy, it should be that all aircraft are mandated to give their position on a regular interval. NAYLOR: Cost is clearly one obstacle to more widespread deployment of streaming technology. The system developed by the Canadian firm FLYHT would cost airlines $100,000 per plane to install. Another concern involves the pilots, who see too much information readily available as an invasion of their privacy. Sean Cassidy is first vice president of the Airline Pilots Association International, the pilots union. Cassidy, an Alaska Airlines captain, is fine with aircraft streaming more data, but he draws the line at cockpit conversations. SEAN CASSIDY: Say I go on an eight-hour trip with my copilot. And every single conversation, every single personal story, stories about our families and everything else, is being streamed live to somewhere? How is that information going to be safeguarded? NAYLOR: It will likely take the FAA to mandate real-time data transmissions for them to be adopted by all carriers. The agency's next generation air traffic control system is based on satellite navigation, but it's unclear when next gen will be fully in place.

LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE: You play \"Candy Crush\" by trying to line up at least three of the same color candies. In February, an average of 144 million daily active users got sucked in to challenge. But, \"Candy Crush\" is one of more than 180 games made by King Digital Entertainment and it alone brought in three quarters of the company's revenue in the last quarter of 2013. Roger Kay, president of research firm Endpoint Technologies Associates, says to a lot of investors it sound like \"Farmville\" - the hit game by Zynga that Zynga can't seem to do again. ROGER KAY: It's very difficult to replicate the alchemy of a great hit. Even the very same makers of that game can't necessarily come up with another one that's going to be just as popular. SYDELL: Kay says the market may also be getting a little bubbly - there've been high priced acquisitions, like Facebook's purchase of the virtual reality company Oculus VR for two billion. That two-year-old company has no revenue. KAY: So people are paying a lot for what appears to be not very much. SYDELL: Still, Kay says King Digital has been a profitable company since 2005. It posted over 700 million before taxes last year, and it does have a potential hit on the horizon with \"Farm Heroes Saga,\" which has seen momentum in popularity since its January launch.

Then came the encyclopedia. And now, Wikipedia. Though it's often criticized for being nonauthoritative, Wikipedia's peer-edited pages are the first place many people turn for answers. According to Wikipedia - who else? - there are now over 31 million entries. And overwhelmingly, for one reason or another, they are written by men. As part of its Women's History Month celebrations, the Smithsonian Institution will hold a Wikipedia edit-a-thon tomorrow. The event is focused on teaching women to write and edit Wikipedia entries, though anybody with a laptop is welcome. Sara Snyder, who works in media and technology at the Smithsonian, is running tomorrow's event, and she joins us in our studios. Thanks so much for being with us. SARA SNYDER: Thank you. SIMON: So, what's your explanation for the gender gap? Only one in 10 people contribute to Wikipedia. SNYDER: My own sense is that editing the most popular encyclopedia in the world takes a whole lot of confidence. And in the world at-large, we don't always see that women are able or willing to stand up and share their views, their expertise, their opinions in public forums with the same prevalence as men do. And we see this in Congress and the op-ed page, as well as on Wikipedia. SIMON: I've never been to an edit-a-thon. How many people? Who shows up? Are there doughnuts? SNYDER: Absolutely. Or sandwiches, at least. We usually invite anywhere from, you know, 20 to 40 people. They bring their laptops. We give them all the food and caffeine that they need to keep fueled up and then everybody sits down and starts working. I don't know if you've ever tried editing Wikipedia, but it can be a little - you should. I encourage you to try. You just click edit and you are given an interface where you can make updates yourself. And it can be a little intimidating at times. SIMON: And you can make up yourself too, right? That's. . . SNYDER: You could. SIMON: . . . one of the drawbacks. SNYDER: You could. Although it's not really surprising to me how difficult it is to get away with that anymore. SIMON: Do you ever worry about an edit-a-thon being taken over by an interest group or subset of people with something to - you're nodding your head yes. SNYDER: Well, it's an encyclopedia. It's not a soapbox. It's not a vanity press. So, it's really important that people understand the norms and rules of what an encyclopedia article is supposed to be before they start contributing. And it certainly can be an issue where someone has a conflict of interest or a point of view or an agenda that they want to push. And if people do violate those policies, they'll just see their edits reverted. I mean, everything on Wikipedia can be rolled back with the push of a button. SIMON: Does Smithsonian now have Wikipedians in residence? SNYDER: We've had several Wikipedians in residence over the last three years. The idea is that, much like an artist in residence, a Wikipedian in residence just hangs around answering questions and contributing their knowledge. You know, you see now around the world an increasing number of cultural institutions will have Wikipedians on their staff. And those folks can give advice on these issues of how you use the encyclopedia to share the valuable knowledge that's locked up in our cultural institutions with a broader audience, while at the same time respecting the online community and the norms and policies of the encyclopedia. SIMON: It sounds as if - and I don't know whether you speak for the Smithsonian in this corporately - but you've gotten beyond the reservations a lot of professionals have about Wikipedia to the conclusion that if you want to reach people, this is a stream in which you much swim. SNYDER: Right. You think about a person has a question and likely, they're going to turn to the Internet for an answer. And one of the top results they'll get in their searches is going to be a Wikipedia article. So if the Smithsonian American Art Museum wants to forward understanding and enjoyment of American art, the best place for us to do that online is where the people already are.

SCHULTZ: As you said, I come from Cleveland, where Superman was born. You knew that, right? MARTIN: Of course. SCHULTZ: He was really - he's not from Krypton. He's from - OK. . . MARTIN: Absolutely. SCHULTZ: All right. Tardy planes, zero leg room, connections late at night. Superman, I hate to ask, but I sure could use the flight. ESPUELAS: That's great. MARTIN: I love that. SCHULTZ: And I would look very cool riding on his back. MARTIN: You totally would. SCHULTZ: It's all figured out. MARTIN: Totally would. ESPUELAS: That's funny. MARTIN: OK, Fernando, what about you? ESPUELAS: OK. Well, I was in Uruguay last week, and this is inspired by that. Toes at the edge of the widest river, I imagine arrival of long-ago sailors, the slaughtered Charrua inevitable. Now all are dust, cold toes. MARTIN: I love it. I love it. Well, thank you. So was it hard? ESPUELAS: It was the hardest thing I've written in 25 years or so. Yeah. Yeah. MARTIN: Well, thank you. ESPUELAS: I loved it. MARTIN: That's great. Well, what made you do it? ESPUELAS: Well, you know, it was the challenge. And I also thought, I write basically one thing - about politics - and so the idea of just going into a totally different genre, of which I'm totally not qualified for, seemed like a challenge. And it took me a lot longer than it takes me to write a column, so - and I'm still unhappy with it, but I guess that's the nature of it. MARTIN: I love it. Well, thank you for that. Well, in addition to your own poems, the other challenge that you've agreed to undertake is to look at the poems coming in on Twitter. So you've already picked some that have stood out for you. And you're going to share those. Connie, why don't you start? SCHULTZ: OK, Platypus Tails @flirtybloomers wrote, her bones quite brittle, she slides down the banisters one last time. I love that. Martha Reynolds @TheOtherMartha1 - I am my mother's daughter, but she does not know my name. She called me Faye, and I said, Faye's dead. That made her laugh. So. . . good. And this is from Aaron - I'm going to apologize if I get the name wrong - Aaron Toleos @Toleos - morning commute, I can't go fast enough towards it, this fat blue sky, this flood above my knuckles and the wheel. ESPUELAS: Oh, nice. MARTIN: Nice. What were some of the things that made the poems stand out for you? SCHULTZ: I think in each case, I could imagine that moment. And not to make it all about me, but apparently I made it all about me. I. . . ESPUELAS: That's good poetry, though. SCHULTZ: I could have made - but that's the thing. ESPUELAS: Right. SCHULTZ: It spoke to me. It didn't feel so obscure. And, you know, I'm the first to admit that when I love a poem - and I love poetry - there's something in it that makes me think a little bit harder about my own world. And so each of these and that whole driving. . . MARTIN: Yes. SCHULTZ: . . . Towards the - I just could - yeah. It was perfect. MARTIN: Fernando, what about you? ESPUELAS: OK, I picked two poems. And I'm going to be challenged by the names, but I will try it. The first one is by Namitha Varma-Rajesh. She's @namithavr, and she wrote, we worship the mundane, we love the mediocre, we're in awe of the ordinary, we are stagnating without knowing it. The second one is by Eusebeia Philos, which is @Eusebeia_Philos. Lepus chases Orion in pre-dawn sky over the horizon. I follow in my car on the way to work. MARTIN: I love those both. What - and they're different. They're both different. What is it that stood out for you? ESPUELAS: Well, Nimitha's poem about worshiping the mundane, I thought, speaks to a bigger truth in our society - very focused, I think, on trivia and not really focused on the bigger issues. And I do feel that in every society, even the most successful society throughout history, at any period of time, eventually, if it's not careful, will stagnate and fall into some sort of collapse, or it will collapse. In terms of the second one, I loved very much first of all, because I love all things Greek, and I love Orion. But I thought it was the combination of sort of the ancient imagery of sky over the horizon with the idea that I follow in my car on the way to work. Like, you know, we can transcend that moment where we are stuck in traffic and see perhaps a greater reality. SCHULTZ: This is something we both picked, stuck in the car thing. MARTIN: Tells you a little bit about our lives. ESPUELAS: Exactly. MARTIN: Well, thank you for taking the plunge. And so I want to again encourage that if these two busy people can do it, then you can do it. And also people who are already good at something else are willing to risk it, then you can do it, too. Do you have any advice for our other armchair or behind-the-wheel poets if they want to take a stab at this? SCHULTZ: Well, I said on Facebook this morning, I know you have it in you. I mean, I've been reading their comments on my page for how many years now. I know how creative they are. I want a lot - some of them don't have Twitter accounts. I said, now's the time. Get on Twitter. I just think that there's something freeing about trying something that you're afraid will embarrass you, and you survive it. And you actually feel pretty good about it. MARTIN: Fernando? ESPUELAS: Yeah, I mean, what I found in my own experience of being completely panicked and then having to do it because I said I'd do it, is that this format - and especially the 140 characters - forces you to get to a deeper truth. And whether you do it for yourself or you do it for someone else, it's a really interesting exercise, what pops out of your brain in that context. MARTIN: Well, thank you. Thank you both, and keep it coming. We know that you'll be watching our Twitter feed. . . SCHULTZ: Every day. MARTIN: . . . And sending your best selections to us.

MARTIN: Fernando? ESPUELAS: Yeah, I mean, what I found in my own experience of being completely panicked and then having to do it because I said I'd do it, is that this format - and especially the 140 characters - forces you to get to a deeper truth. And whether you do it for yourself or you do it for someone else, it's a really interesting exercise, what pops out of your brain in that context. MARTIN: Well, thank you. Thank you both, and keep it coming. We know that you'll be watching our Twitter feed. . . SCHULTZ: Every day. MARTIN: . . . And sending your best selections to us. Fernando Espuelas is host and managing editor of \"The Fernando Espuelas Show,\" which is on Univision. Connie Schultz is a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist. They were both kind enough to join us in our Washington, D. C. studios. Thank you both. ESPUELAS: Thank you, Michel. SCHULTZ: Thanks, Michel.

WADE GOODWYN, BYLINE: The first time a newbie walks in to Cowboys Stadium, the person stops dead in his or her tracks and stares toward the heavens. After a few seconds of stunned, holy silence, there's an exclamation of astonishment. They just cannot believe how big it is.

ROBERT DENT: I'd say the only time I watched the game on the floor is when they were doing rewinds up on the TV and I was missing the game. GOODWYN: That's Florida Gator fan Robert Dent. I asked Dent if he felt any guilt whatsoever about watching the giant TV instead of the action on the court, after all the money he spent for tickets, airfare, hotels , meals. DENT: No guilt at all. The TV is a little better than the one in my living room. GOODWYN: There is a gender component to this reaction. Men tend to be completely fine watching the TV. But women, yeah, not too hard to find a woman who feels a little guilty about it. SANDY DALTON: You know, when you first see it, it's - you're kind of like, what is this? It's too big. It seems a little overwhelming. GOODWYN: That's Kansas fan Sandy Dalton. Yes. I know Kansas isn't in the Final Four but the Daltons bought their tickets hoping they would be. Sandy says watching the game here is an entirely new experience. Everyone is not watching the court together but it's OK because they can see the game so well. Dalton was ideologically against it at first, but as time went by the experience began to grow on her. DALTON: When you're sitting up there and you're watching it, you can look down and see the court but you watch the Jumbotron. But you also have all of the live experience going on around you. So it's now great. GOODWYN: The giant screens serve to make the Final Four experience a little more democratic. No matter what you've paid you still can see everything perfectly. But what about those who've actually paid, not hundreds of dollars a ticket, but thousands of dollars a ticket? What are they watching? DON JACOBS: Actually it was half and half actually. And I was down low too. So. . . GOODWYN: That's Kentucky fan Don Jacobs from Lexington. He could see the action on the court perfectly but his eyes nevertheless were pulled skyward. JACOBS: The clarity is just fantastic. We were low enough where we couldn't decide if we wanted to watch the floor or the middle screen or the big screen.

S. tech industry has long been a favorite target of cyberattacks from China. Now Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is in Beijing, where he's set to give a speech encouraging more dialogue between the U. S. and China over cyberwarfare. Here to talk more is Richard Bejtlich. He's the chief security strategist at FireEye, a global network security company. Welcome to the program. RICHARD BEJTLICH: Thanks, Audie. CORNISH: This visit by Secretary Hagel comes with reports in The New York Times that the U. S. was trying to engage China, kind of swapping information about its cybertech capabilities. What exactly does that mean, though? I mean, what's the point of telling China what the U. S. is up to? BEJTLICH: Well, the United States is - or at least this current administration is operating under the assumption that it is beneficial to both countries to let each side know what are the things that if you go too far, it will have some type of repercussions. Unfortunately, this type of strategy is not really going to get anywhere with the Chinese because they are unwilling to publicly talk about their capability. They frequently will deny that they have anything to do with any sort of offensive hacking activity. So neither in public nor private are they willing to talk about it. CORNISH: So the idea here was to set up rules of the road, so to speak. But it sounds like this is very different. The countries feel differently about this than, say, how people thought about nuclear weapons between the U. S. and the Soviets. BEJTLICH: Well, it's funny you bring up nuclear weapons. I'm not a nuclear weapons strategist, but I've studied some of the issues surrounding it. And what you find is that when you have a situation where there's a stronger power and a weaker power - and in this case the cyber equivalent would be the United States is the stronger power - there is no real strategic benefit for the Chinese to reveal the types of capabilities that they have. CORNISH: The U. S. and China have been dealing with cyber-espionage for a long time, what's the danger of real escalation? BEJTLICH: The escalation problem is this, when you conduct any type of espionage activity in cyberspace, the same level of access that you have to steal information or to simply look at information is the level of access, you need to destroy it. If you can access a system to take information, you can also destroy that system. So anytime the United States sees any foreign actors, or even domestic actors for that matter, in sensitive areas and critical infrastructure, it's difficult to know if they're there to spy or they're there to destroy. That's one of the reasons why we get very concerned when we see any actor operating in those infrastructures. CORNISH: Richard Bejtlich, I'm hearing you sound very dubious about what the U. S. is trying to do here. And as someone who is in the commercial security network industry, why so glum? Is it that you don't think that the government can do much about it, or you see limits to kind of nationalized cyberwarfare? BEJTLICH: Yeah, that's right. I think no company wants to invite a government agent or agency into its networks for defensive purposes. There's nobody out there who'll do it. Even when you hear reports that Google was working with the NSA or these sorts of things after Google's breach in late '09, early '10. It was more information sharing. You know, Google says we've seen these actors, what do you know about them, NSA? It's not calling on the NSA or the FBI and any other agency to defend their network. The government has its hands full trying to defend its own networks. And it's a major initiative right now to simply have DHS to get into a position to watch the rest of the federal government. And DOD pretty much takes care of itself. So there just isn't capacity to have government actors defending private citizens. And also, the private citizenry doesn't trust the government, doesn't believe that they will protect their network in a way that's consistent with privacy.

A flaw in a widely-used encryption program called OpenSSL could expose much of the internets encrypted traffic to eavesdropping. NPR's Steve Henn joins me now for more about how this bug was discovered and what it means for all of us. And Steve, the bug is called the \"Heart Bleed Bug\" and it's affecting this encryption program, as we said, called OpenSSL. What's SSL? STEVE HENN, BYLINE: Well, it stands for Secure Socket Layer. But people probably know this as that little padlock that appears next to a web address on a browser on a secure website. And it's one of the most widely used types of encryption on the internet - it's used by banks, it's used by Google for Gmail, Facebook, Yahoo and many, many Internet commerce sites that handle credit card information. BLOCK: OK, and now they're talking about the Heart Bleed Bug. So what's that? HENN: Well, computers and web surfers that use OpenSSL to talk to each other can verify that they are still connected using something called the heartbeat. Basically, this is a short message that's really just supposed to say, hello, are you still there? But last week, researchers in Finland discovered that they could use these heartbeat messages to trick web servers into sending back the contents of the server's short-term memory or RAM. And that RAM could include things like usernames, passwords, credit card information, even the encryption keys for the site. BLOCK: And this has been described as a catastrophic bug - what makes it so bad? Is it all those things you just mentioned? HENN: Well, obviously losing passwords is bad, losing a credit card number is bad. But if you run a website, losing the encryption keys is even worse. It's like having a fancy car and leaving it on the street with the door open and the key's in the ignition. And this flaw in OpenSSL has been baked in for the past two years. So it's been out there for a while. BLOCK: So if it's been out there for a while, why was it just now discovered? HENN: Well, you know, this is an open-source software program. It has researchers going through it constantly. So even though they could trick a web server into sending back information, unencrypted information, it's not like it obviously was intended to do that. It's possible that other malicious actors or, say, the National Security Agency or other state security agencies could have discovered this flaw years ago and have been using. But it wasn't inherently obvious to anyone who was poking around. BLOCK: How many sites are affected by this, Steve? HENN: Well, lots and lots of sites. I mean, OpenSSL is a free software program. And so many websites like Facebook and Google, Yahoo and many banking sites have adopted it. The assumption was because it was open source and everyone could look at the code that it would be safer, that problems like this would have been caught sooner. So it's a pretty dramatic moment when a widely used open source program like this has such a large security flaw. BLOCK: So Steve, what can consumers do? HENN: Well, Intella website has actually fixed this problem in their encryption program. There's not much you can do. But within the next couple of days, that should be taken care of by reputable sites all over the world. Then, unfortunately, I think it would make a lot of sense for you to go back and change your password. This kind of attack doesn't leave a lot of fingerprints, people that run sites may not know if they've been victimized. And unfortunately, the best thing you can do to make sure you're safe is to change how you log in. BLOCK: OK, NPR's Steve Henn reporting on the so-called Heart Bleed Bug. It's a newly discovered security flaw that could expose encrypted data on much of the internet. Steve, thanks. HENN: My pleasure.

That's our ode to National Poetry Month. All through April we are featuring original tweet-length poems - 140 characters or less delivered by Twitter and written by NPR listeners and, new this year, some of our regular contributors. We have gotten off to a great start, according to the Twitter analytics site Topsy. We have had more than 2,500 tweets on the #TMMPoetry. They are still coming in. We were really excited to hear from Native American poet Heid Erdrich. Here's her Twitter poem inspired by the North Dakota landscapeHEID ERDRICH: Whirlwinds, glitter, flat rivers snake her cleft of low cliffs. Cold, lonely, lovely then green grass sweet. Who would not want to eat? MARTIN: That was Native American poet Heid Erdrich. And here to tell us more about the series is poet Holly Bass who's helped us in each of the last four years that we've been doing it. Holly Bass, welcome. HOLLY BASS: Hi, welcome. It's so great to be back. MARTIN: As I mentioned, this is your fourth year participating in Muses and Metaphor. One of our regular contributors Fernando Espuelas is a talkshow host in Univision, a successful businessman. He said this is the hardest assignment that he has had in years. On the other hand, Heid Erdrich told us she loved the 140 character limit. What about you? BASS: It's definitely challenging. But, you know, who doesn't like a good challenge? MARTIN: Some people. Well, thank you for taking the challenge. You've started a teen writing initiative at a detention center, and you've been working with your students to create Twitter poems. How do they feel about it? BASS: They like it. But they also think it's, you know, really difficult. So what I tell them to do is just write a whole poem, and then you can take one line or two lines from that poem and turn that into your Twitter poem. MARTIN: Do you have one to share with us? BASS: I do, actually. This is - we did metaphor and we did I Am poems. And here's some lines from the girls. I am a plant with no seeds, fiending for soil. I am a good witch with no spells. MARTIN: Nice. Very nice. Was that a group effort or does it have one author? BASS: It was a group effort, yeah. MARTIN: Very nice. Very nice. What do you like about it? BASS: I like the contrast. So one of the things we talked about is how do turn an emotion into a metaphor. So you could start with something like feeling powerless, and then that becomes a good witch with no spells. And so how do you visualize powerlessness in a creative and unique way? And so that's how we came up with some of those lines. MARTIN: That was lovely. Now you've also been monitoring the submissions on Twitter, which you do every year for us, which we appreciate very much. What stood out for you? BASS: Well, I think this year, being the fourth year, what I really loved was the sense of coming back to a sort of reunion, like a poets reunion. And all these people who maybe I've never met in person, seeing their Twitter poems over and over, I was like, oh, yeah. You're back. Yay. MARTIN: That's wonderful. Of course, original poems they're delivering to us, right? BASS: Yes. MARTIN: OK. So do you have one or two for us? BASS: I do. I have one. . . MARTIN: That's the wonderful pleasure of this is because they're so short, you can always share like one or two. BASS: Absolutely. And there's been a lot of nice exchange. So the poet I'm going to read from actually took one of my poems and translated it into Tagalog, which I thought was fabulous. And so it's my pleasure to read this poem by Su Luyag. Marbled waterscape mosaic of fields - The Great River has witnessed birds, seeds, humans - stories before migration was a word. MARTIN: Lovely. I love that. BASS: Yeah, isn't that just beautiful. MARTIN: I love that. BASS: There's a whole sort of ecosystem within those 140 characters. MARTIN: Well, I'm going - you know I'm going to put you on the spot and ask if you would give us - share a poem with us. But before I do, do you have some advice for people who would kind of like to try it and might be a little intimidated by it? BASS: I think, again, you know, it's easier to cut away if you think of it as sort of, like, a big chunk of marble, and that's very intimidating. But you just start to cut away, cut away, cut away until you get something that emerges from that. So I would say write from your heart and focus on vibrancy of language and then distill down. MARTIN: Do you think about picking a - how do you pick a subject? I mean, do you think about just, like, what's on your mind, like what's bothering you or something you feel or happen to feel or something you want to get off your chest? BASS: Absolutely. I think poetry is a great way to process the day. A lot of poets I know, they do a haiku every morning. And so you could think of it as a meditation in a way of processing. I've been writing poems about working in the detention center because there's a lot that I'm processing. So I find that very helpful. MARTIN: Well, tell us about the poem you are about to share with us - your original Twitter poem? BASS: Absolutely. And so I'm very proud about this one. You have to let me nerd out for five seconds, right. . . MARTIN: Well, let's hear it. Let's do it. BASS: . . . Because it's in iambic tetrameter, OK, and it's a Twitter poem. So I thought that was kind of cool to do both. So most of us are familiar with iambic pentameter. You hear that in Shakespeare, my mistress eyes are nothing like the sun, or Elizabeth Barrett Browning - how do I love thee? Let me count the ways. So the iam is that combination of unstressed and stressed syllables. So da-da - da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da. So that would be iambic pentameter when you have five of those pairs. Tetrameter is simply four of those pairs. MARTIN: OK. BASS: So you'll hear the rhythm - da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da. OK, and here we go. To tweet, to sing, to send out sound, napomo, to write, each day, to read, to meet, retweet, to wit, to spring, to hash, to tag, to play. MARTIN: I love it. Thank you. That was Holly Bass. She is a writer and a poet. And she was kind enough to join us once again in our Washington, D. C. studios. Holly Bass, thank you so much for joining us. BASS: Thank you for having me. MARTIN: We still want to hear from you. Tweet us your poems. They have to be 140 characters or less. Use the hashtag #TMMPoetry. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  And now it's time for Muses and Metaphor. That's our ode to National Poetry Month. All through April we are featuring original tweet-length poems - 140 characters or less delivered by Twitter and written by NPR listeners and, new this year, some of our regular contributors. We have gotten off to a great start, according to the Twitter analytics site Topsy. We have had more than 2,500 tweets on the #TMMPoetry. They are still coming in. We were really excited to hear from Native American poet Heid Erdrich. Here's her Twitter poem inspired by the North Dakota landscape HEID ERDRICH: Whirlwinds, glitter, flat rivers snake her cleft of low cliffs. Cold, lonely, lovely then green grass sweet. Who would not want to eat? MARTIN: That was Native American poet Heid Erdrich. And here to tell us more about the series is poet Holly Bass who's helped us in each of the last four years that we've been doing it. Holly Bass, welcome. HOLLY BASS: Hi, welcome. It's so great to be back. MARTIN: As I mentioned, this is your fourth year participating in Muses and Metaphor. One of our regular contributors Fernando Espuelas is a talkshow host in Univision, a successful businessman. He said this is the hardest assignment that he has had in years. On the other hand, Heid Erdrich told us she loved the 140 character limit. What about you? BASS: It's definitely challenging. But, you know, who doesn't like a good challenge? MARTIN: Some people. Well, thank you for taking the challenge. You've started a teen writing initiative at a detention center, and you've been working with your students to create Twitter poems. How do they feel about it? BASS: They like it. But they also think it's, you know, really difficult. So what I tell them to do is just write a whole poem, and then you can take one line or two lines from that poem and turn that into your Twitter poem. MARTIN: Do you have one to share with us? BASS: I do, actually. This is - we did metaphor and we did I Am poems. And here's some lines from the girls. I am a plant with no seeds, fiending for soil. I am a good witch with no spells. MARTIN: Nice. Very nice. Was that a group effort or does it have one author? BASS: It was a group effort, yeah. MARTIN: Very nice. Very nice. What do you like about it? BASS: I like the contrast. So one of the things we talked about is how do turn an emotion into a metaphor. So you could start with something like feeling powerless, and then that becomes a good witch with no spells. And so how do you visualize powerlessness in a creative and unique way? And so that's how we came up with some of those lines. MARTIN: That was lovely. Now you've also been monitoring the submissions on Twitter, which you do every year for us, which we appreciate very much. What stood out for you? BASS: Well, I think this year, being the fourth year, what I really loved was the sense of coming back to a sort of reunion, like a poets reunion. And all these people who maybe I've never met in person, seeing their Twitter poems over and over, I was like, oh, yeah. You're back. Yay. MARTIN: That's wonderful. Of course, original poems they're delivering to us, right? BASS: Yes. MARTIN: OK. So do you have one or two for us? BASS: I do. I have one. . . MARTIN: That's the wonderful pleasure of this is because they're so short, you can always share like one or two. BASS: Absolutely. And there's been a lot of nice exchange. So the poet I'm going to read from actually took one of my poems and translated it into Tagalog, which I thought was fabulous. And so it's my pleasure to read this poem by Su Luyag. Marbled waterscape mosaic of fields - The Great River has witnessed birds, seeds, humans - stories before migration was a word. MARTIN: Lovely. I love that. BASS: Yeah, isn't that just beautiful. MARTIN: I love that. BASS: There's a whole sort of ecosystem within those 140 characters. MARTIN: Well, I'm going - you know I'm going to put you on the spot and ask if you would give us - share a poem with us. But before I do, do you have some advice for people who would kind of like to try it and might be a little intimidated by it? BASS: I think, again, you know, it's easier to cut away if you think of it as sort of, like, a big chunk of marble, and that's very intimidating. But you just start to cut away, cut away, cut away until you get something that emerges from that. So I would say write from your heart and focus on vibrancy of language and then distill down. MARTIN: Do you think about picking a - how do you pick a subject? I mean, do you think about just, like, what's on your mind, like what's bothering you or something you feel or happen to feel or something you want to get off your chest? BASS: Absolutely.

And when I say that, what comes to mind? Is it you helping grandma figure out how to Skype or is it the savvy grandma of all those TV commercials of late who tweet and blog about what's going on? Well, a new study by the Pew Research Center's Internet Project debunks some of the myths and gives us a glimpse into just how older adults are using technology in their lives. Aaron Smith is a senior researcher with the Pew Center's Internet and American Life Project. And he's with us now in Washington, D. C. Welcome. Thanks for joining us. AARON SMITH: Thank you for having me. MARTIN: So the first myth, I think, that a lot of people have - or impression that a lot of people have - is that older people just don't use technology, apart from the kinds of seniors we see highlighted on TV commercials, who are on Facebook or Twitter. But the study says that seniors' use of technology really depends on income. Could you tell us about that? SMITH: Absolutely. So we actually see a lot of diversity in the senior population when it comes to technology. On the one hand, you have some very tech-savvy folks. They go online. They do a lot of activities on there. And they really - they've internalized the technology in their lives and really value it for what it gives them. On the other end of that spectrum, you have some people who, I think, match up with a lot of our stereotypes. They're very disconnected from technology. They don't see the value in it. And they would need a lot of assistance to learn how to use it. MARTIN: So the critical factor here is not age. It's what? SMITH: It's a combination of age and socioeconomic factors. And what's very interesting is that those are a lot of the factors that we see a play in the broader population as a whole. So just like we talk about, in the broader population, digital divide issues centering around age and income and education, we very much see that in the senior population, as well. So those disconnected seniors tend to be older. So Internet usage and a lot of technology measures drop off pretty dramatically at about age 75. They tend to be higher income and they tend to have higher levels of education. And that's, in many ways, somewhat ironic because those folks that are disconnected from technology are in many cases the people who could benefit most from what it allows them to do. MARTIN: From the report, amongst seniors with an annual household income of $75,000 or more, 90 percent go online and 82 percent have broadband at home. I think that is surprising to some people - to find out that there is that level. It's nearly universal. SMITH: Absolutely. And both of those are significantly higher than we see in the population as a whole. So for certain seniors, they're as tech savvy, if not more tech savvy, than what we see in the broader population. MARTIN: For seniors earning less than $30,000 annually, 39 percent go online and 25 percent have broadband at home. SMITH: Absolutely. So when you look at the flip side of that, which is those folks with low levels of income, low levels of education, the older end of the older adult spectrum - and the fourth factor, that we haven't mentioned yet, is people with disabilities. A number of seniors - about a quarter of the senior population has a physical condition that makes reading challenging. And a similar number have a health condition or disability that makes it challenging for them to do certain physical activities. So that's another issue where in many cases, older adults just have physical limitations, in terms of what they can do with the technology. And we see very low levels of tech use among folks with those disabilities or health conditions, as well. MARTIN: The one idea, I think, that - impression that I think a lot of people have is that a motivator for seniors to use technology is to stay in touch with family. But is that true? I mean, is staying in touch the primary driver of staying connected to technology or is it other things? SMITH: It really falls into two categories. So first of all, it is exactly that, connections with family members and, more broadly, sources of social support. And that's very important for a population that, in many cases, struggles with, you know, physical mobility and social isolation. The second element that we see, in terms of benefits to older adults in particular, is just access to information. So when we talk to older adults who do use the Internet, overwhelmingly, they say that it helps them find information that they didn't have access to before. And that people who don't have Internet access are at a disadvantage because they're missing out on important sources of information. So certainly among the people who have sort of gotten over that adoption hump, we see that - both of those as very big factors driving that usage. MARTIN: One of the things that surprised me from the report is that more than half of Americans now have a smartphone, but among older adults, adoption level is just at 18 percent. So that's interesting. So the smartphone is the access to technology that, I think, most people have. In fact, a lot of very young people have them. Why do we think that is - that smartphone adoption lags? And while you're answering that, maybe you could tell me which technology seniors prefer. SMITH: So about three-quarters of seniors have cellphones, so it's not that they're necessarily leery of cellphones per se. But you're absolutely right that very few of them have a smartphone at this point. And part of that is just that older adults tend to be at the end of the adoption curve when it comes to picking up new technologies. But, you know, it also goes back to these very real sort of physical limitations that older adults have using technology. If you, you know - if you have trouble reading, it may be very difficult to read a three-inch smart phone screen. And so what we actually see is that more seniors have a tablet computer or an e-reader than have a smartphone, which is sort of the exact opposite of what we see in the population as a whole. So if you, you know - if you are someone who has trouble reading or maybe has trouble manipulating a small screen, that larger form factor can maybe overcome a lot of those challenges. MARTIN: It's interesting, because that's not how those are advertised, right? Have you noticed that they don't seem to generally advertise those as a benefit to older people? SMITH: Well, maybe we've just found them a new market here. MARTIN: We should find them a new market. Finally, how do minorities fit into this picture? I mean, one of the things we learned from Pew's previous studies is that minorities over-index in use of mobile devices - that they're more likely to have a mobile device than the rest of the population. Do we have any sense of how this plays out with the minority population? SMITH: You know, we don't necessarily see that with seniors yet. Seniors, by and large, once you control for things like education, income and age, you know, really sort of look the same whether they're black or white or male or female or urban or rural. Really those, you know, those sort of socioeconomic, age and sort of health and disability factors are what, in many cases, are really driving a lot of these adoption issues. MARTIN: Since you've been following this for a long time, do you mind if I ask - is there something that really stood out in this report for you? SMITH: The thing that stood out for me is just - it's a reminder of just how diverse all of these different populations are. So we grow very accustomed to thinking of seniors as this monolithic group of people who are, you know, in many cases, not very connected or not very tech-savvy. And so we kind of have, you know, a laugh at that in popular culture and so forth. MARTIN: I've even seen commercials that have played on that - the idea that, you know - that seniors need, you know, the kids to tell them what's what. And you're telling us what? SMITH: Absolutely. And what you really find is that there's a whole diversity of experiences within the population as a whole and with, you know, specifically seniors, as well. And, you know, it's worth bearing in mind that as we talk about all of these groups and their experiences, that we, you know - that we keep that diversity in mind, in terms of, you know, how we serve them, how we treat them and how we, you know, kind of interact with them in our day-to-day lives. MARTIN: Aaron Smith is a senior researcher with the Pew Center's Internet and American Life Project. He was kind enough to join us in our Washington, D. C. , studios.

If you bank or buy things online, if you use Yahoo or GMail, if you sign into work remotely using a virtual private network, your communications might not be safe. A flaw in a widely used encryption program called OpenSSL might be exposing much of the Net's encrypted traffic to eavesdropping. NPR's Steve Henn joins us now to explain how this flaw, which is known as the Heartbleed bug, was discovered and what it might mean for all of us. Steve, good morning. STEVE HENN, BYLINE: Good morning. GREENE: So let's start from the beginning here. This bug affects and encryption program called OpenSSL. What is that? HENN: Well, it stands for Secure Socket Layer, but I think most people would know it as the little padlock that appears on your web browser when you go to a secure site like your bank. GREENE: I'll actually see this if I'm logging onto my bank account or something. HENN: Right, yeah. SSL is one of the most widely used types of encryption on the Internet. As you said, it's used by Google and Gmail, Facebook, Internet commerce, sites like Amazon, and lots of banks. So the fact that this was vulnerable and appears to have vulnerable for years is pretty bad news. GREENE: Okay. So if I got onto one of these websites, I'll see this padlock. I'll know I'm going onto what I hope is a secure site, sounds like it might not be so secure anymore because of something called the Heartbleed bug. Tell us about that. HENN: Right. The Heartbleed bug. So computers and Web servers that are talking to each other using this protocol, OpenSSL, verify that they're still connected by using something called a heartbeat. It's basically a short message that really just says, hello, I'm still here. Are you still here? Researchers discovered that instead of responding with a, yeah, I'm here, they could force servers to actually send a big packet of information, sending back the short term memory on the server, and that information could include things the computer was processing at the time, like passwords, spreadsheets, credit card information and most disturbingly, even the private encryption keys for the site that were supposed to keep all of that information secure. GREENE: So if I'm using sites like this that are exposed, hackers  might be getting information from me. I mean who exactly could be using this bug to get stuff? HENN: The thing about a bug like this is until it's publically known, it's very valuable. People want to use it discreetly because it could open so many doors. What happened on Monday is that bloggers posted this vulnerability online and that really set off an arms race. It's not a very difficult hack to make once you know it's there. So right now, you know, basically hackers and security professionals on websites all over the Internet are engaged in a race where the professionals are trying to patch this bug, fix it, which also isn't very difficult to do, and hackers are trying to find sites that still haven't acted and exploit them. GREENE: Anything I, as a person who uses some of these websites, can do to protect myself? HENN: Well, you know, people have been joking about staying off the Internet and. . . GREENE: That's one option. HENN: Right. And, you know, I'm only kind of kidding. You know, yesterday when I first found out about this, I made a point of not logging into my bank account. I didn't know if my bank had been secured and I didn't want to send my password when I know that this vulnerability was widely known. And until a website you interact with that uses OpenSSL for encryption has been patched, honestly, there's not a lot you can do. But within the next few days, most well-run websites all over the world are going to fix this and then there is actually something you can do. Thursday or Friday it would make sense if you have a site that handles lots of sensitive information like your bank, it could be worth it to go ahead and update your passwords for those sites. GREENE: So once they fix this patch, updating my password I mean would protect me, if someone stole my password, I've got a new password then and they can't get in anymore. HENN: Right. I mean the danger is that this site got attacked and they captured your password sometime in the past and you don't know about it. So if you update your password and the site's fixed, you're probably good to go. And in the meantime, you could actually go to MORNING EDITION's Facebook page. We've posted a couple links that will help you identify whether or not the sites you use are vulnerable and whether or not they've been fixed. GREENE: All right. Helpful to know. NPR's Steve Henn, thanks a lot. HENN: Oh, my pleasure. DAVID GREENE, HOST:   And now here's some frightening news for people who spend a lot of time on the Internet. If you bank or buy things online, if you use Yahoo or GMail, if you sign into work remotely using a virtual private network, your communications might not be safe. A flaw in a widely used encryption program called OpenSSL might be exposing much of the Net's encrypted traffic to eavesdropping. NPR's Steve Henn joins us now to explain how this flaw, which is known as the Heartbleed bug, was discovered and what it might mean for all of us. Steve, good morning. STEVE HENN, BYLINE: Good morning. GREENE: So let's start from the beginning here. This bug affects and encryption program called OpenSSL. What is that? HENN: Well, it stands for Secure Socket Layer, but I think most people would know it as the little padlock that appears on your web browser when you go to a secure site like your bank. GREENE: I'll actually see this if I'm logging onto my bank account or something. HENN: Right, yeah. SSL is one of the most widely used types of encryption on the Internet. As you said, it's used by Google and Gmail, Facebook, Internet commerce, sites like Amazon, and lots of banks. So the fact that this was vulnerable and appears to have vulnerable for years is pretty bad news. GREENE: Okay. So if I got onto one of these websites, I'll see this padlock. I'll know I'm going onto what I hope is a secure site, sounds like it might not be so secure anymore because of something called the Heartbleed bug. Tell us about that. HENN: Right. The Heartbleed bug. So computers and Web servers that are talking to each other using this protocol, OpenSSL, verify that they're still connected by using something called a heartbeat. It's basically a short message that really just says, hello, I'm still here. Are you still here? Researchers discovered that instead of responding with a, yeah, I'm here, they could force servers to actually send a big packet of information, sending back the short term memory on the server, and that information could include things the computer was processing at the time, like passwords, spreadsheets, credit card information and most disturbingly, even the private encryption keys for the site that were supposed to keep all of that information secure. GREENE: So if I'm using sites like this that are exposed, hackers  might be getting information from me. I mean who exactly could be using this bug to get stuff? HENN: The thing about a bug like this is until it's publically known, it's very valuable. People want to use it discreetly because it could open so many doors. What happened on Monday is that bloggers posted this vulnerability online and that really set off an arms race. It's not a very difficult hack to make once you know it's there. So right now, you know, basically hackers and security professionals on websites all over the Internet are engaged in a race where the professionals are trying to patch this bug, fix it, which also isn't very difficult to do, and hackers are trying to find sites that still haven't acted and exploit them. GREENE: Anything I, as a person who uses some of these websites, can do to protect myself? HENN: Well, you know, people have been joking about staying off the Internet and. . . GREENE: That's one option. HENN: Right. And, you know, I'm only kind of kidding. You know, yesterday when I first found out about this, I made a point of not logging into my bank account. I didn't know if my bank had been secured and I didn't want to send my password when I know that this vulnerability was widely known. And until a website you interact with that uses OpenSSL for encryption has been patched, honestly, there's not a lot you can do. But within the next few days, most well-run websites all over the world are going to fix this and then there is actually something you can do. Thursday or Friday it would make sense if you have a site that handles lots of sensitive information like your bank, it could be worth it to go ahead and update your passwords for those sites. GREENE: So once they fix this patch, updating my password I mean would protect me, if someone stole my password, I've got a new password then and they can't get in anymore. HENN: Right. I mean the danger is that this site got attacked and they captured your password sometime in the past and you don't know about it. So if you update your password and the site's fixed, you're probably good to go. And in the meantime, you could actually go to MORNING EDITION's Facebook page. We've posted a couple links that will help you identify whether or not the sites you use are vulnerable and whether or not they've been fixed. GREENE: All right. Helpful to know.

So we want to tell you about a show that just might become your latest guilty pleasure. Take a group of accomplished young women, all friends, making their way through young adulthood, throw in fabulous clothes, great-looking hair, mix in the twists and turns of dating life and put it on a game-changing platform, and what do you have? \"Sex and the City\"? No. It's \"An African City. \"(SOUNDBITE OF WEB SERIES, \"AN AFRICAN CITY\")NANA MENSAH: (As Sade) Welcome home. The African continent finally has you back and just in time for the holidays. ESOSA E: (As Ngozi) How was your flight? MAAME YAA BOAFO: (As Nana Yaa) It was good. The flight was good. MARIE HUMBERT: (As Makena) And how does it feel to be back? BOAFO: (As Nana Yaa) It is exciting, and it is scary at the same time. It's scary 'cause I don't know how I'm going to survive without Starbucks coffee. But I'm all smiles for now. EOSA E: (As Ngozi) Well, instead of Starbucks coffee, on every corner you'll find plenty of fried plantain. MARTIN: That's a clip from the new web-based series \"An African City. \" It follows a young woman, Nana Yaa, who's just returned to Ghana, and her four friends. And by telling hard truths and hilarious stories about life in Ghana now, it's winning fans from Atlanta to Accra. We wanted to learn more, so we have called executive producer Millie Monyo. Also with us is actress Nana Mensah who plays Sade, a Ghanaian-Nigerian who's just moved back to Ghana from abroad. Welcome to you both. Congratulations. MILLIE MONYO: Hello. MENSAH: Thank you. MONYO: Hi. MARTIN: So, Millie, I'll start with you. The \"Sex and the City\" comparison has got to be made, just in terms of women getting together, telling their business, telling some real deal, even if people don't want to hear it and fabulous clothes. So was that show an inspiration? MONYO: It was absolutely an inspiration, and honestly we welcome the \"Sex and the City\" comparisons. So I know that Nicole Amarteifio, the co-creator of the show, was inspired by \"Sex and the City\" heavily. These are the stories of these women who are dynamic, running around New York City. And why can't we have that in Africa? Why can't we have that on our continent? Why can't we have that in Ghana and Accra? That's why she sat down and started writing, and she just knew that we could tell our story in this way. MARTIN: So let me just play a clip from one of the opening scenes that shows one of the characters arriving at the airport. She's going home. (SOUNDBITE OF WEB SERIES, \"AN AFRICAN CITY\")BOAFO: (As Nana Yaa) Hello? UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As Unidentified Character) Madam, the line for the non-Ghanaians is on the other side. BOAFO: (As Nana Yaa) Yeah, I know. I'm Ghanaian. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As Unidentified Character) You are Ghanaian? You don't look or sound like Ghanaian. MARTIN: Ouch. MENSAH: Yeah. MONYO: Sting. MARTIN: Sting. So tell us about the idea of focusing on the born-here, live-there, back and forth generation, if you want to call it that. MONYO: Well, we definitely wanted to tell the story of the returnee. We wanted to stay true to form. Nicole is a returnee. I am a returnee. Most of our cast are returnees. And we felt that there was a story that was there where you feel at home in America, but when you come back to Africa - which is your home continent - you have people who look at you and say, well, you're not African enough. And we weren't really sure how to respond to something like that. That has happened to all of us, where we show up, and we try to speak our language. And they're looking at us like, you akata, which is I guess a slang word for someone who is African, however you were raised in the West. And you may not necessarily know how to navigate life in Ghana anymore. MARTIN: So, Nana, tell us a little bit about your character. MENSAH: My character is Sade. She is Ghanaian and Nigerian, which is great. It's a great set up. I don't even know if Nicole did it on purpose because Ghana and Nigeria have such a rivalry, like a big sister, little sister kind of thing. So it's really funny to see it embodied in one character. So she kind of has this Ghanaian thing and Nigerian thing. She graduated from Harvard Business School, and she's now returned to work for a pharmaceutical company in Accra. So she's, you know, highly educated, very ambitious. And she set her sights on Accra and the men of Accra to succeed by any means necessary. MARTIN: One of the things that struck me about it is that it tells, you know, some real stories about how women are getting along. I mean, the women are very upfront about some of their various strategies for success, you know, as it were, or kind of just trying to navigate their lives, I mean, getting an apartment when apartments are priced in a crazy fashion. Like, a person just on a regular salary couldn't possibly afford one. So how does that happen? Now, Nana, your character, Sade, is very kind of open about her relationships with married men. MENSAH: She is. MARTIN: Well, what's her deal? Tell a little bit about her deal. What's her point of view on all of this? MENSAH: Sade and men - where to begin? It must be known that she is the daughter of the most prominent Nigerian pastor in Lagos. So that - just put that the back of your mind as things develop this season and in subsequent seasons. So that's the one thing. She comes from a very religious background and has rebelled against it. And, you know, like I said, she's highly intellectual, very well-educated and very capable of achieving things by her own means. But it's not as much fun to pay for it when you can get somebody else to pay for it, I think is how Sade feels. And so she does - you know, her apartment, her Mercedes, her this, her that, you know, she does kind of have a - you should buy it for me, why buy it for myself? MARTIN: But this is not free. And. . . MENSAH: Sure. MARTIN: I just want to play another clip if it's OK. I just - you know, spoiler alert. But you were telling us that one of your favorite scenes is one where she shows some vulnerability after she runs into her sugar daddy. MONYO: Of course. MARTIN: Here's a clip. (SOUNDBITE OF WEB SERIES, \"AN AFRICAN CITY\")BOAFO: (As Nana Yaa) Who was that man at the salon? MENSAH: (As Sade) It was him. It's the guy that bought my new apartment, my new home. BOAFO: (As Nana Yaa) And who was that woman? MENSAH: (As Sade) I don't know. BOAFO: (As Nana Yaa) Are you OK? MENSAH: (As Sade) Yeah. At the end of the day, I got my apartment, right? You know, it's wonderful until it's not. It's wonderful until you run into them in public, and you're hit in the face with the truth that you've been avoiding all along. That you're one of many when you should be somebody's one and only. MENSAH: Womp, womp (ph). MONYO: Sade. (LAUGHTER)MARTIN: Well, you know, what about it? I mean. . . MENSAH: What about it? MARTIN: . . . Is this the life that a lot of people are living? MENSAH: You know. . . MONYO: Definitely. Definitely. And that's something that we actually saw firsthand, Nicole and I, being returnees and coming back to Ghana. We meet men, numerous men, married men who would be out in public with their wives, however, when they would see us out in other avenues, would approach us and say, you know, let's go out. Let's go out to eat. Let's do things. And it's kind of like, well, are we supposed to be the nonpublic wife. . . MENSAH: Yeah. MONYO: . . . In the background. . . MENSAH: Yeah. MONYO: . . . Just kind of playing a role, and you just want to give me things, and I'm just supposed to take them? And that's not what anyone's looking for. MARTIN: Well, you know, Millie, one of the things about the show that's really interesting that - I'll just be frank with you - I don't think \"Sex and the City\" did all too well is explaining the power dynamics that come with money. . . MENSAH: Sure. MARTIN: . . . And what role money plays. I mean, one of the points that, I think, critics of \"Sex and the City\" always made is that, you know, a freelance writer for, like, a weekly newspaper could not afford her life. MENSAH: Those shoes. MONYO: Of course. MARTIN: So she could not afford her life in the real world. . . MONYO: Exactly. Exactly. MARTIN: . . . And that somebody had to be paying for that. So who was that somebody? MONYO: Exactly. MARTIN: And so this show is very explicit about those things. And I'm just interested in that as kind of an artistic choice, Millie, you know, like, just laying it out there - look, this is how things are right now. MONYO: I think it needs to be put out there. You need to know that it's a struggle out there for women alike. You know, how are they paying for these expensive apartments? How are they dressing in the latest fashion? Who's buying it for them? I mean, you see a scene where actually Sade convinces Nana Yaa to get a sugar daddy. And finally by the end of the episode, she decides that she's going to go to Ghana Home Loans and, you know, take out a loan and get her apartment on her own because she realizes that she wants to do this for herself. MARTIN: So what reaction are you all getting to the series? What are folks saying about it? MENSAH: I think a lot of people have a hard time with the explicit nature of the transactional behavior between men and women. I think that is stirring the pot a little bit. And so I'm interested in some of the pushback from that because I don't think that anything that we're depicting isn't true. That's been interesting. MARTIN: Like - so? How so? I mean, are people basically saying you all are making it up or that you're being trashy? Or what is it that people are saying? MENSAH: Well, Millie pays attention to the comments a bit more than I do. So. . . MARTIN: Millie. MENSAH: . . . I'll let her take that one. MARTIN: MillieMONYO: Well, I think that some people may think that it's a bit taboo to actually put it out there. Even though it's happening every day on a day to day basis, they don't want to see it. However, I would say that most of our feedback has been enormously positive. There's tons of people who are telling us that, you know, we're showing a different view of Africa that for some people, they say they didn't even know existed. MENSAH: That's true. MONYO: They didn't realize that there's people in Africa spending money. . . MENSAH: A lot. MONYO: . . . Or who have money, you know, or have the means to do these kind of things. They're not realizing that there's places to eat out. There's places to go and entertain yourself. And, I mean, they just didn't even realize that. MARTIN: And fabulous clothes. MONYO: And fabulous clothes. MENSAH: And fabulous clothes. MARTIN: Lots of fabulous clothes. MONYO: Exactly. They - you know, people have no idea that this actually exists on the continent, and that's what we really want to show. So we've been getting a tremendously positive response from a lot of our female viewers. MARTIN: Can you give us some hints about season two? MENSAH: I would say that we're definitely going in deeper. One of the criticisms that I've heard is that they feel like they don't know the girls very well yet. And I think that subsequent seasons are going to aim to fix that. MONYO: Exactly. MENSAH: . . . To really create a bond between the audience and the individual characters. MONYO: Exactly. I think it takes time to grow. MARTIN: All right. Well, we'll be waiting. We will be waiting to see. Millie Monyo is the executive producer of the web series \"An African City. \" Actress Nana Mensah plays Sade on the show. They were kind enough to join us from our bureau in New York City.

And I'm worried this means we're going to need to have different passwords for every single site. To help guide us through this, we're joined by our colleague Steve Henn from Silicon Valley. Good morning, Steve. STEVE HENN, BYLINE: Good morning. GREENE: So is the upshot here that I have to start thinking and remembering all these alphanumeric combinations and be setting up different passwords for everything? HENN: Well, you know, the honest truth is that you probably won't. And most people listening probably aren't going to go and reset all of their passwords. And lots of us don't make different passwords for all of our sites. And there's actually a school of thought among some security professionals that that's OK because we're not handling launch codes. GREENE: That's a good thing. It's a really good thing. (LAUGHTER)HENN: Right. And, you know, Google and your bank are good at identifying weird, possibly fraudulent behavior. So if you log in from a strange city you might get asked a few other questions. And they sort of bake that into the cost of doing business. GREENE: But clearly I don't want to have the same password for dozens of sites and I have trouble remembering them all the time. Are there other options out there for security other than passwords? HENN: Well, yeah. I mean, it's pretty obvious this system doesn't work well for consumers. So there are lots of people working on it. And the ideas range from sort of the mundane to the kind of bat nut crazy. I mean, you've probably seen sites that offer to be your password manager and, you know, you give them all your passwords and then you have one password for that site and they sign you in. Some security people I've talked to who are a little uneasy about that because they say you're putting all your eggs in one basket and if that place gets hacked you're out of luck. GREENE: Someone has all your passwords. HENN: Right. Yeah. And the crazier ideas I seen; Google is messing around with a pill you'd actually swallow. GREENE: Oh. HENN: That would send out a little unique identifier to your phone or computer letting it know it was really you. That's, you know, kind of gross. And I have questions about whether or not someone could steal your pills. But there are some thing that have to do with biometric information that are really intriguing. GREENE: Biometrics meaning things like using my body. I mean, a fingerprint on mobile devices. HENN: Right. Yeah. So you've probably tried the fingerprint scan on the iPhone 5S, and sometimes that stuff doesn't work and that's one of the problems with biometrics. Your face isn't always going to look the same. The sample of your fingerprint always isn't going to be the same. The other thing is if someone steals a biometric code - it's not like you can change your fingerprint. So you're sort of out of luck. So one of the technologies I find really intriguing is voice biometrics because it's dynamic. A computer can recognize whether or not your voice is the voice it's hearing, but they could also ask you to say different things. GREENE: Well, how does that work? HENN: Well, I have some tape. I visited Doug Sharp. He's the head of research at Nuance, which does voice recognition. And he showed me an app that he could train in about 30 seconds to recognize his own voice. COMPUTER: Please say your pass phrase. DOUG SHARP: My voice is my password. COMPUTER: Welcome back, Doug. HENN: All right. Now let's see if I can imitate your voice. COMPUTER: Please say your pass phrase. HENN: My voice is my password. So I was trying to trick it by mimicking his voice. COMPUTER: Can you say you pass phrase a little slower? HENN: I kept trying but I could never get in. GREENE: Which is a good thing. It means this thing was working. HENN: Right. And then we tried training it to my voice and Sharp couldn't get in. And Sharp actually says this app can actually even recognize when it's listening to a recording. GREENE: Oh, wow. HENN: And the thing that makes it really intriguing to me is that you don't have to say a specific phrase. So there's a bank in Great Britain that's actually been using this technology on its customer service lines. So if you were to call that bank and say you forgot your pin number, the customer service rep would just chat you up and a light on his or her screen would go from red to yellow to green as the computer verified that it was actually you on the other end of the line. GREENE: What if I have laryngitis or I'm just really tired? HENN: Right. Well, that's the problem with any of these kinds of biometrics and unfortunately, it's going to need a backup in that situation. And right now the most common backup is still going to be a password or a pin number. GREENE: All right. Steve Henn is NPR's technology correspondent. Thanks, Steve. HENN: My pleasure. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  In the tech world, headlines all week have been screaming about bleeding hearts because a bug called Heart Bleed has punched a hole in one of the most popular encryption programs online.

But even the professionals are having a hard time with this one. Google Maps, the highest profile map maker in the world today, took nearly a month to decide what to do with the changing border in Crimea. On Thursday the company finally updated its maps to reflect a new reality, or should I say several new realities? I asked John Gravois of Pacific Standard magazine to explain what users can expect to see. JOHN GRAVOIS: Well, it depends on where you are, or what version of Google Maps you're looking at. VIGELAND: What do you mean? GRAVOIS: If you're here in the U. S. and you look at Google Maps you will see a dotted line separating Crimea from the rest of Ukraine, which is how Google represents a disputed border. If you're in Russia, though, you'll see what Vladimir Putin wants you to see. You'll see a solid line dividing Ukraine from Crimea and no line between Crimea and Russia. So the map in Russia shows Crimea as part of Russia, the map here shows it as a disputed territory. VIGELAND: And what about in Ukraine? GRAVOIS: In Ukraine I think it shows it as still part of Ukraine. VIGELAND: So Google basically recognizes where the map request is coming from and then specifies which map it's going to return based on that? GRAVOIS: You know, when people say what does Google Maps say about a geographical conflict, it's really important to say which Google Maps are you talking about because Google maintains different versions of their mapping platform in different countries. The last time I counted there were over 30. That's partly because those mapping platforms are run out of servers that are located in countries that have their own laws about how the world needs to be represented politically. In China, there's a territory that India and China both claim. In China, that territory called Arunachal Pradesh looks like part of China because Chinese law says it is. And Google has servers in China that have to obey Chinese law. VIGELAND: What does Google say about this? GRAVOIS: Google says a lot of things about their approach to map making that are frustrating and challenging for people who are used to a sort of traditional notion of maps as a single authoritative view of the world, you know. VIGELAND: Right. GRAVOIS: Historically, the most powerful map maker in the world was often the most powerful country in the world. It was the British Empire. And the map maker would come in and kind of settle disputes by saying, the name of that lake is X, what you people on the eastern shore of the lake call it. And so sorry, you people on the western shore of the lake. Google doesn't have to settle those disputes because they can just represent way more information than a traditional paper map. Google can take something like the Persian Gulf/Arabian Gulf. The Arab countries on one side of that gulf like to call it the Arabian Gulf. Iran has, for thousands of years, called it the Persian Gulf. And historically, most map makers have called it the Persian Gulf. But Google represents both names. And in the process infuriates Iranians. VIGELAND: Well, it might be hard to believe but I know there are still some other map makers around. I mean, Rand McNally springs to mind. What are those others doing? GRAVOIS: It's been interesting. There's a big spread of the way that people have responded to this. National Geographic has done sort of a version of what Google's done and they did it quicker. They decided that they were going to show Crimea as a special case, as a sort of disputed territory. So they note the border but they shade Crimea differently from the rest of Russia or Ukraine. Rand McNally though, they say they take their cues from the State Department. And, you know, the U.

I'm Tess Vigeland. The Internet found itself in the emergency room with cardiac arrest this week. As you've likely heard by now, something called the heartbleed security flaw threatened to wield a scalpel against our most sensitive online information. Software that was supposed to protect our internet activity turned out to have a giant hole in it, potentially allowing attackers to access email, bank accounts, user names and passwords. Google researchers and a security firm based in Finland reported the flaw earlier this week. Jordan Robertson, a reporter for Bloomberg Businessweek says, even though Heartbleed has been around for at least two years, a software patch to fix the problem was only released a few days ago. JORDAN ROBERTSON: It's a very serious bug, a really big find. It's the kind of thing that we only see come along once every couple of years and it sends everybody scrambling to upgrade their Web servers, fix their email clients. Just all manner of technical upgrades needed to be done because of this. VIGELAND: When you say it's a really serious bug that we only see every few years, what makes it serious? ROBERTSON: Lots and lots of bugs come out every year, thousands and thousands of bugs. What makes this one particularly malicious is the fact that it deals with an encryption standard that's used by two-thirds of all Internet sites, active Internet sites. And what it does is it allows an attacker who knows about it to spy and eavesdrop on conversations that are going over this encryption protocol. So anytime you see that padlock in the address bar of your Internet browser, that's basically what this communication protocol indicates. And so you can see a padlock. You can think your communications are secure but the problem is there's a flaw in that protocol. Fortunately, the flaw was announced at the same time as the patch was released so the researchers handled it responsibly, as they were supposed to. VIGELAND: This encryption software that you're talking about is what's called open source. And that means that the source code is pretty much available for anyone to see. What, if anything, does that add to the picture here? Was it - did it make it more difficult or was it, I don't know, was it an advantage at all when dealing with this flaw? ROBERTSON: It's an interesting question because you would assume that with open source software, because the code is available to the public that that would give hackers an advantage in finding vulnerabilities to exploit. You'd think it's a competitive advantage to keep that secret. But actually the reverse is true. It's actually an advantage for security researchers because you can have all kinds of researchers like the ones who found this bug tinkering away at research projects kind of in their spare time and finding holes in it. So it's actually a significant advantage to have open source software. VIGELAND: Jordan, when these sorts of vulnerabilities are found, I kind of imagine this race between hackers and developers frantically trying to fix it. Is that an accurate vision? ROBERTSON: There is this race between hackers who use that information to try to exploit the bug. They see this as, here's a patch that not everybody's going to put on immediately, and security professionals who are frantically scrambling to update their systems and their Web servers. And this process moved very quickly this week. VIGELAND: All right. Well, when the story broke we all heard advice to change our passwords. And then we heard wait for your bank, your email provider, everybody else to apply the patch and then change your passwords. Should we all do that today, tomorrow? What's the public service announcement here? ROBERTSON: You're pretty safe if you want to change your passwords at this point. There are some online tools that will allow you to check website to see if they're vulnerable. I should also mention as well, large banks in general were not affected by this. They use different technologies generally. But if you're using Google, if you're using Yahoo, if you're using eBay, it's fine to go in and change your username, your password and other personal details. At this point, if you're a large company and you haven't upgraded, I mean, those are going to be few and far between. VIGELAND: OK. So then of course the challenge is making sure that you remember your new password. ROBERTSON: That's right. VIGELAND: That's a whole other thing altogether.

Days later came a report from Bloomberg News that the National Security Agency knew about the bug for at least two years, but the NSA denied having knowledge of the Heartbleed bug or exploiting it for their own spying purposes. Now, the NSA does have an arsenal of software holes and vulnerabilities that it uses to hack computers and gain intelligence. In response to the Bloomberg story, the White House clarified new guidance on how and when U. S. intelligence agencies can take advantage of such flaws and when they must disclose them to software manufacturers and the public. Here to talk more about this is Michael Riley. He's a cybersecurity reporter for Bloomberg News and Bloomberg Businessweek. Welcome to the studio, Michael. MICHAEL RILEY: Thank you. BLOCK: So help us understand just what kind of flaws we're talking about. Describe them. RILEY: So, basically what happens is hackers use - a central part of hacking as you take unknown flaws - in some cases, known flaws - in computer software, and it allows you basically to break the machine in ways that it doesn't expect. That can give them control over a computer, over really anything that works with the help of a computer chip. But it's a very valuable thing to find something that isn't known to the manufacturer of the software and that can be exploited without anybody else knowing what's going on. BLOCK: So what's the value of these flaws to the intelligence community? What's known about how they use them? RILEY: Essentially, it's at the heart of both cyberspying, which the NSA does a lot of and is essential to its mission, as well as what we're moving towards, which is cyberwarfare. These flaws basically are central to allow NSA hackers to break into computers of very high intelligence value. The leadership of Russia, for example, the leadership of Pakistan, they can break into computers of nuclear smugglers. They can break into computers of terrorists. But to do it really stealthily and very carefully these zero days, as they're called, are really at the heart of everything. BLOCK: And you call this a zero-day flaw. What exactly does that mean? RILEY: It's a hacker term. It refers to there have been zero days since the attack that the flaw was used in and its disclosure. Simply it means that this is a flaw that nobody, including the manufacturer of the software, was aware of. BLOCK: So what does the White House directive say about how the NSA and other intelligence agencies actually use these so-called zero day flaws? RILEY: Essentially, the White House is building off of a recommendation that comes from a presidential panel that looked at what the NSA does and how it works after the Snowden leaks. The recommendation suggested that those zero day flaws, the stockpile that already exists and new flaws that are developed be used only for a very brief period if at all, and then disclosed so that they can help improve the computer security of everyone. Because, essentially, these are holes that not only the NSA could use, but other hackers could use, other intelligence agencies and other criminals. BLOCK: What was the response from the tech community? I mean, is this actually seen as a fundamental change? RILEY: You know, it's - there's one big loophole in this new guidance. Basically, they've handed the problem back to the NSA and said, all right, we want you to try and bias this process towards disclosure. In other words, rather than keep a hoard of these stockpiles, you should look at them all and decide to disclose most, if you can. The one exception is don't disclose flaws if they're really important for national security purposes or law enforcement purposes. It's going to be a very difficult thing to unpack because basically any of the flaws that the NSA's elite cyber units have could essentially be justified for national security purposes. What they do is hack into computers to steal intelligence that's really important to the U. S. , but they use this tool kit, so to speak, of flaws and they're all kind of interconnected. It's not clear sort of how the process is going to resort from here but essentially they've given this problem to the new director of NSA, Admiral Mike Rogers. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: And so, what's been the response within the intelligence community? You reported that they're saying there's going to be some challenges in complying with this new guidance. RILEY: Absolutely. I mean, this has a created a good deal of debate. Although it wasn't the most widely known of the panel recommendations, it was the most controversial within the intelligence community, or one of them certainly. And that's because these zero days are so at the heart of what they do. I've talked to people in the intelligence community who talk about this as a sort of unilateral disarmament. Because even if we stopped using these laws or disclose the ones we found, other countries that do this - China, Russia, Israel, France - are not going to do this. And it will really change the way that this intelligence is gathered and make it slower, more detectable, less efficient. All sorts of problems that if you're an agency like the NSA and your job is to get this intelligence, you're really not very happy about. CORNISH: Michael Riley, he's the cybersecurity reporter for Bloomberg News and Bloomberg Businessweek. Thanks so much for coming to speak with us. RILEY: You bet. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:  News of the critical security bug Heartbleed sent people scurrying to change their online passwords last week. Days later came a report from Bloomberg News that the National Security Agency knew about the bug for at least two years, but the NSA denied having knowledge of the Heartbleed bug or exploiting it for their own spying purposes. Now, the NSA does have an arsenal of software holes and vulnerabilities that it uses to hack computers and gain intelligence. In response to the Bloomberg story, the White House clarified new guidance on how and when U. S. intelligence agencies can take advantage of such flaws and when they must disclose them to software manufacturers and the public. Here to talk more about this is Michael Riley. He's a cybersecurity reporter for Bloomberg News and Bloomberg Businessweek. Welcome to the studio, Michael. MICHAEL RILEY: Thank you. BLOCK: So help us understand just what kind of flaws we're talking about. Describe them. RILEY: So, basically what happens is hackers use - a central part of hacking as you take unknown flaws - in some cases, known flaws - in computer software, and it allows you basically to break the machine in ways that it doesn't expect. That can give them control over a computer, over really anything that works with the help of a computer chip. But it's a very valuable thing to find something that isn't known to the manufacturer of the software and that can be exploited without anybody else knowing what's going on. BLOCK: So what's the value of these flaws to the intelligence community? What's known about how they use them? RILEY: Essentially, it's at the heart of both cyberspying, which the NSA does a lot of and is essential to its mission, as well as what we're moving towards, which is cyberwarfare. These flaws basically are central to allow NSA hackers to break into computers of very high intelligence value. The leadership of Russia, for example, the leadership of Pakistan, they can break into computers of nuclear smugglers. They can break into computers of terrorists. But to do it really stealthily and very carefully these zero days, as they're called, are really at the heart of everything. BLOCK: And you call this a zero-day flaw. What exactly does that mean? RILEY: It's a hacker term. It refers to there have been zero days since the attack that the flaw was used in and its disclosure. Simply it means that this is a flaw that nobody, including the manufacturer of the software, was aware of. BLOCK: So what does the White House directive say about how the NSA and other intelligence agencies actually use these so-called zero day flaws? RILEY: Essentially, the White House is building off of a recommendation that comes from a presidential panel that looked at what the NSA does and how it works after the Snowden leaks. The recommendation suggested that those zero day flaws, the stockpile that already exists and new flaws that are developed be used only for a very brief period if at all, and then disclosed so that they can help improve the computer security of everyone. Because, essentially, these are holes that not only the NSA could use, but other hackers could use, other intelligence agencies and other criminals. BLOCK: What was the response from the tech community? I mean, is this actually seen as a fundamental change? RILEY: You know, it's - there's one big loophole in this new guidance. Basically, they've handed the problem back to the NSA and said, all right, we want you to try and bias this process towards disclosure. In other words, rather than keep a hoard of these stockpiles, you should look at them all and decide to disclose most, if you can. The one exception is don't disclose flaws if they're really important for national security purposes or law enforcement purposes. It's going to be a very difficult thing to unpack because basically any of the flaws that the NSA's elite cyber units have could essentially be justified for national security purposes. What they do is hack into computers to steal intelligence that's really important to the U. S. , but they use this tool kit, so to speak, of flaws and they're all kind of interconnected. It's not clear sort of how the process is going to resort from here but essentially they've given this problem to the new director of NSA, Admiral Mike Rogers. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  And so, what's been the response within the intelligence community? You reported that they're saying there's going to be some challenges in complying with this new guidance. RILEY: Absolutely. I mean, this has a created a good deal of debate.

Michel Martin is away. They say it takes a village to raise a child, but maybe you just need a few moms and dads in your corner. Each week, we check in with a diverse group of parents for their common sense and savvy advice. And if you've seen your teenager with their head buried in a phone lately, you may have stopped to wonder, from time to time, what exactly your kid was doing - maybe texting about homework, you hope. Maybe it's about the next school party or dance. Most parents really hope it's not explicit photos or messages. It might surprise you to learn, though, that some parents and researchers are kind of coming around on the idea of sexting. They see it as a normal part of a teenager's sexual development. Here to talk more about this is Rey Junco. He's a fellow at the Harvard University's Berkman Center for Internet & Society where he researches social media, also a dad of two. And Fernando Espuelas is host of his own program on Univision America and dad of two. Stephanie Silverman is the publisher of Your Teen Magazine. She's also a mother of three, including two teenagers. And Leslie Morgan Steiner author, mom of three and one of our regular parenting contributors. Welcome, all. REY JUNCO: Thank you. MORGAN STEINER: A pleasure to be here. STEPHANIE SILVERMAN: Thank you. FERNANADO ESPUELAS: Thank you. HEADLEE: Rey, let me begin with you because you've been writing about this. And you are one of the people who kind of think this might be a normal expression of teenage sexuality. I want to be clear, though, when you say that, you're talking about people over the age of 18, right? JUNCO: Well, I am talking about over the age of 18, but I'm also talking about teenagers as well. I think that's one of the issues we have in our society, that we're so reticent to acknowledge the sexual development of our teenagers, of our young people. HEADLEE: Although, I think that when a parent finds especially a very graphic text that one of their kids may have sent, that raises some eyebrows. It causes concern. JUNCO: Sure. What kind of concerns are you talking about? HEADLEE: Well, I mean, I think that most parents are worried - depending on the text - and we're going to be clear that this is radio. We're not going to explain - but some of them are quite graphic in terms of sexual content. And oftentimes, parents worry that that means that the kid is perhaps becoming too mature too fast or getting sexually active in a way that is not healthy. How do you advise parents to deal with, perhaps, a very shocking text or picture? JUNCO: OK. Well, what you said certainly is not the case because the proportion of American adolescents who are sexually active has actually decreased over the last few decades. There's an increased use in contraceptives by adolescents over the last few decades, and adolescent pregnancies have also declined over the past two decades. So in terms of sexual behavior and, you know, things that we, you know, kind of worry about - if they're being sexually active, contraceptive use and pregnancy - that really is not as much of a concern. Also research shows that sexting has no relationship to engaging in riskier sexual behavior, like unprotected sex. So I think then the concern becomes just one issue, which is what we know - the one thing we know that sexting is related to, and that is engaging in sexual activity. And so to me, instead of it being a major concern for parents, it's a way that parents can actually begin a conversation with their teens about sexuality. HEADLEE: Leslie, I want to know what the difference is, for you at least and with your kids, between a text - just words - and either photos or videos. Is there a difference? STEINER: Yes. The issue for me is that sending photos of naked body parts, whether they're yours or somebody else's, via your cell phone - for all of my kids 'cause they're all under age 18 - is illegal. And, you know, state-by-state regulations vary, but it could be considered child pornography. And then if they sell it to somebody else, which has happened at schools in our area - you know, they've charged to look at this naked picture - then you get into really murky territory. So I've been really clear with my kids that they cannot ever send pictures like that of themselves or anybody else. They can't pass it along. And also the issue for me, too, is not so much that this is an indication that they're becoming sexually interested and active. I'm fine with that. I just don't want them to do anything that's illegal, or I don't want them to harass other kids. Like, what I worry a lot about is, is the person on the receiving end of this welcoming it? If it's mutual and consensual, then I'm comfortable with it. But I worry that one of my kids might receive something that they didn't want to receive, or they might send something that made another child feel really uncomfortable. And that's where I get really worried about my kids and other kids. HEADLEE: Fernando, let me go to you because you have two sons. ESPUELAS: Right. HEADLEE: The oldest is 14. Oftentimes, a lot of this talk about, you know, dealing with sexting focuses on girls, especially in terms of taking photos or videos. But in fact, research shows that boys are much more likely to share those photos with their friends than others. What do you tell your sons about this kind of thing? ESPUELAS: Well, I think, like Leslie, we've explained the legality issues and tried to take it away from any kind of moralistic message about what you should do or not do and rather just put in the most frightening way possible, that you will end up in the pokey if this happens. But we also have taken a very proactive approach to explaining to him the consequences of - exactly as Leslie was saying - what happens when someone receives something they don't want or - including yourself. But we've also given him freedom. We realize we could not be spies. And so his phone has a lock on it, which he put on. We stopped - he's in school - we stopped going through his email. And in fact, he got off Facebook on his own because we think he was being harassed by a pair of girls actually. We don't. . . HEADLEE: That's why my son got off Facebook. ESPUELAS: Yeah. HEADLEE: He had enough of those girls. ESPUELAS: Yeah, so, I mean, we talk all the time. I had the most awkward conversation I've ever had in the world because he just had, about six months ago, his first girlfriend. I didn't catch them. I happened to see them making out in the living room, which of course was the most terrifying thing I've ever seen in my life. And afterwards, my wife gave me, on a Post-it note, five things I had to say to him about, you know, you're too young, I will buy you condoms, however. And we just looked at each other completely scared out of our minds. And then he said, is that it? I said, yeah, that's it. Any questions? No. OK. And so I left. And so, you know. . . HEADLEE: Shortest conversation ever. ESPUELAS: Ever. Ever. But very clear. I had the points from the mom. HEADLEE: Yeah, right, you had the Post-it. Well, Stephanie, you published Your Teen Magazine. What kind of concerns - maybe you are a better person to answer Rey's question, in what are the concerns that parents have about sexting? SILVERMAN: Well - and I think that Leslie said it. You know, it is illegal under the age of 18. So you've got that to contend with. And I think a softer consequence, for lack of a better word, is just even reputation. And what does that mean? And I think, you know, these conversations have to be had at an earlier time with these kids. Hopefully, you've had a conversation - if you do discover that photo on your kid's phone, you know, whether they've sent or received it, that you've already been having those conversations. And I think it's not too early to have those conversations in the preteen years. Even when they're 8, 9, 10, you're starting talking about their body and body changes. And so this is all just gearing up, I guess, eventually to a Post-it filled with five things you have to say to them. But that's what you're leading toward. And it's not so much - these kids can make mistakes. There 's no question, and we all made mistakes. The problem is that was we were able to make mistakes privately, and they can make the mistakes much more publicly. HEADLEE: There's the rub. And if you're just joining us, our parenting panel is talking about sexting. You just heard Stephanie Silverman of Your Teen Magazine, also joined by writer Leslie Morgan Steiner, radio host Fernando Espuelas and social media expert Rey Junco. Rey, let's talk about these privacy concerns. If we accept that sexting is now kind of a normal part of teenage and then on to young adult sexual development, where does the law kind of enter into that? JUNCO: OK. Well, I think we're talking about two issues. We're talking about legal, and we're talking about social. And the law is - it's not as dreadful as we've been discussing so far. There - certainly, sexting could fall under child pornography laws. There are very rare instances when that has happened, and there is quite a bit of backlash against prosecutors who try to prosecute minors under child pornography laws for sexting. Seventeen states actually have created legislation that either decriminalizes sexting or makes it a misdemeanor. So that - you know, that's something to keep in mind that, you know, your kids are probably not going to go to jail. I just, you know. . . HEADLEE: You hear that, Fernando. They're not going to the pokey. (LAUGHTER)ESPUELAS: He doesn't know that. JUNCO: They're not going to jail. And, Fernando, I'm happy to review any Post-it notes if you need some help. (LAUGHTER)HEADLEE: There's a business opportunity here. Many people might want your wife's Post-it notes. ESPUELAS: Oh, it was good. JUNCO: Seriously, yeah. You could see that at the bookstore, you know, Post-it notes. HEADLEE: OK, So, Leslie, you're pretty pragmatic - I mean, you all seem to be fairly pragmatic. What happens - what's your advice to a parent who look at their kid's phone and sees a graphic sext either from or to their kid. STEINER: Well, I think, you know, take a deep breath and think about the issues before you go running after the kid. But definitely don't bury your head in the sand. It's actually a great opportunity to talk to your child. And I would say, don't apologize for being a spy. I am my kids' spy. I look through their stuff. I look through their Facebook posts. It's part of my responsibilities as a parent. And talk to them openly about it, and tell them why you're concerned. And again, it's - as I said earlier, my biggest concern is that my kids, you know - I want them to be able to stand up for themselves if they're getting sexually oriented messages that they don't want. And I do not want them inflicting that on anybody else. But I also want them to feel really good about their sexuality, and I think that that's another important part of parenting. HEADLEE: So this actually happened to you, Stephanie, as I understand, this kind of situation in which you found something on your kid's phone. What happened? SILVERMAN: Yeah, so - and it goes back - he was in - seventh or eighth? I think he was in seventh grade at the time. And a young lady had lifted her shirt, took a picture, sent it to a boy who had asked her to send it. That boy then passed it on to a bunch of other boys, my son being one of them. And it really - as prepared as I am in the world to deal with this from a business perspective, I couldn't believe it was actually happening in my own home. And I saw it. I happened to be going through his phone, checking in periodically, as Leslie was talking about, and it queued up the conversation. And, you know, it was the longest day waiting for him - I think for some reason, his phone was at home. I was waiting for him to get home, and I thought, oh, my God. I was really, you know, prepping for the conversation. And the conversation was, hey, I saw this on your phone. At first he was very cavalier, no big deal - took him about 15 minutes, sat back down with me. And he said, oh, I feel really badly. And we started talking about it in the context of, you know, this young lady, she sent it to someone. First of all, it wasn't even meant for you to receive. So there's that piece, right? And then just what the implications are that this is on your phone and that this is illegal. And, you know, I think where it really hit home for him was when I started putting in the context of, what if this had been your cousin, whom he is very close to - a young lady who's his age. What if this had been your friend, so-and-so? What if this had been your sister? HEADLEE: So, Fernando. . . SILVERMAN: And that changed - all of a sudden, he had that. . . HEADLEE: Yeah, I. . . SILVERMAN: . . . Aha, wait a minute. HEADLEE: And I want to take that to you, Fernando, 'cause you don't spy on your kid's phone or other social media, I guess. And yet your kid left Facebook because you think he may have been getting harassed. Do you not worry that - about, you know, what he may be going through? ESPUELAS: Yeah, first of all, I should clarify that we stopped our spying recently. . . HEADLEE: Oh, I see. ESPUELAS: . . . So as not to - just to be totally transparent. But he's a very mature guy. But he's 14, so, you know, by definition, his brain is. . . HEADLEE: Right. ESPUELAS: . . . Half monkey-half man. And so we try to deal with that reality. But at the same time, he's one of these, I guess, typical boys, we're told by all our sisters-in-laws who have boys. He doesn't want to talk about it. HEADLEE: Yeah. ESPUELAS: And the more we try to force a conversation out, the quieter he becomes. So, you know, I try to take moments when we're driving somewhere and just casually bring up, you know, who he's dating or what's going to happen and, you know, do you have any questions, should I be helping you? I mean, we take a proactive role in trying to understand what's going on. For example, and my wife pointed out the last two weeks he's been, you know, basically whistling to work and happy as can be. And finally, my wife told me last night it must be a girl. You know. . . HEADLEE: Yeah. ESPUELAS: . . . There's a girl now involved, and it's all good. You know, but we've seen the other side of that. . . HEADLEE: Yeah. ESPUELAS: . . . When things go badly with a girl, and he's down and moody and depressed. HEADLEE: So, Rey, let me bring this back to you because I know that your theory is that sexting is relatively normal. And I assume that's because this is - and I don't want to put words in your mouth - but are you assuming that sexting or just the things that used to be shared between friends verbally and is now shared between people over a cellphone or Twitter? JUNCO: Yeah, that's right. And there's also no data to show that, you know, it's anything different than previous communications about sexuality. HEADLEE: So, I mean, I doubt that a lot of parents sat down and had conversations with their kids about what they talk about with their friends, right? So how does that change - how does that conversation then change, do you think, if this is just a digital version of what we all used to do? JUNCO: Right. Well, I think that's - I mean, you've answered the question. I think it's a great in to talking with your kids about sexuality. I like that - what Fernando said - that he keeps trying to talk with his sons about, you know, who they're dating and things like that. And, you know, sometimes it's like pulling teeth. And eventually, they will talk to us about it. And I think it's also - you know, in addition to that, I think it's also important to, you know, kind of open up with them, too, and kind of, you know, share 'cause often as parents, we don't tend to talk to our kids about, you know, our relationship with the other parent. And so, you know, that might be something to include as well as modeling to how to talk about relationships. HEADLEE: So where's the drawing line for you, Rey? At what point would you get concerned? JUNCO: I think really the big concern here is about images being shared. And on the one hand, research shows that that doesn't happen with great frequency. So only 2 percent of sexters - of adolescence sexters have had their photo shared with someone who didn't want to see it. That being said, that's still 2 percent. HEADLEE: Yeah. JUNCO: And our society has some interesting double standards about sexuality where it's everywhere. We sexualize everything, including adolescents in movies and advertising. But then when it comes to our kids having some kind of sexual identity, then we freak out about it. And I think that needs to stop. HEADLEE: That's Rey Junco, fellow at Harvard University's Berkman Center for Internet & Society, also father of two. He joined us from a member station WBAA in West Lafayette, IN. I was also joined by Leslie Morgan Steiner, author, mom of three, one of our regular parenting contributors - Fernando Espuelas, host of his own program on Univision America, dad of two.

Hopefully, you've had a conversation - if you do discover that photo on your kid's phone, you know, whether they've sent or received it, that you've already been having those conversations. And I think it's not too early to have those conversations in the preteen years. Even when they're 8, 9, 10, you're starting talking about their body and body changes. And so this is all just gearing up, I guess, eventually to a Post-it filled with five things you have to say to them. But that's what you're leading toward. And it's not so much - these kids can make mistakes. There 's no question, and we all made mistakes. The problem is that was we were able to make mistakes privately, and they can make the mistakes much more publicly. HEADLEE: There's the rub. And if you're just joining us, our parenting panel is talking about sexting. You just heard Stephanie Silverman of Your Teen Magazine, also joined by writer Leslie Morgan Steiner, radio host Fernando Espuelas and social media expert Rey Junco. Rey, let's talk about these privacy concerns. If we accept that sexting is now kind of a normal part of teenage and then on to young adult sexual development, where does the law kind of enter into that? JUNCO: OK. Well, I think we're talking about two issues. We're talking about legal, and we're talking about social. And the law is - it's not as dreadful as we've been discussing so far. There - certainly, sexting could fall under child pornography laws. There are very rare instances when that has happened, and there is quite a bit of backlash against prosecutors who try to prosecute minors under child pornography laws for sexting. Seventeen states actually have created legislation that either decriminalizes sexting or makes it a misdemeanor. So that - you know, that's something to keep in mind that, you know, your kids are probably not going to go to jail. I just, you know. . . HEADLEE: You hear that, Fernando. They're not going to the pokey. (LAUGHTER) ESPUELAS: He doesn't know that. JUNCO: They're not going to jail. And, Fernando, I'm happy to review any Post-it notes if you need some help. (LAUGHTER) HEADLEE: There's a business opportunity here. Many people might want your wife's Post-it notes. ESPUELAS: Oh, it was good. JUNCO: Seriously, yeah. You could see that at the bookstore, you know, Post-it notes. HEADLEE: OK, So, Leslie, you're pretty pragmatic - I mean, you all seem to be fairly pragmatic. What happens - what's your advice to a parent who look at their kid's phone and sees a graphic sext either from or to their kid. STEINER: Well, I think, you know, take a deep breath and think about the issues before you go running after the kid. But definitely don't bury your head in the sand. It's actually a great opportunity to talk to your child. And I would say, don't apologize for being a spy. I am my kids' spy. I look through their stuff. I look through their Facebook posts. It's part of my responsibilities as a parent. And talk to them openly about it, and tell them why you're concerned. And again, it's - as I said earlier, my biggest concern is that my kids, you know - I want them to be able to stand up for themselves if they're getting sexually oriented messages that they don't want. And I do not want them inflicting that on anybody else. But I also want them to feel really good about their sexuality, and I think that that's another important part of parenting. HEADLEE: So this actually happened to you, Stephanie, as I understand, this kind of situation in which you found something on your kid's phone. What happened? SILVERMAN: Yeah, so - and it goes back - he was in - seventh or eighth? I think he was in seventh grade at the time. And a young lady had lifted her shirt, took a picture, sent it to a boy who had asked her to send it. That boy then passed it on to a bunch of other boys, my son being one of them. And it really - as prepared as I am in the world to deal with this from a business perspective, I couldn't believe it was actually happening in my own home. And I saw it. I happened to be going through his phone, checking in periodically, as Leslie was talking about, and it queued up the conversation. And, you know, it was the longest day waiting for him - I think for some reason, his phone was at home. I was waiting for him to get home, and I thought, oh, my God. I was really, you know, prepping for the conversation. And the conversation was, hey, I saw this on your phone. At first he was very cavalier, no big deal - took him about 15 minutes, sat back down with me. And he said, oh, I feel really badly. And we started talking about it in the context of, you know, this young lady, she sent it to someone. First of all, it wasn't even meant for you to receive. So there's that piece, right? And then just what the implications are that this is on your phone and that this is illegal. And, you know, I think where it really hit home for him was when I started putting in the context of, what if this had been your cousin, whom he is very close to - a young lady who's his age. What if this had been your friend, so-and-so? What if this had been your sister? HEADLEE: So, Fernando. . . SILVERMAN: And that changed - all of a sudden, he had that. . . HEADLEE: Yeah, I. . . SILVERMAN: . . . Aha, wait a minute. HEADLEE: And I want to take that to you, Fernando, 'cause you don't spy on your kid's phone or other social media, I guess. And yet your kid left Facebook because you think he may have been getting harassed. Do you not worry that - about, you know, what he may be going through? ESPUELAS: Yeah, first of all, I should clarify that we stopped our spying recently. . . HEADLEE: Oh, I see. ESPUELAS: . . . So as not to - just to be totally transparent. But he's a very mature guy. But he's 14, so, you know, by definition, his brain is. . . HEADLEE: Right. ESPUELAS: . . . Half monkey-half man. And so we try to deal with that reality. But at the same time, he's one of these, I guess, typical boys, we're told by all our sisters-in-laws who have boys. He doesn't want to talk about it. HEADLEE: Yeah. ESPUELAS: And the more we try to force a conversation out, the quieter he becomes. So, you know, I try to take moments when we're driving somewhere and just casually bring up, you know, who he's dating or what's going to happen and, you know, do you have any questions, should I be helping you? I mean, we take a proactive role in trying to understand what's going on. For example, and my wife pointed out the last two weeks he's been, you know, basically whistling to work and happy as can be. And finally, my wife told me last night it must be a girl. You know. . . HEADLEE: Yeah. ESPUELAS: . . . There's a girl now involved, and it's all good. You know, but we've seen the other side of that. . . HEADLEE: Yeah. ESPUELAS: . . . When things go badly with a girl, and he's down and moody and depressed. HEADLEE: So, Rey, let me bring this back to you because I know that your theory is that sexting is relatively normal. And I assume that's because this is - and I don't want to put words in your mouth - but are you assuming that sexting or just the things that used to be shared between friends verbally and is now shared between people over a cellphone or Twitter? JUNCO: Yeah, that's right. And there's also no data to show that, you know, it's anything different than previous communications about sexuality. HEADLEE: So, I mean, I doubt that a lot of parents sat down and had conversations with their kids about what they talk about with their friends, right? So how does that change - how does that conversation then change, do you think, if this is just a digital version of what we all used to do? JUNCO: Right. Well, I think that's - I mean, you've answered the question. I think it's a great in to talking with your kids about sexuality. I like that - what Fernando said - that he keeps trying to talk with his sons about, you know, who they're dating and things like that. And, you know, sometimes it's like pulling teeth. And eventually, they will talk to us about it. And I think it's also - you know, in addition to that, I think it's also important to, you know, kind of open up with them, too, and kind of, you know, share 'cause often as parents, we don't tend to talk to our kids about, you know, our relationship with the other parent. And so, you know, that might be something to include as well as modeling to how to talk about relationships. HEADLEE: So where's the drawing line for you, Rey? At what point would you get concerned? JUNCO: I think really the big concern here is about images being shared. And on the one hand, research shows that that doesn't happen with great frequency. So only 2 percent of sexters - of adolescence sexters have had their photo shared with someone who didn't want to see it. That being said, that's still 2 percent. HEADLEE: Yeah. JUNCO: And our society has some interesting double standards about sexuality where it's everywhere. We sexualize everything, including adolescents in movies and advertising. But then when it comes to our kids having some kind of sexual identity, then we freak out about it. And I think that needs to stop. HEADLEE: That's Rey Junco, fellow at Harvard University's Berkman Center for Internet & Society, also father of two. He joined us from a member station WBAA in West Lafayette, IN. I was also joined by Leslie Morgan Steiner, author, mom of three, one of our regular parenting contributors - Fernando Espuelas, host of his own program on Univision America, dad of two. They both joined me here in our Washington studios. And Stephanie Silverman is the publisher of Your Teen Magazine, and she was on the line from Cleveland. Thanks to all of you. JUNCO: Thank you. STEINER: Thank you. SILVERMAN: Thank you. ESPUELAS: Thanks. HEADLEE: That's our program for today. I'm Celeste Headlee. You've been listening to TELL ME MORE from NPR News.

By tradition, a woman's ideal catch has been a man who devotes his life to religious study. Well, now, NPR's Emily Harris has found a matchmaking network designed for changing tastes. EMILY HARRIS, BYLINE: Yael Mizrachi is 30 - old for an ultra-Orthodox woman to still be single. She's been to many matchmakers. YAEL MIZRACHI: (Through translator) The problem is they don't know me well enough. They don't know my soul. They don't understand who I am. HARRIS: Mizrachi calls herself a modern ultra-orthodox. She wears long sleeves and long skirts but she drives. Unmarried women normally don't. She won't attend mixed parties but she bucked tradition by getting a BA and a Master's. Most ultra-Orthodox women here only finish religious high school. Men traditionally study religious texts up to 14 hours a day. MIZRACHI: (Through translator) Matchmakers were always trying to set me up with somebody who studies the Bible all day. I don't want that. I want somebody who can also make a living. HARRIS: Ultra-Orthodox Jews are about 10 percent of Israel's population. When men are dedicated to religious study, they rely on welfare checks or wives with limited education to support their families. Rabbi Yehezkel Fogel says for decades, few ultra-Orthodox contributed to Israel's economy. RABBI YEHEZKEL FOGEL: They live their whole life in their own neighborhoods. So they have small businesses like having a deli, but they were not involved in really economic life. HARRIS: But things are changing. As the number of ultra-Orthodox has grown, so has pressure to join the workforce. Rabbi Fogel runs a community college for ultra-Orthodox men and women. The four-story school in central Israel blends in with office buildings around it. Here, 3,000 students study law, business, accounting, health and occupational therapy. This college might seem a good place for young ultra-Orthodox pushing boundaries to meet. But men and women attend classes on different days. Third-year law student Eli Potavsky started a digital dating service to help. ELI POTAVSKY: (Through translator) My friends and I talked about needing this. The men and women who study there are probably very suitable for each other but don't have any way to make connections. HARRIS: But it's not like most online dating. TUBI POTAVSKY: You fill out the form and you send pictures. And then I speak with everybody. HARRIS: There's a human matchmaker behind the screen. Tubi Potavsky, the founder's mom. TUBI POTAVSKY: I'm trying to open them and to learn them, to learn what they need. HARRIS: How is this different from traditional matchmaking then? Twenty-four-year-old Natanel Schlesinger says it values ultra-Orthodox who are a little bit different. NATANEL SCHLESINGER: (Through translator) What interested me was that it was for ultra-Orthodox who were going to college. There seemed to be more chance I would find a good match here than any other place. HARRIS: He married a woman four months after they met through the service. About 400 students have signed up. It's free until you find a spouse, when a matchmaking fee of perhaps $1,000 would be expected. Rabbi Fogel says the program helps prove to skeptical ultra-Orthodox that education can respect tradition. FOGEL: We're not against the community. We are part of the community. And this is why it's important. One of the ways to show that we are part of community is through this matchmaking system. HARRIS: Yael Mizrachi, the 30-year-old with two degrees, has met several men through this matchmaking service but no sparks yet.

For example, Pakistani drivers often have to waste hours every day lining up for fuel before they can even get their cars on the road. And now one driver and entrepreneur is trying to tackle this problem by reaching for the skies. NPR's Philip Reeves sent us this postcard from the capital, Islamabad. (SOUNDBITE OF BIRDS)PHILIP REEVES, BYLINE: Spring in Islamabad should be a happy time of year. The roses are in full bloom. The birds are in full song. So why are so many people here so angry? ABDUL MAJID: (Foreign language spoken)REEVES: Islamabad is a modern city, purpose-built in the '60s as the nation's capital. The center has a lot of wide, straight roads. I'm driving along a big avenue and there's a huge line of parked vehicles and a lot of angry looking people. This is a common sight in Pakistan these days. These people are lining up for hours to fill up their cars. I've been measuring this line while driving along, and it's way over a mile to the gas station. (SOUNDBITE OF TRAFFIC)REEVES: These drivers are waiting to fill up with CNG, compressed natural gas. Pakistan has more cars powered by CNG than anywhere else in the world. Abdul Majid drives a cab. He spends half his working day waiting in line. MAJID: (Through translator) I have been here for two hours and the gas station is still two kilometers away. REEVES: He has to do this almost every day, he says. He's losing so much driving time that his daily income of about 10 bucks is down by half. (SOUNDBITE OF CAR MOTOR)REEVES: Pakistan's government started encouraging everyone to use CNG about 10 years ago. It wanted to cut its bill for imported oil and use domestic gas reserves instead. CNG is also cleaner and cheaper than regular gasoline. The plan was a huge success, at first. Then the problems started. Demand for natural gas soared. Hundreds of CNG stations closed after the courts put a cap on prices. And separatists in Balochistan Province, where a lot of the gas comes from, regularly bomb the pipelines. Now there's a severe shortage. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: (Foreign language spoken)REEVES: Enter Aslam Azad. Five years back, Azad embarked on a personal mission to find an answer to Pakistan's fuel crisis. He spent $500,000 of his own money and countless evenings designing a car powered by the sun. It looks like a golf cart with solar panels on the roof, hood and sides. But looks aren't important right now, says Azad. The snazzy design will come later. It's very simple, just two pedals. . . ASLAM AZAD: Yeah,REEVES: . . . the break and accelerator. AZAD: Yeah. Yeah, accelerator and drive. You see, here's the drive, the reverse and neutral. That's it. REEVES: It's the world's simplest car. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Very nice, we like. AZAD: Thank you. REEVES: We go for a spin. Azad heads a big company that specializes in heating and cooling systems and has made a lot of money. That's not why he created his solar car, he says. AZAD: No, no. It's I did not did this for money basically. This is because my people needs me. I'm pretty sure this is what we are looking for. And this will solve the problem of people and the lines and the financial crisis. REEVES: The car has a battery powered by solar and kinetic energy. The engine becomes a generator when it's coasting. It can do about 50 miles a day. But Azad says he hopes soon to boost its range greatly. Others around the world are also pioneering solar-powered cars, often hybrids. Azad says his will be unusually cheap - just a couple of thousand dollars. He's certain that once he gets a manufacturing license, Pakistanis will snap it up. AZAD: I have no doubt. I just have no doubt. (SOUNDBITE OF TRAFFIC)REEVES: Back in the giant line for CNG, taxi driver Akhtar Farooq has given up hope. The gas station is still hundreds of yards away and now it's about to close. AKHTAR FAROOQ: (Through translator) It depends on luck. Sometimes we get it. And sometimes we don't get it and we just go home with empty hands. REEVES: For Farooq, Pakistan's solar car can't come soon enough. Philip Reeves, NPR News, Islamabad.

What time is it? So imagine if you could just reach down and feel the time on your wrist. Well, when Hyungsoo Kim was in business school, he helped design a device that would let you do just that. It's not a watch, it's a timepiece 'cause you don't have to watch it to know the time. This timepiece, called the Bradley, was designed for the blind. But interestingly enough, it's being bought mostly by sighted people who will now be able to check the time on the down low. Hyungsoo joins me in our D. C. studios. Thanks for coming in. HYUNGSOO KIM: Thank you very much. GOODWYN: Who is Bradley, and why did he need a new watch? KIM: Yes, we named it after former naval officer Bradley Snyder who lost his vision in 2011 while he was serving in Afghanistan as a bomb diffuser. But one year after the accident, he inspired us by competing in Paralympics in London. And he won two gold medals and one silver medal. So the Bradley Timepiece is a wristwatch that you can tell time by either looking at it or by touching it. So my team started designing it after having realized that most of the mainstream watches and clocks require vision. GOODWYN: Can you hold it up and show me how it works and describe it? KIM: Yes. So the time is indicated by the two ball bearings. So one ball bearing, it rotates on the surface and the other ball bearing, it rotates on the side, so. . . GOODWYN: Ah, well, it's a beautiful watch. And it has, I guess, chrome markings. KIM: The face has raised hour markers so that people can feel the reference hours. GOODWYN: Now, weren't there already watches for the blind, some kind of Braille? I mean, I really don't have any idea. KIM: Yeah, so there are two types of watches available for the blind. So one is talking watch. I brought it here. Basically, you press a button. (SOUNDBITE OF TALKING WATCH)COMPUTERIZED SPEAKER: It's 2:34pm. KIM: It speaks out time. But soon, I realized that people who use this didn't like pressing the button. First, everyone knows that you're checking time. Second, it draws attention to their disabilities. And the other alternative solution they have is analog watch. You open the glass cover to touch the minute and the hour hand. As you can imagine, it's very fragile, and when you touch them, you can very easily change position of the hands. GOODWYN: Are you surprised that so many sighted people are buying the watch? KIM: While we were developing the concept, we wanted it to be for everyone. So we are very glad that people who are sighted also really liking it. GOODWYN: Hyungsoo Kim is the founder of Eone Timepieces, the maker of the new Bradley watch. Congratulations. KIM: Thank you. GOODWYN: This is NPR News. WADE GOODWYN, HOST:  If you've ever sat through a never-ending meeting or a bad movie, you've probably had to resist the urge to look down at your watch. What time is it? So imagine if you could just reach down and feel the time on your wrist. Well, when Hyungsoo Kim was in business school, he helped design a device that would let you do just that. It's not a watch, it's a timepiece 'cause you don't have to watch it to know the time. This timepiece, called the Bradley, was designed for the blind. But interestingly enough, it's being bought mostly by sighted people who will now be able to check the time on the down low. Hyungsoo joins me in our D. C. studios. Thanks for coming in. HYUNGSOO KIM: Thank you very much. GOODWYN: Who is Bradley, and why did he need a new watch? KIM: Yes, we named it after former naval officer Bradley Snyder who lost his vision in 2011 while he was serving in Afghanistan as a bomb diffuser. But one year after the accident, he inspired us by competing in Paralympics in London. And he won two gold medals and one silver medal. So the Bradley Timepiece is a wristwatch that you can tell time by either looking at it or by touching it. So my team started designing it after having realized that most of the mainstream watches and clocks require vision. GOODWYN: Can you hold it up and show me how it works and describe it? KIM: Yes. So the time is indicated by the two ball bearings. So one ball bearing, it rotates on the surface and the other ball bearing, it rotates on the side, so. . . GOODWYN: Ah, well, it's a beautiful watch. And it has, I guess, chrome markings. KIM: The face has raised hour markers so that people can feel the reference hours. GOODWYN: Now, weren't there already watches for the blind, some kind of Braille? I mean, I really don't have any idea. KIM: Yeah, so there are two types of watches available for the blind. So one is talking watch. I brought it here. Basically, you press a button. (SOUNDBITE OF TALKING WATCH) COMPUTERIZED SPEAKER: It's 2:34pm. KIM: It speaks out time. But soon, I realized that people who use this didn't like pressing the button. First, everyone knows that you're checking time. Second, it draws attention to their disabilities. And the other alternative solution they have is analog watch. You open the glass cover to touch the minute and the hour hand. As you can imagine, it's very fragile, and when you touch them, you can very easily change position of the hands. GOODWYN: Are you surprised that so many sighted people are buying the watch? KIM: While we were developing the concept, we wanted it to be for everyone. So we are very glad that people who are sighted also really liking it. GOODWYN: Hyungsoo Kim is the founder of Eone Timepieces, the maker of the new Bradley watch. Congratulations. KIM: Thank you.

But figuring out how best to use the newer online storage lockers isn't easy. There are a dozen choices with varying costs, storage sizes and security. Here to talk more about it is Jill Duffy, writer for PCMag. Welcome to the program, Jill. JILL DUFFY: Hi, Audie. Thanks for having me. CORNISH: So, we just mentioned email but we're going way beyond messages, right? I mean, what are other uses for cloud storage that are growing in popularity with consumers? DUFFY: I think probably the biggest one is file synching and cloud storage together. So, these are solutions like Box, Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive, and even Google Drive. So, if you remember the old days of emailing yourself a file so that you can work on it from your home computer and then get it again at your office computer, this takes all of that out of the equation. So, now you can store your files or your photos or your music in one cloud solution and it will synch to all of the computers and devices that you connect it to. CORNISH: So, what are some key questions someone ask themselves before taking the plunge? DUFFY: Well, I think most people don't ask very many questions. They see the convenience of it but there is always a tradeoff with the risk that you take. So, every big service you've ever heard of has some level of encryption. Then there are some services that go a little bit further with that and offer security as sort of an upfront issue that they look at. And then the other option is to create your own cloud so that you're not using the public cloud. And that would be to use something like - we call them a NASD, a network-attached storage device. And so you could use that to create your own little cloud that wouldn't be anywhere public. CORNISH: So, help us understand how much this costs the average consumer and how much kind of storage you're getting for that price. DUFFY: Cost is a big concern for a lot of people. So, if you sign up for something like Dropbox or Box, you're usually paying nothing upfront and you get a little bit of storage. And you can use that until it fills up and then maybe you want to upgrade to have a little bit more storage, and then it'll cost you a few dollars a month. Now, if you wanted to build your own infrastructure, you're probably look at somewhere in the order of, like, $300-500. But you don't pay any recurring fees like you would with some of the other services. CORNISH: So, with a lot of new kind of innovations and services, people find that a lot of times it's connected to whatever operating system that they use, right? How does that work in the world of cloud storage? DUFFY: A good example would be Apple and iCloud. iCloud comes preinstalled on any iPhone or iPad that you buy and you get five gigabytes of storage. Now, I wouldn't consider myself locked into that. I mean, a lot of the other storage systems are flexible enough that they can go onto your device and you also don't have to use just one service. What I do personally is I keep my work files in one cloud-synching solution and I use my personal files in another one. So, I try them all out, I see what I like, I know that all of my work files are going to be in one place, all of my personal files are going to be in another place and yet, I can still access them from any computer that I'm on. CORNISH: Finally, I think there are people out there who see security breaches happening all the time in social networking and even with their email services and are nervous about putting more and more information about themselves online. Are there things to think about in terms what you should actually store in the cloud? DUFFY: An ounce of common sense here goes a long way. So, you never want to put something so sensitive into a cloud storage solution that would give a hacker ability to make money off of you. So, things like your Social Security number, a photocopy of your passport. So, anything that's sensitive you wouldn't want to put in there. The other thing that you can do is use an encryption service to give another layer of encryption to all of your files. So, you would encrypt them locally before you put them into the storage locker. That way, anybody who intercepts them is not going to be able to make any sense of those files. CORNISH: Jill Duffy. She's a writer for PCMag. Thanks so much for talking with us.

Of course, they've now become one of America's most successful cultural exports. But you might be surprised to learn that only five songs and albums from those genres are represented in the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"FIGHT THE POWER\")PUBLIC ENEMY: (Singing) 1989 the number - Another summer - get down -sound of the funky drummer. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"THE MESSAGE\")GRANDMASTER FLASH: (Singing) A child is born with no state of mind - blind to the ways of mankind - God is smiling on you but he's frowning too. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"RAPPER'S DELIGHT\")SUGAR HILL GANG: (Singing) I said a hip hop, hippie to the hippie, the hip, hip a hop, and you don't stop, a rock it to the bang bang boogie, say, up jump the boogie, to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"DEAR MAMA\")TUPAC SHAKUR: (Singing) Pour out some liquor and I reminisce - 'cause through the drama - I can always depend on my mama. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"ME, MYSELF AND I\")DE LA SOUL: (Singing) But when it comes to being De La - it's just me myself and I. HEADLEE: Every year the Library of Congress adds recordings to the registry that they say are important to America's culture and history. This year, 25 new recordings were added. None of them were hip-hop, though. Joining us to talk about it is William Boone. He's a professor in the English and African-American studies department at Winston-Salem State University and founder of Afro Blue Media. Welcome. WILLIAM BOONE: Hey. How's it going, Celeste? HEADLEE: Good. You know, I wonder first of all before we started on hip-hop not be included this year - we just heard \"The Message\" from Grandmaster Flash, \"Rapper's Delight\" with the Sugar Hill Gang, of course, \"Fear of a Black Planet\" Public Enemy, \"Dear Mama\" from Tupac Shakur, and \"Three Feet High and Rising\" De La Soul. Any problem with those? BOONE: No, no, no, no. Actually, I think these are very, very, very good selections in that they represent a broad sort of scope of hip-hop music. So I don't have a problem with what the registry has included. I guess my problem is what they've excluded. HEADLEE: So I should say that the Library of Congress responded when we reached out to them and said, quote, the National Recording Registry really does represent all facets of America's soundscape and its rich diversity. Nominations are gathered through online submissions from the public and the National Recording Preservation Board, which is comprised of leaders in the fields of music, recorded sound and preservation, unquote. So William Boone, your response - I assume if you had been on this recording preservation board - you have ideas on what you would've added. What would - what would you have included this year? BOONE: Oh, wow, that's a great question. There's a couple of albums that I think would really better represent not only American musical culture, but the hip-hop generation. I don't see how they could omit Run-DMC. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"CAN YOU ROCK IT LIKE THIS\")RUN-DMC: (Singing) I'm straining not complaining for a casual life - something normal nuttin' formal three kids and a wife - I'm dying from the spying that you're putting me through -I perspire I'm on fire when I'm thinking of you - But can you rock it like this? - I can rock it like that. BOONE: I feel as though Run-DMC is not only a seminal group, but they are archetypal in their approach to hip-hop music, particularly their 1985 album \"King of Rock,\" where they merge hip-hop and rock sensibilities. HEADLEE: So if they're collecting things that are historically relevant - in a way it's almost like they're creating a time capsule for people - I kind of think of it. What are the qualities that a song or an album needs to have to make it onto that? I mean, obviously, the things that you study may not be the things that somebody in the National Registry might consider important, right? They're not hip-hop scholars. They're trying to create a large picture. BOONE: Right, right, right. Well, I would say that I think that music should be representative of a given era or a given region. So for example, Nas' \"Illmatic. \"(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"N. Y. STATE OF MIND\")NAS: (Singing) Yeah, yeah, aiyyo black it's time. BOONE: \"Illmatic\" had such a profound impact on not only New York sound and hip-hop sound, but in terms of the topics that were covered within hip-hop. So, you know, I think at the very least these songs, these albums should be representative of a certain era, a certain moment or certain cultural moment. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"N. Y. STATE OF MIND\")NAS: (Singing) Rappers, I monkey flip 'em with the funky rhythm I be kickin' - musician, inflictin' composition - of pain; I'm like Scarface sniffin' cocaine - holding an M-16, see with the pen I'm extreme, now - bullet holes left in my peepholes - I'm suited up in street clothes - hand me a nine and I'll defeat foes. HEADLEE: I wonder to what extent should a song that's included also be popular? Does something that's really important have to be popular? Does it have to reach a certain number of people before it becomes a historical artifact? BOONE: Not necessarily. Not necessarily because I think we have to be careful there as we walk the tightrope between say popular music and art, if you will. So I wouldn't necessarily say it had to be popular, but I would say that I would judge it more by impact. So another album that I hope makes it onto the registry is 50 Cent's \"Get Rich or Die Tryin'. \" And so there's popular success there. But not only do 50 Cent's narratives impact the way hip-hop artists dealt with realism, 50 Cent has had a profound impact on the business landscape. So in that regard, I think it should perhaps be - the impact should be multi-dimensional, multi-layered. HEADLEE: Let me put it to you this way. Let's say that I'm on the board and I'm helping to choose what the 25 archival recordings will be, right? And we have to include great political statements, right? Maybe we're going to include something from the Mandela memorial. Maybe we're going to include something else that marks a moment in time. And say that there's a few spots left. You kind of have to include all of music. And yes hip-hop is ubiquitous, but an argument could be made that you have to put in \"Let It Go\" from \"Frozen. \" That's pretty ubiquitous also. And you're laughing, but it's everywhere. BOONE: Right. Two points. One, I think hip-hop emerges in an era of skepticism. So I think that's important to note. HEADLEE: Wait, could you explain a little further what you mean? It emerges in an era of skepticism. BOONE: Yes. Yes, so. HEADLEE: What does that mean? BOONE: So in the 1980s, you know, hip-hop was viewed - and actually all the way up into the '90s - as sort of this disposable, ephemeral art form. OK. It won't last. These are just kids, you know. This is not important. And so, you know, hip-hop has since its inception been kind of pushing back on these dominant narratives, you know. We're here to stay, essentially, you know. So you fast-forward some 40 years later and it's still here. And it doesn't seem to be fading away. So I think there's a bit of a maybe generational bias there - a bit out of touch as it relates to the pulse of American culture. HEADLEE: We should also point out that if you're going to go on to the Library of Congress list, the song or selection has to be at least 10 years old. That would bring us right now - obviously it's 2014, so that would bring us up to 2004. So what did we miss from the early 2000s that you think is most important for us to get in there? You mentioned Run-DMC. You mentioned Nas. What else are we missing? Do we need to get Jay-Z in there? BOONE: I'm not sure if we can include Jay-Z, but clearly he's made an impact. I would answer that yes. But before we talk about Jay-Z, I think we have to talk about the precursors to Jay-Z, somebody like a group like A Tribe Called Quest. And again, I think that's the significance of hip-hop in that it's free-collide (PH). It brings a lot of different elements together to create a sort of a narrative. So A Tribe Called Quest's first album \"People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm. \"(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"BONITA APPLEBUM\")A TRIBE CALLED QUEST: (Singing) Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on - Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on. BOONE: They come together to create essentially a new sound and a new American sound because jazz, as we know, is an American art form. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"BONITA APPLEBUM\")A TRIBE CALLED QUEST: (Singing) Bonita, Bonita, Bonita. BOONE: And then also I would maybe include OutKast, you know, because there's always a sort of New York-centric bias in hip-hop. And so the South is usually excluded. So I would definitely have to include OutKast's \"Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik\" 1994 album. 'Cause again, it made a national impact within the genre, but then also outside of the genre as Andre 3000 has moved on into film and various other avenues and arenas. HEADLEE: OK. Even animated cartoon shows for kids. BOONE: Yes, yes, yes. HEADLEE: What do you think hip-hop will tell future generations? Eventually the genre will either evolve into something completely different or disappear in one way or another. So, you know, 100 years from now looking back, the same way that we look back at Scott Joplin's rags, what do we learn about our culture by listening to these hip-hop songs? BOONE: Well, I mean, I think the first thing that we'll remember looking back as we look back at a historical memory, I think, we have to come to grips with the fact that America is still struggling with certain things, whether it be race, whether it be poverty, whether it be violence. And so I think hip-hop offers an exciting opportunity to look back on these moments and not only chronicle history and culture in America and the tension between generations and communities, I think it's also a great American story in regards to the way young black folk, young poor folk, folk of color in America are grappling with these things - commercialism, hyper-consumption. You know, these are things that are not only essential to young people, but essential to the American experience. HEADLEE: And what - having hip-hop included and rap included at all in the Library of Congress - does that make a difference to what you were talking about earlier in terms of the skepticism surrounding the genre? BOONE: Yes, yes. HEADLEE: Does it matter? BOONE: Yes. And I don't want to paint the Library of Congress as a villain because I think they've done a good job. I just think they're a bit out of touch. I mean, these things can happen when we're talking about institutions that go back 200 or 300 years. I think it is commendable, but there's more work to do, if you will. HEADLEE: Message from William Boone to the Library of Congress - get with the times. William Boone is professor in the English and African-American studies department at Winston-Salem State University and he joined us from that campus. Thank you so much. BOONE: Thank you so much, Celeste. Have a good one. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"CHECK THE RHIME\")A TRIBE CALLED QUEST: (Singing) Okay, if knowledge is the key then just show me the lock - got the scrawny legs but I move just like Lou Brock - with speed. I'm agile plus I'm worth your while. One hundred percent intelligent black child. My optic presentation sizzles the retina. How far must I go to gain respect? Um. Well, it's kind of simple, just remain your own. . . HEADLEE: And that's our program for today. I'm Celeste Headlee and you've been listening to TELL ME MORE from NPR News. Tune in for more talk tomorrow. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"CHECK THE RHIME\")A TRIBE CALLED QUEST: (Singing) . . . or you'll be crazy sad and alone. Industry rule number four thousand and eighty, - record company people are shady. So kids watch your back 'cause I think they smoke crack. I don't doubt it. Look at how they act. Off to better things like a hip-hop forum. Pass me the rock and I'll storm with the crew and. . . Proper. What you say Hammer? Proper. Rap is not pop, if you call it that then stop. NC, y'all check the rhyme y'all. SC, y'all check it out y'all. Virginia, check the rhyme y'all. Check it out. Out. In London, check the rhyme, y'all.

Maybe we're going to include something from the Mandela memorial. Maybe we're going to include something else that marks a moment in time. And say that there's a few spots left. You kind of have to include all of music. And yes hip-hop is ubiquitous, but an argument could be made that you have to put in \"Let It Go\" from \"Frozen. \" That's pretty ubiquitous also. And you're laughing, but it's everywhere. BOONE: Right. Two points. One, I think hip-hop emerges in an era of skepticism. So I think that's important to note. HEADLEE: Wait, could you explain a little further what you mean? It emerges in an era of skepticism. BOONE: Yes. Yes, so. HEADLEE: What does that mean? BOONE: So in the 1980s, you know, hip-hop was viewed - and actually all the way up into the '90s - as sort of this disposable, ephemeral art form. OK. It won't last. These are just kids, you know. This is not important. And so, you know, hip-hop has since its inception been kind of pushing back on these dominant narratives, you know. We're here to stay, essentially, you know. So you fast-forward some 40 years later and it's still here. And it doesn't seem to be fading away. So I think there's a bit of a maybe generational bias there - a bit out of touch as it relates to the pulse of American culture. HEADLEE: We should also point out that if you're going to go on to the Library of Congress list, the song or selection has to be at least 10 years old. That would bring us right now - obviously it's 2014, so that would bring us up to 2004. So what did we miss from the early 2000s that you think is most important for us to get in there? You mentioned Run-DMC. You mentioned Nas. What else are we missing? Do we need to get Jay-Z in there? BOONE: I'm not sure if we can include Jay-Z, but clearly he's made an impact. I would answer that yes. But before we talk about Jay-Z, I think we have to talk about the precursors to Jay-Z, somebody like a group like A Tribe Called Quest. And again, I think that's the significance of hip-hop in that it's free-collide (PH). It brings a lot of different elements together to create a sort of a narrative. So A Tribe Called Quest's first album \"People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm. \" (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"BONITA APPLEBUM\") A TRIBE CALLED QUEST: (Singing) Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on - Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on. BOONE: They come together to create essentially a new sound and a new American sound because jazz, as we know, is an American art form. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"BONITA APPLEBUM\") A TRIBE CALLED QUEST: (Singing) Bonita, Bonita, Bonita. BOONE: And then also I would maybe include OutKast, you know, because there's always a sort of New York-centric bias in hip-hop. And so the South is usually excluded. So I would definitely have to include OutKast's \"Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik\" 1994 album. 'Cause again, it made a national impact within the genre, but then also outside of the genre as Andre 3000 has moved on into film and various other avenues and arenas. HEADLEE: OK. Even animated cartoon shows for kids. BOONE: Yes, yes, yes. HEADLEE: What do you think hip-hop will tell future generations? Eventually the genre will either evolve into something completely different or disappear in one way or another. So, you know, 100 years from now looking back, the same way that we look back at Scott Joplin's rags, what do we learn about our culture by listening to these hip-hop songs? BOONE: Well, I mean, I think the first thing that we'll remember looking back as we look back at a historical memory, I think, we have to come to grips with the fact that America is still struggling with certain things, whether it be race, whether it be poverty, whether it be violence. And so I think hip-hop offers an exciting opportunity to look back on these moments and not only chronicle history and culture in America and the tension between generations and communities, I think it's also a great American story in regards to the way young black folk, young poor folk, folk of color in America are grappling with these things - commercialism, hyper-consumption. You know, these are things that are not only essential to young people, but essential to the American experience. HEADLEE: And what - having hip-hop included and rap included at all in the Library of Congress - does that make a difference to what you were talking about earlier in terms of the skepticism surrounding the genre? BOONE: Yes, yes. HEADLEE: Does it matter? BOONE: Yes. And I don't want to paint the Library of Congress as a villain because I think they've done a good job. I just think they're a bit out of touch. I mean, these things can happen when we're talking about institutions that go back 200 or 300 years. I think it is commendable, but there's more work to do, if you will. HEADLEE: Message from William Boone to the Library of Congress - get with the times. William Boone is professor in the English and African-American studies department at Winston-Salem State University and he joined us from that campus. Thank you so much. BOONE: Thank you so much, Celeste. Have a good one. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"CHECK THE RHIME\") A TRIBE CALLED QUEST: (Singing) Okay, if knowledge is the key then just show me the lock - got the scrawny legs but I move just like Lou Brock - with speed. I'm agile plus I'm worth your while. One hundred percent intelligent black child. My optic presentation sizzles the retina. How far must I go to gain respect? Um. Well, it's kind of simple, just remain your own. . . HEADLEE: And that's our program for today. I'm Celeste Headlee and you've been listening to TELL ME MORE from NPR News. Tune in for more talk tomorrow. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"CHECK THE RHIME\") A TRIBE CALLED QUEST: (Singing) . . . or you'll be crazy sad and alone. Industry rule number four thousand and eighty, - record company people are shady. So kids watch your back 'cause I think they smoke crack. I don't doubt it. Look at how they act. Off to better things like a hip-hop forum. Pass me the rock and I'll storm with the crew and. . . Proper. What you say Hammer? Proper. Rap is not pop, if you call it that then stop.

I'm Celeste Headlee. Michel Martin is away. You might have been hearing about the Heart Bleed bug over the past couple weeks. And if you haven't, you might want to check it out. It's important. That is the security flaw the researchers say could have compromised up to half a million websites. So maybe you changed your passwords for your online accounts by now. But Heart Bleed got us thinking here, what other kinds of threats are out there that we don't entirely know about and what can you do to protect yourself from them? We have Gerry Smith with us now to answer those questions. He's a technology reporter for the Huffington Post, and he joins us from our New York bureau. Gerry, thanks for being with us. GERRY SMITH: Thanks for having me. HEADLEE: So one of the cyber threats that we're hearing more and more about recently is ransomware. And I wonder if it appears differently, ransomware when it occurs, what is it and how does appear to, say, an individual as opposed to a company? SMITH: Yeah, ransomware really takes two forms. For the individual computer user, it's essentially a virus that shows up on your computer if you click on a bad link or visit a malicious website. And it'll be a pop-up on your screen, and it often will, you know, purport to be from, say, the FBI. And it'll say that you've been looking at illegal pornography or piracy, and to avoid any kind of law enforcement action, you need to pay such and such amount of money. You know, it can range from a couple hundred dollars to a couple thousand dollars. But what that does is it essentially locks the - locks you out of your computer, and you don't have access to any of the files on there. But what we're seeing more and more is actually, there's another sort of cyber extortion that's happening to companies. There's been a few technology startups in recent weeks that have said that they've been extorted by hackers. And it's a little bit of a different attack where suddenly their website or their online service will crash, will get knocked off-line. And then employees at the company will get an email from an unidentified hacker saying, you know, essentially, I just crashed your website, and I'll do it again unless you pay me. HEADLEE: Does it work? Do some of these companies pay? SMITH: Well, the companies that have gone public - there's not too many of them - but they said that they didn't pay. And the reason they said they didn't pay was because if they did, even if it was just a couple hundred dollars, they're afraid that they would essentially have a target on their back and that hackers would tell other hackers that these people, you know, they're willing to pay so you should go after them. And experts say that you should never pay a hacker ransom, that you should go to law enforcement or contact a computer security company that offers a service that can essentially help you out in that situation. But there has been research done that shows that some people do pay. I mean, it's as little - maybe as little as 3 percent of victims will actually pay the ransom. But that can actually add up to a lot of money for the hackers because they're - you know, they're going after thousands and thousands of computer users. And so even if it's just a couple hundred dollars, you know, if enough people pay, that's a pretty good source of revenue for the computer hackers. HEADLEE: But how accurate is our data? Do we know how many companies have been targeted? Are they letting us know when this happens? SMITH: Right, I mean, the statistics are kind of hard to come by because most people who have this happen to them don't say anything, especially if you end up paying a hacker that's - I mean, a company is very reluctant to disclose that publicly. But security companies - Symantec actually did a study last year where they - their estimate is that maybe 3 percent of victims actually pay. HEADLEE: Is there anything that requires - security problems, privacy problems that requires a company to let us know if our personal information on that website is in danger? SMITH: Yeah, there's actually laws in almost every state that require companies to disclose if they've been hacked. And there's actually federal legislation right now that's being considered that would make it nationwide because, oftentimes, companies, when they've been hacked, they take a few weeks to investigate, you know, how many people have been affected or whether their customers have been affected. And then sometimes companies never say that they've been hacked at all because they have stock prices and reputations to uphold, and sometimes their lawyers will say, you know, you should stay quiet about this 'cause we may be facing some lawsuits. But there is more of a push now for these companies to be more open. I know that they're also, you know, being asked to disclose whether they've had any kind of cyber security incident in their SEC filing. So there's a push to have these companies be a lot more transparent about when they're under any kind of threat from hackers. HEADLEE: Let's bring this back to individuals. I mean, needless to say, if your computer gets locked up and supposedly FBI tells you to send a money order for a couple grand, don't do it. But what are some of the other things that are showing up that are a danger to someone, especially through email? SMITH: Yeah, I mean, email, I mean, it's actually a very common hacker technique called spear phishing where you'll get an email that looks a lot like a friend or family member or any kind of trusted source, but it's not. It's a hacker who's impersonating that person, and oftentimes they'll have an attachment or a link embedded in that email. And if you click on it, it allows that hacker to essentially take over your computer. And if you work at a company, that hacker can jump from your computer to some of the other employees' computers and steal data from that company. So, I mean, that's really - you know, email is a very common way that people are getting taken advantage of. You know, there's also just websites that if you go to that website, you don't even have to click on anything on that  website, but the website itself is booby-trapped and you'll, you know, just by visiting it, you'll have - your computer will be infected with malicious software. HEADLEE: We only have about 30 seconds left. But am I - if I'm running my virus scans and malware scans regularly, am I pretty safe? SMITH: You know, I mean, that's a good idea. I mean, there's some of the other things that, you know, experts will say is use complex passwords, not just 123456. But use words and numbers and letters. Use different passwords for each site. A lot of popular sites now will use what's called two-factor authentication where you not only have to type in a password, but you also get a second password sent to your phone. That way a hacker, even if they steal their password, they can't get into your account unless they also have access to your phone. HEADLEE: It just gets more complicated all the time, Gerry. Gerry Smith is a technology reporter from the Huffington Post. Thanks so much for being with us. SMITH: Thanks for having me. CELESTE HEADLEE, HOST:  This is TELL ME MORE from NPR News.

Joining me now to talk about that is Wall Street Journal reporter Gautham Nagesh, who covers the FCC. Gautham, welcome. GAUTHAM NAGESHI: Thanks for having me. BLOCK: And first, why don't you explain what we mean when we say net neutrality. NAGESHI: Sure. Net neutrality is the concept that broadband or Internet service providers must treat all Internet content equally. They can't pick and choose which websites they will allow users to access, or speed up and slow down certain websites. Actually, in practice, there is no net neutrality today. If you ask the broadband providers, they say that they abide by that concept. But there are no rules dictating that they have to because those rules were struck down in court, in January. BLOCK: OK, so under the new proposed rules that the FCC is expected to put forth tomorrow, what would change? NAGESHI: So basically, the FCC in their proposal is going to say that broadband providers still - they can't block any websites; they can't slow anyone down. But what they can do is enter into agreements with content providers - companies that offer video, phone and other types of services to consumers - they can take payment in exchange for preferential treatment. That could be faster access or prominent placement on the home screen of your cable box, or something like that. But there is an opening to strike deals and to many people, that means this is no longer net neutrality. BLOCK: Yeah. I'm seeing a bunch of commentary on Twitter talking about - like, \"net neutrality finally dies at the ripe, old age of 45\"; \"this is the death of the open Internet system. \" What about the impact on consumers? NAGESHI: So it's debatable, of course, but in the short-term, I don't think you will see much change in how consumers experience the Internet. If you think of the Internet as something you get over a web browser, I don't think that will change significantly because they're not allowed to block or slow down websites, as I said. In the long term, what you may see is a shift towards offering more aspects of online communication as a service, for which there would be a separate fee. So for example, right now, if you want to watch videos over your Internet connection, you don't buy a special Internet connection. You just buy a standard Internet connection, and you either subscribe to a service like Netflix or Hulu, or you just watch free videos on YouTube and other sites. Under this new change, YouTube or Hulu or Netflix could foreseeably pay a Verizon or a Comcast - or someone like that - in order to reach consumers faster. So their service might be a little bit better over your Internet connection, and that might drive more consumers to it. Again, the concern is then the big companies - it will be harder for new companies or startups who can't afford to pay for preferential treatment, to compete for those sorts of services. BLOCK: And isn't it likely that some of those costs will ultimately get passed on to the consumer, for that fast lane that you're talking about? NAGESHI: Sure. Well, that is, of course, another concern. Broadband prices in general are very high and rising, and cost is a major factor for the people who do not subscribe to broadband. And so we don't see that trend stopping. And this will certainly not do anything to slow it down. Whether or not those costs will be passed directly to the consumer in price increases or in additional fees, we do not know. On the other hand, you may see enough packages emerge where some folks might choose to assemble some combination of services they're paying for independently, rather than paying the large flat fee they usually pay for Internet access. BLOCK: Gautham Nagesh covers the FCC for the Wall Street Journal. We were talking about the FCC's proposal - to be released tomorrow - that will change the rules for net neutrality. Gautham, thanks so much. NAGESHI: Thanks for having me.

But what they can do is enter into agreements with content providers - companies that offer video, phone and other types of services to consumers - they can take payment in exchange for preferential treatment. That could be faster access or prominent placement on the home screen of your cable box, or something like that. But there is an opening to strike deals and to many people, that means this is no longer net neutrality. BLOCK: Yeah. I'm seeing a bunch of commentary on Twitter talking about - like, \"net neutrality finally dies at the ripe, old age of 45\"; \"this is the death of the open Internet system. \" What about the impact on consumers? NAGESHI: So it's debatable, of course, but in the short-term, I don't think you will see much change in how consumers experience the Internet. If you think of the Internet as something you get over a web browser, I don't think that will change significantly because they're not allowed to block or slow down websites, as I said. In the long term, what you may see is a shift towards offering more aspects of online communication as a service, for which there would be a separate fee. So for example, right now, if you want to watch videos over your Internet connection, you don't buy a special Internet connection. You just buy a standard Internet connection, and you either subscribe to a service like Netflix or Hulu, or you just watch free videos on YouTube and other sites. Under this new change, YouTube or Hulu or Netflix could foreseeably pay a Verizon or a Comcast - or someone like that - in order to reach consumers faster. So their service might be a little bit better over your Internet connection, and that might drive more consumers to it. Again, the concern is then the big companies - it will be harder for new companies or startups who can't afford to pay for preferential treatment, to compete for those sorts of services. BLOCK: And isn't it likely that some of those costs will ultimately get passed on to the consumer, for that fast lane that you're talking about? NAGESHI: Sure. Well, that is, of course, another concern. Broadband prices in general are very high and rising, and cost is a major factor for the people who do not subscribe to broadband. And so we don't see that trend stopping. And this will certainly not do anything to slow it down. Whether or not those costs will be passed directly to the consumer in price increases or in additional fees, we do not know. On the other hand, you may see enough packages emerge where some folks might choose to assemble some combination of services they're paying for independently, rather than paying the large flat fee they usually pay for Internet access. BLOCK: Gautham Nagesh covers the FCC for the Wall Street Journal. We were talking about the FCC's proposal - to be released tomorrow - that will change the rules for net neutrality.

Tim Wu is a law professor at Columbia University. He says if the proposed changes go into effect, consumers can expect prices to rise. TIM WU: Companies like Netflix, companies that - like Amazon that rely on not paying cable and telephone companies to reach consumers will have to pay. And therefore it will end up costing the consumer more. CORNISH: Now, advocates of usage-based pricing are arguing that, you know, why shouldn't a company like Netflix or Google have to cover the cost of being a bandwidth hog. And they're also saying things that this should in some way enable people to buy cheaper broadband packages. WU: Well, the problem is there's no real competition in broadband and so prices will not go down. They have never gone down. So I don't think that's going to happen. And as for contributing, these companies are already make enormous contributions. And, in fact, users pay a lot for their broadband to be fast. So it's kind of a strange argument. Really, what they're talking about here is a new way for cable companies mainly to make more money. And that's one part of the economy I think that doesn't need to make more money. CORNISH: Now, the head of the FCC has argued that there is a lot of misinformation about their proposal. And there are provisions in the draft that would provide some oversight to deter companies from taking kind of drastic actions. What's your reaction to what they've put forward? WU: My reaction is that the commission is not omnipotent nor omnipresent, it doesn't know everything that's going on, that there will be a serious cost in terms of free speech. That's very hard to measure economically, very hard for them to see. And so that their idea that they can supervise and see everything that's happening on the Internet, and know that speech is being hurt, is not correct. CORNISH: But you also have an incredibly active Internet activist community, right? I mean I think people saw that with the Stop Online Privacy Act, that debate. Isn't this a scenario where, again, the Internet in a way polices itself, that people would highlight what they think is abuse by these companies? WU: I think that community may start policing Tom Wheeler and the FCC. I don't think the community is able to police monopoly carriers. There's no real other option. There's a lot of economic power there. And, as I said, activism needs to be directed towards the FCC to protect net neutrality and not abandon this important principle. CORNISH: Now, one other thing. Tom Wheeler also says that the new rules would look at any paper priority arrangements carefully, and on a case-by-case basis, and block the ones that aren't found to be commercially reasonable. That's still not enough protection for you, it sounds like. WU: No, commercially reasonable and free speech are not principles that coexist well. I think we've learned from the history of free speech in this country that you need to have a clear principle, not a case-by-case adjudication of free speech performed by an unaccountable federal bureaucrat. CORNISH: What's the worst-case scenario here for you, Professor Wu, as far as you're concerned? WU: I think the worst case is that we see the Internet kind of wither and disappear as a forum for free speech and new companies getting started, a world in which to get started it's more like cable television, you need a lot of money to even open a website and really reach a number of users, that things become entrenched and kind of frozen. And we've seen what cable TV has become, what it could have become. I think Internet could very easily become that, something where it's only a forum for the rich to speak and nobody else gets heard.

DeMille blockbuster \"The Ten Commandments. \" That spring staple may be one of the few times increasingly secular Americans think about the origin of the commandments, which by faith tradition were delivered to the Hebrew prophet Moses. For centuries, these commandments have been viewed by believers as the essential guide to an ethical and faithful life. But apart from the movie or Sunday school or bar mitzvah study, do you ever think about how those commandments fit into the fabric of life today? That is the question the editors of the Deseret News asked, and their recently published 10-part series sought to provide answers. Joining us now to tell us more is Paul Edwards. He is the editor of the Deseret News, which is owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Mormon church. It's based in Salt Lake City, but we caught up with him on a visit to Washington, D. C. And he's here now. Welcome. Thank you for joining us. PAUL EDWARDS: Wonderful to be with you. MARTIN: Now, I drew the analogy of the movie just because it seemed like every time I walked past the television, it was on this spring. But what gave you and your editors this idea? EDWARDS: Well, actually, Michel, as the Deseret News has focused its investigative journalism on some core areas of national concern around family, around faith and so on, and we thought there would be an opportunity to find something that would touch on many of these areas. And. . . MARTIN: And did you find a through line in your investigation? I mean, it's actually a very kind of original approach because you're not just investigating, like, the sociology of those particular commandments or the faith story. You're talking about what's the relevance of this right now. EDWARDS: That's right. MARTIN: Did you see any through line? EDWARDS: Really, the through line was that we saw a number of faith leaders, including Pope Francis, emphasizing the 10 commandments recently. So many faith traditions have had - seem to have said, we need to roll these out, talk about them. Pope Francis led an evangelization effort in Italy last year that said, how do we have a good, thoughtful, ethical life through the 10 commandments? He called it the art of living through the 10 commandments. MARTIN: One of the findings that really stood out to me was about adultery. Quoting from your piece, \"Americans place cheating on a spouse dead last on a list of acceptable behaviors, behind abortion, cohabitation, pornography, out of wedlock births and divorce, among others. \" I found that very interesting. Did you? EDWARDS: Well, I think some people might find that surprising because there have been so many changes in attitudes towards other kinds of sexual behavior. And yet, clearly, Americans really value marital vows. They think that stepping outside of those marital vows is a real problem. They may have less concern about premarital relations and so on. But adultery is a real concern. MARTIN: And one of the other findings of your piece that I found fascinating is that one of your pieces reported that people even experience post-traumatic stress symptoms, which I think might be surprising just how devastating it is. EDWARDS: Yeah, it's almost a physiological response. And yet one of the things that was a through line in the series was how contemporary media effects our relationship to these ancient commandments. MARTIN: Well, that's another thing I wanted to mention. One of the other pieces drew a very interesting observation about covetousness - in other words, envy - in the digital age. It said that the degree to which we are exposed to more things makes us want more things. Want to talk a little bit about that? EDWARDS: Well, we call that the Instagram effect. And really in social media, what we're able to do is portray ourselves in our best light. And we show a lot of different things or different activities that may create significant envy among those around us. And if people aren't liking what we're doing on social media, if we're not showing enough, then people have different kinds of negative reactions to that. But there's also - yes - this envy that we get when we see someone on a great vacation, or they have a swanky new piece of clothing. This is what the psychologists call relative deprivation. So it's not absolute deprivation. People may actually have a very good existence, right? They have a shelter. They have clothing. They have what they need, and yet they feel relatively deprived because, now in relation to what these other people see, they have this sense of envy and concern, which is truly dissatisfying and unhealthy. MARTIN: Is there anything that stood out to you since you supervised all of these pieces and got to read all of them and also the original reporting as it came in? Is there something that really jumped out for you? EDWARDS: Well, I think that the way that we work through a new canvas of social media is actually one thing that came through. So again, on adultery, what are the bounds for different kinds of relationships online? This actually was a question. Everyone is quite clear about a certain line crossed with physical relations in a marriage, but we saw this post-traumatic stress syndrome among people who had felt that there had been infidelity just even in a virtual space. How do we think about theft? The rates of crime around physical property have declined significantly. But we have significant increase in online theft, identity theft and so on. So we're really working out our social cohesion, the rules of the game in a very new space. And I think that was one of the main things that stood out for me, Michel. MARTIN: Well, you mentioned earlier in our conversation the whole question of thou shalt not kill and that you noted that the murder rate has in fact declined precipitously in years. So I have to confess, I was surprised that you didn't discuss the death penalty. Some people consider, you know, that to be state-sponsored killing, and. . . EDWARDS: Sure. MARTIN: . . . It remains a very polarizing issue in this country, particularly given that capital punishment continues to be practiced in the United States when it isn't in other countries that we consider to be less advanced and sophisticated than this one. And I was surprised that you didn't take that up. EDWARDS: Well. . . MARTIN: May I ask why? EDWARDS: Well, we just really focused in on a few issues, right? So we couldn't take the whole gamut of this. . . MARTIN: Well, there are 10 issues, so. . . EDWARDS: Yeah, but on these specific ones, we went deep on one aspect. And I agree with you, Michel. I mean, this is really a very interesting dimension in American life right now. And I think as we see real questioning of convictions - you know, the evidence that's come in about the way people have been falsely convicted - how that plays out with this particular penalty is hugely important. Let me just say in regard to that, probably the most troubling aspect of what I saw in the series actually had to do with thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor - OK, that commandment. We really explored that from the perspective of perjury, which was one strong aspect of this commandment anciently. And I was very troubled to learn about an epidemic of perjury in the United States. And in particular, I was very concerned about what it said around law enforcement officials perjuring themselves on the stand in order to get rapid conviction. And I think that goes to the very core of our criminal justice system and faith and trust in that system. So there are many other kinds of things that the Deseret News will certainly explore in the future along these lines.

I'm Guy Raz. And our show today - ideas around how we love. So love is instinctive, right. It's buried deep inside the most primitive part of our brains. But the way it works - why we're drawn to certain people and not others - it's still not entirely understood. So this hour, TED speakers who are all exploring love and not just romantic love, but the kind of love you might feel for your dad or your brother or best friend. So our first story is a romantic, love story with help from math, data and algorithms as told on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)AMY WEBB: My name is Amy Webb. And a few years ago, I found myself at the end of yet another fantastic relationship that came burning down in a spectacular fashion. And I thought what's wrong with me? I don't understand why this keeps happening. So I asked everybody in my life what they thought. I turned to my grandmother, who always had plenty of advice, and she said stop being so picky. You've got to date around. And most importantly, true love will find you when you least expect it. In short, I was trying to figure out, well, what's the probability of my finding Mr. Right? Well, at the time I was living in the city of Philadelphia. And it's a big city. And I figured, you know, in this entire place, there are lots of possibilities. Population of Philadelphia has 1. 5 million people, figure about half of that are men. So that takes the number down to 750,000. I'm looking for a guy between the ages of 30 and 36, which was only four percent of the population. So now I'm dealing with a possibility of 30,000 men. I was looking for somebody who was Jewish 'cause that's what I am and it was important to me, so only 2. 3 percent of the population. I figure I'm attracted to maybe 1 out of 10 of those men. And there was, you know, no way I was going to deal with somebody who was an avid golfer. So that basically meant there were 35 men for me that I could possibly date in the entire of city of Philadelphia. (LAUGHTER)WEBB: So if I have two possible strategies at this point - I'm sort of figuring out. One, I can take my grandmother's advice and sort of least expect my way into maybe bumping into the 1 out of 35 possible men in the entire 1. 5 million-person city of Philadelphia or I could try online dating. Now, I like the idea of online dating because it's predicated on an algorithm. And that's really just a simple way of saying I've got a problem. I'm going to use some data, run it through a system and get to a solution. So in my case, I thought will data and an algorithm lead me to my Prince Charming? So I decided to sign on. Now, the biggest problem is that I hate filling out questionnaires of any kind. And I certainly don't like questionnaires that are like Cosmo quizzes. So I just copied and pasted from my resume. (LAUGHTER)WEBB: So in the descriptive part up top I said that I was an award-winning journalist and a future thinker. When I was asked about fun activities and, like, my ideal date, I said monetization and fluency in Japanese. I talked a lot about JavaScript. (LAUGHTER)RAZ: Fluent in Japanese and JavaScript. That is - that's hot. WEBB: That's super sexy. RAZ: That's sexy. WEBB: Yeah. RAZ: Yeah. WEBB: Yeah, maybe that wasn't the best way for me to introduce myself. But, you know, the crazy thing is that even though I had foolishly copied and pasted from my resume, it didn't stop the dating services from matching me with other people. And it certainly didn't stop those people from asking me out on dates. RAZ: So how did they go? WEBB: Yeah. I had some dates that were pretty rough. I was being set up with very, very Orthodox rabbis, which was, like, a no-go from the get-go, people who were super interested in sports. There was being stuck with the check. There was a another guy who was diminutive and ordered a lot of Long Island Iced Teas. And we were out doing karaoke on our first date, and he ran up on stage and sang a bunch of songs and then dedicated them to his girlfriend. And I was like, I have no idea who you are. I just met you, like, 20 minutes ago. I am not your girlfriend. RAZ: Now, the thing you should know about Amy Webb is that she crunches numbers for a living. She analyzes data that helps big companies make more accurate predictions. And so she started to wonder, what if love isn't so mysterious at all? What if, instead of analyzing data for her clients, why not do it for herself? And what if, by doing that, she could game the system? WEBB: You know, in any other case, I would do market research. Why wouldn't I do market research, you know, on myself? So dating websites are sort of predicated on some pretty basic, not very exciting math. And in order to make things work, there has to be a limited number of choices, a limited number of variables. So it's a lot easier to parse do you like cats or dogs than it is to parse something like chemistry, right. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)WEBB: Knowing that there was superficial data that was being used to match me up with other people, I decided instead to ask my own questions. What was every single possible thing that I could think of that I was looking for in a mate? So I was looking for compatibility in terms of work ethic, religion. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)WEBB: So I started writing. You know, musical tastes. . . (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)WEBB: . . . And writing. I wanted somebody who had a certain attitude towards money. . . (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)WEBB: . . . And writing. I was looking for somebody who was going to be 20 pounds heavier than I was at all times. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)WEBB: Somebody who was going to be totally OK with forcing our child to start taking piano lessons at age 3. It was a pretty exhaustive list. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)WEBB: And at the end, I had amassed 72 different data points, which, to be fair, is a lot. So what I did was I went through and I prioritized that list. I broke it into a top tier and a second tier of points. And I ranked everything starting at 100 and going all the way down to 91. So once I had all this done, I then built a scoring system. What I wanted to do was to sort of mathematically calculate whether or not I thought the guy that I found online would be a match with me. I figured there would be a minimum of 700 points before I would agree to email somebody or respond to an email message. For 900 points, I'd agree to go out on a date. And I wouldn't even consider any kind of relationship before somebody had crossed the 1,500-point threshold. RAZ: And this is, like, unbelievable. You are like Alan Turing, like, cracking the enigma code. You've cracked the online dating code. WEBB: Well, I cracked if for myself. And I think that's what this comes right down to. A lot of people are - they either go into relationships not really knowing what they want and they change or they've settled. And when you make your list, when you really think about who it is that's going to make you happy in the long term and what you're going to need, that should be the time that you make the most detailed list of your entire life. I know people who have a handful of things they're looking for in a mate, but who have grocery lists that are three pages long. You are grocery shopping for a soulmate. There isn't a lot of science behind cracking the code. It's about figuring out what you need to make you happy and then going out and getting it. You know, in my case, I didn't want to go out on 50 dates. I wanted to go out on one date with the right person and be done. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)WEBB: Well, as it turns out, this worked pretty well. So I go back online now, I found JewishDoc57, who's incredibly good looking, incredibly well-spoken. He had walked along the Great Wall. He likes to travel as long as it doesn't involve a cruise ship, right. And I thought I've done it. I've cracked the code. I have just found the Jewish Prince Charming. . . (LAUGHTER)WEBB: . . . Of my family's dreams. There was only one problem - he didn't like me back. And I guess the one variable that I haven't considered is the competition. Who are all of the other women on these dating sites? I found SmileyGirl1978. (LAUGHTER)WEBB: She said she was a fun girl who is happy and outgoing. She listed her job as teacher. She said she is silly, nice and friendly. She likes to make people laugh a lot. At this moment, I knew, clicking after profile, after profile, after profile that looked like this that I needed to do some market research. So I created 10 fake, male profiles. Now before I lose all of you. . . (LAUGHTER)WEBB: . . . All right, understand that I did this strictly to gather data about everybody else in the system. I didn't carry on crazy catfish-style relationships with anybody. I really was just scraping their data. But I didn't want everybody's data. I only wanted data on the women who were going to be attracted to the type of man that I really, really wanted to marry. And mainly what I was looking at was two different data sets. So I was looking at qualitative data - so what was the humor, the tone, the voice, the communication style that these women shared in common - and also quantitative data - so what was the average length of their profile, what - how much time was spent between messages? I wanted to figure out how to maximize my own profile online. And as it turns out, I did a really good job. I was the most popular person online. (APPLAUSE)WEBB: And as it turns out, lots and lots of men wanted to date me. Well, not too long after that, I found this guy. And he said that he was culturally Jewish. He talked in detail about travel. He looked and talked exactly like what I wanted. And immediately, he scored 850 points. It was enough for a date. Three weeks later, we met up in person for what turned out to be a 14-hour-long conversation that went from coffee shop to restaurant to another coffee shop to another restaurant. Well, a year and a half after that, we were non-cruiseship traveling through Petra, Jordan when he got down on his knee and proposed. A year after that, we were married. And about a year and a half after that, our daughter, Petra, was born. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: That's incredible. It's like a movie. I mean, it's amazing that that happened, that all that happened. WEBB: It is. So afterwards, I eventually did show him the list. So fourth date in I had said, listen, I got to tell you something. RAZ: Yeah. WEBB: And I took the list out, and I said here's how we came to be together. And he thought that it was great. One of the things that was on the list was I was looking for somebody who would appreciate the beauty of a well-crafted spreadsheet. RAZ: Yeah. That's totally - that's exactly the right way to go. WEBB: Well, and it was, and he did. RAZ: Wow. I mean, so if technology is, like, changing, you know, the way we find love, right. And if the algorithms can be gamed - I don't know - couldn't it, like, lead to the perfect person, like, the person you are meant to be with forever? WEBB: I think technology is a really useful tool to bring people together. But at the end of the day, it's up to us. Technology has made a lot of things in life much more efficient, much easier. Love is something that takes work. And it takes work even if you found your soulmate, your 1,500-point man or woman, the person that you are looking for who is the perfect person for you. You both still have to put in some effort. And technology can't solve for that critical element of any relationship. For love to endure, it takes human capital. It takes sweat equity, understanding, and it takes people. RAZ: Amy Webb, she told her story in a memoir. It's called \"Data: A Love Story. \" Her full talk is at TED. NPR. org.

I'm Eric Westervelt. It's time for the New and the Next. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)WESTERVELT: Carlos Watson is the co-founder of the online magazine Ozy. Each week, he joins us for a taste of the eclectic mix of stories on the site. Carlos, nice to meet you. CARLOS WATSON: Eric, it's really good to join you. WESTERVELT: So throughout this month, Carlos, we've been hearing lots of mostly depressing stories about Rwanda's past. It's been 20 years since the genocide in that country. You have a different story about a different side of Rwanda's capital, Kigali. It's becoming something of a draw for foreigners. Tell us why. WATSON: It's an incredible story. As you said, 20 years ago, nearly a million people lost their lives in 100 days. But to visit the East African country and particularly the capital, Kigali, you find incredibly clean streets - many call it the cleanest capital in Africa; paved roads; in some cases, expensive coffee shops. It's been an amazing renaissance of that city, and it's led to a dramatic surge in the number of ex-pats who live there - Germans, Americans, Canadians, Saudis and others. WESTERVELT: I mean, this is a country that lost 10 percent of its population in the genocide. It's interesting that 20 years later, one of the big draws to the city is safety and security. WATSON: It is, and it's been a double-edge sword. Most people champion it and say that the safety, the low levels of corruption, have made it an interesting place to live, to do business - from FedEx to Coca-Cola and back - but you do hear a handful of people say it feels like democracy is a little stifled here. It feels like it's tough to speak out and challenge President Kagame's government. But then again, perhaps that's the tradeoff in the early stages. WESTERVELT: Yeah, it will be interesting to watch how the city evolves over the next few decades. OK, now on a bit of a lighter note, it seems like there's a new twist to the online dating model all the time. And another one is coming down the pike, one that doesn't use words when you create your profile. Tell us about it. WATSON: It's called Dreamcliq. It just started this year by a young graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design, Melissa Jones, and her feeling was that a lot of words often obscure who the person really is and what might matter more, their images. Not surprisingly, she's a more visual person. ,And so she created something called Dreamcliq, where your portfolio - or mine - wouldn't be 6- or 800 words, but 24 or 25 pictures; and they might be grouped by titles like Arts and Books, or Travel and Leisure. After seeing someone's kind of visual portfolio, you can then decide to send them a message, or as they call it, send them a click. WESTERVELT: So this is kind of the Pintrest of online dating, but Carlos, you know, what if I don't know how to impress someone with images? Is there help for the design-challenged among us? WATSON: They, in fact, gather a number of interesting images that you can pull from and create something really nice and strong and distinctive, whether it's a beautiful sunset, whether it's the cover of a particular book. And so those end up becoming a little bit of a common language and allow people to see things they love and recognize, pull those and post them; and then allow, ultimately, other people to reach out. WESTERVELT: Now, startups often struggle with how to monetize their product, Carlos. This has an interesting business model. You have to pay to send a message to your potential date. WATSON: Very, very interesting. I mean, you've got free sites, like OK Cupid and Plenty of Fish. You've got sites like Match. com and EHarmony, where you probably pay 30, 40, 50 bucks a month. But here, you pay $2. 50 a message. And for those who kind of go, ouch, they say the person who's receiving your click knows that you really value it, that you actually had pay for it; and so it's got greater weight. WESTERVELT: Carlos Watson is the co-founder of the online magazine Ozy. You can explore all of the stories we talk about at npr. orgnewandnext. Carlos, thanks again.

And another one is coming down the pike, one that doesn't use words when you create your profile. Tell us about it. WATSON: It's called Dreamcliq. It just started this year by a young graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design, Melissa Jones, and her feeling was that a lot of words often obscure who the person really is and what might matter more, their images. Not surprisingly, she's a more visual person. , And so she created something called Dreamcliq, where your portfolio - or mine - wouldn't be 6- or 800 words, but 24 or 25 pictures; and they might be grouped by titles like Arts and Books, or Travel and Leisure. After seeing someone's kind of visual portfolio, you can then decide to send them a message, or as they call it, send them a click. WESTERVELT: So this is kind of the Pintrest of online dating, but Carlos, you know, what if I don't know how to impress someone with images? Is there help for the design-challenged among us? WATSON: They, in fact, gather a number of interesting images that you can pull from and create something really nice and strong and distinctive, whether it's a beautiful sunset, whether it's the cover of a particular book. And so those end up becoming a little bit of a common language and allow people to see things they love and recognize, pull those and post them; and then allow, ultimately, other people to reach out. WESTERVELT: Now, startups often struggle with how to monetize their product, Carlos. This has an interesting business model. You have to pay to send a message to your potential date. WATSON: Very, very interesting. I mean, you've got free sites, like OK Cupid and Plenty of Fish. You've got sites like Match. com and EHarmony, where you probably pay 30, 40, 50 bucks a month. But here, you pay $2. 50 a message. And for those who kind of go, ouch, they say the person who's receiving your click knows that you really value it, that you actually had pay for it; and so it's got greater weight. WESTERVELT: Carlos Watson is the co-founder of the online magazine Ozy. You can explore all of the stories we talk about at npr. orgnewandnext. Carlos, thanks again. WATSON: Eric, really good to be with you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)", "section": "The New And The Next", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2014 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The New York Police Department, like a lot of institutions, is trying to break into the world of social media. So they made up a hash tag - #myNYPD - and asked people to post photos of themselves with police officers. They got some pictures of smiling cops and citizens. But the hash tag generated more ideas of cops doing things like holding down a protester or knocking over a bicyclist. To talk more about this, I'm joined now by Zeynep Tufekci of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University. Welcome to the program. ZEYNEP TUFEKCI: Hello. MARTIN: So the NYPD has been trying to get into the world of social media more aggressively recently. What went wrong with this particular effort? TUFEKCI: Well, what went wrong is that social media doesn't function like old-style public relations, where you could just push a message and not expect to hear back. What happens is, if people have something they want to say to you, they will say it back to you. This is not the first time this happened. McDonalds tried the same thing with #McDStories as a hash tag and in fact, they paid to promote it. And people told their own McDonald's stories that were far from flattering to McDonald's. So this is something that is a reality in the 21st century. If people want to talk back to you, and you wade into the places where they can talk back, they will. It doesn't work like television. MARTIN: Last year, the financial services firm JPMorgan Chase created the hash tag #AskJPM. And they found themselves hit with a deluge of negative questions along the lines of - did you always want to be part of a vast corrupt criminal enterprise or did you break bad? So again, what are we seeing - the same kind of mistakes being repeated by corporations when it comes to social media? TUFEKCI: Well, one way to look at it as mistakes, from a public relations point of view. But if you look at it from a civic point of view, it's actually - rather than mistakes, it's an opportunity for reality of perception to break through. They could learn from this, just like J. P. Morgan could learn from this, and McDonald's can learn from this. The fact is there are a lot of people who want to talk back to these companies. So there's something really interesting going on. So instead of firing the person who started this campaign, maybe they should be thanking them for showing them a problem. And its very stark - yes, unpleasant. I understand why it's unpleasant for an institution. But it's also an opportunity if the people running the institution look at it and say, whoa, what just happened. Let's think about this.

I'm Melissa Block. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: And I'm Robert Siegel. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel recently declared the United States reliance on cyberspace was outpacing its ability to defend it. So, Hagel plans to more than triple the size of the workforce at the U. S. Cyber Command over the next two years. Meeting that goal will take a lot more cybersecurity experts, who are in short supply. And this is where the NSA comes in. The National Security Agency has been under fire for its surveillance programs but it also plays a big role in cyber defense. The agency recently held an exercise to train more cyber warriors, and NPR's David Welna was there. DAVID WELNA, BYLINE: Ten miles down the road from the National Security Agency at a defense contractor's office, big speakers pump electro-house music into a long room. Several dozen people, many in military uniforms, cluster around computer stations. Hovering above them is the image of a skull and bones, a big Jolly Roger pirate flag. What this is, is a roomful of break-in artists, people who are experts at hacking into other people's computers. Marine Captain Robert Johnston leads what he calls a reconnaissance and initial access team. CAPTAIN ROBERT JOHNSTON: So, we're the guys kind of pounding at the front door, finding all the open holes that we can and beating down the door. WELNA: And they do that for three days nonstop, 'round the clock, launching cyber-attacks on networks designed and defended by teams at the nation's top military academies - Annapolis, West Point. It's all part of CDX, an annual cyber defense exercise run by the NSA. The red-cell team hacking the academies' networks is a mix of NSA and military cyber experts like Captain Johnston. He did this last year, too. The military academies, he says, have gotten a lot better since then. JOHNSTON: I've been nothing but impressed, actually. From last year to this year, I've felt like there's been some exponential growth in capabilities. WELNA: But the academies are still no match for the attack team that the NSA's assembled. The evidence: four men in camouflage around a computer screen - on it the grinning face of Justin Bieber. It shows they've managed to deface a network defended by the U. S. Naval Academy. SHAWN TURSKEY: Now, we want to make this clear, this is not a game. WELNA: Shawn Turskey is the NSA's red-cell team leader. This hacking exercise, he says, is done for practical reasons. TURSKEY: We're training our future leaders how to fight through network adversity to conduct their mission and keep our nation safe. WELNA: The CDX exercise has been going on for 14 years. But this one's the first since former NSA contractor Edward Snowden hacked the spy agency itself and made off with thousands of top-secret documents. That episode only highlighted how much damage can be done when networks are breached. But there's something else in this exercise for the NSA, the possibility that some of those students at the military academies will take jobs there. DAN FINNERTY: Some have ended up working a tour here, maybe for three years, then on to another tour. It definitely happens. WELNA: That's the NSA's Dan Finnerty. He coordinates of this annual cyber battle. Finnerty says the armed forces are a vital part of the agency's 35,000-member workforce. FINNERTY: One out of every two employee in NSA is a military employee, so they're important to us. WELNA: Industry insiders say the competition for top cyber experts in both the private and public sectors has never been so fierce. LORI WELTMANN: We're all fighting for the same talent. It's tough out there. WELNA: Lori Weltmann is the NSA's recruitment marketing manager. The problem, she says, is the soaring demand for a very limited supply of cyber experts. Still, she insists NSA is holding its own. In her words, once you try NSA, you buy NSA. WELTMANN: The work is exciting and you can do things here that you can't do anywhere else. WELNA: That's the selling point, but it may also be the problem. VICTOR PIOTROWSKI: The last 12 months were extremely difficult for NSA. WELNA: Difficult, says Victor Piotrowski, at least in part because of the NSA activities Edward Snowden revealed. Piotrowski is with the National Science Foundation and he directs a program called CyberCorps, focused on attracting students to the cybersecurity profession. The NSA is by far CyberCorps' biggest customer. Piotrowski says it's hard to know just how much the agency was hurt by Snowden's revelations. PIOTROWSKI: From the leaked documents, the public perception is really, you know, creating a very negative image of a lot of government programs. And that might be working, you know, somehow against our recruitment efforts. WELNA: The next generation of talent is being trained now at the nation's military academies. It's students, like the Naval Academy's in Annapolis, who are at the incoming end of the CDX computer hacking exercise. It's on their computer screens where the face of Justin Bieber showed up. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: I don't know if maybe that's something you want to look at here. They're attacking Doc 54(ph). So, they're trying to hit web. BILL YOUNG: They're trying to hit our specific one, right? UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Yeah. YOUNG: Midshipmen in a large classroom cluster around a computer whose network is being bombarded by the NSA's red-cell team. A second-year student named Bill Young is at the keyboard. He'll be in the academy's first graduating class of cyber operations majors. Young says for him, the CDX exercise has been time well-spent. I've probably learned more in four days of working CDX than I have in two-plus semesters of taking information security classes, simply because you're doing it, you're seeing other people work with it. WELNA: This is the only military academy where every student is required to complete at least two courses in cybersecurity. Captain Paul Tortora directs the Naval Academy's Center of Cyber Security Studies. He says the academy is preparing for a whole new theater of warfare. CAPTAIN PAUL TORTORA: Cybersecurity, cyber awareness, cyber operations, so that we create an officer corps that has an understanding. Then they go to the fleet, or the Marine Corps, and they can take the understanding of cybersecurity, cyber awareness in all of their daily operations. WELNA: Some of the students at Annapolis will end up pursuing cyber operations majors. They'll then owe the Navy or Marines five years of service. Bill Young, the cyber-ops major at the keyboard, says he's thinking his tour of duty in information warfare. Beyond that, he says, a huge number of civilian jobs are out there for people like him. Asked if he'd consider working for the NSA, Young hesitates. YOUNG: You know, you always got to keep those options open. I don't know, you know, the NSA works for everyone. But certainly if, you know, you have the skills and they need you then that's a viable option. WELNA: In fact, there's a good chance that when he's a commissioned officer, Young would serve at least some of his tour of duty working with the NSA. Whether he'd make it a career is an open question. The NSA's Shawn Turskey says training exercises like CDX are really an investment in the future. TURSKEY: We're in this for the long haul. And we'll get immediate return but down the road is what we're looking for to have that bigger payoff. WELNA: For the embattled spy agency, the payoff would be if the new generation of cyberwarriors being bred at the nation's service academies choose eventually not just to try NSA but to buy NSA.

We've been talking a lot on this program about the push for equal opportunities in the workplace. Today, we look at a new hiring tool that raises some interesting questions about the recruitment process. The tool was developed by a San Francisco-based startup called Entelo. It allows employers to sort applicants according to things like ethnicity and gender and status as a military veteran - for example, you can say show me all the candidates who are women or show me all the candidates who are African-American veterans. Now, as you might imagine, this tool which is scheduled to launch yesterday has already sparked some controversy. A Fox business columnist suggested it's a tool for quote reverse discrimination. We wanted to hear more about this so we've called once again on Cyrus Mehri. He's a founding partner of the law firm Mehri and Skalet, PLLC. He's worked on landmark civil rights cases involving employment discrimination. And he's with us once again in our studios in Washington, D. C. Cyrus Mehri, thanks for joining us once again. CYRUS MEHRI: Thank you. MARTIN: So first I wanted to ask about the whole question of Silicon Valley. MEHRI: Sure. MARTIN: And the employment situation in there. I mean, on the one hand, this is the - kind of the cutting edge of the economy and you'd think it's all kind of open, you know, new and yet the numbers there, to the degree that we know because many of these companies refuse to disclose their employment statistics, we still hear that, you know, women are still far below their numbers in the population as represented as employees there, African-Americans, minorities in general. Why is that? MEHRI: There are flaws in the evaluation systems in many companies. Some of the companies had or till recently had a forced ranking type of system which then would force people to kind of be on the kind of survivor show where someone's going to get thrown out of their group as opposed to kind of cultivating innovation and teamwork. So then there's issues of the education system that's kind of the pipeline into some of these companies. And we have profound problems of higher education being exclusionary partly about how people get selected into the elite schools. It's a cascading set of problems that begins, I think, at the higher education, in the point of entry at these companies and then when it comes to advancement and compensation once they get there. MARTIN: So this tool was developed, as we mentioned, by this San Francisco startup called Entelo. And we reached out to their CEO, his name is Jon Bischke. And we asked him why he thinks this is an important tool and what he thinks it'll accomplish. And this is part of what he told us. JON BISCHKE: It's important to point out that this tool isn't used to necessarily hire someone for a job. We always - we feel you should always hire the best people for every position - rather it's about trying to make sure that the pool of applicants or the pool of candidates is as diverse as possible. There is a lot of discrimination that exists in the workforce. Our hope, our desire would be that that wasn't the case, and our tool is designed to hopefully correct any imbalances that might already exist. MARTIN: Couldn't somebody use a tool like this just to say just give me all the white males? MEHRI: I think it could be misused that way. But clearly the purpose behind it is the opposite - to be inclusionary. And that's why we've started with the Coca-Cola settlement, with the NFL -what's known as the Rooney Rule. We've advanced the idea of having a diverse slate of candidates so you're not just tapping on the shoulder, you're making sure you have a more competitive process to make sure that you're hiring the best. And that means you need to have pools of people from different backgrounds. MARTIN: Well, people think that - I think therein lies the rub because there are some people who object on its face to even considering ethnicity or gender. I mean, their argument is that by definition bringing ethnicity and gender into it reduces the meritocracy. It should all be on something objective and achievement oriented, it's something that you can accomplish as opposed to what you are. MEHRI: By having a more inclusive process you are enhancing meritocracy. When you have a closed-minded approach based on presumptions that may not be correct, you're going to have less successful choices in the long run. One practical thing that listeners may not know - the way Silicon Valley typically hires is not the way that I would hire, for example, in my law firm where I look at a stack of resumes and actually eyeball them. They are using computerized systems to match up the resumes to the job description and then using that as their pool. And so they're already not using the human element necessarily at that first cut. So adding something like this, which would make sure that you're looking at more sources of information to get in that first round, seems to me would enhance the process. MARTIN: Well, there are those, I think, who would argue that's the whole point of using computers - to remove the human element, which people believe introduces the bias. MEHRI: Well, you can't exclude the human element 'cause a human being is going to make that hiring decision. But what you can do is motivate the decision-makers to value diversity as a business necessity and then help them get there by making sure they have a viable set of candidates of different backgrounds. MARTIN: Could it be that, for example, the recruiters are people you tend to recruit in their social networks and if their social networks are not diverse you're not even going to see resumes to get into the system. For example, you might not know anybody who went to HBCU. . . MEHRI: Exactly. MARTIN: . . . Or a Latino serving institution and therefore none of those candidates would even apply. MEHRI: Right. And the more proactive companies are looking at different forms of social media - they may look at root. com and not just at their - you know, the prior schools that people went to. So they'll just expand the horizons of what the possibilities are. And this is only about possibilities 'cause a candidate will still have to get in the process and compete and show the decision-maker what they have to offer. But when that happens, surprisingly, people that may have gone under the radar get discovered. And we've seen that happen over and over again whether you look at the success we've had with the NFL or companies that are less well-known. We've seen it happen over and over again - people getting discovered. MARTIN: Cyrus Mehri is a partner at the law firm Mehri and Skalet, PLLC. He was kind enough to join us from our studios in Washington, D. C. Cyrus, thanks so much for joining us once again. MEHRI: Thanks for having me.

We wanted to hear more about this so we've called once again on Cyrus Mehri. He's a founding partner of the law firm Mehri and Skalet, PLLC. He's worked on landmark civil rights cases involving employment discrimination. And he's with us once again in our studios in Washington, D. C. Cyrus Mehri, thanks for joining us once again. CYRUS MEHRI: Thank you. MARTIN: So first I wanted to ask about the whole question of Silicon Valley. MEHRI: Sure. MARTIN: And the employment situation in there. I mean, on the one hand, this is the - kind of the cutting edge of the economy and you'd think it's all kind of open, you know, new and yet the numbers there, to the degree that we know because many of these companies refuse to disclose their employment statistics, we still hear that, you know, women are still far below their numbers in the population as represented as employees there, African-Americans, minorities in general. Why is that? MEHRI: There are flaws in the evaluation systems in many companies. Some of the companies had or till recently had a forced ranking type of system which then would force people to kind of be on the kind of survivor show where someone's going to get thrown out of their group as opposed to kind of cultivating innovation and teamwork. So then there's issues of the education system that's kind of the pipeline into some of these companies. And we have profound problems of higher education being exclusionary partly about how people get selected into the elite schools. It's a cascading set of problems that begins, I think, at the higher education, in the point of entry at these companies and then when it comes to advancement and compensation once they get there. MARTIN: So this tool was developed, as we mentioned, by this San Francisco startup called Entelo. And we reached out to their CEO, his name is Jon Bischke. And we asked him why he thinks this is an important tool and what he thinks it'll accomplish. And this is part of what he told us. JON BISCHKE: It's important to point out that this tool isn't used to necessarily hire someone for a job. We always - we feel you should always hire the best people for every position - rather it's about trying to make sure that the pool of applicants or the pool of candidates is as diverse as possible. There is a lot of discrimination that exists in the workforce. Our hope, our desire would be that that wasn't the case, and our tool is designed to hopefully correct any imbalances that might already exist. MARTIN: Couldn't somebody use a tool like this just to say just give me all the white males? MEHRI: I think it could be misused that way. But clearly the purpose behind it is the opposite - to be inclusionary. And that's why we've started with the Coca-Cola settlement, with the NFL -what's known as the Rooney Rule. We've advanced the idea of having a diverse slate of candidates so you're not just tapping on the shoulder, you're making sure you have a more competitive process to make sure that you're hiring the best. And that means you need to have pools of people from different backgrounds. MARTIN: Well, people think that - I think therein lies the rub because there are some people who object on its face to even considering ethnicity or gender. I mean, their argument is that by definition bringing ethnicity and gender into it reduces the meritocracy. It should all be on something objective and achievement oriented, it's something that you can accomplish as opposed to what you are. MEHRI: By having a more inclusive process you are enhancing meritocracy. When you have a closed-minded approach based on presumptions that may not be correct, you're going to have less successful choices in the long run. One practical thing that listeners may not know - the way Silicon Valley typically hires is not the way that I would hire, for example, in my law firm where I look at a stack of resumes and actually eyeball them. They are using computerized systems to match up the resumes to the job description and then using that as their pool. And so they're already not using the human element necessarily at that first cut. So adding something like this, which would make sure that you're looking at more sources of information to get in that first round, seems to me would enhance the process. MARTIN: Well, there are those, I think, who would argue that's the whole point of using computers - to remove the human element, which people believe introduces the bias. MEHRI: Well, you can't exclude the human element 'cause a human being is going to make that hiring decision. But what you can do is motivate the decision-makers to value diversity as a business necessity and then help them get there by making sure they have a viable set of candidates of different backgrounds. MARTIN: Could it be that, for example, the recruiters are people you tend to recruit in their social networks and if their social networks are not diverse you're not even going to see resumes to get into the system. For example, you might not know anybody who went to HBCU. . . MEHRI: Exactly. MARTIN: . . . Or a Latino serving institution and therefore none of those candidates would even apply. MEHRI: Right. And the more proactive companies are looking at different forms of social media - they may look at root. com and not just at their - you know, the prior schools that people went to. So they'll just expand the horizons of what the possibilities are. And this is only about possibilities 'cause a candidate will still have to get in the process and compete and show the decision-maker what they have to offer. But when that happens, surprisingly, people that may have gone under the radar get discovered. And we've seen that happen over and over again whether you look at the success we've had with the NFL or companies that are less well-known. We've seen it happen over and over again - people getting discovered. MARTIN: Cyrus Mehri is a partner at the law firm Mehri and Skalet, PLLC. He was kind enough to join us from our studios in Washington, D. C. Cyrus, thanks so much for joining us once again. MEHRI: Thanks for having me.", "section": "Technology", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2014 NPR.  All rights reserved.

We've talked about the lack of access to computer science classes and so forth. Right now, though, we are going to flip that script. And we are going to meet a self-taught game developer from Miami, Fla. , whose app 4 Snaps is topping the charts on the App Store on iTunes. He's been so successful, he's been able to help his family financially when they've had some rough patches. And he was highlighted at Facebook's development conference last week by none other than Mark Zuckerburg. And, oh, by the way, did I mention he's 17 years old? Michael Sayman joins us now from member station WLRN in Miami. Michael, welcome. Congratulations on everything. MICHAEL SAYMAN: Thank you. Thank you so much. MARTIN: How did you get started coding? I understand that you literally taught yourself from - what - from YouTube tutorials? SAYMAN: Yeah, basically. That's how I got started. I actually - when I was around 12, 13 years old, I got interested in making apps. And basically what I wanted to do was just make them, right? I wanted to make a difference. Why not do something cool? So I just didn't really have any programming courses in my school or anything to go by. And I was like, well, the Internet exists, so I might as well just go on Google, YouTube and try to find out how to do it myself. MARTIN: So what did you look up? Did you look up how to code? I mean, did you even know what that word was? SAYMAN: I kind of had an idea about how to program and stuff because I knew some things on making websites and things like that. But I started getting into making apps, and it's a whole different world. It's, like, a lot more complicated, and I didn't know it at first. So I didn't understand how big of a world it is. And I just started looking up little things, like how to program certain things and little by little, piecing it together. It's no way the most efficient form of learning how to program. It took me forever, but it worked. MARTIN: It didn't take you forever. You're 17. (LAUGHTER)MARTIN: I'm sorry. I just thought I'd mention that. Anyway, so tell me about 4 Snaps. SAYMAN: I started working on it junior year during final exams. I know, very bad timing. But I actually got started on the app because I saw my sister texting her friend some of the pictures on her phone, and her friend was trying to guess what the pictures were. So, like, they were playing a little game through text messages. And I was like, oh, wow, this would be a really cool idea for a game, right, where people can take pictures and then have their friends guess what it is that they're taken a picture of, kind of like a word game. I had no idea how to start, but I basically said, well, I got to start doing something. So I started looking things up, getting things ready, and in no time, I had an app ready. MARTIN: At each stage you had to kind of figure out what you didn't know and learn that thing. What was the big hurdle to getting it done? SAYMAN: I didn't exactly know what a server was or any of that type of thing. Like, I had no idea what a backend service was. I didn't know anything about how to run games on the Internet. So I had to figure out how to make a game where people would send it to each other. I don't have big farms filled with servers to be able to store data of people. So I think that was one of the tougher things - like, having to deal with storage and making sure that images wouldn't take too much space on the servers and cost me money that I didn't have. So I basically tried to find a way to, like, grab the four pictures that people would take, combine them into one picture, upload them to the server, and then by the time they had to play the game, bring it back down from the server and split the picture back into four. MARTIN: Did your folks know what you were doing? 'Cause one of the things that struck me about this is that a lot of times, when a kid's spending a lot of time in his room on the computer, parents get annoyed. SAYMAN: Yeah. Yes. MARTIN: You know what I mean? They're like, go outside. . . SAYMAN: (Laughing) Yeah. MARTIN: . . . Or do you homework, or what are you doing? So what - how did you explain what you were spending all this time doing? SAYMAN: They didn't really understand what it was. Like, my app had reached number seven in the top reference charts for the first time. And I had told my dad in the morning, like, waking him up, look, look, the app is number seven. And he was more like, oh, that's nice - you know, that's nice. Go do your homework. Like, I was like, well, OK. They didn't really think it would make such an impact until I get the first paycheck of course. Once that happened, then constantly, hey, Michael, what rank is it? Or, hey, Michael, how's it going? MARTIN: That was from your first app right? How much did you make on your first app, roughly? SAYMAN: On the first day, I made, like, $40. The second day I made, like, $100. On the third day, like, $200. It just kept going like that. So it was, like, incredible for me to experience that because initially I was just hoping to make, like, $100 to buy myself, like, a concert ticket or something. But it turned out to be a lot more. MARTIN: It turned out to be a little better than that. SAYMAN: (Laughing) Yeah. MARTIN: Well, I understand it - that one of the things that you've been able to do is, like, help out your tuition, for example. . . SAYMAN: Yeah. MARTIN: . . . Your tuition and your sister's tuition and some things like that. SAYMAN: Since my parents weren't lucky enough to, you know, have all these things here and everything, I, you know, I told them, well, we're having bad economic situations, right? Well, it's the least thing I can do is help you guys, right? Like, they've been able to feed me every day, have a bed for me to sleep in, like, my entire life. So the least I can do is when they need the help, to help them out, right? So, like, I help pay the mortgage for the house and the rent for their small business and me and my sister's tuition - you know, anything I can do to help them. MARTIN: Well, congratulations. And I understand that you've got an internship coming up with Facebook, correct? SAYMAN: Yes. Yes, I - yes. MARTIN: And - this summer. And you graduate from high school in a couple of weeks. Congratulations on that. If it is fair to say, though, that your grades have kind of suffered a little bit in high school. . . SAYMAN: Yeah. MARTIN: . . . Because you've been spending a lot of time. . . SAYMAN: Yes. MARTIN: . . . It's kind of like you have a really demanding afterschool job. SAYMAN: Yeah. MARTIN: Right. Have teachers been tolerant of that or. . . SAYMAN: Well, actually. . . MARTIN: . . . Are they kind of annoyed that you're not, you know? SAYMAN: Yeah, they're kind of annoyed for the most part. But I'm worried about that because I kind of want a lot of teachers to know that technology is a big part of the world now and coding especially. In my school last year, they had canceled the whole computer science department. It was incredible. I was extremely furious about it. And the whole importance on coding is not as strong as I would love it to be, you know. There's so much opportunity out there for kids to learn how to code, and if schools were to take a bigger part in that, it would be amazing. But I feel like there's a big part with, like, teachers also. Like, I feel like teachers don't want to be the ones to not know things, right? And I feel like since a lot of students know a lot about technology and, like, iPads and how they work, I feel like teachers kind of don't want to embrace that technology 'cause of the fear that, you know, one day the student might outsmart the teacher. And I think teachers, you know, should try to learn, you know, the technology and try to just embrace, you know, the new stuff. MARTIN: I've been speaking with 17-year-old developer, entrepreneur Michael Sayman. His app 4 Snaps is one of the most popular on the iTunes App Store. And he was kind of to join us from our member station WLRN in Miami. Thank you for joining us. SAYMAN: No, thank you so much. And I hope you enjoy 4 Snaps with me.

Continuing with our top story today we want to look at what activists have been doing around the world in response to the kidnapping of those 200-plus schoolgirls in Nigeria. On Twitter, activists have started a hashtag campaign #BringBackOurGirls to keep focus on the crisis and to keep-up pressure on the government. We wanted to learn more, so we've called upon Nicole Lee, a human rights activist and until recently president of TransAfrica. That's a nonprofit organization based in Washington D. C. that was found by African-Americans to advance the interests of Africa and the Caribbean in U. S. policy. And she's with us now in our studios. Welcome back to the program. Thank you for joining us. NICOLE LEE: Thank you so much for having me. MARTIN: I wanted to start off by asking you about the Twitter campaign at the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls. I was wondering what we know about how this started. And I was also wondering if it is in part kind of an indictment of the media coverage and the mainstream media about this. LEE: Well, it's amazing because certainly we know there are all these Twitter spheres, if you will. So there is an African Twitter. And so this started on African Twitter. I know I saw it about a week ago #BringBackOurGirls. And it was very clear that it was coming from Nigeria. It was Nigerian Twitter followers that were really retweeting and retweeting and it became a trend. There were others that were also trying to capture it, but I think the message of #BringBackOurGirls really caught on because it makes anyone who's tweeting it - you have to take ownership of these young women, even though they're - Nigeria. You may not have ever been to Nigeria, yet we all have to take ownership of the girls. And I think that that's one of the reasons why it's so very powerful. It's indigenous to Nigeria and it's something that we all can support. MARTIN: Well, speaking of this sense of ownership of it, what is your role as an activist, as an American activist, at a time like this? LEE: You know, I think about 30 years ago when we were working on the anti-apartheid movement as Americans and as TransAfrica - and what was our role back then? And I really think it is to stand in solidarity with the people of Nigeria, with the families. That not necessarily - we don't always need to be in the lead, but we can always follow and we can always support. One of the things that's really changed in the last 30 years is the diaspora organizations, but just the diaspora members. So we have so many Nigerian-Americans here now or first or second generation Nigerians that are really taking the lead in New York and in Washington. I was at the demonstration in Washington. And it was amazing how many young Nigerians were out. And it was also amazing how many Americans who are not from Nigeria - white, black, Latina - also came out and really supported it. So I think, at a time like this, we really need to first get our lead from what the diaspora are saying here in the United States. And what I'm hearing them say is they want to hold the Nigerian government accountable. MARTIN: Is there something that, you know, putting on your hat as a long time lobbyist - is there something in U. S. policy that you feel could be used to address this government to government? LEE: You know, there's a couple things that certainly come to mind for me. I mean, one of the things that we don't talk about here in the United States is this growing internal displacement problem in Nigeria. A part of the reason why we have conflict in countries like Nigeria is because people are not heard in the democratic process. That's something that our government can certainly be talking about. But then also there are issues of resources. And resource are so very important. In the same Northeast region that we're talking about where these girls were kidnapped, we also have a situation of displacement, where people are not getting resource from the oil sharing. That's something that our government certainly can talk about and get involved with. But also the fact that people don't feel heard in the democratic process. So the fact that these girls - like some of your guests have already talked about - are literally being used as pawns, if you will, in the upcoming election. I mean, at least that's what it looks like from the reports we're getting. Certainly, we hope that our State Department is talking about that. We hope that the corporations, the vast corporations - American corporations, that are doing business in Nigeria are also asking questions and see it as their role - not to certainly attempt to take away sovereignty from the government - but to ask serious questions. There's certainly, you know, a lot of profit being made right now in Nigeria. We need to make sure that the people of Nigeria can live in safety and in prosperity as well. MARTIN: Before we let you go, I wanted to take note that you recently concluded eight years of service as the president of TransAfrica, which is kind of a very high-profile organization in Washington D. C. Can I ask about the timing? Why now? I mean, is it in part because as an activist you want the freedom to offer critique from outside? I mean, originally the kind of role of TransAfrica was to elevate the interests of Africa and the Caribbean within the halls of the U. S. government. Is partly what you're saying with your resignation that you feel a need - that there are - sometimes you need to critique these governments and the way to do that is from the outside? LEE: I mean, I think that there's a lot of different reasons. Certainly, right now there's a plethora of issues that have now kind of fallen into my lap, if you will, that I definitely want to talk about. But in terms of critique, I actually think it's more a critique of American leadership, if you will. Listen, you know, my personal opinion is as a leader of a nonprofit, it's amazing - opportunity. You need to really though do your job in seven to 10 years. This is not a dynasty. This is not Nicole Lee's dynasty. I really wanted to make sure  that I contributed to TransAfrica, but at the same time didn't get founder's syndrome, even though I'm not the founder - didn't get that founder's syndrome where I thought that I was the only person that could do the job. And that's really something that I wanted to hold myself accountable to more than anything else. I am so excited though, because I see the changes in TransAfrica - the young people that are now involved, the diaspora folks that feel comfortable engaging in our organization. It's just - it's been an amazing ride. MARTIN: Nicole Lee is a human rights activist. She is currently involved with the hashtag campaign #BringBackOurGirls. It's aimed at keeping focus on the kidnapping of those 200-plus schoolgirls in Nigeria. She recently concluded eight years as president of TransAfrica and she joined us in Washington D. C. Nicole Lee, thank you for joining us. LEE: Thank you. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  I am Michel Martin and this is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. Continuing with our top story today we want to look at what activists have been doing around the world in response to the kidnapping of those 200-plus schoolgirls in Nigeria. On Twitter, activists have started a hashtag campaign #BringBackOurGirls to keep focus on the crisis and to keep-up pressure on the government.

C. that was found by African-Americans to advance the interests of Africa and the Caribbean in U. S. policy. And she's with us now in our studios. Welcome back to the program. Thank you for joining us. NICOLE LEE: Thank you so much for having me. MARTIN: I wanted to start off by asking you about the Twitter campaign at the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls. I was wondering what we know about how this started. And I was also wondering if it is in part kind of an indictment of the media coverage and the mainstream media about this. LEE: Well, it's amazing because certainly we know there are all these Twitter spheres, if you will. So there is an African Twitter. And so this started on African Twitter. I know I saw it about a week ago #BringBackOurGirls. And it was very clear that it was coming from Nigeria. It was Nigerian Twitter followers that were really retweeting and retweeting and it became a trend. There were others that were also trying to capture it, but I think the message of #BringBackOurGirls really caught on because it makes anyone who's tweeting it - you have to take ownership of these young women, even though they're - Nigeria. You may not have ever been to Nigeria, yet we all have to take ownership of the girls. And I think that that's one of the reasons why it's so very powerful. It's indigenous to Nigeria and it's something that we all can support. MARTIN: Well, speaking of this sense of ownership of it, what is your role as an activist, as an American activist, at a time like this? LEE: You know, I think about 30 years ago when we were working on the anti-apartheid movement as Americans and as TransAfrica - and what was our role back then? And I really think it is to stand in solidarity with the people of Nigeria, with the families. That not necessarily - we don't always need to be in the lead, but we can always follow and we can always support. One of the things that's really changed in the last 30 years is the diaspora organizations, but just the diaspora members. So we have so many Nigerian-Americans here now or first or second generation Nigerians that are really taking the lead in New York and in Washington. I was at the demonstration in Washington. And it was amazing how many young Nigerians were out. And it was also amazing how many Americans who are not from Nigeria - white, black, Latina - also came out and really supported it. So I think, at a time like this, we really need to first get our lead from what the diaspora are saying here in the United States. And what I'm hearing them say is they want to hold the Nigerian government accountable. MARTIN: Is there something that, you know, putting on your hat as a long time lobbyist - is there something in U. S. policy that you feel could be used to address this government to government? LEE: You know, there's a couple things that certainly come to mind for me. I mean, one of the things that we don't talk about here in the United States is this growing internal displacement problem in Nigeria. A part of the reason why we have conflict in countries like Nigeria is because people are not heard in the democratic process. That's something that our government can certainly be talking about. But then also there are issues of resources. And resource are so very important. In the same Northeast region that we're talking about where these girls were kidnapped, we also have a situation of displacement, where people are not getting resource from the oil sharing. That's something that our government certainly can talk about and get involved with. But also the fact that people don't feel heard in the democratic process. So the fact that these girls - like some of your guests have already talked about - are literally being used as pawns, if you will, in the upcoming election. I mean, at least that's what it looks like from the reports we're getting. Certainly, we hope that our State Department is talking about that. We hope that the corporations, the vast corporations - American corporations, that are doing business in Nigeria are also asking questions and see it as their role - not to certainly attempt to take away sovereignty from the government - but to ask serious questions. There's certainly, you know, a lot of profit being made right now in Nigeria. We need to make sure that the people of Nigeria can live in safety and in prosperity as well. MARTIN: Before we let you go, I wanted to take note that you recently concluded eight years of service as the president of TransAfrica, which is kind of a very high-profile organization in Washington D. C. Can I ask about the timing? Why now? I mean, is it in part because as an activist you want the freedom to offer critique from outside? I mean, originally the kind of role of TransAfrica was to elevate the interests of Africa and the Caribbean within the halls of the U. S. government. Is partly what you're saying with your resignation that you feel a need - that there are - sometimes you need to critique these governments and the way to do that is from the outside? LEE: I mean, I think that there's a lot of different reasons. Certainly, right now there's a plethora of issues that have now kind of fallen into my lap, if you will, that I definitely want to talk about. But in terms of critique, I actually think it's more a critique of American leadership, if you will. Listen, you know, my personal opinion is as a leader of a nonprofit, it's amazing - opportunity. You need to really though do your job in seven to 10 years. This is not a dynasty. This is not Nicole Lee's dynasty. I really wanted to make sure  that I contributed to TransAfrica, but at the same time didn't get founder's syndrome, even though I'm not the founder - didn't get that founder's syndrome where I thought that I was the only person that could do the job. And that's really something that I wanted to hold myself accountable to more than anything else. I am so excited though, because I see the changes in TransAfrica - the young people that are now involved, the diaspora folks that feel comfortable engaging in our organization. It's just - it's been an amazing ride. MARTIN: Nicole Lee is a human rights activist. She is currently involved with the hashtag campaign #BringBackOurGirls. It's aimed at keeping focus on the kidnapping of those 200-plus schoolgirls in Nigeria. She recently concluded eight years as president of TransAfrica and she joined us in Washington D. C. Nicole Lee, thank you for joining us. LEE: Thank you.", "section": "Technology", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2014 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Dictionaries accept either pronunciation. And by either pronunciation the Museum of the Moving Image in Queens, New York is giving the GIF GIF its own show. NPR's Neda Ulaby paid a visit. NEDA ULABY, BYLINE: Maybe the least interesting thing about the GIF, G-I-F, is what it stands for, graphic interchange format. A GIF is a little box showing a loop of someone doing something over and over. Museum-goer Abee Cox sees them used as comments on Facebook, Tumblr and Reddit. ABEE COX: They're gestures that are sort of hard to put into words. ULABY: Like Oprah shaking her head in a way that says, unmistakably, unh-unh. Unh-unh-unh. Or a GIF of a saucer-eyed baby freaking out over a toy can show you're startled or thrilled or both. COX: It's all about context and that's why I think this is a great exhibit. ULABY: The exhibit is 37 little GIFs projected by the museum's stark white entrance. They're reactions used to respond to other people's posts, so the GIF of actress Jennifer Lawrence giving side-eye and a sarcastic thumbs up means. . . COX: Yeah, okay, sure. JASON EPPINK: For most of human history, we've communicated face to face. ULABY: That's the curator of this exhibition. Jason Eppink is a lanky 30-year-old in a plaid blazer and T-shirt. He says GIFs can be jumping animals or angry sports fans, but GIFs of actors bring multiple layers of meaning because we associate them with their characters. Take a GIF of Larry David as a neurotic writer on his TV show, \"Curb Your Enthusiasm. \"EPPINK: Furrowed brow, it's like he's sort of shaking his head in a way, like he's, like, weighing both sides. It's so complex and so nuanced. ULABY: And so economical. The clip is five seconds long. EPPINK: You could've seen the GIF looped 10 times already in the time it took me to, like, explain that. ULABY: Eppink asked users of the website Reddit to submit GIFs and explain how they're used. Those explanations are captions in the exhibit so when you see the GIF of Larry David shaking his head, it's clear what someone means when they post it. I value your argument and want to agree with you, but. . . GLADYS FLORES: Yeah, but I'm not prepared for the consequences of doing so. ULABY: Gladys Flores is at the museum with her daughter. Until now she'd never even seen a GIF. FLORES: I'm not really, really into computers. ULABY: While the expressions and gestures in GIFs are not necessarily universal, GIFs has become integral to the internet vernacular. Julia Flores hangs out on comment boards and she uses GIFs. . . JULIA FLORES: All the time when I try to express stuff. You always use Paul Rudd dancing 'cause that's the best way to express happiness. ULABY: There's not really a word in English that sums up the uninhibited charm of actor Paul Rudd dancing.

I'm Melissa Block. And now for All Tech Considered. (SOUNDBITE OF THEME MUSIC)BLOCK: Our tech team is homing in on the burgeoning market for drones or unmanned aircraft. There are three reasons behind out focus. First, drones are cheaper than ever. Second, from farmers to realtors, business people want to use them. And third, the FAA is working on new rules to allow that. Well, here's an example of a possible hazard. The FAA is investigating a close call, a near collision last month near a Florida airport. The pilot of a commuter jet says he encountered a remotely-piloted craft in restricted airspace, some 2,300 feet up. Unmanned aircraft can be small and hard for pilots to see. NPR's Steve Henn reports on some research aimed at solving that problem. (SOUNDBITE OF A DRONE REVVING UP)STEVE HENN, BYLINE: Weston Swetich and Matthew Braunberger are building a drone at the University of North Dakota's school of engineering. WESTON SWETICH: Kind of like a helicopter in a sense. It just hovers. So you have control over pitch, roll and yaw. HENN: They're on a bit of an odd mission. Will Semke is their professor. WILL SEMKE: To build a quad rotor aircraft - that in an indoor testing facility to heard a bunch of robots - they're the iRobots. HENN: What Weston and Matthew are trying to do is build a flying drone that will herd those little iRobots, you know the vacuum cleaners, around a room like sheep - but the trick is the drone has to do this all automatically with no human intervention. SEMKE: And what we had to do was take an aircraft and autonomously have it look at what the robots are doing and decide what action should be taken - should they get in front of them so they turn around, should they tap them on the top so they change direction, and herd these things into a desired target area. HENN: Their little quad copter has four rotor blades and is about three feet across. It looks like t a bigger version of the kind of unmanned craft you may have seen in a hobby shop. And their drone needs to identify and track the iRobots visually - using basic cameras - they same way a private pilot would track other planes in the air. Will Semke says this challenge is pretty similar to the one unmanned aircraft will face when flying through crowed airspace. SEMKE: Well the similarity is you have information and you have to have a computer system evaluate that information, predict what is going to happen in the future and then act in the most responsible way. HENN: But when you are herding real airplanes instead of iRobots, the stakes are much higher. The FAA began testing how to integrate commercial drones into U. S. airspace last week. Bob Becklund runs the Northern Plains Unmanned Aerial Systems Test Site. One of six facilities around the county selected to test the use of unmanned aircraft. BOB BECKLUND: And the FAA's next generation system relies on digital technology for air craft positional awareness. HENN: Researchers like Will Semke and other have already used these digital beacons to test how automated drones would behave in crowded airspace. The system is called ADS-B. SEMKE: And what that basically does is, on an aircraft, it's spitting out its locations, GPS locations, and its heading and all that stuff. And so we know where everything is. HENN: But this only works if every aircraft in the sky is equipped to send and receive these signals. And right now small private planes are not. ADS-B has also been hacked. Its signals are unencrypted. So Will Semke believes the FAA's next-generation system is only part of the answer. SEMKE: One of the problems is geese don't want to wear ADS-B systems and they're not going to. (LAUGHTER)HENN: Still, Will Semke is optimist. He says the kind of research his students are doing, teaching drones to see, will eventually help drones fly safely almost to anywhere. But he believes getting there may take years.

You're probably seeing a lot of ads for smartphones and other gadgets that a graduate might like. There are a lot out there, and they're changing all the time. And that made us think that technology is not the only thing changing quickly. There are also new ways to store information. We're no longer storing documents and photos on hard drives or USB sticks or even CDs or floppy disks, if you remember those. Many people today rely on clouds like Google Drive or Dropbox. And these allow us to access important documents anywhere on almost any device. But we wanted to know just how secure are clouds, and what should we know before we use them? Joining us to tell us more is Nicole Perlroth. She is technology reporter for The New York Times, and she's with us now. Nicole, thanks so much for joining us. NICOLE PERLROTH: My pleasure. Thanks for having me. MARTIN: For people who are not familiar with the term, can you just tell us what a cloud is? PERLROTH: So the cloud is a really nebulous term - no pun intended - for computing done remotely. So you're using the cloud if you are working off of your Google Drive and you're creating a document in Google Drive, you're working from the cloud. You are using the cloud when you do online banking. You're using the cloud when you store something in a Dropbox account. And you're even using the cloud when you're watching Netflix because Netflix outsources its data storage to Amazon's Web Services, which is a cloud-computing provider. MARTIN: Do you even have a choice anymore about whether you use the cloud? PERLROTH: You do have a choice, but it's getting - people are moving to the cloud at a very fast rate. So gone are the days for small companies when most of their data is stored down the hall in a computing room. A lot of small and medium-sized businesses now outsource their data storage and data security to services like Amazon and Google and Rackspace and a number of cloud providers. And, yes, you can still store documents on your computer or on your hard drive or on a time machine, but a lot of people are now migrating to the cloud because it's cheap. It's easy to access your documents from different devices, which is very convenient. And in a lot of businesses' cases, it's cheaper for them to sort of outsource their data storage and data security to someone like Amazon than to go build out their own warehouses to store their data themselves. MARTIN: And of course, if you lose that particular device or if it breaks, of course people are just, you know, they're stuck. They're lost. It's almost like losing that old address book. And this way you - it's automatically sort of available somewhere else. PERLROTH: Right. MARTIN: But is there a downside? I mean, a lot of people are familiar with those big security breaches at the retailers that became known at the end of last year - right? - after the kind of Christmas or even in the middle of the Christmas shopping season. A lot of people were just terrified that they were suddenly exposed and all their personal data was exposed. Is there something that people should know or be aware of about this? PERLROTH: Yeah, there are definitely risks. And one of them is, say, your cloud provider goes out of business. Say they're having financial troubles and they go out of business, and they take all your data with them. Say that there is an outage - and this has actually happened several times, usually due to storms. But Amazon has a huge data warehouse in Virginia, and there's been a couple times where it's had an outage. And suddenly you saw all these services they interface with, like Instagram and Pinterest and Netflix, all suddenly have problems because so much of their businesses are dependent on Amazon's - Amazon Web Services. So, you know, you want to make sure that whoever you're storing your data within the cloud isn't likely to go out of business tomorrow and same for security. You know, all - what we're doing now with the cloud is we're sort of aggregating so much different data from so many different services in one cloud storage provider. And so if  that cloud storage provider is not handling their infrastructure correctly or is not devoting enough resources to their security or hiring the right personnel or ensuring that they're not going to go out of business anytime soon or that a storm at one of their facilities doesn't affect all of their data, then you're certainly putting your data at risk. MARTIN: So what are some of the common sense things that you do to insulate or protect yourself from these negative consequences? We have a about a minute and a half left. Can you just give us some things that people can be doing on a commonsense basis 'cause you surely can't - you can't, you know, go and check their hiring records and say are you sure you got the right people here? PERLROTH: Right. MARTIN: What can you do? PERLROTH: Right. So I am notoriously paranoid because I am a cybersecurity reporter, and we have - ourselves here at the New York Times - dealt with a breach from a foreign nation state. So I'm notoriously paranoid. So I won't put anything very crucial - I won't put any of my sources' information in my Dropbox account, for example, or on Google Drive. But I do use it for things like my photos. I will - you know, I don't just want my photos saved on my phone. I will save them to my computer, and then I'll save them to my Dropbox account so that if I lose my phone or my computer crashes, at least I can access my photos from my Dropbox account. But for things like my Social Security number or things that, you know, if a cybercriminal got a hold of them or the NSA got a hold of them, I would be in deep trouble, I don't put that stuff in the cloud. And I would say that I'm very much on the paranoid side of the spectrum. But if you want to be very secure, I would be very careful about what you're storing where. MARTIN: Nicole Perlroth is technology reporter for The New York Times. She covers cybersecurity issues, as she just mentioned. And she was kind enough to join us from New York City. Nicole, thanks so much for joining us. PERLROTH: Thanks so much for having me. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Switching gears now.

So, you know, you want to make sure that whoever you're storing your data within the cloud isn't likely to go out of business tomorrow and same for security. You know, all - what we're doing now with the cloud is we're sort of aggregating so much different data from so many different services in one cloud storage provider. And so if  that cloud storage provider is not handling their infrastructure correctly or is not devoting enough resources to their security or hiring the right personnel or ensuring that they're not going to go out of business anytime soon or that a storm at one of their facilities doesn't affect all of their data, then you're certainly putting your data at risk. MARTIN: So what are some of the common sense things that you do to insulate or protect yourself from these negative consequences? We have a about a minute and a half left. Can you just give us some things that people can be doing on a commonsense basis 'cause you surely can't - you can't, you know, go and check their hiring records and say are you sure you got the right people here? PERLROTH: Right. MARTIN: What can you do? PERLROTH: Right. So I am notoriously paranoid because I am a cybersecurity reporter, and we have - ourselves here at the New York Times - dealt with a breach from a foreign nation state. So I'm notoriously paranoid. So I won't put anything very crucial - I won't put any of my sources' information in my Dropbox account, for example, or on Google Drive. But I do use it for things like my photos. I will - you know, I don't just want my photos saved on my phone. I will save them to my computer, and then I'll save them to my Dropbox account so that if I lose my phone or my computer crashes, at least I can access my photos from my Dropbox account. But for things like my Social Security number or things that, you know, if a cybercriminal got a hold of them or the NSA got a hold of them, I would be in deep trouble, I don't put that stuff in the cloud. And I would say that I'm very much on the paranoid side of the spectrum. But if you want to be very secure, I would be very careful about what you're storing where. MARTIN: Nicole Perlroth is technology reporter for The New York Times. She covers cybersecurity issues, as she just mentioned. And she was kind enough to join us from New York City. Nicole, thanks so much for joining us. PERLROTH: Thanks so much for having me.", "section": "Technology", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2014 NPR.  All rights reserved.

And yet, a new survey finds the number of American teens reading for pleasure has dropped dramatically. NPR's Jennifer Ludden reports. JENNIFER LUDDEN, BYLINE: For sure, \"Harry Potter\" and \"The Hunger Games\" haven't been big hits for nothing. Lots of teens and adolescents still do read, a lot. But a roundup of studies, put together by the non-profit Common Sense Media, shows a clear decline over time. JIM STEYER: For example, 45 percent of 17 year olds today say they read for pleasure, no more than 1-to-2 times a year, if that often. LUDDEN: That's way down from a decade ago, says Jim Steyer, head of Common Sense Media. Among 13 year olds, a third say they read for pleasure only once or twice a year. STEYER: As a parent and an educator, this is a really big deal. LUDDEN: Steyer studies the impact of technology on children and he finds the results striking, though not shocking. He has four kids, and has seen the trend - mostly with his 16-year-old. STEYER: And I start to see it in our 10-year-old as well because he is less and less reading, and more and more attracted to some of the digital media platforms that he has access to - and that he did not have access to when he was, say, you know, six or seven years old. LUDDEN: Now the studies do not say kids are reading less because they're spending more time online. But Steyer is convinced that's at least p art of the answer. STEYER: First of all, most children now have access to e-readers, or other smart electronic devices like phones and tablets. And they're spending time on that. Numerous reports show the increasing use of new technology platforms by kids. It just strikes me as extremely logical that that's a big factor. JAMAHRI SYDNOR: I don't really read for pleasure. CHIAMAKA ANOSIKE: I don't read for pleasure either, unless it's for a school assignment. LUDDEN: Jamahri Sydnor and Chiamaka Anosike are ninth graders, waiting for the bus outside Wilson High School in Washington, D. C. So how do they relax? . ANOSIKE: Generally, I talk on the phone. Or I watch, like, Netflix shows or Hulu shows. Mostly TV, that's it. I'm usually on my phone or watching TV, too. LUDDEN: Of course, some students say they love to read but have too much homework, or are swamped with sports. Researchers want to know more about how teens are spending their time in the digital age. But Kathryn Zickuhr, of the Pew Research Center, says it's tricky. If a kid is looking at a book, you say they're reading. But looking at a Smartphone or tablet? Well, who knows? KATHRYN ZICKUHR: And we've heard from middle and high school teachers that sometimes the Internet is wonderful for highly-motivated students to do deep and expansive research. But on the flip side, obviously there are many distractions on the Internet. LUDDEN: Despite those distractions, Jim Steyer, of Common Sense Media, says parents can still do a lot to promote reading. STEYER: Kids with parents who read, who buy or take books out of the library for their kids, and who then set a time aside in their kids' daily schedule for reading, tend to read the most.

I'm Melissa Block. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: And I'm Audie Cornish. Today, the Kansas Board of Regents gave final approval to a strict new policy on what its employees can say on social media. Critics say it violates the First Amendment and academic freedom. Peggy Lowe of member station KCUR reports on a controversial policy that was triggered by an equally-controversial tweet. PEGGY LOWE, BYLINE: That tweet was posted last September by David Guth, an associate journalism professor. Reacting to a lone gunman killing 12 people at the Washington Navy Yard, he wrote: The blood is on the hands of the NRA. Next time, let it be your sons and daughters. Guth was placed on administrative leave after an outcry by the public and lawmakers. REPRESENTATIVE TRAVIS COUTURE-LOVELADY: Well, I was outraged, actually. LOWE: That's Representative Travis Couture-Lovelady, a member of the Kansas House and a member of the National Rifle Association. He supports the Board of Regents' new policy to place parameters on professors. COUTURE-LOVELADY: Look, you have freedom of speech, but you can't go this far, so I think having a clear understanding between faculty and the Board of Regents on what's acceptable and what's not is better for everyone involved. LOWE: The new policy says faculty and staff may not say anything on social media that would incite violence, disclose confidential student information, or release protected data. But it also says staffers are barred from saying anything, quote, \"contrary to the best interests of the university. \" Critics say the broad nature of the guidelines would offer administrators enormous latitude in firing people, even those with tenure. Will Creeley of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education says it is one of the most restrictive social media policies in the country. WILL CREELEY: I mean, we have a First Amendment to protect controversial statements like Professor Guth's. We don't have it to protect pictures of kittens posted on Facebook. If you punish a student or a professor for a clearly protected speech, you send a message to everyone else on campus that you better watch what you say. BURDETT LOOMIS: All of this has to be taken into account in the context of a very, very conservative Kansas legislature that has very little sympathy, I think, for higher education. LOWE: That's KU political science professor Burdett Loomis, who says the Regents are scared of Kansas lawmakers, who hold the university's purse strings. And the Board is appointed by the governor, conservative Republican Sam Brownback. Loomis scrolls down his Facebook page to recall the reaction he posted last December, when the Regents first announced a new policy was in the works. LOOMIS: OK, OK, here we go. This is right when it came out. Unbelievably broad and vague set of policies. Perfect example of using a nuclear weapon to destroy a gnat of a pseudo problem. LOWE: Chair of the Board of Regents Fred Logan dismissed that controversy about the policy as ludicrous. When it was finalized at today's meeting, he defended the new policy and even claimed it would shore up academic freedom by creating more specific guidelines. FRED LOGAN: In many respects, the work that has been done has really focused on lifting up academic freedom as a core principal for the Kansas Board of Regents. Now, that may sound funny, but if you look in our policy manual, there's really not much in there about that. LOWE: And the professor who triggered the policy? David Guth spent this semester on a sabbatical in far western Kansas. But he's still talking.

The FCC voted to open up public debate on proposed Internet rules. There were protests before and during the meeting. And inside the meeting room and across the country, there's a lot of concern that the Web, as we know it, is in peril. NPR's Laura Sydell has more. LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE: A few weeks back, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler announced he would propose new rules to govern Internet traffic. There were suggestions that his proposals would permit broadband providers, like Comcast or Verizon, to charge extra to get on a fast lane into consumers' homes. So Netflix could make a deal with Comcast to get better speeds than, say, Amazon. Leaks and rumors about the proposals drew public ire. During today's meeting, FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn acknowledged that the protest, which included her own objections - had an impact on what was being introduced today. MIGNON CLYBURN: This item has changed considerably over the last few weeks. And I appreciate the chairman for incorporating my many requests to do so. SYDELL: Clyburn also made it clear that the vote taking place was on proposed rules, not final ones. CLYBURN: This item is an official call inviting interested parties to comment, to discuss pros and cons of various approaches, and to have a robust dialogue about the best path forward. SYDELL: But not all five commissioners were even ready to vote to open dialogue on any rules made by the FCC. Two commissioners, both Republican appointees, raised objections. Commissioner Ajit Pai said Congress should be consulted before taking action. AJIT PAI: A dispute this fundamental is not for us - five unelected individuals - to decide. Instead, it should be resolved by the people's elected representatives.

SYDELL: That's Chairman Tom Wheeler whose approach to keeping the Internet open has been at the center of criticism from all sides. Previous open Internet rules were challenged by broadband providers such as Comcast and Verizon. And a federal appeals court struck down the last version of the rules in January. But the court left room for the commission to take more limited action. Wheeler says working within the framework of the court's decision is the best way forward. WHEELER: My preference has been to follow the road map laid out by the D. C. circuit in the belief that it was the fastest and best way to get protections in place. SYDELL: But many believe Wheeler's approach is too weak and say it will draw more litigation, and let broadband providers sell fast lanes to consumers to the highest bidder. They want the FCC to reclassify the Internet under something called Title II. This would make broadband more like phone lines, which the FCC regulates heavily. Wheeler says the new proposal asks for public comment on the issue of reclassification. WHEELER: This rulemaking begins the process by putting forth a proposal, asking important and specific questions, and opening the discussion to all Americans. SYDELL: With so many Americans online, opinions about the future of the Internet are not hard to find.

Canoes modeled after ancient Polynesian vessels will set sail on a three-year trip around the world. Instead of using modern instruments, the sailors and scientists will rely on the wind and the stars. Molly Solomon of Hawaii Public Radio reports. MOLLY SOLOMON, BYLINE: It's a gusty day at the Sand Island boat harbor on O'ahu's South Shore. Captain Bob Perkins says it's a perfect day for sailing. BOB PERKINS: Here we go. You can step anywhere on there. There you go. Then you can come around. SOLOMON: We hop aboard the deck of the Hokulea, a replica of the traditional double-hold voyaging canoe Polynesians used centuries ago. PERKINS: All of our cooking is done on deck. I guess you could say this would be our living room, our kitchen, our dining room. Every room in the house is this deck that we're on now. SOLOMON: The 62-foot, double-hold Hokulea is not your average sea vessel. A couple sails, a wooden oar to steer, and about five miles of rope to hold the canoe together. Perkins says what you won't find on board is any type of navigational instrument, no GPS, no compass, not even a watch. PERKINS: The watch and hours really don't mean much once you're at sea. Natural wayfinding is when we have no instruments, much like what the ancient Polynesians and Hawaiians did. SOLOMON: Hokulea's sister canoe, Hikianalia, does pack technical gear. It'll trail the Hokulea for safety. Perkins says they'll travel to 26 countries over the course of 50,000 miles. PERKINS: To try and prove the idea that Polynesians and Hawaiians actually did purposefully transit the oceans. NAINOA THOMPSON: It's allowing us to do what we do because of who we are. You know, we're voyagers. SOLOMON: Nainoa Thompson is president of the Polynesian Voyaging Society. He famously navigated the Hokulea across the Pacific 40 years ago. THOMPSON: For me, it's ancestral. It's a science and it's an art that's traditional, that's about 3,000 years old. It's part of human migration throughout the Pacific. It allows me to be here and be who I am as a native Hawaiian because without it, we couldn't make it to Hawaii. SOLOMON: Thompson learned the ancient tradition from Micronesian master navigator Mau Piailug, who passed away in 2010. This trip is different from the voyage of the Kon-Tiki in the 1940s. It's about more than proving that traditional wayfinding is possible. Thompson says it's about passing on a cultural legacy to a new generation. THOMPSON: The way that you do that is to explore. And the way that you do that is to challenge. And this voyage is not going to be easy. That's why it's powerful. SOLOMON: Both the Hokulea and the Hikianalia set sail from O'ahu to Tahiti at sunset tonight, using the stars to guide them on the first leg of their voyage.

SOLOMON: Thompson learned the ancient tradition from Micronesian master navigator Mau Piailug, who passed away in 2010. This trip is different from the voyage of the Kon-Tiki in the 1940s. It's about more than proving that traditional wayfinding is possible. Thompson says it's about passing on a cultural legacy to a new generation. THOMPSON: The way that you do that is to explore. And the way that you do that is to challenge. And this voyage is not going to be easy. That's why it's powerful. SOLOMON: Both the Hokulea and the Hikianalia set sail from O'ahu to Tahiti at sunset tonight, using the stars to guide them on the first leg of their voyage.

Her new book is called \"Now I Know Who My Comrades Are: Voices from the Underground. \"Emily Parker, thanks for coming in to our New York bureau. EMILY PARKER: Thank you so much for having me. CORNISH: So your research comes in part from interviews with bloggers and online activists in countries like Russia. Give us a sense, what are some of the advantages that they have today compared to a generation or two ago? PARKER: Well, my book focuses on the psychological impact of the Internet in countries like China, Cuba and Russia. And in particular, how online activists can use the Internet to overcome isolation, fear and apathy. Because isolation, fear and apathy are among the most effective weapons of authoritarian regimes. So, for example, I talk about ordinary bloggers in Cuba who start writing blogs and, for the first time, they feel that they can express themselves freely. Or, for example, I talk about the famous Russian blogger Alexei Navalny, who launched anti-corruption campaigns on the Internet and helped ordinary Russians show that they could make a difference. CORNISH: So let's break this down further. As you said, isolation, fear and apathy. In the book, I think you call them the lifeblood of authoritarian regimes. PARKER: That's right. CORNISH: So the first, isolation. This seems fairly obvious but talk about how it plays out for people under these regimes. PARKER: In a country like China, for example, we talk a lot about Chinese censorship. And people tend to think that Chinese authorities censor words that are critical of the government. The truth is the Chinese government is far more concerned about collective action. They're concerned about assembly. And ever since the 1989 demonstrations that swept across the country and led to the Tiananmen crackdown of 1989, the Communist Party has been extremely nervous about any kind of physical gathering. And it's very dangerous for critics of the party to gather in the real world. So, for critics of the Chinese government, the Internet is the one place where they find that they are not alone. CORNISH: The other issue is fear. And when you look at the way that regimes around the world have been only too happy to crack down on dissent, how has this really made a difference? PARKER: So I don't want to downplay how tough authoritarian regimes can be on Internet activists. This is a serious and real threat. But I've also seen Internet activists overcome their fears. And I talk about this in particular in Cuba. I talk about, for example, a blogger named Loritza who, you know, early on in her life was afraid to express herself freely. And when she started writing her blog, she felt that she found her voice. She felt that she could express herself. She felt that she had a network of international readers that afforded her some degree of protection. So even as she maneuvered this web of surveillance and intimidation and harassment, Loritza described herself as free. CORNISH: Another issue you talk about is the idea of apathy. And I would think that this seems like the hardest to overcome, right, to kind of make a really foundational shift in a society? Give us an example where you've seen this shift, where you think it makes a difference. PARKER: So I think in a country like Russia, for example, there was an off-cited survey in which 85 percent of Russians felt that they had no impact on their political system. And the Internet alone is not going to change that reality. But what Internet activists can do is show ordinary citizens that they can make a difference. And that's why someone like the prominent opposition blogger Alexei Navalny is so effective. He told me years ago, I propose to people the comfortable way of struggle. And what he meant was he wasn't calling Russians out into the streets. He was saying: Please, fill out this online form. He would try to show ordinary Russians that they could protest corruption from the convenience of their living rooms and that sometimes they could win. CORNISH: But, you know, since the book was published, President Putin signed a law requiring popular bloggers to register with the government. You've also told a story in the book about a popular Russian blogger was actually invited to the Kremlin and sort of had a change of point of view. Does this indicate a kind of savviness by the government? And does this indicate that the Russian government perceives a growing threat? PARKER: It absolutely indicates that the Russian government perceives a growing threat. And it indicates that the Internet finally matters in Russia. I mean, just a few years ago, the Internet, again, it was sort of seen as this virtual playground. It's like, you can say whatever you want online because the Internet doesn't really matter. And in 2011 and 2012, there were these large anti-Putin demonstrations in Russia and some of these were organized online. And I think that alerted Kremlin to the fact that the Internet could actually be a political threat. So the reason they're cracking down on the Internet now is because they take the Internet a lot more seriously. CORNISH: Emily Parker, her new book is \"Now I Know Who My Comrades Are: Voices From The Internet Underground. \" She joined us from our New York bureau. Emily Parker, thank you.

I'm Audie Cornish. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: And I'm Robert Siegel. (SOUNDBITE OF THEME MUSIC)SIEGEL: In All Tech Considered today, the Internet and political discord. Ukraine is preparing for presidential elections on Sunday and a social media struggle is being waged in the country's eastern provinces. That's where pro-Russian separatists have seized government buildings and, after a disputed referendum, declared independence. Bloggers on all sides are trying to get their points across. Many are facing surveillance, Internet trolls and threats as they work. NPR's Corey Flintoff reports from Donetsk. (SOUNDBITE OF TYPING)COREY FLINTOFF, BYLINE: To some people in eastern Ukraine, the sound of a computer keyboard has become a dangerous and subversive thing. That's because with armed pro-Russian separatists occupying key points in many cities, it's become dangerous to oppose them. Bloggers are using the relative safety of the Internet to express themselves, but even that has risks. ALEXSEY RYABCHYN: I know a lot of people that received threats and they left to Kiev or to another cities because they are afraid for their life and there was a real threat. FLINTOFF: That's Alexsey Ryabchyn, a professor at Donetsk National University and a popular blogger. He says that because he tries to be completely independent, showing both sides of the conflict, he's never been threatened, although he does get attacks. RYABCHYN: These trolls come like saying, you know, Russia is great, saying Ukraine is great, these people are good, these people are crap. But because you could easily understand who I know are some paid commenters. FLINTOFF: Denis Kazanskiy is a freelance journalist and blogger in Donetsk. He makes no secret of his support for the revolution that ousted President Viktor Yanukovych and for Ukrainian integration with Europe. He says he's come across organized efforts to discredit him and other pro-European bloggers. DENIS KAZANSKIY: In Russia, we have also a big organization with people who have money, who receive money for commenting about how huge and powerful is Russia and how successful is Putin; and how bad and dumb other countries' politicians, et cetera. FLINTOFF: It's not just political bloggers who have problems. Civic organizations that use social media have also been targeted. Activists who work for an organization called Donbass SOS hold their meetings in a public park, so they won't draw attention to themselves. The group helps get money and medical attention to people who have been injured by pro-Russian separatists. They say there are some people who are monitoring their social media, and that separatists have tried to interfere with their activities. Larissa Andreishina says group members try to use protected networks as much as possible. LARISSA ANDREISHINA: (Through Translator) We have a closed group for contacting other activists, and we post messages there so nobody else can see them. FLINTOFF: She says pro-separatists maintain their own Internet groups where they post the names, photos and addresses of opposition activists. Some, she says, were threatened and had to move away. Both activists say that if they, too, are forced to leave the region, social media will allow them to keep up their work from other areas in Ukraine. Corey Flintoff, NPR News, Donetsk.

We'd like to bring you up to date on two recent developments regarding the Internet. First, Europe's higher court ruled that people can request that outdated and erroneous information about them be removed from the Web. And here in the U. S. , the FCC began debate over a new set of rules called net neutrality. Both developments have advocates and critics who both say that they're concerned that they could challenge the idea of an open and accessible Internet. We wanted to try to understand these two important stories. So we've called Rey Junco. He's an associate professor at Purdue University and a fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University. And he visits with us from time to time to talk about technology. Welcome back, Rey. Thanks for joining us. REY JUNCO: It's wonderful to be here, Michel. Thank you. MARTIN: So let's start with that FCC discussion. Late last week the FCC voted to open a public debate for new rules that are said to guarantee an open Internet. But other people are saying that these rules, if implemented, would actually mean that content providers would be able to pay to guarantee faster service for them but then other people would get information more slowly. And I'm even confusing myself just trying to describe it. So can you help me here? JUNCO: Yeah, I think it's really confusing, Michel, because of the direct statements coming from the FCC is that, you know, we don't want to use the 'fast lane' language. But in effect, it is a fast lane because Internet service providers, like your Comcast, can charge content providers - people like YouTube, Hulu, Amazon and Netflix - to have their traffic prioritized and delivered to you faster. And so those who don't pay for those guaranteed fast lanes wouldn't have as much priority. So the data would get to you slower. MARTIN: Well, what problem are they trying to solve with these new rules? JUNCO: I think the problem they're trying to solve is giving in to the cable lobby that wants to be able to charge more for these content providers that they feel are using more bandwidth, and they feel they should charge them more. MARTIN: Can I ask you to kind of handicap how you think this debate is going to go? Is it still kind of very much in the air or does there seem to be kind of one direction or the other? 'Cause on the one hand, it was reported last month that Tom Wheeler, chairman of the FCC, said, quote, \"we will not allow some companies to force Internet users into a slow lane so that others with special privileges can have superior service,\" end quote. He said that. But other people say, well, they don't believe that. What do you think? JUNCO: Well, I agree with his statement. However, these proposed rules open it up for fast lanes. So in effect, it really would have the opposite effect of that statement. The plan is currently open for comment on the FCC's website. People can go to www. fcc. gov/comments and comment on it, or they can send an email to openinternet@fcc. gov with their comments. MARTIN: Are there consumer groups that are paying attention to this, and have they coalesced around a particular point of view? Because you can see where, on the one hand, some people might say, well, what's wrong with paying more for faster services as long as everybody gets some service? Whereas, you can see other people saying, you know, that's just not fair since the airwaves are, you know, by definition, a public good. You know, why should some people have favored access to them versus others? You know what I mean? It seems like there's arguments on either side, right? JUNCO: Sure. Well, the open Internet has been a boon for minority voices to be heard, right? The fact that any blogger, reporter or startup media outlet can have as loud of a voice as the more established, well-funded companies, that's the very foundation of democracy. You mentioned an interesting point there because in this FCC statement, they say that they are willing to reconsider classifying Internet providers as common carriers. They're - right now they're classified as information service. Making them common carriers would put them on par with other industries that serve the public good like transportation and communication so they couldn't discriminate. And so they would have to treat all traffic equally. And I think some of the messages I've seen by groups like the ACLU are really supportive of classifying the Internet service providers as common carriers. And I support that as well. MARTIN: You were telling us that actually we pay more for inferior service here than other parts of the world. I'm not sure Americans know that. Tell us more about that. JUNCO: That's right. In the U. S. , we pay three times as much as in the U. K. and France and five times more than in South Korea. We also have some of the slowest broadband globally. And the reason we pay so much and have such poor service is because we don't have a choice. Most markets are dominated by one company. For instance, I'm moving to a new community soon, and I was researching broadband service. There were two providers. I could either go with a service that would really struggle to stream online video or pay twice as much to get appropriate broadband. So guess what my option is? I paid double to get appropriate broadband. So in effect, it's a monopoly. MARTIN: All right. Well, let's get to one other topic very briefly. This is regarding Europe's highest court ruling. It requires search engines like Google to allow online users to be, quote, \"forgotten,\" unquote, after a period of time by removing links to webpages. And, you know, obviously, the people who are advancing this say that they should have a right to - particularly when something is wrong or when it's outdated or like, say - you shouldn't have to live with that information forever. But others are saying this could undermine the essence of the Internet, that it'll interfere with the free exchange of information. I think, obviously, this is European Court. Privacy rules are somewhat different than they are in the United States. But can - I'd like to get your take on this. JUNCO: Gosh, Michel, this is a mess. I'm a big supporter of the right to be forgotten, especially if we can implement something that's narrowly focused on minors, as has been done in the U. S. So for instance, California passed a law that beginning January 2015, minors have the right to ask to remove any information they post online. The European court ruling, however, is completely different than this kind of legislation. It sets up this user-initiated takedown system that puts Google in the powerful position of being the arbiter of what's in the public's best interest to keep online versus the privacy interest of the individual who is making the request. That's a pretty powerful place for them to be in and a bit scary. MARTIN: Is there any immediate relevance for American consumers? JUNCO: I'm not sure about that right now. I mean, it is a European decision. My understanding is that it cannot be appealed. So I think we're going to have to see how this plays out. MARTIN: Rey Junco is an associate professor at Purdue University and a fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University. He was with us from member station WBAA, which is on the campus of Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind. Rey Junco, thanks so much for joining us once again. JUNCO: Thanks so much, Michel.

It sets up this user-initiated takedown system that puts Google in the powerful position of being the arbiter of what's in the public's best interest to keep online versus the privacy interest of the individual who is making the request. That's a pretty powerful place for them to be in and a bit scary. MARTIN: Is there any immediate relevance for American consumers? JUNCO: I'm not sure about that right now. I mean, it is a European decision. My understanding is that it cannot be appealed. So I think we're going to have to see how this plays out. MARTIN: Rey Junco is an associate professor at Purdue University and a fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University. He was with us from member station WBAA, which is on the campus of Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind. Rey Junco, thanks so much for joining us once again.

S. law enforcement calls it the biggest international cyber crackdown ever. Yesterday, more than 90 people in 19 countries were arrested for using and distributing something called the Blackshades Remote Access Tool, RAT for short. It's a wordy name for malware that makes hacking very simple, even for novices. And it gave cyber criminals unfettered access to more than a half a million computers worldwide. Joining me on the line is Brian Krebs of Krebs on Security. Welcome to the program, Brian. BRIAN KREBS: Hey, Robert, thanks for having me. SIEGEL: And first, how does the Black Shades program work? KREBS: Sure. So it really does typify the sorts of fraud tools that are widely available and usable to just about anybody. The only thing a buyer of this product would really need to know how to do is figure out how to get the militia software installed on the would-be victim's computer in the first place. SIEGEL: And then, what could they do with the would-be victim's computer? KREBS: Right. Well, they could do anything that that user could do and that includes taking a peek at their files, locking up those files or deleting those files. It could include turning on their webcams so they can see the victim behind their keyboard. Anything, essentially, that the user could do, the attacker could do. Like any other trojan, the lure usually comes via email or social networking sites like Twitter or Facebook and it works when it tricks you into clicking a link that sends you to a booby-trapped website. And essentially, you know, if you're not running the latest version of the browser software, if you're not up-to-date on your security updates, you're going to have a bad day. SIEGEL: Black Shades was openly distributed. There was even online support for it. It wasn't so hard to find in forums. Was that unprecedented? KREBS: No, I don't think so. I think, first of all, there are dozens of these remote access trojans for sale in the underground. What was interesting about this was it was very cheap. They initially sold for $40. And, you know, customers could pay for it using PayPal, which made it very accessible. So, you know, I think in that respect, that has a lot to do with how many users ultimately and customers there were. SIEGEL: Do you think that these arrests will actually deter lots of other people from doing similarly in the future or will the attackers still be at it trying to outsmart officials? KREBS: Well, in this case, I mean, that's a good question. I think a lot of these guys were sort of low-hanging fruit. The government did some targeted arrests and sting operations a couple of years ago that should've given anyone who had a clue or was paying attention as a customer of this heads-up that this day would be coming. You know, I don't know if this is going to serve as a deterrent. There are just an enormous number of these tools being marketed and sold every day and the fact that these guys manage to hack into half a million computers in all these different countries and the fact that there are just so many of these other tools out there, it gives you an idea of the size of the problem. SIEGEL: Does this mean, by the way, that there's no longer such a thing as Black Shades remote access tool or just the people who have been trafficking in it in trouble? KREBS: Well, I wouldn't be surprised to see the resurrection of this thing. You know, first of all, if you have a copy of this, it's still functional. If you have a license to it, you could still resell it. It has a strong brand, right? I mean, you could see somebody taking this up and running with it. Brand loyalty goes a long way.

I'm Robert Siegel. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  And I'm Audie Cornish. This week, we've been exploring how we remember, letters, home videos and, of course, the photographs we've taken. Now, here at NPR, few people take or make more photos than Kainaz Amaria. She works with NPR's visuals team. She's a photographer and editor. She joins me in the studio to talk more. Hi, there, Kainaz. KAINAZ AMARIA, BYLINE: Hi, Audie. CORNISH: So this series was sparked by a conversation about how technology is taking us away from our memories and we've been talking about the power of images to boost and create our memories in a way, but also that that power is diminished when we don't review the pictures. I spoke with a psychologist, Linda Hinkle about the importance of doing this. LINDA HINKLE: When you're looking at photos, what you're doing is you're reactivating in your brain those mental experiences that you had. You're thinking about what you thought about, you're looking at the color of the shirt. Oh, my gosh, look at how beautiful that blue is. I remember that shirt. I remember this. You're reactivating the neurons that are involved in creating that memory experience. And those are all the things that are going to benefit memory. AMARIA: Yeah. So when I first heard this, I thought, you know, this is a great argument to make our digital life more analog. We are overwhelmed and consume so many digital images. Actually taking the time to print them out is going to solidify that memory. CORNISH: So let's talk more about this 'cause I feel inundated by all the images I've taken. AMARIA: It's overwhelming. CORNISH: What are some of your strategies for processing all these pictures? AMARIA: So I would say on word. It's thoughtfulness. Be thoughtful and mindful of what you're doing. When we're making images as photographers, we're thinking about what is in the frame and what isn't in the frame. We're living that moment. It's not passive. That's why we say we make images and not take images. So when I'm making an image, I'm looking at the frame and I'm seeing what's in front of me. I'm editing stuff out that I don't want in the frame and I'm focusing in on what I want to capture. So it's not a snapshot. It's not a burst of images, but I'm there in the moment, actually looking at what I'm capturing. And let me tell you, I then remember it. CORNISH: Now, in understanding sort of how to be mindful in our approach, you mentioned something that you do, which is to value the images that you share, right? And to print them. How does this help? AMARIA: Yeah, for me, the rule of thumb is if I share it, it's worth printing. That's my editing process, right? When you look at all your takes or what you've done and you've said, okay, I'm going to show this on Instagram, I'm gonna share this on Facebook, what you're actually doing is you're editing the images and you're saying this is worth putting out there in the world. So, for me, if I do that, it's then worth printing and putting it in my analog world. CORNISH: And you've also shared it in other analog ways, right? Like, you're a big fan of the Christmas card, which I have to say I kind of - it feels impersonal getting one of a thousand photos of you and your kids at Christmastime. But you're saying there is a way for this also to be a memory worth building. AMARIA: Yeah, what I think is awesome about this age is you can really personalize these memories, too. I'll tell you a little secret. I love the selfie. When I meet people that I haven't seen in a long time, I make a photo with them, a selfie with them and this Christmas, I thought of doing something different. I said, you know what, I'm going to print cards with that selfie of the person I'm sending it to on the card. And within a week of me mailing these cards out, I got paragraph-long text messages of my friends and loved ones saying, I loved that card. It reminded me of us together. It's on my fridge. I'm going to frame it. And so, never have we been able to personalize and customize our really cherished moments. You can print your images on just about anything now really easily. You can put your Instagram photos on marshmallows and send them out. CORNISH: Wait. For real? AMARIA: For real. And actually, the only reason why I know this is because that's what our interns did. They wanted to give us something special when they left. We didn't eat them but we just thought it was amazing. I mean, you can make posters. You can have little prints. Some of my friends, what they do is they have something automated where every 500 Instagrams, they have it automated so they get a book in the mail after they reach that 500 mark. They don't have to do anything. I remember the days of scrapbooking where I had to buy the corners, buy the tape, buy the ruffled scissors, you know. It took me sometimes six months to create an album. It took a really long time. There are apps out there where you can make an image, hit a button and it'll print it and mail it to you. And it's actually really exciting because everyone's visual language and literacy is being heightened and expanded. CORNISH: That's Kainaz Amaria. She works as a photographer and editor with NPR's visuals team. You can find Kainaz's tips and tricks for photo-taking and more importantly photo archiving at NPR. org.

More than a million and a half tweets so far, including these - because I shouldn't have had to send my daughter's to college with pepper spray and a rape whistle. And - because I've never felt completely safe since I was first threatened and harassed at age 14. On the flipside of that, there's a long-standing online current of men who express many of the same misogynistic thoughts as the killer. Writer Laurie Penny has written a powerful piece in The New Statesman exploring the twisted ideology behind the attacks. She calls it misogynistic extremism that's too often ignored and excuse as an aberration, when it's real and pervasive and deadly. Laurie Penny joins me now from London. Thanks for being with us. LAURIE PENNY: Thank you for having me on. BLOCK: Laurie, you say in your piece I make no apologies for the fact that this piece is full of rage. Why don't you explain what you mean there? PENNY: So when I sat down to write this piece, it came after a long week where I had been on the receiving end of a lot of sexist and misogynist attacks online. I had rape threats. And I just had been about to e-mail my editor and say, actually, this has really, really got to me, can I have a couple of days off? And then I went on Twitter, went online and saw that this horrific assault had happened, and that the words being used by the killer were so similar to the threats that I was getting, the threats that I knew many people I come into contact with are getting, and I was just full of anger. And I think that anger is politically important. Women are usually allowed to say that were frightened or we feel like victims when we are the target of attacks like this, but what we're not allowed to say is that actually I'm really, really crossed, I'm furious, I want to stop this happening. BLOCK: You've spent time, Laurie, looking into some of the so-called men's rights forums online, forms that the killer in California was apparently quite active in. And you describe them as a disturbing cult of women hatred. What did you find? PENNY: Well, I think it's important to note that the language used on forums, men's rights activist forums, is an extreme version of language that you see everywhere on the web. You see it everywhere where men believe they can speak about women with impunity and men believe they can harass women with impunity. It's not just sites which are dedicated to hating and slut-shaming women, it's online video games, it's YouTube and Facebook - the language of sexism and rape threats is becoming more and more common. And the ideology seems to be that men are owed sex and respect and love and adoration by women not because they deserved it, not because that's what human beings need, but because that is their right as men. And if they don't get it, they're entitled to rape, to beat and even to kill, as was the ultimate end of Elliott Rogers really sad disturbing manifesto. BLOCK: What bothers you, Laurie, about how the killings in Isla Vista have been portrayed in the media? PENNY: There have been a lot of angles on the Isla Vista killings that have been extremely disturbing. One of the most horrifying has been the pushback that not all men do this, not all men think like this. Well, of course not all men are killers, not all men are violent misogynists. But the idea that before we speak about misogynistic extremism we should take men's feelings into account and make sure no man listens to that conversation, feels threatened or has his ego bruised - that's really, really dangerous. That's a language of silencing, and that's what the #YesAllWomen hashtag was a response to. BLOCK: You know, I'm struck by a tweet from a man - I may be mispronouncing his name - Albert W. Dubreuil - who wrote - started reading the #YesAllWomen tweets because I've got a daughter, but now I see I should be reading them because I've got two sons. PENNY: Yes, and many men and boys have e-mailed me not just to say, oh, my gosh, this is awful, but they're saying how can I change this? How can I make this different? How can I as a man step up and support women and girls and create a better world? That, to me, is what's really, really heartening about this conversation. As well as the fact that it's enabling women and girls of all ages, but particularly young women and girls to talk about their experiences in a public forum, which is so wide and so broad and allows them to be braver and be supported.

PENNY: So when I sat down to write this piece, it came after a long week where I had been on the receiving end of a lot of sexist and misogynist attacks online. I had rape threats. And I just had been about to e-mail my editor and say, actually, this has really, really got to me, can I have a couple of days off? And then I went on Twitter, went online and saw that this horrific assault had happened, and that the words being used by the killer were so similar to the threats that I was getting, the threats that I knew many people I come into contact with are getting, and I was just full of anger. And I think that anger is politically important. Women are usually allowed to say that were frightened or we feel like victims when we are the target of attacks like this, but what we're not allowed to say is that actually I'm really, really crossed, I'm furious, I want to stop this happening. BLOCK: You've spent time, Laurie, looking into some of the so-called men's rights forums online, forms that the killer in California was apparently quite active in. And you describe them as a disturbing cult of women hatred. What did you find? PENNY: Well, I think it's important to note that the language used on forums, men's rights activist forums, is an extreme version of language that you see everywhere on the web. You see it everywhere where men believe they can speak about women with impunity and men believe they can harass women with impunity. It's not just sites which are dedicated to hating and slut-shaming women, it's online video games, it's YouTube and Facebook - the language of sexism and rape threats is becoming more and more common. And the ideology seems to be that men are owed sex and respect and love and adoration by women not because they deserved it, not because that's what human beings need, but because that is their right as men. And if they don't get it, they're entitled to rape, to beat and even to kill, as was the ultimate end of Elliott Rogers really sad disturbing manifesto. BLOCK: What bothers you, Laurie, about how the killings in Isla Vista have been portrayed in the media? PENNY: There have been a lot of angles on the Isla Vista killings that have been extremely disturbing. One of the most horrifying has been the pushback that not all men do this, not all men think like this. Well, of course not all men are killers, not all men are violent misogynists. But the idea that before we speak about misogynistic extremism we should take men's feelings into account and make sure no man listens to that conversation, feels threatened or has his ego bruised - that's really, really dangerous. That's a language of silencing, and that's what the #YesAllWomen hashtag was a response to. BLOCK: You know, I'm struck by a tweet from a man - I may be mispronouncing his name - Albert W. Dubreuil - who wrote - started reading the #YesAllWomen tweets because I've got a daughter, but now I see I should be reading them because I've got two sons. PENNY: Yes, and many men and boys have e-mailed me not just to say, oh, my gosh, this is awful, but they're saying how can I change this? How can I make this different? How can I as a man step up and support women and girls and create a better world? That, to me, is what's really, really heartening about this conversation. As well as the fact that it's enabling women and girls of all ages, but particularly young women and girls to talk about their experiences in a public forum, which is so wide and so broad and allows them to be braver and be supported. BLOCK: Laurie Penny, thanks very much for talking with us. PENNY: Thank you, Melissa. BLOCK: Laurie Penny is contributing editor with The New Statesman.

We turn now to an event happening this weekend that will bring software developers, entrepreneurs, local governments and community members together to design and build tools for the common good. Using publicly released data they will work together to create all kinds of projects from fixing potholes to talking food banks - basically integrating technology to solve community issues. The event is known as the national Day of Civic Hacking. Here to tell us more is one of the organizers -- Todd Khozein. He is the founder Second Muse. That is a collaborative innovation lab that helps find technological solutions to everyday issues. Welcoming thanks so much for joining us. TODD KHOZEIN: Thanks so much for having me. MARTIN: Tell me what is civic hacking? KHOZEIN: So a civic hacker is really a community member. This can be an engineer, a software developer, and designer and entrepreneur - anybody that cares about their community and cares about actually influencing it. And civic hacking is when these folks actually work with each other including posters and the government who are included in that to find ways to just improve the quality of life in our communities. MARTIN: What kinds of projects you tend to gravitate towards? Because I think some who might be intrigued by this on the one hand volunteerism is such a fundamental part of American life. On the other hand, I think, some people might say well fixing potholes that the government's job. They're supposed to do that. Why should people volunteer to do something that we know that's their job? KHOZEIN: Yeah. I think that's a great question. And my sense is that because you know - because we know more about what is going on within our communities and that there is such a tremendous capacity that there's many ways where citizens can actually plug in and provide solutions and ideas that traditionally were held within say the government or within say for example some kind of an NGO or something like that but we see people come up novel solutions that integrate these different sort of segments of society that have traditionally been very segmented to come together in really novel ways. And so you see people doing a whole range of things from building websites that help you know people without homes find homes for the evening or people who are hungry find food form healthy food sources and that, of course, involves the government working together to make sure certain standards are in place as well as you know software programmers to bring their talents from their day jobs to help solve a problem that exists in the community. MARTIN: You know I have seen an example of this up close. After Hurricane Katrina when a lot of people went up to Houston to find, you know, safety and a lot of people had to leave so quickly they didn't have a address books or particularly seniors who didn't have - or they perhaps left phones behind where they had numbers program in and couldn't find find relatives. I saw hackers descend upon the stadium there in Houston where a lot of people are finding emergency shelter and set up systems right there to help people find relatives and loved around the country. It was quite amazing to see and it was kind of a but it was an emergency situation where there literally could not have been a system in place. Can you give us another example of where hackers have gone together to kind of solve a problem perhaps on a more ongoing basis or to solve a more ongoing problem. KHOZEIN: Yeah and that's a great example. I think at the aftermath of Katrina was when we saw a real explosion of this kind of like you know - people who had a lot to give for what they wanted to give was not a $5 donation. They wanted to build a website or find a lot of those - you, of course, are referring to you know - you know one of many person finders website the popped up in an emergency situation. So I mean one of the examples of what we saw come out of last year, for example, was an OMG Transit so if you are interested in multimodal transportation that means I want to use a bus and maybe a car sharing program and maybe a train and then maybe I, you know, some other form of transportation there were no apps to be a will to take you from and to and say know how to get from point a to point B using the public infrastructure. And this was a group of people that literally just came together. They met each other in Minneapolis and then they came up with a really interesting sort of application and then, you know, throughout the course of the next six months we worked with them quite closely and they're a proper up and running business right now where they are really building this and has been an ongoing year-long initiative. MARTIN: You know Edward Snowden is in the news now. We mentioned him briefly a few minutes ago. What about the fact that NASA and the White House are taking part in this? So some citizens have some not warm feelings about their government right now - feeling that the government has overreached in accessing information about citizens that they should not necessarily have access to. Are you at all concerned about privacy issues are breaking down walls - not just for the government or private sector players who were getting access to information they really shouldn't have about people. Is that at all a concern? KHOZEIN: Yeah, I mean, I think that's clearly a concern and I think we are seeing it play out. I think that what we are seeing is that there has been this really big explosion of data, you know, and that people have access to a lots of data about people and we're having a really interesting conversation right now about what information should you have access to and what information shouldn't do? I think what we focus over here is on - is not necessarily on saying we should open up data that is questionable in terms of whether we should have access to it or not. What we're really focusing on is an inaccessible yet acceptable data so there is - NASA for example generates tons of data through other satellites both looking into space as well as they a lot of satellites that are looking at Earth looking at climate change patterns and things like that. I think what we are interested in is taking data that everybody agrees is not innocuous but is not sort of within this realm of conflict about should this data be available - be available or not and we are making this accessible. So you have 18 different federal agencies that are involved that are opening up data sets and these are not - this is not controversial data this is sort of data that nobody would object to but they may be sitting in a corner is not being used well. That is the kind of data we are focusing on. MARTIN: You were telling us that there are events all over the country - something like more than a hundred events right? Taking place this weekend. KHOZEIN: That's right. I think we're up to 123 events in 103 different cities. MARTIN: What are some of the things you like about it? I know one of the things you telling us about is this is the kind of event to bring together people who don't normally don't sit in a room together right? KHOZEIN: Absolutely - because of the fact that the difference between what should the government be doing for switch of the private sector be doing versus what should a community volunteer be doing because they've gone center mingled - a lot of times we can clash and say this your job this is my job. Or we can get into the room together and see each other face-to-face and meet each other. That diversity of opinion from so may different multiple backgrounds when it is coming together for the intensive actually understanding some kind of challenge or opportunity and working together to fix it is turning out to be a very powerful - and we have, you know, a library of evidence of what that is able to create. It is really rich what comes out of there just because I think it is not an antagonistic meeting. It is a very additive and constructive sort of - an event. MARTIN: How will you judge the success of this overall? If you and I get together five years from now, what do you hope will have happened as a result of the work that is going on this weekend and around the country and around the world? KHOZEIN: I think that there's probably a number of factors. I think that we want to see - we want to see real stuff happen. So we want to see not something that happens over the weekend and disappears but we want to see what you alluded to earlier which is ongoing initiative that actually is helping people in solving challenges and starting new businesses. We also want to see this influence and we are already seeing it really influence both local government as well as federal government in terms of their ability to - because there is a lot of data there - again we are talking about the data that is not controversial. We are seeing a lot of people open that up. And I think that watching more of that is going to be one of the factors of success. MARTIN: Todd Khozein is the cofounder of Second Muse. We've been talking to him about events around civic hacking. And to learn more you can go to NPR. org/tellmemore. Todd, thanks so much for joining us. KHOZEIN: Thanks so much for having me Michel.

(SOUNDBITE OF ADVERTISEMENT)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: There is no steering wheel in the way. RATH: The Google video is like and Ipad ad. The gentle music, the real people - who quickly get over the weirdness of the car with no steering wheel or brake pedal and are soon giggling as they enjoy their ride. Brad Templeton has written extensively about self-driving cars and has advised Google on their program. I asked him how long before we're seeing these things out on the road? BRAD TEMPLETON: Well, Google has said they're going to be letting people, non-Google employees, into it fairly soon - within a year. Now actually making it for sale or available for rent is far more likely as something that will come a little bit later. But the car companies have been saying they'll be selling offerings by 2020 themselves. And Google originally said 2017, Elon Musk said that Tesla would sell the car by 2016. Volvo has said they will have people in cars around that time, too. So it is definitely going to be on the road in the later part of this decade and really taking over the world the 2020s. RATH: What do you think are the biggest hurdles that remain between now and then in terms of getting the car out there in numbers? TEMPLETON: Well, the answer to your first question actually is the hurdle because there isn't a fixed date. What there is, is a goal of making a vehicle that drives more safely than people do. Now that's both easy because people drive very badly, but also very hard at the same time. And everyone involved is really just focused on making it possible to prove that they've making a vehicle that safe. And then they'll sell them as soon as they believe they can do that. Google has a big lead in that area. They've announced that they've done at least 700,000 miles of testing of their vehicles in the roads around California. Other companies aren't nearly as far long, but they're all working on it. RATH: So, you've been thinking about this for a while. And I know that once the driverless car is on the road for you, that's just the start. How will this affect the design of the car? TEMPLETON: Well, what Google has done is particularly interesting there because their cars don't have a steering whee, and they're cars that can operate unmanned, which means they can actually deliver themselves to you. This is a car which can go often recharge or refuel itself. And this is a car which can go and park and store itself. And those things have big consequences for the energy we use in transportation and for our cities. Many people don't realize just how much of our lives and our cities we've given over to the car. A quarter of the energy in the United States goes to personal transportation, a quarter of the greenhouse gases. So it's really such a huge part of our lives, even when you forget about the biggest thing of all, which is the 33,000 Americans who die in car accidents every year and the millions more who are injured. RATH: Do you see any downside here? I would at least think that there's going to be job loss from people who drive for a living. TEMPLETON: That's certainly true. And unlike people who build an industrial robot, who build it for the purpose of replacing a worker, nobody is building this for the purpose of replacing the worker. It's going to happen. But it's not the goal of the people working on it. Now there are other downsides possible to. There are people who might take this instead of going green with it, they might decide they want to live three hours away from the city and sleep on their commute every day. We could get more sprawl instead of less. We could get people who don't walk anywhere anymore, and so they don't get fitness. We could get governments demanding that they have control of the vehicles and they can take them over and tell your car to take you to jail like happens in the movie \"Minority Report\" with Tom Cruise. We could see privacy invaded. The NSA is already watching everything we do. Soon they'll be able watch everywhere he go. Nothing is perfect. Nothing is without its downsides. But boy, as you may have mentioned 1. 2 million people around the world killed every year in car accidents. That's like curing one of the world most dangerous diseases. And it's worth the risk of those downsides to try and do that. RATH: That's Brad Templeton. You can read more of his thoughts on driverless cars at his website, templetons. com.

It's the second source of income for mayors. It's 30 percent of the congestion and people are willing to pay for the services. It's parking in your apartment to get to your house, going to a restaurant - that is all part of the connected life. If you think in an aging population like we are here in the U. S. , why should you go to the doctor to take your blood pressure? Why would we queue up at the DMV to renew our driving license? If you could take your eye test from home, if you just fill in a form on the web and you get it shipped home or perhaps you even can print it at home. SIEGEL: I think part of the problem there is that you could have somebody with better eyesight than yourself perhaps take the eye test for you from home. And some things you just have to do in person, we just have to show up and go someplace. ELFRINK: Yes, but, you know, a lot of these things will be solvable with high definition video technology that will become pervasive in the house. Seventy percent of doctors calls to continue in healthcare don't need physical interaction. We think, Robert, that from an economic value point of view on the global basis, that the Internet of things - providing data, connecting people, having an opportunity to reengineer a lot of business processes, is a valued proposition of $19 trillion in the next 10 years. SIEGEL: Should I reasonably be concerned right now about privacy and that everything from my blood sugar and blood pressure to where my car is parked is all available to the enterprising hacker in pretty much the same place? ELFRINK: Robert, you should. So security and privacy are areas of concern and areas as a tension that as an industry we have to solve. So let me give you an example - transparency, who is owning your data, who is getting your data, who is managing your data is going to be essential. And we will come to a proposition that people can opt in or can opt out. If you don't get transparency from a privacy point of view, this is not going to take off. SIEGEL: Well, Mr. Elfrink, thank you very much for sharing your and Cisco's vision with us. ELFRINK: Thank you, Robert. SIEGEL: That's Wim Elfink. He's executive vice president for industry solutions and chief globalization officer for Cisco. He spoke to us from San Jose, California. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: You're listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  Cisco is another company thinking about the Internet of things in a big way.

The ambulance will talk to patient records, will talk to doctors about saving lives. SIEGEL: That's a broadcast ad for Cisco.

CORNISH: That's Alex Hawkinson, founder and CEO of SmartThings, in a video for a Kickstarter campaign that raised more than a million dollars last year. The company has since raised many millions more.  Alex Hawkinson joins us now. Welcome to the program. HAWKINSON: Thanks for having me. CORNISH: So I understand that you're constantly testing things out in your own house and, you know, we just heard in the commercial there about the light and the coffee pot, but what are three automatic tasks that wouldn't have been possible a few years ago that you're now able to use in your home because of Internet connected technology? HAWKINSON: Sure, three good examples - I mean, one is very like that Kickstarter video. So my house, I wear a fitness bracelet that has been integrated by a company called Jawbone into our platform so the house actually knows when I physically am waking up and does things like turn on the coffee pot. It actually turns on NPR in the kitchen and reads me the weather forecast when I walk into the kitchen for the first time. CORNISH: Really. (Laughing)HAWKINSON: Yeah, it's - the Jetson lifestyle is upon us. CORNISH: The Internet of things strikes some people as something tech companies are doing because they can, right, the data's there, the equipment is there, the connectivity is there. Is this a case where you're essentially creating a marketplace for something we didn't even know we needed? HAWKINSON: I don't think so. I think a lot of the benefits are really practical and very profound for almost anyone. So the consumer may be very interested in knowing, let's say, whether their front door was opened while they were away from home, but they may not be aware that there's such a simple answer to enable them to tell that, at this point. So it's a discontinuity between not the value that it creates, but really just the awareness that the options are already so readily available. CORNISH: What's the weirdest connected device in your house? HAWKINSON: You know, we have a stage in our basement, which sounds crazy, but a stage with like, a disco ball and a costume room and stuff. And so when my daughter leaps up on it specifically, like, the music and lighting and disco ball starts going in the right way. There's a few other things, there's like romance mode. You know, the house knows when it's a Friday or Saturday night and the kids are asleep, that sort of stuff. So I won't say that's weird but it's. . . CORNISH: No, a little. What does that do then? Like, the lights go down? HAWKINSON: I don't know, it's never worked for me, in terms of the real goal, but, you know, the lights dim and the Barry White comes on the Sonos, mostly as a joke, that type of stuff. And of course puts on the classical music and brings up the lights if there's motion outside the kids' bedrooms. CORNISH: And that is technology that's useful, my friend. HAWKINSON: Exactly.

I'm Michel Martin. We want to turn to a topic we've discussed quite a bit over the past few months - diversity in the tech industry. Just recently, one of the biggest names in tech, Google, has started talking openly for the first time about diversity. Last week Google published a report breaking down its workforce based on gender and ethnicity. The report shows that 30 percent of Google's U. S. workforce is female, 70 percent is male. As far as race goes, 2 percent of the workforce is black, 3 percent is Hispanic, 31 percent is Asian and 61 percent is white. And those numbers, as you might imagine, don't come close to reflecting U. S. demographics. We wanted to talk more about this with two people who've thought a lot about this issue and who've joined us before. Hadi Partovi is the founder of the nonprofit code. org. Beginning this fall, the organization will partner with public school districts around the country to provide computer science instruction to more than 2 million students. Hadi, welcome back to the program. Thanks for joining us once again. HADI PARTOVI: Thank you so much for having me here. MARTIN: And Kalimah Priforce is also back with us. He is the cofounder of Qeyno Labs, which launched the first Hackathon focused on black male achievement in Oakland. Kalimah, welcome back to you as well. KALIMAH PRIFORCE: Thank you for having me. MARTIN: And before we go any further, I do want to mention that we did contact Google to ask them if they'd like to join our conversation. They declined to speak with us. But instead, they sent us this statement from Google senior vice president of People Operations, Laszlo Bock, quote, \"we are not where we want to be when it comes to diversity. It is hard to address these kinds of challenges if you are not prepared to discuss them openly and with the facts. All our diversity efforts, including going public with these numbers, are designed to ensure Google recruits and retains many more women and minorities in the future,\" end quote. So, Kalimah, I'm going to start with you. It's interesting because we have talked before about the unwillingness of tech players to even discuss these issues. So do you applaud Google for coming open with it - getting open with it? PRIFORCE: What Google shared was courageous and showed leadership. Not a lot of tech companies are doing this or showing their numbers. The problem I have is the language that they used in their blog correlating their lack of diversity by using stats about women and minorities in the computer science degrees. It's a deficit approach rather than an asset-based conversation - very 20th century talk for a 21st century company. MARTIN: What do you mean by that? It's deficit-oriented as opposed to - what would you have preferred that they had said? Would you had prefer that they would've talked about the benefits of diversity? PRIFORCE: Yeah, talk about the benefits of diversity or even talk about inclusion -that Google is working on and continuously improving their work environment to make sure that women and minorities feel like Google is a great place to be at and as well as that the tech industry - that we're doing things to change some of the pipelines that exist in the tech industry that sometimes don't encourage women and minorities to even want to become players. MARTIN: Hadi, what about that? What Kalimah is talking about, I think, is the passage in their blog where the spokesman talks about their struggle to recruit and retain women and minorities. He talks about, for example, women earn roughly 18 percent of all computer science degrees. In the United States, blacks and Hispanics makes up under 10 percent of  U. S. college grads and collect fewer than 5 percent of degrees in CS majors, respectively. And so that's, I think, what Kalimah is talking about. How does that strike you? PARTOVI: Yeah, well, I mean, at code. org, we're completely focused on the education pipeline that leads to people pursuing computer science. And, you know, if you look at the stats, the percentage of women at Google is actually higher than the overall percentage of women in software jobs in general. The industry at a whole, software jobs are 23 percent women, and that itself is, again, higher than the percentage at the school level. At the high school or college level, it's 15 to 18 percent. So it's quite difficult if you're trying to hire people who've studied computer science when the actual field isn't producing an evenly balanced representation of the genders. MARTIN: I understand you're working on addressing that pipeline issue, Hadi, but what are your thoughts about the way Google framed this? I mean, obviously, we would've loved to talk to them to understand what it is about now, especially since they have been execrated for refusing to talk about these issues, and they say that they were wrong. So the way that they framed this, do you - Hadi, do you agree with it, disagree with it? Do you find this helpful? PARTOVI: I don't mince words on the wording of the blog as much as I think it's great and courageous to actually publish the stats - I think is a good thing because you can't solve a problem unless you start discussing it. MARTIN: Kalimah, talk a little bit more about your sense of why there needs to be a more positive focus when describing the benefits of inclusion. Can you give us an example about that? PRIFORCE: See, I'd have to disagree. Language is really important. It determines whether or not - like, for example, some of the comments that I read on the blog from Google employees that the - same thing. They said, oh, well, we have this many women who have degrees, and yet Google has 30 percent. And so we're doing fine, and everything is great - rather than being able to look at it and go, OK, you know what? Maybe the system has to change, the game has to change. And that doesn't mean, oh, well, we need more players. It actually means that we need to be able to change some of the rules that govern and the culture that govern technology. MARTIN: Well, you were telling us, Kalimah, about something earlier. I think in of one of our earlier conversations. It was a conversation around Google maps avoiding certain areas that are called, quote, \"bad neighborhoods. \" And you were saying if there had perhaps been more diversity on the team that was discussing that, there might've been a different approach. Can you talk a little bit about that? PRIFORCE: Well, last year Google was introducing features about how to sort of avoid certain areas like - for example, when you're walking, you don't want to take a highway in order to get to your destination. But what it did is also opened up a conversation about avoiding the hood. A ghetto tracker was an app that came out. And it was all these conversations in Silicon Valley about that. And of course, you know, if you have more minorities and women, you know, sort of at the table and discussing it, they'll go, well, wait a minute. So then should there be sort of pins on maps that show where there's been police brutality in my neighborhood or where there have been rapes in my neighborhood? And so I think that that's something that Google is poised to be able to use data to be used to create inclusive technologyMARTIN: Well, Hadi, final thought from you? I'm particularly interested in whether you think that this will have an effect on - I understand we have a little bit of a disagreement about how - the way this is being framed and so, you know, I appreciate that. But do you feel that their willingness to come forward, however they've chosen to do it, will have an impact on the rest of the industry? PARTOVI: Yes, for sure. I think, I mean - I think the industry at large is not as diverse as it would like to be, and there's diversity problem, pretty much, in any tech company, whether it's on the gender or ethnicity. And I think it's a helpful thing to sort of shed a light on that so people can collectively think about how to solve the problem. MARTIN: Do you really - I mean, - can I parse your words a little bit - that they would like to be? Do we really think that? I mean, aren't they powerful players in this marketplace, and if they'd want to be, you know, why aren't they, right? PARTOVI: That, I think, is not as easy - it's not, you know - it is not easy if you're trying to hire a thousand software engineers and the graduating classes have 15 or 16 percent female. It's hard to make the numbers on who you want to hire. So some of the challenges, I'm sure, are around discrimination of the hiring side of things. Some of the challenges for sure are on terms of retention. It's harder to retain somebody who feels excluded. But the hardest challenge, I believe, is the one that I am trying to solve, which is the pipeline in the first place, making sure that graduating out of college, there's a 50-50 balance between men and women, which would then provide a far greater wave of improving in these numbers. MARTIN: All right, keep us posted, will you? Hadi Partovi is the founder of the nonprofit code. org. Beginning this fall, the organization will partner with public-school districts around the country to provide computer instructions to more than two million students - with us, from member station KUOW in Seattle. Kalimah Priforce is cofounder of Qeyno Labs, and he launched the first Hackathon focused on black male achievement in Oakland. He was with us from San Francisco.

Jihadi groups from Afghanistan to Iraq to Syria, have developed sophisticated media campaigns to get their messages out and attract new followers. And as NPR's Dina Temple-Raston reports, social media is playing a bigger and bigger role. DINA TEMPLE-RASTON, BYLINE: The Taliban had carefully planned how it would shape the narrative surrounding Sgt. Bergdahl's release. SETH JONES: They had a pretty coordinated information operations campaign. TEMPLE-RASTON: Seth Jones is an associate director of international security at the Rand Corporation. JONES: They had the camera there so they could film it, so they could put it into context and then push it out. And it went viral. TEMPLE-RASTON: What went viral was a very specific message that the Taliban has been honing for years. That it is a legitimate government and that it could make an agreement with the U. S. and deliver. The U. S. government's message on the other hand has been a bit more muddled. It's still try to explain why Bergdahl was exchanged for five Guantanamo prisoners in the first place. So why was the Taliban able to control this narrative? JONES: The difference is a much smaller organization trying to coordinate across a massive U. S. government, especially when there are differences in views about the objectives of fighting a war like this mean that there are actually multiple audiences, multiple messages and it's really hard to make a unified one. TEMPLE-RASTON: So the U. S. system is just more cumbersome. The Taliban has other advantages. STEVE BOYLAN: They can say what they want, when they want, how they want, without regard if they remain credible or not. TEMPLE-RASTON: Retired Col. Steve Boylan was a spokesman in Iraq for Gen.

MCCANTS: The power of the Bergdahl video was it's immediacy and that you can see with your own eyes. And I doubt that the U. S. government would have put something out comparable. So it's hard to compete. TEMPLE-RASTON: Now there's something else that's hard for the U. S. to compete with. The immediacy and reach of Twitter and Facebook and other social media.

And one afternoon in 1977, that happened to Richard Branson in Puerto Rico. RICHARD BRANSON: I was 27 years old. I had a beautiful lady waiting for me in the Virgin Islands. And the airline that I was flying on decided they didn't have enough passengers. So they decided to delay the flight 'til the next morn. And I was upset, desperate to get to this lady. And I went to the back of the airport. I rented a plane. I got a blackboard, just for a joke, wrote Virgin Airline's since I was going to the Virgin islands. Went out to all the passengers who'd been bumped and filled my first plane. And we ended up, you know, getting to the BBI that night. And it got me thinking. Next day I rang up Boeing and said have you got any second-hand 747s for sale? (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CHRIS ANDERSON: You know, you made this move that other people advice you was crazy. And in fact. . . RAZ: This is TED curator Chris Anderson in conversation with Richard on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)ANDERSON: I had a conversation with one of the investment bankers who, at the time, when you - you basically sold your Virgin Records and invested heavy in Virgin Atlantic. And his view was that you were trading, you know, the world's fourth-biggest record company for the 25th biggest airline, and that you were out of your mind. Why did you do that? BRANSON: Well, I think that, you know, there's a very thin dividing line between success and failure. And I think if you start a business without financial backing, you're likely - you're likely to go the wrong side of that dividing line. And I'm - I just love learning, and I'm incredibly inquisitive. And I love taking on the - you know, the status quo and trying to turn it upside down. So I've seen life as one long learning process. And if I see, you know - you know, if I fly on somebody else's airline and find the experience is not a pleasant one, which it wasn't 21 years ago, then I think, well, you know, maybe I can create the kind of airline that I'd like to fly on. RAZ: The kind of airline that had personal video players and libraries and a standing bar 20 years before any other airline did the same thing. But aside from those things, the thing about flying is that it's not that different than it was 60 years ago. So Richard Branson plans to change that. And just like for Bertran Piccard, the seed was planted on a particular July day in 1969. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Tranquility base here. The Eagle has landed. BRANSON: It was watching the moon landing on a little black-and-white television set - and with my sisters and parents. And that was the most inspirational moment of, you know, of those years. RAZ: Did you think at that moment that we'll all someday go there. I'll go there. We'll be up there. BRANSON: Oh, I absolutely felt that. And I think, you know, millions of people all over the world assumed that one day we would be able to go to the moon. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: It's beautiful from here. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: It has a stark beauty all its own. It's like much of a (unintelligible) of the United States. BRANSON: And that was inspirational. And, you know, many, many, many years later, you know, only 300 or 400 people had actually been into space. And it was obvious that governments weren't that interested in letting us experience the wonders of space. And then we decided, you know, let's get out there and try to find an engineer or somewhere in the world who can - who could build us a spaceship. RAZ: So that's exactly what Richard Branson did. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Release, release, release. RAZ: What you're hearing right now is actual audio from one of the first-ever test flights of SpaceShipTwo. It's a new kind of spacecraft that was built by Virgin Galactic, which is Richard's commercial spaceflight company. And it works like this. There's a giant rocket ship that blasts you and five other passengers to an altitude of 60,000 feet, at which point the smaller capsule that you're inside. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: 3, 2, 1. . . RAZ: . . . Detaches. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: Release, release, release. RAZ: And then there's another rocket blast. And then you're pressed back into your seat at 3,000 miles per hour, and you're taken thousands of feet higher into space. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: Bringing it down. BRANSON: When the rocket stops, you will be in space. There will be complete silence. You will unbuckle, and you will float around as gently, lift up and hit the roof. And you'll be able to turn somersaults, and you'll be able to look out of big windows that we've built back at our beautiful Earth. And you'll be 1 of only 500 people who've been to space. And you will have had, I think, the ride of a lifetime. RAZ: Richard Branson has already sold over 700 tickets for these future flights, each one costing $250,000. And once those 700 people go up, that'll be more than all the people who've ever been to space, period. How is this going to change how we travel around the world in the future? BRANSON: Well, it'll take us a while. But the 300 engineers that are working on this project are already drawing up designs for transcontinental airplanes. I mean, on purpose we built our spaceship shaped as an airplane rather than shaped as a rocket, which is the conventional way. And in that way, we can build them bigger and bigger. And one day we hope to be able to transport you orbitally, i. e. at 18,000 miles an hour from, say, New York to Australia. The maximum amount of time that people should actually spend traveling is, you know, roughly 40 minutes. . . RAZ: Wow. BRANSON: . . . Because at 18,000 miles an hour, you can get to pretty where - anywhere on earth in about 40 minutes. But equally, I think that through space travel, we may well be able to reduce the carbon footprint to a negligible carbon footprint in traveling people around the world by, you know, getting them out of the Earth's atmosphere and orbitally around the world - anyway, all Virgin flights. We'll see whether the others catches up. RAZ: So we're - I mean, so this is really, probably going to be the next big innovation in flight, right? Like, now we've got - I've seen jet travel, and the Concorde was around for a while. But it's more or less the same amount of time to get from New York to Tokyo. But the big change is going to be when you've got aircraft that will launch into space and then come back down. BRANSON: Yes. I mean, that's going to be the radical change. And then it's up to our engineers and technicians to overcome the technological challenge, then to make sure that it is environmentally safe. You know, maybe the most iconic pitch ever, which has done more, I think, for the environmental movement than almost any other picture, was the picture shot from the moon back of the earth. And I think that picture stimulated so many of us to want to, you know, protect our oceans, to protect the species in our oceans, to protect forests, to protect the species in our forests. And if we can actually get thousands of people to have that experience, I think that would be enormously beneficial to the world. That's what sort of science fiction's made of. You'll be able to just sit back and look out of your window at the earth as you're traveling around it. And it's going to be absolutely breathtaking. RAZ: That's Richard Branson. In late May, Virgin Galactic was cleared for takeoff by the FAA. Richard plans to be on that first flight to space with both of his kids later this year. He's a pretty fascinating guy.

I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, \"Getting There,\" ideas about transport for a crowded planet. So think about where you live. And think about never going more than 25 miles from where you are right now, ever because for most of human history, that was the way it was until Henry Ford started to market the Model T to middle-class Americans. (SOUNDBITE OF FORD COMMERCIAL)BILL FORD: So what this really allowed people to do is to have freedom. It was really a societal shift. RAZ: This is Bill Ford - Henry Ford's great-grandson. FORD: My two great-grandfathers were Harvey Firestone, of the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company, and Henry Ford. And so in many ways my parents' marriage was more like a merger. RAZ: (Laughing) Yeah, right. Bill is the executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company. And he was practically bottle-fed motor oil from birth. FORD: Well, you know, I keenly remember when I was little, you know - 4, 5, 6 years old - staring out the window waiting to see what my dad was going to bring home that night. And then when he brought it home, I would leap out the front door and go through the car, probably flying from the front seat to the back seat and vice versa, checking it all out because I was really interested in it. And I remember when he brought home the first Mustang. I thought that was about the coolest thing I'd ever seen. RAZ: Was that strange? I mean, did you feel - I don't know - like, pressure to live up to that legacy? FORD: To me it was something I was exceptionally proud of, something that I knew a lot about. But I also tried not to let it burden me in any way and, rather than that, actually have it inspire me. RAZ: And the way Bill Ford wants to make his mark is by changing everything about the way we're going to drive. Here's his idea from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)FORD: By birth and by choice, I've been involved with the auto industry my entire life. And for the past 30 years I've worked at Ford Motor Company. And for most of those years I worried about, how am I going to sell more cars and trucks? But today I worry about what if all we do is sell more cars and trucks? What happens when the number of vehicles on the road doubles, triples or even quadruples? When we look at the population growth in terms of cars, it becomes even clearer. Today there are about 800 million cars on the road worldwide. But with more people and greater prosperity around the world, that number is going to grow to between 2 and 4 billion cars by mid-century. And this is going to create the kind of global gridlock that the world has never seen before. Now, think about the impact that this is going to have on our daily lives. Today, the average American spends about a week a year stuck in traffic jams. And that's a huge waste of time and resources. But that's nothing compared to what's going on in the nations that are growing the fastest. Today, the average driver in Beijing has a five hour commute. And last summer, many of you probably saw this, there was a 100-mile traffic jam that took 11 days to clear in China. In the decades to come, 75 percent of the world's population will live in cities, and 50 of those cities will be of 10 million people or more. RAZ: So in your talk you describe this traffic problems around the world, and you mentioned Beijing. And I heard that and I thought, wow. I mean, like, a five hour commute in Beijing, on average. I mean, this is happening now. I mean, we're getting to a future where, I guess, where cities just won't be able to absorb the number of cars coming in. FORD: Yeah, it's happening. And what's happening, as a result, is a lot of municipalities are trying different kind of band-aids to ameliorate the problem. But frankly, all of those are just band-aids. And if you play that out, it becomes a human rights issue. If you can't deliver healthcare and food in major city centers because traffic simply can't move, that's a huge issue. Right now people are looking at it as an annoyance, and it is. But it could get a whole lot worse. So the option of doing nothing, to me, is not an option. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)FORD: So what's going to solve this? Well, the answer isn't going to be more of the same. My great-grandfather once said, before he invented the Model T, if I had asked people then what they wanted, they would've answered, we want faster horses. So the answer to more cars is simply not to have more roads. When America began moving west, we didn't add more wagon trains. We built railroads. Today, we need that same leap in thinking for us to create a viable future. We are going to build smart cars, but we also need to build smart roads, smart parking, smart public transportation systems and more. We need an integrated system that uses real-time data to optimize personal mobility on a massive scale without hassle or compromises for travelers. And frankly, that's the kind of system that's going to make the future of personal mobility sustainable. Now, the good news is some of this work has already begun in different parts of the world. The city of Masdar in Abu Dhabi uses driverless electric vehicles that can communicate with one another and they go underneath the city streets. And up above, you've got a series of pedestrian walkways. Now, if you look at Hong Kong, they have a very interesting system called Octopus there. It's a system that really ties together all the transportation assets into a single payment system. So parking garages, buses, trains - they all operate within the same system. These are all really good ideas that will move us forward. Now, every morning I drive about 30 miles from my home in Ann Arbor to my office in Dearborn, Michigan. And every night I go home, my commute is a total crapshoot. And I often have to leave the freeway and look for different ways for me to try and make it home. But very soon, we're going to see the days when cars are essentially talking to each other. So if the car ahead of me on I-94 hits traffic, it will immediately alert my car and tell my car to reroute itself to get me home in the best possible way. And these systems are being tested right now. And frankly, they're going to be ready for primetime pretty soon. So just imagine, one day very soon you're going to be able to plan a trip downtown, and your car will be connected to a smart parking system. So you get in your car. And as you get in your car, your car will reserve you a parking spot before you arrive. This is the kind of technology that will merge millions of individual vehicles into a single system. RAZ: You can imagine the possibilities, really, like the end of drunk driving or the end of automobile accidents, the end of traffic. FORD: Well, and think about old people who today have to give up their driver's license. RAZ: Yeah. FORD: Now we can extend their life in a vehicle and make them much more independent. And then, you know, people who are disabled - I mean, there are so many really interesting aspects to this. And that, to me, is so exciting because one of the thoughts that Henry Ford had and that really drove him was this notion of opening the highways to all mankind. Well, if you play that forward, if you do allow seniors to drive longer, if you do allow disabled people to have access to mobility, you don't have drunk driving, you, once again are opening the streets to all mankind again. RAZ: Will everything we think about driving today be completely different in 50, a hundred years? FORD: Yeah, it certainly could be. And I wouldn't put it even at a hundred years. I mean, I think, you know, we're talking, really, the next 10 to 50 years. And the reason I picked that timeframe is a lot of the autonomous driving features are going to be coming in well within the next 10 years. And then beyond that, though, it's going to take a little longer to really figure out one system that everything is connected to. That will take a little bit longer. But that's where we have to go so that every transportation element, whether it's a bike, buses, taxis, trains, subways, private cars, they're all going to have to be on a single network eventually. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)FORD: We're on our way to solving - and as I said earlier, I know we've got a long way to go - the one big issue that we're all focused on that threatens it and that's the environmental issue. But I believe we all must turn all of our effort and all of our ingenuity and determination to help now solve this notion of global gridlock because in doing so we're going to preserve what we've really come to take for granted, which is the freedom to move and move very effortlessly around the world. And frankly, we'll enhance our quality of life if we fix this because if you can envision, as I do, a future of zero emissions and freedom to move around the country and around the world like we take for granted today, that's worth the hard work today to preserve that for tomorrow. I believe we're at our best when we're confronted with big issues. This is a big one, and it won't wait. So let's get started now. Thank you. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: Bill Ford - he's the product of a family merger and the executive chairman of Ford. You can find his full talk at ted. com. GUY RAZ, HOST:  It's the TED RADIO HOUR from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, \"Getting There,\" ideas about transport for a crowded planet. So think about where you live. And think about never going more than 25 miles from where you are right now, ever because for most of human history, that was the way it was until Henry Ford started to market the Model T to middle-class Americans. (SOUNDBITE OF FORD COMMERCIAL) BILL FORD: So what this really allowed people to do is to have freedom. It was really a societal shift. RAZ: This is Bill Ford - Henry Ford's great-grandson. FORD: My two great-grandfathers were Harvey Firestone, of the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company, and Henry Ford. And so in many ways my parents' marriage was more like a merger. RAZ: (Laughing) Yeah, right. Bill is the executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company. And he was practically bottle-fed motor oil from birth. FORD: Well, you know, I keenly remember when I was little, you know - 4, 5, 6 years old - staring out the window waiting to see what my dad was going to bring home that night. And then when he brought it home, I would leap out the front door and go through the car, probably flying from the front seat to the back seat and vice versa, checking it all out because I was really interested in it. And I remember when he brought home the first Mustang. I thought that was about the coolest thing I'd ever seen. RAZ: Was that strange? I mean, did you feel - I don't know - like, pressure to live up to that legacy? FORD: To me it was something I was exceptionally proud of, something that I knew a lot about. But I also tried not to let it burden me in any way and, rather than that, actually have it inspire me. RAZ: And the way Bill Ford wants to make his mark is by changing everything about the way we're going to drive. Here's his idea from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) FORD: By birth and by choice, I've been involved with the auto industry my entire life. And for the past 30 years I've worked at Ford Motor Company. And for most of those years I worried about, how am I going to sell more cars and trucks? But today I worry about what if all we do is sell more cars and trucks? What happens when the number of vehicles on the road doubles, triples or even quadruples? When we look at the population growth in terms of cars, it becomes even clearer. Today there are about 800 million cars on the road worldwide. But with more people and greater prosperity around the world, that number is going to grow to between 2 and 4 billion cars by mid-century. And this is going to create the kind of global gridlock that the world has never seen before. Now, think about the impact that this is going to have on our daily lives. Today, the average American spends about a week a year stuck in traffic jams. And that's a huge waste of time and resources. But that's nothing compared to what's going on in the nations that are growing the fastest. Today, the average driver in Beijing has a five hour commute. And last summer, many of you probably saw this, there was a 100-mile traffic jam that took 11 days to clear in China. In the decades to come, 75 percent of the world's population will live in cities, and 50 of those cities will be of 10 million people or more. RAZ: So in your talk you describe this traffic problems around the world, and you mentioned Beijing. And I heard that and I thought, wow. I mean, like, a five hour commute in Beijing, on average. I mean, this is happening now. I mean, we're getting to a future where, I guess, where cities just won't be able to absorb the number of cars coming in. FORD: Yeah, it's happening. And what's happening, as a result, is a lot of municipalities are trying different kind of band-aids to ameliorate the problem. But frankly, all of those are just band-aids. And if you play that out, it becomes a human rights issue. If you can't deliver healthcare and food in major city centers because traffic simply can't move, that's a huge issue. Right now people are looking at it as an annoyance, and it is. But it could get a whole lot worse. So the option of doing nothing, to me, is not an option.

I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, ideas about how technology and a crowded planet will change almost everything we know about getting from Point A to Point B. And our first story begins about half a century ago. BERTRAND PICCARD: (French spoken). RAZ: Was there, like, a moment when you knew that you wanted to explore the skies? PICCARD: Yes, a very precise moment. That was in July 1969. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Lift off. We have a lift off - 32 minutes past the hour. Lift off on Apollo 11. RAZ: This is Bertrand Piccard. PICCARD: I'm, at the same time, medical doctor and explorer and. . . RAZ: In July 1969, the Apollo 11 launched to the moon. Betrand Piccard was 11 years old at the time. And he was there to see it happen. And that launch, it wasn't Bertrand's first. PICCARD: Exactly. I was fortunate enough to see six Apollo takeoff. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: We have ignition. PICCARD: Apollo 7. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Lift off. PICCARD: . . . 8. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: We have lift off. PICCARD: . . . 9. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: Lift off. We have lift off. PICCARD: . . . 10, 11 and 12. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #5: Lift off. We have lift off - 11:22 a. m. Eastern Standard Time. RAZ: So how does an 11-year-old get to witness six Apollo take offs? Well, Bertrand's dad took him because he was an explorer, too. He was a deep-sea submarine diver. And that same week as Apollo 11. . . PICCARD: My father started his dive in the Gulf Stream with a submarine he had built. There was a crew of six people, and he made a drift mission underwater from Palm Beach, Florida to New Scotland. RAZ: Which is also known as Nova Scotia. Anyway, Bertrand's dad, Jacques, was also the first man, along with Don Walsh, to reach the bottom of the Mariana Trench. More people have walked on the moon than have been to the Mariana trench. It's the deepest underwater spot on earth. And Jacques's father, Auguste. . . PICCARD: My grandfather made the first flight ever into the stratosphere, and he invented the pressurized cabin. And he was the first man to see the curvature of the earth with his own eyes. And you know what is so strange? Is to see that he made his first flight in the stratosphere with a tie. He had a jacket and tie. He had the jacket and the tie - no flying suit. RAZ: So it must've been incredible to grow up like this, I mean, around those guys. PICCARD: No, what was really strange was the fact that as long as it was inside my family, I thought it was normal. So there was no limit for me between my dreams as a child and the reality that I could see through all the people I met. RAZ: OK, so back to that week in July 1969. Bertran's dad, fresh off his undersea mission, wanted his son to see the men who were headed to the moon. PICCARD: And I met most of the astronauts also the evening before. RAZ: And you were just a kid. PICCARD: Yeah, I was 11 years old. But, you know, it's fabulous moment where you open yourself to the world because, you know, at that age, you still have everything to learn. So you're very receptive to everything. And it was so fascinating to see these two feats of exploration down and up in the same week. And I thought that's the type of life I would like to have. RAZ: So that's the type of life he chose. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #6: Two Europeans attempting to go around the world in a balloon have broken the record for the longest flying time by a hot air balloon without refueling or stopping. Brian Jones of England and Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland. . . RAZ: In 1999, 30 years after he watched Apollo 11 go to the moon, Bertrand and Brian Jones became the first men to circle the globe in a hot air balloon. It took them 20 days. They flew as high as 37,000 feet and as fast as 160 miles an hour. And the pressurized capsule that they traveled in, it now sits at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum in Washington, D. C. right next to the Apollo 11 command module. And at a press conference after he landed, reporters asked Bertrand. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #7: Several people have asked what you will be doing next, and should there be other around-the-world balloon missions. Would you all comment on that? PICCARD: Well, a lot of people will say that it's the ultimate flight and there's nothing left. Probably the people said that after the Wright Brothers' flight. So. . . RAZ: And just like the Wright Brothers' flight, they eventually led to transatlantic travel and jet airplanes. Bertrand's balloon trip was actually the start of another mission - a mission that could change the way we all travel. Here's Bertrand telling a story from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)PICCARD: Well, the unknown is part of life. And in that sense, ballooning is a beautiful metaphor because in a balloon, like in life, we want to go in the direction, but the winds push us in another direction, like in life. And as long as we fight horizontally against life, against the winds, life is a nightmare. When Brian Jones and I were flying around the world, the weatherman asked us one day to fly quite low and very slow. And when we calculated we thought we're never going to make it around the world at that speed. So we dissipate. We flew much higher and double the speed. And I was so proud to have found that jet stream that I call the weatherman and I told him, hey, guy, don't you think we're good pilots up there. We fly twice the speed you predicted. And he told me don't do that. Go down immediately and told us to slow down. And I started to argue. I said I'm not going to do that. We don't have enough gas to fly so slow. And he told me, yes, but with the low pressure you have on your left, if you fly too fast, in a couple of hours, you will turn left and end up at the North Pole. And then he asked me - and this is something I would never forget in my life. He just asked me, you're the good pilot up there. What do you really want? You want to go very fast in the wrong direction or slowly in the good direction? And this is why you need weathermen. This is why you need people with long-term vision. So we went down actually. We slowed down, and we went through moments of fears because we had no idea how the little amount of gas we had in the balloon could allow us to travel 45,000 kilometers. But we accepted to have doubts. We accepted to have fears. And actually this is where the adventure really started. RAZ: Which brings us back to Bertrand's idea for the future of transportation because on that flight, that balloon flight in 1999, somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, Bertrand and his partner, Brian Jones, were struggling to find the jet stream that would take them across the ocean. And they were burning way too much fuel. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PICCARD: We're a little afraid - little afraid, Brian and I. We talked about it - have the butterflies in the stomach. RAZ: So this is audio from a recording Bertrand made inside the capsule at the time drifting over the ocean. And when they finally touched down in the Egyptian desert after 20 days. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PICCARD: It's fabulous. Thank you. RAZ: Bertrand and his partner looked at a line of frost on their last fuel tank. And they realized just how close they came to not making it. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BRIAN JONES: That's how much fuel we've got left. PICCARD: After three weeks? JONES: After three weeks. PICCARD: And 40,000 kilometers. JONES: What a wonderful piece of planning on our behalf. RAZ: So it was almost empty when you landed. PICCARD: Yeah, absolutely. There were probably two more hours of duration after 20 days of flight. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)PICCARD: When I saw that, I made a promise to myself. I made the promise that the next time I would fly around the world, it would be with no fuel - independent from fossil energies - in order to be safe, not to be threatened by the fuel gauge. I had no idea how it was possible. I just thought it's a dream, and I want to do it. And when the capsule of my balloon was introduced officially in the Air and Space Museum in Washington together with the airplane of Charles Lindbergh, with Apollo 11, with the Wright Brothers' flyer, with Chuck Yeager's X-1, I had really felt that. I thought, wow, the 20th century, that was brilliant. It allowed to do all this things there, but it would not be possible in the future anymore. It takes too much energy. It will cost too much. It will be prohibited because we'll have to save our natural resources in a few decades from now. So how can we perpetrate this pioneering spirit with something that will be independent from fossil energy? Pioneering spirit for me means to observe what we have learned to do and what we have learned to think and to believe and try something else. It's an active disruptive behavior from what we have learned to what we would like to achieve. RAZ: And that disruptive thing for Bertran, an airplane that flies day and night entirely on solar energy. He's already flown it across the U. S. And next year, over the course of five months, Bertrand Piccard plans to fly that plane - that's called the Solar Impulse - he plans to fly it around the world. And he wants to prove that a new revolution in transportation technology is actually within reach. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)PICCARD: So the idea is that if we fly around the world in a solar-powered airplane using absolutely no fuel, nobody ever could say in the future that it's impossible to do it for cars, for heating system, for computers and so on and so on. And this is exactly the symbol of our world. If our airplane is too heavy, if the pilot wastes his energy, we'll never make it through the night. And in our world, if we keep on spoiling, wasting our energy and resources, if we keep on building things that consume so much energy, that's most of the companies now go bankrupt. It's clear that we'll never give the planet to the next generation without a major problem. So you see that this airplane is more a symbol. I don't think it will transport 200 people in the next years. But when Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic, the payload was also just sufficient for one person and some fuel. And 20 years later, there were 200 people in every airplane crossing the Atlantic. People will tell you it's impossible, and it's exactly why we try to do it. And in 50 years, if we still need to use fuel, air travel will be in trouble - really in trouble because we'll be in a world of renewable energies where there will be either a lot of restrictions and regulations about fossil energy or maybe just a price of fossil energy that will be so high that people won't use it anymore. RAZ: Do you see - like, can you imagine a future where we get around, either locally or transcontinentally, like, through solar power - like, solar power will generate the energy to move us around? PICCARD: I would be crazy to say yes and stupid to say no because today we don't have the technology to move everybody on solar power. But don't forget, when Charles Lindbergh flew across the Atlantic, he was alone on board. And we had to wait for maybe 25 or 30 more years before they could become commercial airliners. So we just have to insufflate the pioneering spirit, which means to open new doors. We have to understand now that we have to be open to change. All the people who fight to keep their old technologies are people who will disappear. RAZ: Bertrand Piccard's talk can be found at ted. npr. org.

Bertrand's balloon trip was actually the start of another mission - a mission that could change the way we all travel. Here's Bertrand telling a story from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) PICCARD: Well, the unknown is part of life. And in that sense, ballooning is a beautiful metaphor because in a balloon, like in life, we want to go in the direction, but the winds push us in another direction, like in life. And as long as we fight horizontally against life, against the winds, life is a nightmare. When Brian Jones and I were flying around the world, the weatherman asked us one day to fly quite low and very slow. And when we calculated we thought we're never going to make it around the world at that speed. So we dissipate. We flew much higher and double the speed. And I was so proud to have found that jet stream that I call the weatherman and I told him, hey, guy, don't you think we're good pilots up there. We fly twice the speed you predicted. And he told me don't do that. Go down immediately and told us to slow down. And I started to argue. I said I'm not going to do that. We don't have enough gas to fly so slow. And he told me, yes, but with the low pressure you have on your left, if you fly too fast, in a couple of hours, you will turn left and end up at the North Pole. And then he asked me - and this is something I would never forget in my life. He just asked me, you're the good pilot up there. What do you really want? You want to go very fast in the wrong direction or slowly in the good direction? And this is why you need weathermen. This is why you need people with long-term vision. So we went down actually. We slowed down, and we went through moments of fears because we had no idea how the little amount of gas we had in the balloon could allow us to travel 45,000 kilometers. But we accepted to have doubts. We accepted to have fears. And actually this is where the adventure really started. RAZ: Which brings us back to Bertrand's idea for the future of transportation because on that flight, that balloon flight in 1999, somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, Bertrand and his partner, Brian Jones, were struggling to find the jet stream that would take them across the ocean. And they were burning way too much fuel. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PICCARD: We're a little afraid - little afraid, Brian and I. We talked about it - have the butterflies in the stomach. RAZ: So this is audio from a recording Bertrand made inside the capsule at the time drifting over the ocean. And when they finally touched down in the Egyptian desert after 20 days. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PICCARD: It's fabulous. Thank you. RAZ: Bertrand and his partner looked at a line of frost on their last fuel tank. And they realized just how close they came to not making it. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BRIAN JONES: That's how much fuel we've got left. PICCARD: After three weeks? JONES: After three weeks. PICCARD: And 40,000 kilometers. JONES: What a wonderful piece of planning on our behalf. RAZ: So it was almost empty when you landed. PICCARD: Yeah, absolutely. There were probably two more hours of duration after 20 days of flight. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) PICCARD: When I saw that, I made a promise to myself. I made the promise that the next time I would fly around the world, it would be with no fuel - independent from fossil energies - in order to be safe, not to be threatened by the fuel gauge. I had no idea how it was possible. I just thought it's a dream, and I want to do it. And when the capsule of my balloon was introduced officially in the Air and Space Museum in Washington together with the airplane of Charles Lindbergh, with Apollo 11, with the Wright Brothers' flyer, with Chuck Yeager's X-1, I had really felt that. I thought, wow, the 20th century, that was brilliant. It allowed to do all this things there, but it would not be possible in the future anymore. It takes too much energy. It will cost too much. It will be prohibited because we'll have to save our natural resources in a few decades from now. So how can we perpetrate this pioneering spirit with something that will be independent from fossil energy? Pioneering spirit for me means to observe what we have learned to do and what we have learned to think and to believe and try something else. It's an active disruptive behavior from what we have learned to what we would like to achieve. RAZ: And that disruptive thing for Bertran, an airplane that flies day and night entirely on solar energy. He's already flown it across the U. S. And next year, over the course of five months, Bertrand Piccard plans to fly that plane - that's called the Solar Impulse - he plans to fly it around the world. And he wants to prove that a new revolution in transportation technology is actually within reach. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) PICCARD: So the idea is that if we fly around the world in a solar-powered airplane using absolutely no fuel, nobody ever could say in the future that it's impossible to do it for cars, for heating system, for computers and so on and so on. And this is exactly the symbol of our world. If our airplane is too heavy, if the pilot wastes his energy, we'll never make it through the night. And in our world, if we keep on spoiling, wasting our energy and resources, if we keep on building things that consume so much energy, that's most of the companies now go bankrupt. It's clear that we'll never give the planet to the next generation without a major problem. So you see that this airplane is more a symbol. I don't think it will transport 200 people in the next years. But when Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic, the payload was also just sufficient for one person and some fuel. And 20 years later, there were 200 people in every airplane crossing the Atlantic. People will tell you it's impossible, and it's exactly why we try to do it. And in 50 years, if we still need to use fuel, air travel will be in trouble - really in trouble because we'll be in a world of renewable energies where there will be either a lot of restrictions and regulations about fossil energy or maybe just a price of fossil energy that will be so high that people won't use it anymore. RAZ: Do you see - like, can you imagine a future where we get around, either locally or transcontinentally, like, through solar power - like, solar power will generate the energy to move us around? PICCARD: I would be crazy to say yes and stupid to say no because today we don't have the technology to move everybody on solar power. But don't forget, when Charles Lindbergh flew across the Atlantic, he was alone on board. And we had to wait for maybe 25 or 30 more years before they could become commercial airliners. So we just have to insufflate the pioneering spirit, which means to open new doors. We have to understand now that we have to be open to change. All the people who fight to keep their old technologies are people who will disappear. RAZ: Bertrand Piccard's talk can be found at ted. npr. org.

Apple may be set to end its use of the standard headphone connector in favor of its lightning port. That's the input for charging new iPhones. The news came from Jordan Kahn at a blog called \"9 to 5 Mac. \"JORDAN KAHN: Apple's introduced these new guidelines for manufacturers that allow them to build headphones that connect to an iPhone or an iPad pad through the lightning connector. That might be the first hint that Apple could remove that old legacy headphone jack from devices down the road. CORNISH: If they do that, new iPhones, iPads and iPods pods won't work with the old headphone jack. It could be a big industry upset. For decades, the minijack has been the standard for all kinds of audio equipment. So why change it? We asked Gordon Kelly, who wrote about it for Forbes. GORDON KELLY: There's two main reasons for doing this. On paper you can get a higher specification of audio out of the lightning port than you can out of the headphone jack. It's minimal, but on paper you could do that. It could be part of marketing. The other side to this, is that they would be able to, say, bring new functionality. Say you were listening to Spotify - you could connect your headphones, and through the extra functionality of the lightning port, it could work out where you were or what mood you said you were in, and it could start to adjust things for it. You could have a podcast, plug in your headphones - it checks your favorite podcast, makes sure downloads things as you need it. So there's all sorts of functionality which can potentially come with the lightning Jack. CORNISH: And then, of course, Apple paid around three billion dollars for the headphone company Beats Electronics. Does this make that deal make more sense to you? KELLY: It makes a lot more sense. When you look at Beats as a purely technical product, it very rarely wins when you come to out-and-out sound quality for the value. It's become a fashion statement. It's become a brand you want to be associated with. Well, the interesting thing is if they go down the lightning connector route, the first thing they're going to need is partners. They don't get any bigger than having Beats on board as a launch partner for a lightning headphone. CORNISH: So looking ahead to, say, the iPhone six, is this a technology we can expect to see there? KELLY: I'm sure Apple's not going to rush this straight in. It's too knee-jerk. What Apple will do is they will look to introduce this as a luxury option on the iPhone. Whether be the iPhone six, whether it become available slightly after the iPhone six, this will be something that will be rolled out over time. I'm sure that they won't drop the iPhone - the 3. 5 millimeter jack straightaway. CORNISH: There's another legacy technology that Apple tried to do away with which is the password, right? They came up with the fingerprint sensor on the phone. And that didn't exactly, like, revolutionize the entire smart phone industry. I mean, could this backfire on them? KELLY: I think there is the chance that it can backfire. But you have to look at it from Apple's perspective which is, it's largely shot to nothing. You can keep the 3. 5 mil jack on. You can make headphones for the lightning port. You can promote all the benefits for the lightning port. And if people don't go for it, they just stick with the 3. 5 mil jack and Apple slowly fades it back out again. But what happens is if consumers do get convinced - and initially based on the articles I've written people are very, very skeptical. But if you do convince people, Apple is in a win-win situation. You fade out the 3. 5 mil jack. You put it as to lightning only, and you have a whole new profit margin. CORNISH: That's Gordon Kelly. He wrote about Apple's headphone connector for Forbes. Gordon, thanks so much. KELLY: My pleasure. CORNISH: Your listening to all things considered from NPR news.

AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: A team from the University of Reading put the computer through a test - it's called the Turing Test - and to pass it, the computer had to fool people.

SHAHANI: The Russian-made program decided to make the computer a 13-year-old boy from Ukraine who goes by the name Eugene Goostman. And as a kid who speaks English only as a second language, Eugene managed to send whimsical messages in five-minute-long chats, and also to lower the judge's expectations.

So, you know, it's very impressive to sort of see how clever these programs can be. SHAHANI: Computer scientist, Scott Aaronson at MIT, doesn't think Eugene is that clever.

They've been negotiating with record companies over licensing fees. And YouTube is threatening to block videos by smaller independent music artists if they can't make a deal. YouTube has long offered a site where fans can find pretty much any artist they want for free. NPR's Laura Sydell reports the stand-off threatens that reputation. LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE: According to YouTube every month a billion people watch 6 billion hours of video. And eight out of 10 of the most popular videos are music. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"GANGNAM STYLE\")PARK JAE-SANG: (Singing in Korean). SYDELL: So it's no surprise that \"Gangam Style\" was the first video to get 2 billion hits on YouTube.

But other fairly popular bands could vanish from the site. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"DIANE YOUNG\")VAMPIRE WEEKEND: (Singing) Out of control but you're playing a role. Do you think you can go to the 18th hole? Or will you flip-flop the day of the championship? Try to go it alone on your own for a bit. SYDELL: Vampire Weekend has over 3 million views for its song \"Diane Young. \" The band is signed to British independent label XL. Stuart Johnston, the president of the Canadian Independent Music Association, says YouTube has put the independents on notice. STUART JOHNSTON: What we're seeing is YouTube dictating terms to the independent music community with the proviso that if those terms are not agreed to or met, then the repertoire of that label will be removed from YouTube. SYDELL: Johnston says YouTube has already negotiated with the three major labels - Universal, Sony and Warner. Neither the site nor the labels will reveal the specifics of the deal. But Rich Bengloff with A2IM, the American trade group for independent labels, says YouTube paid more to the majors than it wants to pay to independents, despite the fact that independents account for more than a third of music revenues. RICH BENGLOFF: A song by a pop artist such as Justin Bieber shouldn't be valued more than a blues song by an artist by the name of Koko Taylor. They should have the exact same value. Justin Bieber may get paid 10 times more because his music is listened to 10 times more. And that's fair. SYDELL: Bengloff says that other streaming music services, such as Spotify, Rhapsody and Rdio have all given independents a better deal than YouTube is offering. But in the world of music YouTube holds an especially powerful position. In the site's early days its relationship with the music industry was often antagonistic. Fans regularly put up videos of their favorite musicians or lip-synched to their songs and the labels accused YouTube of copyright infringement. But the site and the labels worked out agreements that allowed artists and labels to get a percentage of ad revenues. And the industry found that YouTube exposed their artists to new fans. NINA MCQUIVEY, BYLINE: Today YouTube is the marketing arm of the music business. SYDELL: James McQuivey is an analyst at Forrester Research. He says there are parallels between this fight and the current dispute between Amazon and the publisher Hachette over the cost of print and e-books. Amazon is delaying delivery of some Hachette titles and it's eliminated pre-orders for others. McQuivey says it signals a shift in the Internet economy, which is now centered around the small number of players that get the most eyeballs. MCQUIVEY: Digital aggregation creates power. And now these companies after years of talking about a big open Internet future, are finally starting to show when it comes time to be tough in negotiations, they're willing to use their access point as a source of power. SYDELL: YouTube would not talk to NPR for this report. But McQuivey says it's clear that its planned subscription service will somehow incorporate music video and audio streaming. Since the site is a place where fans are already able to hear and watch videos for free, it may be hard to get them to pay. Meanwhile McQuivey says YouTube, while profitable, has never made the kind of money its owner Google would like to see. MCQUIVEY: Certainly people who are producing original video content for YouTube are not making the kind of money that they all hoped and I think even YouTube hoped. So case-in-point it's uncertain when you're creating a new kind of digital media experience whether it'll be a big hit and then beyond that whether it will generate the kind of revenue you'd hope for. SYDELL: But independent labels say YouTube shouldn't try to hedge its bets on the backs of independent musicians. Ultimately, if their videos don't appear on the site, it's going to change the nature of YouTube and upset many fans. And that's a power they can exert to get YouTube and the independent labels back to the table. Laura Sydell, NPR News, San Francisco.

So case-in-point it's uncertain when you're creating a new kind of digital media experience whether it'll be a big hit and then beyond that whether it will generate the kind of revenue you'd hope for. SYDELL: But independent labels say YouTube shouldn't try to hedge its bets on the backs of independent musicians. Ultimately, if their videos don't appear on the site, it's going to change the nature of YouTube and upset many fans. And that's a power they can exert to get YouTube and the independent labels back to the table.

Now we've often talked about the role technology can play in changing the world and how tech players are tried to reach out beyond their own borders. Well, this week we are seeing both those ideas come together in Silicon Valley as top tech entrepreneurs from across the Middle East and North Africa head to Silicon Valley to visit places like Twitter, Facebook, and Google. These entrepreneurs will be brainstorming with successful CEOs, learning how to expand their company's and getting tips on pitching to investors. We wanted to hear more about it, so we've called journalist Nafeesa Syeed, she's reported extensively on entrepreneurship in the tech world. She's actually headed out to this conference later this week. And she is with us now. Welcome, thanks so much for joining us. I do want to mention also, that you are one of our Twitter contributors around our women in tech series back in March. So it's good to see you in person. NAFEESA SYEED: Thanks so much Michel, it's good to be here. MARTIN: So whose idea was this, who to put this conference together? SYEED: This conference is the brain child of several different groups, including MIT Enterprise Forum, that has held startup competitions across the Arab world as well as TechWadi, which is a non-profit that builds bridges between Silicon Valley and the Arab world. MARTIN: And what does Wadi mean in Arabic by the way? SYEED: Wadi means valley, hence TechWadi. MARTIN: (Laughs) Oh, OK. Well, that makes sense. So you've, as we mentioned, you've done a lot of research on female entrepreneurship and startups. In general, who are some of the people coming to this conference? SYEED: This week they have a variety of entrepreneurs, ranging from publishing, E-publishing, to health services. A couple that I can mention particular include a group called Tomautom (ph) out of Jordan, and they're a mobile gaming studio and publisher. And they say they're trying to create culturally specific games for what they identify as 60 million smart phone users in the Arab world, and who are seeking Arab speaking content. And then another is called KarmSolar, which is out of Egypt, and they're looking to replace diesel power with solar energy because they say it's eco-friendly, but also more affordable and more reliable as well. MARTIN: You know, we talked a lot, I think, a lot of Americans who followed events in the Arab Spring heard a lot about the role that technology played. But I get the sense from you that these entities, I'm just wondering were these entities, are any of these entities influenced by the Arab Spring in any way? Most of these are, kind of, basic products that people would want to use. Do you know what I'm saying? SYEED: I would say that entrepreneurship has become a huge buzzword since the Arab Spring. Some people identify it as sort of the grand articulation of the entrepreneurial spirit of the Arab world. But I would also say that it's not new. It has been around before. In our book \"Arab Women Rising,\" we cite several examples of women who started tech companies in the early 90's. They talk about what it was like to convince people to use the Internet early on. But at the same time, this has been definitely a huge boom in terms of the momentum people have and how can I change things, how can I use different tools to, kind of, change society? And there's, so there's definitely a momentum built around that. And you see lots of organizations both, international organizations, U. S. government, pouring in money into the idea of entrepreneurship. But then you also have a huge ecosystem that has evolved, with local incubators in the Arab world nurturing local entrepreneurs. MARTIN: You mentioned women earlier. That is also another focus of your reporting. It's kind of ironic that there's this focus on women entrepreneurs, when as we've just discussed just recently, Silicon Valley has its own issues around the lack of diversity. You know, both gender and ethnic. And also, kind of, the growing sense, the environment itself is not as hospitable to people of different backgrounds as many people think they would like it to be, and that it should be, given its purpose and importance in our society. I wanted to ask, with all the women entrepreneurs you've been reporting on, what do they say about the role that gender plays in their lives as entrepreneurs? What do they say? Similar experiences? SYEED: One of the things my co-author Rahilla Zafar and I both were struck by was the number of women we met who were studying computer science and engineering. Whereas here in the U. S. , we still have an ongoing discussion of, how do we get our girls to be interested in science and tech? Where is there, that's already happening with a lot of the women we met. So you have a convergence of a lot of different forces coming together that have pushed women into the tech field and the Arab world. You have more women pursuing higher Ed. In many countries, more, women outnumber men. You have more women entering the workplace, and then you have more women becoming breadwinners for their families. In addition to that, the very high Internet penetration rates. So all of that combined, you see, sort of, women being pushed into the tech world. Now in terms of whether gender played a role, in my interviews with dozens of women, we asked has gender played a role, do you ever feel like it has held you back? And there were actually many women, several of the women said gender has never been an issue of getting ahead and they actually decried and criticized women that do think that gender has held them back. But then there were other women that did tell us that there were some social attitudes or social-cultural issues that may have got in the way sometimes. So, for instance, if a woman has products, where she has to go to a supplier or factories, there are certain parts of town that maybe her family's not comfortable with her going, or  these are male dominated areas that she had to, sort of, assert herself in a different way that she's not used to. We also asked the women to be very candid about their, managing their work and family lives. And so, there again, you see maybe their gender coming up as an issue, where some of their families thought they needed to make their home their priority and not their work. While some told us their husbands and their fathers or brothers actually encouraged them to continue their business. Some whose spouses may not have shared their vision ended up getting divorced because they weren't able to continue doing both. MARTIN: I think those are stories that will sound very familiar to many, many, many people here. So tell us a little bit more about what the various participants are hoping to accomplish this week? Recognizing, you know, you're heading out at the end of the week to present. So we hope that goes well. But how, tell us a little bit more about what the people participating hope to accomplish, and what do people who are receiving these entrepreneurs hope to get out of this exchange as well? SYEED: My sense is, you know, when I'm talking to people in the region, talking to young entrepreneurs, they're fascinated and they glean a lot of knowledge and inspiration from the experiences in Silicon Valley and look to some of those people as their heroes. It's something they want to emulate in a way, in their own work. But when it comes to the knowledge of what's needed, or what technology makes sense, and what programs, what software will make sense, it's only going to be the people from the region who can actually develop that. So I think they're - going there my sense, a lot of them might be their dream to go visit Google or Twitter and learn what they can but also have an exchange. So see what ideas they could learn from Silicon Valley but also let Silicon Valley know what it is that they're doing and how they're innovating in ways that Silicon Valley may have never seen actually before. MARTIN: I'm just looking at the list of the entrepreneurs who were invited. They all seem young. Is that correct? Is there, kind of, an average age? They all seem to be, kind of, hovering around their thirties, am I right about that? And is that generally the way, the wave of the future, it's young? TechWadi is young, right? SYEED: Sure. There's a huge, obviously they call it the youth bulge and a lot of these countries have a very young population and technology is just, you know, from a young age being eaten up by these young people. And you also have to keep in mind that a lot of the problems and issues facing societies, whether it's, such as high unemployment, who's going to create opportunities. Even amid the turmoil and other huge issues and challenges going on, sort of taking matters into their own hands. And again, I would say from the Arab Spring, they're taking that inspiration of how can we create new realities for ourselves. MARTIN: I've been speaking with Nafeesa Syeed, she's co-author of the digital book \"Arab Women Rising: 35 Entrepreneurs Making A Difference. \" She's been telling us about a conference going on in Silicon Valley this week. It's called The Arab World Meets Silicon Valley, she's headed out there to present at that conference. But she was kind enough to stop here first in our studios in Washington, D. C.

The same concern is rattling cabbies across Europe. And today, drivers in several capital cities took to the streets in protest. The threat is one that's familiar to some American cabbies - car services like Uber that let you book a ride with your cell phone. NPR's Ari Shapiro reports. ARI SHAPIRO, BYLINE: One of the hardest tests a Londoner will ever take is called simply, the knowledge. To pass, you need a roadmap of London in your head. Nobody gets to drive a black taxi without the knowledge. EDDIE TRESIDA: I mean to me, personally, it took me two years. I mean, other drivers it takes three or four years, depends how hard you work at it. SHAPIRO: Cab driver, Eddie Tresida, is disturbed that after all his work, an Uber driver with GPS can sweep in and undercut his business. TRESIDA: If you want to be a taxi driver, then do the same as what I've done. It's hard, for two years, you know, you go without things and you have to sacrifice things in your life. But if you want to be a taxi driver, this is the best taxi service in the world, then that's what you have to do. SHAPIRO: Uber now operates in 20 European cities. It is doubling in size every six months, according to Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty. He's Uber's general manager for Western and Northern Europe. PIERRE-DIMITRI GORE-COTY: We've opened Frankfurt last week. We've opened Lille in France, which is our third city this week. We've opened Barcelona a couple of weeks ago, and there's many more cities to go. SHAPIRO: He argues that his company is simply responding to consumer demand. Unlike with many taxis, Uber passengers can pay by credit card, order a ride by cell phone and rate their drivers. GORE-COTY: And so finally, seeing some sort of competition coming to the market is something that's new. And even on the protest today, what I'm seeing is taxis are trying to bring cities to a standstill while on the opposite, Uber is focused to kind of help as many people as possible move around cities. (HONKING)SHAPIRO: The protests began in the early afternoon in major cities all across Europe. In France, they called it operation escargot. Taxi drivers inched along at a snail's pace, refusing to take passengers. In Germany, 64-year-old Barbara Novak joined other cabbies at Berlin's central station for their slow-drive protest across the city. (German spoken)SHAPIRO: These apps don't offer proper, decent, quality transportation, she says. Climb it's one of those and you might as well say, mug me. In Madrid, cabbies complained that they paid a fortune for a taxi license, only to be undercut by Uber drivers. Maria Eugenia Hernaz is 37 years old. MARIA EUGENIA HERNAZ: After three years, I bought my own license -137,000 euros. It's more than my house. So I need work and I have to work 16 hours per day to do it. SHAPIRO: Many cabdrivers argue that Uber should be forced to follow the same licensing and fare rules as taxis. Uber believes those rules should not apply because the company says Uber is more like a car hire service. Ben Edelman of Harvard Business School says new innovations replace old companies all the time, but he says Uber is taking some important shortcuts. BEN EDELMAN: If there's a medallion to be purchased, they're not purchasing it. If there's commercial driver's insurance to be purchased, again, nope they're not doing that either.

But even with that, we wondered what exactly could the NSA still see about us, assuming for a second that they still care to look? To find out, NPR technology correspondent Steve Henn teamed up with Sean Gallagher, a reporter at Ars Technica and Dave Porcello, a computer security expert at a company called Pwnie Express. Together, they tapped Steve's smart phone and laptop. He's the guinea pig here. For little more than a week, Sean and Dave stepped into the role of a security or even a criminal organization and they spied on Steve Henn's life. This is what happened. STEVE HENN, BYLINE: A little over a week into this project, I got a call from Sean Gallagher at Ars. At first I wasn't sure what he had found but he sounded giddy. Turns out, Sean had intercepted some of my tape - an uncut interview, parts of which would air later that day at NPR. SEAN GALLAGHER: What happened was the Pwn Plug that was in your office caught it as you were pulling it down from the NPR server. HENN: He played me the recording. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN 1: OK, awesome. Yep, yep. OK I'm passing the phone to you. I'm going to record. . . HENN: Holy cow. SCOTT BELL: Hello, this is Scott Bell. HENN: So this is a guy I interviewed in a field in Iowa. GALLAGHER: Right. Right. This was for your story you were doing on clean data centers. HENN: (Laughing) Yeah. GALLAGHER: Which we figured out based on your search traffic. HENN: Like anyone doing research on anything, I'd hit Google. Sean Gallagher and Dave Porcello had seen that. Like the NSA monitoring traffic, they were monitoring me. A few weeks earlier, we had installed something called a Pwn Plug in my office. It's this little wireless router that basically catches and copies all the traffic into and out of any device that connects to it - in my case, my computer and mobile phone. That data, including my interview, was sifted and analyzed and sorted by software, automatically. GALLAGHER: So it re-created the file and extracted it out. And that's very similar to the sort of content mining that the NSA's surveillance technology is capable of. HENN: Who you are and where you are, whether you're a U. S. citizen or in this country or abroad, all this matters in the eyes of the law. But bulk collection - this kind of mass collection of Internet data - this is what happens to people who are not targets, who are not suspected terrorists but just regular people whose traffic is sucked up into this mesh. Our goal was to try and figure out exactly what this kind of passive surveillance can discover. And there were some ground rules. Dave and Sean didn't have access to NPR's systems. They couldn't hack into anything. They were just collecting the data flowing between me and the net - the way data about millions of people around the world is collected every day. They tracked me this way for one week. HENN: Right, and so in fairness, like I chose a story in a week where I wasn't working on anything particularly sensitive. There were no, like, off the record sources here. When I did do that, I disengaged from the experiment. You know, on other work. GALLAGHER: (Laughing) Right. HENN: Another ground rule, was I wasn't going to try go dark or cover my tracks. I'd just do my job like any other week. But going in, I knew that my e-mail and my phone calls were encrypted and walled off from their prying eyes. Most people surfing the web, doing research on a medical issue or looking for a divorce attorney probably don't take these kinds of precautions. Actually, I thought that my standard operating procedures might make tracking me kind of hard. It turns out I was wrong - completely and totally wrong. HENN: You know, earlier you said that you knew what the story was about. GALLAGHER: Yeah. HENN: Walk me through how you figured that out. GALLAGHER: OK, so I started looking at the search terms that were coming up for what you were working on and there was a web referral that was for who coined the term cloud computing. HENN: Right. Cloud computing - that's what my story was about. Google search traffic is supposed to be encrypted but that data leaked. Sean and Dave tracked me from website to website. And then the real payoff came when the software that was automatically analyzing my web traffic got down to business. It scoured the sites I visited, looking for e-mail addresses and telephone numbers. Sean gave me a list of people he thought I was reaching out to. HENN: And you had Greenpeace and you had Facebook. You had all my sources for that story. GALLAGHER: I had all your sources. I could've written that story for you. (Laughing)HENN: But the web wasn't the only thing that tripped me up. Almost every business or computer has some old software inside. Think about how you do your expenses at work or when you last updated your audio player. Old programs leak data too and pretty much everyone has them. DAVE PORCELLO: Yeah, I mean we use hundreds of services for our business. HENN: Dave Porcello says one weak link can spill your personal information onto the net in plain text. And that's how they got that copy of the interview in Iowa. BELL: We are at the large water tower near Wellsburg. . . HENN: It was sent using an old, insecure system that's now been patched. But actually the biggest surprise for me, the thing that kind of blew me away, came right at the beginning of this, when I first connected my phone to that little router monitoring my traffic. Dave was across the country on a speakerphone watching as my iPhone pinged servers all over the world. PORCELLO: Yahoo, NPR. . . HENN: My phone sent Yahoo my location data in the clear. It connected to NPR from my e-mail. It pinged Apple, Google. GALLAGHER: You're not, like, opening apps or anything right? HENN: No my phone is sitting on my desk. HENN: There was this cascade of bits. GALLAGHER: There's just thousands and thousands of pages of stuff. HENN: And all of this was going down without me even touching the phone. Over the next couple of weeks, David and a colleague at Pwnie Express - a guy named Awk - dug through those thousands of packets. OLIVER WIES: A lot of times it's pretty easy to identify not only the type of device, but the person. HENN: Awk's real name is Oliver Wies. WIES: How many people's iPhones are named, you know, Steve's iPhone? HENN: Right. Well, I mean, when you were talking about that I was thinking, OK so it sounds out the name of my iPhone - Steve's iPhone - it sends out a ping to NPR mail, so now you are limited to Steve's who work at NPR. WIES: Right. HENN: And then it hits my weather app and it's saying I'm in Menlo Park, California. >>WIES: Exactly. HENN: And it's like, all right, we know exactly who you are. You are not Steven Inskeep, you know, you are Steve Henn. WIES: (Laughing) Right, exactly. Yeah, it's pretty wild. HENN: This happened without me touching the phone or doing anything. And in fact, for millions of phones there is no easy way to stop this. WIES: You know, I mean, that's really the mind blowing thing about all this is that, you know, people are walking around every day with these, you know, mobile computers in their pockets and they have no idea what they're sending to the world. HENN: Over the rest of the week we are going to dig into the kind of information that leaks out from your phone and apps and websites that claim to be safe. And we'll look at what a hacker or a spy agency could do with this stuff. It turns out, you don't have to be as big or sophisticated as the NSA to capture these bits of information we leave trailing behind us. And you don't have to let someone plant a bug in your office either. Steve Henn, NPR News, Silicon Valley. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:  For many, Edward Snowden's disclosures about the NSA's massive phone and data collection program were an eye-opener - major tech companies race to add digital encryption to their services. But even with that, we wondered what exactly could the NSA still see about us, assuming for a second that they still care to look? To find out, NPR technology correspondent Steve Henn teamed up with Sean Gallagher, a reporter at Ars Technica and Dave Porcello, a computer security expert at a company called Pwnie Express. Together, they tapped Steve's smart phone and laptop. He's the guinea pig here. For little more than a week, Sean and Dave stepped into the role of a security or even a criminal organization and they spied on Steve Henn's life. This is what happened. STEVE HENN, BYLINE: A little over a week into this project, I got a call from Sean Gallagher at Ars. At first I wasn't sure what he had found but he sounded giddy. Turns out, Sean had intercepted some of my tape - an uncut interview, parts of which would air later that day at NPR. SEAN GALLAGHER: What happened was the Pwn Plug that was in your office caught it as you were pulling it down from the NPR server. HENN: He played me the recording. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN 1: OK, awesome. Yep, yep. OK I'm passing the phone to you. I'm going to record. . . HENN: Holy cow. SCOTT BELL: Hello, this is Scott Bell. HENN: So this is a guy I interviewed in a field in Iowa. GALLAGHER: Right. Right. This was for your story you were doing on clean data centers. HENN: (Laughing) Yeah. GALLAGHER: Which we figured out based on your search traffic. HENN: Like anyone doing research on anything, I'd hit Google. Sean Gallagher and Dave Porcello had seen that. Like the NSA monitoring traffic, they were monitoring me. A few weeks earlier, we had installed something called a Pwn Plug in my office. It's this little wireless router that basically catches and copies all the traffic into and out of any device that connects to it - in my case, my computer and mobile phone. That data, including my interview, was sifted and analyzed and sorted by software, automatically. GALLAGHER: So it re-created the file and extracted it out. And that's very similar to the sort of content mining that the NSA's surveillance technology is capable of. HENN: Who you are and where you are, whether you're a U. S. citizen or in this country or abroad, all this matters in the eyes of the law. But bulk collection - this kind of mass collection of Internet data - this is what happens to people who are not targets, who are not suspected terrorists but just regular people whose traffic is sucked up into this mesh. Our goal was to try and figure out exactly what this kind of passive surveillance can discover. And there were some ground rules. Dave and Sean didn't have access to NPR's systems. They couldn't hack into anything. They were just collecting the data flowing between me and the net - the way data about millions of people around the world is collected every day. They tracked me this way for one week. HENN: Right, and so in fairness, like I chose a story in a week where I wasn't working on anything particularly sensitive. There were no, like, off the record sources here. When I did do that, I disengaged from the experiment. You know, on other work. GALLAGHER: (Laughing) Right. HENN: Another ground rule, was I wasn't going to try go dark or cover my tracks. I'd just do my job like any other week. But going in, I knew that my e-mail and my phone calls were encrypted and walled off from their prying eyes.

I'm Arun Rath. The code breaking skills of mathematician Alan Turing helped the Allies win World War II. He also devised the Turing Test, a measure of artificial intelligence. Last week, a computer program pretending to be a 13-year-old boy named Eugene Gustman was the first to pass the test - meaning the age of artificial intelligence has begun - maybe. Gary Marcus is a professor of cognitive science at New York University. I asked him to explain how the test works. GARY MARCUS: It was devised in the teletype era. So those of you who don't remember what a teletype is can think of it as text messaging back and forth. So you text message to a computer or a person, you don't know which. And you try to decide. And that's basically what actually happened, is somebody managed to build a computer program that was good enough to fool a third of the judges. RATH: Siri kind of does that, right? You ask your phone questions, and you can even throw in some abstract ones and it will come up with some creative responses, on occasion. MARCUS: Siri, like this program Eugene Gustman, interacts with you. You ask questions, and it gives answers. But most people aren't fooled into thinking that Siri is an actual person. RATH: People who are into science, I think, especially, get really excited when we see this headline, computer passes the Turing Test. But you think, maybe not such a big deal. MARCUS: Well, it's a small sign of progress. But it's not really progress towards the larger goal of having machines that really understand us. It turns out that you can do a lot of misdirection, answer sarcastically, and evade the fact that you are a computer. So all it really shows is you can fool humans for a short period of time, about five minutes - not all of the humans, but maybe more than you might've expected - by having these sort of personality twitches. RATH: Well, let's give an example of that. You had an exchange with an earlier version of this program. Well, why don't we read that? I will read the part of Eugene Gustman. MARCUS: I will play the role of myself as best I can. (Reading) Do you read the New Yorker? RATH: (As Eugene Gustman, reading) I read a lot of books. So many, I don't even remember which ones. MARCUS: (Reading) You remind me of Sarah Palin. RATH: (As Eugene Gustman, reading) If I'm not mistaken, Sarah is a robot, just as many other, quote-unquote, \"people. \" We must destroy the plans of these talking trash cans. MARCUS: Now, see, your first impression, if you had that line in isolation, would be, hey, that's clever. It sounds like a 13-year-old boy, which is what the program's supposed to sound like. But if you talk to it for a long time, you would see that it uses the same laugh lines over and over again. If you asked it questions about common sense, you would find out very quickly that it doesn't really understand the world, that it's just a lot of preprogrammed responses, and pattern recognition and so forth, without any real there, there. RATH: You know, I have to say, from all of the exchanges that I've read with people who are talking with this machine, none of them seem very convincing. Thirty percent of people need to be fooled for it to be considered to pass? MARCUS: Based on a very, I think, foolish reading of Alan Turing's original essay. People decided that in order to quote, \"pass this test,\" close quote, you would have to fool 30 percent of the judges. And this program fooled 33 percent of the judges on this particular occasion. Turing was saying, I'm guessing that this is how far along we will be by the year 2000. He wasn't saying, and when we get there, that means that machines are necessarily intelligent. He was kind of opening the question. But people have taken his offhand suggestion as if it was the definition of intelligence. And I think that part's silly. And we might actually want to think about updating the Turing Test for a modern era. RATH: Yeah 'cause it seems, again, looking at these exchanges, maybe just 33 percent of people are more gullible, I hate to say. MARCUS: Yeah, it is kind of a gullibility test. What I suggested, instead, is have a machine watch a YouTube video or a TV broadcast, and see if you can ask questions about it. So in order for a machine to understand an ongoing television program, an episode of \"Breaking Bad,\" the program would have to build up ideas over time - well, this character does this. This is their motivation. This is the conflict. If we could get machines towards that, I think that would be real progress in AI. The Turing Test itself, not so much. RATH: So if this test doesn't really serve the purpose of determining whether we've broken through a barrier in artificial intelligence, is there anything valuable that can come out of it? MARCUS: It gets people thinking about, what will it be like when we do have intelligent machines that we really can interact with at that level, that follow us around? - sort of like in that movie, \"Her. \" I don't think that's going to happen in the next 20 years. It might take 40 or 50. But we will reach a society where we have more and more of these things around. RATH: Gary Marcus is a professor of cognitive science at New York University. He is the author of \"Guitar Zero,\" and his forthcoming book is called, \"The Future Of The Brain. \" Gary, thank you. MARCUS: Thanks a lot.

So how are retailers able to track me, a consumer, when I'm in a store? SWEENEY: Well, one of the ways they might do that is using your mobile phone. So what a lot of people may not realize is that, in order for your phone to make a connection on the Internet, it's constantly sending out a unique number that's embedded in that phone, called the MAC address, to say, hey, any Wi-Fis out there? I'm number, say, 124 - though the numbers are a little longer and more complicated. Will you connect with me? And by using these constant probe requests by the phone looking for Wi-Fis, you could actually track where that phone has been, how often that phone comes there, down to a few feet. Which is much finer than, say, the GPS location that your phone might be giving. SIEGEL: So how is this helpful to companies, and to what extent are companies doing this? SWEENEY: Well, you know, I'm not an expert about marketing, but one could easily understand that knowing where customers might move throughout the store is very helpful for designing the store and putting the kinds of products the store might want to sell in particular pathways of the customer. You could also imagine a future in which they might use your location to deliver just-in-time ads. I'm not saying that any of the stores are doing that, but we could easily see how that could be done. SIEGEL: When this is done, to the extent that it's done, is the customer notified? And in your view, should the customer be notified that this store tracks your whereabouts on the premises? SWEENEY: Well, that's one of the most interesting aspects - is that this can be done actively by the store without the consumer ever knowing. And why might you care? Well, it could be the case that knowing where you are in a point in time or knowing where your phone has been in a point in time can be an issue. You could imagine future lawsuits in divorce proceedings. Wants to know, oh, were you with MAC address number blah, blah, blah, for example. SIEGEL: In the jewelry department. SWEENEY: (Laughing) Right. Were you in the jewelry department someone else? And so these kinds of unforeseen consequences that can cause real harms to consumers, without consumers knowing that that tracking is happening, is something that one should be a little concerned about. SIEGEL: Is it something that, as a consumer, I can easily opt out of? You know, flick a switch on my smart phone? SWEENEY: Right. Well, my background is in computer science. And a lot of times, what I do is look at how the design of the system fits in with policy or consumer expectations. And this is a really good issue - is suppose I did know it was happening, but I didn't want to be party to it. What do I do then? A lot of times, you can put it in airplane mode - the phone - which would turn off the Wi-Fi. But if you turn on the Wi-Fi after that, then the Wi-Fi stays on. And so that can be a little confusing. There are some apps that allow you to change the MAC address that address that's sent out in the probes, so that you could sort of masquerade as someone else, if you wanted to. SIEGEL: And is there anything that I could see on the settings of my smart phone that would tell me whether or not I'm being tracked? SWEENEY: No. There's nothing you can see. All you could do is turn the ability for them to do the tracking off or leave it on. But there's nothing that you would know that someone actually listened to a probe that was being emitted by your phone. SIEGEL: Well, Dr. Sweeney - Professor Sweeney, thank you very much for talking with us about it today. SWEENEY: Thank you. SIEGEL: Latanya Sweeney is chief technology officer with the Federal Trade Commission. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  Now, from tracking you where you work to where you shop. This doesn't just happen when you shop online, but in actual brick-and-mortar stores, too. And for more on this, I'm joined now by Latanya Sweeney. She's chief technology officer for the Federal Trade Commission, and she has written about how this works. Dr. Sweeney, welcome to the program. LATANYA SWEENEY: Thank you. Thank you for having me. SIEGEL: And you've actually written on your own blog. This isn't in your official capacity with the FDC. SWEENEY: Right. The views that I have are not in my - are not of the FTC or any of its commissioners. They allow me to blog on the site solely to open up discourse in the topic. SIEGEL: OK. So how are retailers able to track me, a consumer, when I'm in a store? SWEENEY: Well, one of the ways they might do that is using your mobile phone. So what a lot of people may not realize is that, in order for your phone to make a connection on the Internet, it's constantly sending out a unique number that's embedded in that phone, called the MAC address, to say, hey, any Wi-Fis out there? I'm number, say, 124 - though the numbers are a little longer and more complicated. Will you connect with me?

All this technology has made lying so much easier. JEFF HANCOCK: For the first time in human history we can lie to each other about where we are, who we are, who we're with, what we're doing. RAZ: This is Jeff Hancock. He's a professor of psychology at Cornell. And he studies how people lie on the Internet. HANCOCK: Before when we talked to each other we had to be in the same room at the exact same time. And that's the crux of the paradox that we see. So it would seem that now that I can lie about all those things and I can do it without you seeing my face and any of my vocal tones or any of my body movements, that we should see a lot more lying. And I think it's wrong. RAZ: OK. So this all might seem completely counterintuitive, right? But it turns out that the Internet might be keeping us honest. Here's Jeff's take from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HANCOCK: Now let's put aside the online anonymous sex chat rooms, which I'm sure none of you have been in. I can assure you there's deception there. And let's put aside the Nigerian prince who's emailed you about getting the 43 million out of the country. (LAUGHTER)HANCOCK: Let's forget about that guy too. Let's focus on the conversations between our friends and our family and our coworkers and our loved ones - those are the conversation that really matter. What does technology do to deception with those folks? One of the studies we do are called diary studies in which we asked people to record all of their conversations and all their lies for seven days. And what we can do then is then calculate how many lies took place per conversation within a medium. And the finding that we get that surprises people the most is that email is the most honest of those three media. And it really throws people for a loop because we think, woah - there's no non-verbal cues, so why don't you lie more? The phone, in contrast, the most lies. Again and again and again we see the phone as the device that people lie on the most. RAZ: So, I  mean, you would think that, like, email would be the easiest way to sort of mislead somebody right or to lie to them? And you're saying that this is the most honest form of communication? HANCOCK: Right. It is really amazing - that being able to see the person doesn't improve your ability to detect deception. And this is really surprising to a lot of people. It was surprising to me. But it's been shown again and again and again that we don't really rely on non-verbal cues to tell if someone's lying. So the fact that those go away doesn't make email that much more difficult or easy to lie in. The reason that email I think is more honest - and again we're not talking about spam or any of that - but in our conversations with family, friends, coworkers we leave a record. We provide the recipient of the lie with the a record of the lie and that is not good for deception. RAZ: The irony is is that as we have all these, like, different avenues, like, in different places where we can lie it is actually a lot harder because you basically, like, you triangulate. Like, if you lie there's a good chance that somebody will be able to call you out on it because so many more people are exposed to that lie or that slight exaggeration about something. HANCOCK: Exactly right. I think that in all the ways that technology can on the surface seem like it will facilitate deception, they can't see me, I can call from anywhere, I can say anything I want, technology allows for all of that but at the same time it provides all these other tools for detecting deception in ways that 10, 20, 30 years ago we never would've thought about. But in addition to that, like you said, we have all these other tools. So Google - just think of the power that Google provides. Now imagine a Google search algorithm 20 years from now and the kinds of things and information it'll be able to parse and go through and surface for us. So this is one of the reasons when people say, well I think we're lying a lot more now and technology's a big reason for it - that's one of the reasons I just think that that's wrong. And I think that technology allows us to lie in some ways and we're certainly going to adapt and evolve our deception. But technology provides a lot of other constraints on how and when we lie. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HANCOCK: What does that mean? What's the next big idea from that? Well, as a social scientist now I can look at all those words that use to, for millennia, disappear. I can look at lies that before were said and then gone. So one thing that we did, I'll give you an example of looking at the language, is we paid people to write some fake reviews. One of these reviews is fake, the person never was at the James Hotel. The other review is real, the person stayed there. Now your task now is to decide which review is fake. HANCOCK: So in one of the reviews it's a person talking about who they were there with. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN 1: My husband and I stayed at the James Chicago Hotel for our anniversary. The place is fantastic. HANCOCK: And they talked about that they went shopping and that the hotel is really lovely. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN 1: Staff very attentive and wonderful. HANCOCK: Really, really beautiful rooms. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN 1: We will definitely be back to Chicago and will sure be back to the James Chicago. HANCOCK: In the second one. . . UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN 2: I have stayed at many hotels traveling for both business and pleasure and I can honestly say. . . HANCOCK: They don't really say who they were there with. They talk a little bit more about what the room looked like. . . UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN 2: The rooms are modern and very comfortable. HANCOCK: And instead of saying that they went shopping they say that the shopping was about a mile away. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN 2: Highly recommend it to both business travelers and couples. HANCOCK: And people have a really hard time telling which one is real. In fact, your listeners may be trying to decide well was it the first one where they talked about being there with a husband or the second one where they talked about the size of the room? RAZ: And which one was it? HANCOCK: The first one was fake. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HANCOCK: Let me highlight a couple of things here. In the fake review. The first is that liars tend to think about narrative, they make up a story - who and what happened. And that's what happened here. Our fake reviewers talked about who they were with and what they were doing. They also used the first-person singular, I, way more than the people that actually stayed there. They were inserting themselves into the hotel review kind of trying to convince you they were there. In contrast, the people that wrote the reviews that were actually there, their bodies actually entered the physical space, they talked a lot more about spacial information. They said how big the bathroom was or they said, you know, here's how far shopping is from the hotel. We believe that every lie now, every type of lie, fake hotel reviews, fake shoe reviews, your girlfriend cheating on you with text messaging, those are all different lies - they're going to have different patterns of language. But because everything is recorded now, we can look at all those kinds of lies. The next big thing for me, the next big idea, we can find by going way back in history to the origins of language. Most linguists agree that we started speaking somewhere between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago. That's a long time ago. A lot of humans have lived since then. We've been talking I guess about fires in caves and saber tooth tigers - I don't know what they talked about. But they were doing a lot of talking. And like I said there's a lot of humans evolving, speaking. About 100 billion people in fact. What's important though is that writing only immerged about 5,000 years ago. So what that means is that all the people before there was any writing - every word that they ever said, every utterance, disappeared, no trace, evanescent, gone. So we've been evolving to talk in a way in which there is no record. HANCOCK: So I think deception involved to disappear. And we're in this really amazing, interesting time where, yes, we can lie about many more things. People can't hear our voice or see our face but we leave a record and that record is something brand-new and I think it's something that deception is currently having to adapt to. RAZ: Jeff Hancock, he studies deception in psychology at Cornell University. His full talk is at ted. npr. org. Our show today - ideas about why we lie, why we cheat, we why deceive and still why believe so much of what we're told. Back in a moment. I'm Guy Raz and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. GUY RAZ, HOST:  So think about how easy it is to lie now over e-mail or in a text. All this technology has made lying so much easier.

I'm Arun Rath. This is E3, the Electronic Entertainment Expo - the videogame industry's biggest convention. The old Stereotype that gamers are all nerdy, white men - well, there was truth to that. A survey nine years ago found that 83 percent of people making videogames were white men. And the vast majority of college students studying computer science and videogame art are men. Even today, a Kaiser Family Foundation study found that nearly nine out of nearly every 10 that videogame protagonists are white men. But in recent years, some in the industry say things are really changing. That interactive games incorporate sophisticated narratives like never before. That games are now directed at and are being played by a much more diverse group - no longer the domain of nerdy, white guy. So we came to this showcase of what the gaming world has in store to see how the industry is going to deliver on those promises. That's our cover story today. E3 is massive and bright and colorful and loud. Sensory overload doesn't quite cover it. In spite of all the noise and spectacle, none of the new games here seemed that new. A lot of sequels - to \"Assassin's Creed,\" \"Call Of Duty,\" \"Mario Kart,\" a repackaging of \"Halo,\" and lots of ultraviolence. The most exciting place at E3 was actually the quietest - a room above the crowded convention floor. Here they're demonstrating a game about as far as you can get from a first-person shooter. It's called \"Adrift,\" and it's being developed for the virtual reality of platform Oculus Rift. You may have heard of Oculus Rift. They were recently acquired in a huge deal by Facebook. I had the chance to try on the goggles that Mark Zuckerberg was willing to pay $2 billion for. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: When you pop this on, you'll find yourself in the game world environment. So have a look around, get your bearings. RATH: And I am in outer space. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: You can look down at your feet. RATH: Oh, my. I'm an astronaut floating in a face spaceship or space station that's been damaged. All I can hear is my breathing and Beethoven's Pathetique Sonata. There's the Earth. There's Mexico right below me. It's incredible, unlike any VR headset I've tried. My brain is processing the input like it's a real sense data. It's really amazing. I actually feel a bit of vertigo. Adam Orth is the creator of \"Adrift. \"ADAM ORTH: The goal of the game is to - A, survive, and B, get home safely. RATH: Honestly, I don't care about the goal of the game. I was just so excited to be in outer space. I could happily spend hours just exploring the environment. But here's the weirdest part of the experience - I had this deeply emotional feeling of being transported, an intensity I'd never felt before in the game. Orth says he wants to set a motion to take gamers beyond the standard, violent, action games. ORTH: And there's nothing wrong with those games. They're great. I love them, and I have made them, and I play them. But I don't want to make them any more. And I want to tell emotional stories. And that device is allowing me to tell them in a way that I was not able to do it before. RATH: It's kind of a buzz-kill to go back to the convention floor. The noise of firearms and explosions, mostly white male attendees playing almost entirely white male characters. Megan Farokhmanesh writes for Polygon, a gaming news site. MEGAN FAROKHMANESH: To the outside world, video games are violence and men doing that violence. And I think that that's a really good way push anybody out that would be interested in it. RATH: Past E3 press conferences have been roundly criticized for the lack of diversity. This year, out of dozen of presenters, there were five women and three people of color - an improvement to be sure, but not great. One Polygon headline announced that during the big press conferences, there were more severed heads in game demos than female presenters. FAROKHMANESH: I think it's getting a little bit better in recent years because people are finally starting to pay attention to it and starting to make it a big deal where it hasn't been so much before. RATH: And the tradition of booth babes, the hot models who draw attendees to displays - that's dying out. None of the major companies have them anymore. Women make up nearly half of video gamers, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation Study.

So the revolution in video games may be coming just a little later than advertised. ARUN RATH, HOST:  From the studios of NPR West in Culver City, California, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Arun Rath. This is E3, the Electronic Entertainment Expo - the videogame industry's biggest convention. The old Stereotype that gamers are all nerdy, white men - well, there was truth to that. A survey nine years ago found that 83 percent of people making videogames were white men. And the vast majority of college students studying computer science and videogame art are men. Even today, a Kaiser Family Foundation study found that nearly nine out of nearly every 10 that videogame protagonists are white men. But in recent years, some in the industry say things are really changing. That interactive games incorporate sophisticated narratives like never before. That games are now directed at and are being played by a much more diverse group - no longer the domain of nerdy, white guy. So we came to this showcase of what the gaming world has in store to see how the industry is going to deliver on those promises. That's our cover story today. E3 is massive and bright and colorful and loud. Sensory overload doesn't quite cover it. In spite of all the noise and spectacle, none of the new games here seemed that new. A lot of sequels - to \"Assassin's Creed,\" \"Call Of Duty,\" \"Mario Kart,\" a repackaging of \"Halo,\" and lots of ultraviolence. The most exciting place at E3 was actually the quietest - a room above the crowded convention floor. Here they're demonstrating a game about as far as you can get from a first-person shooter. It's called \"Adrift,\" and it's being developed for the virtual reality of platform Oculus Rift. You may have heard of Oculus Rift. They were recently acquired in a huge deal by Facebook. I had the chance to try on the goggles that Mark Zuckerberg was willing to pay $2 billion for. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: When you pop this on, you'll find yourself in the game world environment. So have a look around, get your bearings. RATH: And I am in outer space. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: You can look down at your feet. RATH: Oh, my. I'm an astronaut floating in a face spaceship or space station that's been damaged. All I can hear is my breathing and Beethoven's Pathetique Sonata. There's the Earth. There's Mexico right below me. It's incredible, unlike any VR headset I've tried. My brain is processing the input like it's a real sense data. It's really amazing. I actually feel a bit of vertigo. Adam Orth is the creator of \"Adrift. \" ADAM ORTH: The goal of the game is to - A, survive, and B, get home safely. RATH: Honestly, I don't care about the goal of the game. I was just so excited to be in outer space. I could happily spend hours just exploring the environment. But here's the weirdest part of the experience - I had this deeply emotional feeling of being transported, an intensity I'd never felt before in the game. Orth says he wants to set a motion to take gamers beyond the standard, violent, action games. ORTH: And there's nothing wrong with those games. They're great. I love them, and I have made them, and I play them. But I don't want to make them any more. And I want to tell emotional stories. And that device is allowing me to tell them in a way that I was not able to do it before. RATH: It's kind of a buzz-kill to go back to the convention floor. The noise of firearms and explosions, mostly white male attendees playing almost entirely white male characters. Megan Farokhmanesh writes for Polygon, a gaming news site. MEGAN FAROKHMANESH: To the outside world, video games are violence and men doing that violence. And I think that that's a really good way push anybody out that would be interested in it. RATH: Past E3 press conferences have been roundly criticized for the lack of diversity. This year, out of dozen of presenters, there were five women and three people of color - an improvement to be sure, but not great. One Polygon headline announced that during the big press conferences, there were more severed heads in game demos than female presenters. FAROKHMANESH: I think it's getting a little bit better in recent years because people are finally starting to pay attention to it and starting to make it a big deal where it hasn't been so much before. RATH: And the tradition of booth babes, the hot models who draw attendees to displays - that's dying out. None of the major companies have them anymore. Women make up nearly half of video gamers, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation Study. But that covers not just console games like \"Call Of Duty,\" but social games like \"Farmville\" on Facebook and mobile games like \"Candy Crush. \" Looking around at E3, it's tough to imagine the console players are really half women. Polygons managing editor Justin McElroy says the current system is self-perpetuating. JUSTIN MCELROY: Dudes are playing video games. Dudes are making video games.

I'm Arun here at NPR West. More than 25 years ago, Saroo Brierley was one of many poor children in rural India. SAROO BRIERLEY: My earliest earliest memory would have been going to sleep during the night and looking at the stars in the sky with my mother on one side of me and my siblings on the other. RATH: His mother was raising four children on her own. They were constantly hungry. Saroo's older brothers would hop trains to nearby towns to search for scraps. One day when he was just four years old, Saroo tagged along to the next city down the rail line. Ordered by his brother to wait at the station, he decided to take a nap. BRIERLEY: But when I woke up, my brother wasn't there anywhere to be seen. And I was thinking, you know, he should be here by now. You said you'd only be a few minutes away. And all I saw was a train in front of me. You know, I thought perhaps he's on this train. It was just as an impulse decision, which in fact changed my destiny for life. RATH: He ended up over a thousand miles from home in Calcutta. It might as well have been an alien planet. They spoke a different language. Saroo couldn't read, didn't even know the name of his hometown. He spent five harrowing months, first on the streets, then in a juvenile home and finally in an orphanage. There he was adopted by an Australian family and began a new life in Tasmania. As he recounts in his new book, \"A Long Way Home,\" Saroo Brierley never stopped thinking about his hometown in India. But finding a small neighborhood in a vast country where he could only remember landmarks proved impossible until Google Earth came along. Saroo spent years zooming in and out of satellite photos examining the web of railway lines across India, until one night in 2011, he saw something that he thought looked familiar. BRIERLEY: I thought to myself, well, you know, the first thing you've got to see before you come to your hometown is the river where you used to play with your brothers in the waterfall. And, you know, the architecture of this particular place where I used to visit quite a lot has to be exactly the same, otherwise if it's not, I'll just sort of, you know, fly over and go somewhere else. And so I studied it very carefully - extremely carefully. And the architecture of this particular place where I used to play with my brothers in the water was exactly the same. And I quizzed myself. Well, that's a bit unusual, but there could be another place that looks exactly the same, too. You never know. And so I thought to myself - well, why don't we just scroll a little bit more? I scrolled up a bit left and a bit right and a bit straight here - no, you've got to go underneath here. And before you know it, I was looking from a bird's-eye view at the town's central business district right in the middle. And I thought, well, on the right-hand side you should see the three-platform train station. And there it was. And on the left-hand side you should see a big fountain and there it was. And everything just started to match. And I said well, from this point I pretty much know how to get back to my suburb. And so I just traced a road that I would follow back as a child. And before I knew it, I was sort of looking at the suburb where I had grown up. And just on the right of it was the house that I grew up in. RATH: Was your heart just pounding when you're, you know, having these realizations, making these connections and recognizing those things? BRIERLEY: Yeah, it was. I was - I was trying to think, you know, is this a dream? Am I in reality? Get a hold of yourself, Saroo. And, you know, I sort of did the zoom-in, zoom-out - sort of looked at different angles, 3D angles - to make sure that, you know, what I'm looking at is not something that sort of looks the same, but it is what it is. And it is my hometown and I just couldn't sleep for that whole night. RATH: Let's skip several months ahead 'cause you go to India. You make the trip. You show up at your old house - just show up there. But no one's there. What happened? BRIERLEY: I sort of almost fell to my knees and I thought the worst. I've come all the way to find something that I had found on Google Earth and now I'm standing there. Here's the house that I grew up in as a child and the door's shut and it's locked. And there's no one there. And I can't believe how small it is. I thought perhaps everyone's gone. My whole family's, you know, died. They've passed away. But lucky for me, there was - this lady came out of a doorway holding a baby. And she said can I help you in a very sort of English-Hindi tone. And I said to her my name is Saroo. And these are my family members' names. I tried to be animated, too, by pointing this is the house that I grew up in. She sort of, I think, understood what I was talking about and later on in the conversation, she said these people don't live here anymore. And, you know, that sort of got me down again. And I thought what do I do? And another person comes in and I sort of spill my mantra to them as well. And then that sort of went on quite a few times with other people that kept wanting to know this person that's just a foreigner that's coming to a town that's never seen a foreigner. And people are starting to congregate and gather. And by the time the fourth person had come, they said just stay here for a sec. And within 10 minutes, they came back around. And they said now I'm going to take you to your mother. And I couldn't believe it because when I went around the corner, there was three ladies standing in front of an entrance to a house. And I looked at the second one. I thought oh, there's something about you.  And it took me, you know, a few seconds, but I decrypted what she used to look like to what she is when I saw her. And you looked so much shorter than as I remembered when I was a four-and-a-half-year-old child. But she came forward and I walked forward. And my emotions and tears and the chemical in my brain was like a nuclear fusion. I just didn't know really what to say because I never thought this point in time of ever seeing my mother would ever come true. And here I am standing in front of her and I don't know what she was thinking. But I think she was quite gobsmacked as in how can this day be so true because, you know, later on she really wanted to see me again and waited in the same place for a long time for my return. RATH: It sounds like this is something that obviously - it changed your life. I have to imagine that also reconnecting must have changed the lives of your Indian family. BRIERLEY: Yes. Well, you know, from my brother's point of you it's the time that I went missing and later on he found out that my oldest brother had died. It was a big loss to him. He had two brothers and all of a sudden within a week apart, they're all gone. And I think, they're very grateful and very happy. Now there's two in the family - two sons and one daughter. And she couldn't be, I reckon, any happier than what she is. So it's a big thing for her and the whole family. And perhaps they don't really know how to take it. But it's only time before it all sinks in that, you know, this is true. I am here. It isn't a dream. This is reality. RATH: That's Saroo Brierley. His new book is called \"A Long Way Home. \" Thank you so much. BRIERLEY: Thank you very much for having me. RATH: Again, it's ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR West. I'm Arun Rath.

Doctors are now using 3-D printers to make replacement body parts, among other things. The printer we're hearing is at the Food and Drug Administration offices, outside Washington D. C. This is an area they are starting to regulate. So NPR's Rob Stein went and got a little tour of the FDA lab. ROB STEIN, BYLINE: Is that white, plastic thing, below the nozzle there - is that what's being made? STEVE POLLACK: That's the object that's being built. And so you can see what looks like the line from a weedwacker. It's the plastic. . . BLOCK: And Rob Stein joins us to talk about this now. Rob, the printer that we were hearing there is in a lab, where they're evaluating medical devices, including replacement body parts made with 3-D printers. And this is where I have a really hard time wrapping my mind around this story. Explain how a 3-D printer actually works. STEIN: Oh sure, Melissa. So I think you're right. When most people think about a printer, they think about your typical ink printer, which squirts out ink onto to print words or pictures. Well, 3-D printers is basically the same idea, except instead of ink it squirts out something else, like plastic that's been melted into a liquid. And it squirts it out in a very precise pattern, that's determined by a computer, layer by layer. So it squirts out one layer and then another layer on top and so on and so forth, until it's created a very complex three-dimensional structure. Here's how Steve Pollack at the FDA explained it to me. POLLACK: You can take any object that you can create inside the computer, either by designing it or by capturing a three-dimensional representation of the object by scanning - either the exterior of it or using medical imaging, like X-ray or MRI. You can then take that three-dimensional rendition of the object and create it with the 3-D printer. BLOCK: OK, so how are doctors using the technology? What are some of the medical applications that they found? STEIN: There are actually a lot of medical applications. Now, at the moment, most of them are considered experimental, but some are already helping patients. You know, for example, I did a story recently about doctors in Michigan, who are using 3-D printing to create tiny customized, what they call, splints to help open up the windpipes of babies who are dying because they can't breathe. They were born with defective windpipes. But that's just one example. 3-D printing's also been used to build part of a jaw for patient in France, to patch broken skulls and even to rebuild the pelvis of a man, whose pelvis was destroyed by bone cancer. And what you can do with 3-D printing is you can tailor it to the individual patient. BLOCK: And when they're using 3-D printing to create replacement body parts, they're not just using plastic or metal as the key ingredients here, right? STEIN: That's right. Some researchers have started using 3-D printers with cells, human cells. These are cells that are donated from one patient to the other. Sometimes they're even using embryonic stem cells. And they've done this to create skin for burn victims and even blood vessels for people who have damaged blood vessels. Some scientists have started to use this to create human ears and noses and even very primitive organs that are being used for drug testing, but someday could be implanted into patients. BLOCK: Now, is safety the area where the FDA comes in, try to figure out how safe this is? STEIN: Yes, this raises all sorts of questions for the FDA, as you could imagine. This is really brand new stuff. And they're trying to figure out what questions to even ask. So they've set up this special lab, where they're testing this technology, themselves. They're using it to test the devices that are being produced. And the key question is, you know, how far can you push this technology and still make things that are safe and reliable? BLOCK: Fascinating stuff. NPR Health Correspondent, Rob Stein. Rob, thanks very much. STEIN: Oh, sure, nice to be here Melissa.

You know, for example, I did a story recently about doctors in Michigan, who are using 3-D printing to create tiny customized, what they call, splints to help open up the windpipes of babies who are dying because they can't breathe. They were born with defective windpipes. But that's just one example. 3-D printing's also been used to build part of a jaw for patient in France, to patch broken skulls and even to rebuild the pelvis of a man, whose pelvis was destroyed by bone cancer. And what you can do with 3-D printing is you can tailor it to the individual patient. BLOCK: And when they're using 3-D printing to create replacement body parts, they're not just using plastic or metal as the key ingredients here, right? STEIN: That's right. Some researchers have started using 3-D printers with cells, human cells. These are cells that are donated from one patient to the other. Sometimes they're even using embryonic stem cells. And they've done this to create skin for burn victims and even blood vessels for people who have damaged blood vessels. Some scientists have started to use this to create human ears and noses and even very primitive organs that are being used for drug testing, but someday could be implanted into patients. BLOCK: Now, is safety the area where the FDA comes in, try to figure out how safe this is? STEIN: Yes, this raises all sorts of questions for the FDA, as you could imagine. This is really brand new stuff. And they're trying to figure out what questions to even ask. So they've set up this special lab, where they're testing this technology, themselves. They're using it to test the devices that are being produced. And the key question is, you know, how far can you push this technology and still make things that are safe and reliable? BLOCK: Fascinating stuff. NPR Health Correspondent, Rob Stein. Rob, thanks very much. STEIN: Oh, sure, nice to be here Melissa.", "section": "Technology", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2014 NPR.

NPR's Julia Botero reports on one man's innovative, yet old-fashioned, method of cleaning up the harbor. JULIA BOTERO, BYLINE: We're standing on the dock of the Inner Harbor. It's a beautiful Thursday afternoon. The sun is shining. I'm looking down at the water. And right in front of me, I see not one but two, three, four, five, six cigarette butts, an empty bag of Cheetos, a Swiss rolls wrapper. John Kellett brings his speed boat close to the dock, where I'm waiting. Hi. JOHN KELLETT: Hi, I'm John. BOTERO: Hi, so you're - he's come to show me his solution for the trash problem in Baltimore's Inner Harbor. We speed past the Promenade to the center, Pier Six, where the waterwheel is docked. KELLETT: We can hop off and get on board, check out the wheel. Looks sort of like a cross between a spaceship and a covered wagon and an old mill. It's pretty unique in its look. But it's also doing a really good job getting this trash out of the water. BOTERO: Kellett used to walk by this pier on his way to work every day. He'd notice all the plastic cups and bottles floating in the water and heard tourists calling the harbor disgusting. It bugged him. Kellett approached Baltimore officials with his ideas for removing the trash. And they listened. KELLETT: So I started out thinking, maybe we could bail it like a hay bailer. And then I said, well, that's not necessary. Maybe we could make it even simpler. We could just use the power of the run-off that brings it, to collect it. BOTERO: Kellett is talking about the run-off from the Jones Falls River. He's placed the water wheel where the river spills into the harbor. After a rainstorm, trash lingering on Baltimore's streets - like that Cheetos bag and cigarette butts I saw earlier - gets swept into storm drains and ends up here. We watch as a 7-Eleven cup makes its way towards the wheel. KELLETT: Here it comes. The cup is trying to sink. It's going to push up to the conveyor. BOTERO: And into a dumpster. Since the water wheel begin turning in May, it's removed more than 50 tons of trash from the harbor. That's made business owners very happy. Bill Flohr runs Baltimore's East Marina. BILL FLOHR: The waterwheel's been a timesaver for us. It seems to be collecting probably 95 percent of what we normally had to pick up by hand. BOTERO: The city used to catch the trash with crab nets. FLOHR: I liken it to having a box of mice, letting them go in a gymnasium and having two people try to corral them. The mice spread out, the trash spreads out. And it's a long job to get it clean. BOTERO: John Kellett and his nephew replace a full dumpster with an empty one, to get ready for the rainy night ahead. KELLETT: Grab it, grab it, grab it, grab it, grab it, grab it, grab it. Now back up. There we go. Now you got it. BOTERO: It's been a wet couple of days. And the waterwheel has already collected 11 tons of trash this week. But Kellett knows his invention doesn't solve Baltimore's trash problem. He's hoping the thousands of tourists, who see the waterwheel, realize every Cheetos bag that ends up on the ground, may eventually float by in the water. Baltimore wants to make the Inner Harbor clean enough for swimming by 2020. For NPR News, I'm Julia Botero. MONTAGNE: This is NPR News.

Most coal in this country is buried too deep for conventional mining. An Australian company working in Wyoming wants to use an unconventional technique to get to that deep coal - burning it underground. Wyoming Public Radio's Stephanie Joyce reports. STEPHANIE JOYCE, BYLINE: The technique is called underground coal gasification, and the company that wants to use it in Wyoming is Linc Energy. The firm describes the process in a promotional video. (SOUNDBITE OF LINC ENERGY'S PROMOTIONAL VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR: Underground coal gasification, UCG for short, is a process in which coal is converted into synthesis gas while the coal remains deep underground. JOYCE: Basically it involves drilling holes into coal seams buried as much as a mile underground, and then lighting them on fire and capturing the gases, which can then be converted to fuels like diesel. It's not new technology. It was first pioneered in the late 1800s, and tested in the United States during the oil crisis of the 1970s. But outside of the former Soviet Union, it's never been developed commercially. PETER WOLD: This technology will open up that 95 percent that surface mining can't get to. JOYCE: That's Peter Wold. His family sold Linc Energy some of the 180,000 acres of coal it now owns in Wyoming. WOLD: It creates an opportunity for the United States to be energy independent. The potential here is phenomenal. JOYCE: For now, Linc Energy is only proposing a test project in Wyoming to demonstrate that the process works and is safe. If it's not done right, burning the coal could contaminate groundwater and create sinkholes. Linc Energy repeatedly declined to make anyone available for comment, but Nancy Nuttbrock, who directs the state agency that regulates mining, says there's risk with any new technology. NANCY NUTTBROCK: Obviously, the low-hanging fruit is going to require an easier means of extraction. As we go farther, and we've exhausted those resources that are nearer to the surface, the technology gets trickier. JOYCE: But Nuttbrock is convinced Linc Energy can burn Wyoming's coal safely. NUTTBROCK: We thoroughly investigated every aspect until we were comfortable enough to proceed with issuing the license. JOYCE: The state issued that license in November. The backlash was swift. At a public meeting about the project, nearby landowners felt they had been kept in the dark about the risks to groundwater. UNIDENTIFIED LANDOWNER 1: Why are we letting them come to our country, and most specifically, to our state to let them - to try and perfect it here? UNIDENTIFIED LANDOWNER 2: We want some answers. If things go wrong, what it's going to take to fix them, how much money? Where's that coming from? DAVID CAMP: It's fair to say I'm ambivalent about UCG. JOYCE: That's David Camp. He directs research into underground coal gasification - UCG - at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Camp says there are upsides like that miners don't have to go underground and that carbon capture is easier than with coal-fired power plants. But he says those need to be weighed against the risks. And he adds that even extremely complicated drilling technologies like deepwater drilling and fracking are easier and more cost-effective than UCG. CAMP: I really don't see where underground coal gasification, or really gasification in any form, plays in the United States right now. JOYCE: But not everywhere is as rich in oil and gas as the United States. And Camp says regardless of what happens in Wyoming, it's inevitable that the technology will be used elsewhere. CAMP: People need energy, and they always want to do whatever is cheapest. It takes regulations and laws to make dirty sources of energy expensive. So without that, coal is going to be used. JOYCE: In fact, right now there are underground coal gasification test projects underway or planned in a half-dozen other countries including Australia. The government there alleges Linc Energy's test project has caused serious environmental harm, although they haven't released any specifics. As for Wyoming, the Environmental Protection Agency is expected to weigh in on the final permitting later this summer. For NPR News, I'm Stephanie Joyce.

But in the last five years, there have been more than 200 unsafe or abnormal incidents involving drones flown by civilian agencies, the majority of them belonging to Customs and Border Protection. Meanwhile, since 2001, U. S. military drones have been involved in more than 400 major accidents, both here at home and in war zones overseas. Those are just some of the findings of a Washington Post investigation into the safety record of American drones. Craig Whitlock is a reporter on the series and he joins us now in studio to talk more. Craig Whitlock, welcome to the program. CRAIG WHITLOCK: Thanks for having me. CORNISH: So drone accident reports are not easy to come by, and you only got a hold of them after filing Freedom of Information Act request. Describe some of the accidents that you learned about, both overseas and here in the U. S. WHITLOCK: Well, we knew there had been a number of drone crashes, we didn't know how many. So when we kept digging, we kept finding more and more and were pretty startled by the sheer number. But what really struck me in looking through these voluminous investigation reports were the ways in which they crashed. There was one Predator drone in Afghanistan that crashed because the pilot didn't realize it was upside down. She was literally flying this thing upside down and thought it was going fine. And they kept warning her, it's upside down and she didn't believe them. In other cases, drones - four cases in Afghanistan - drones just kept going into thin air and they never came back. Other cases, they crashed on runways very frequently, pilots flew them into mountains without even realizing that the mountains were there. In one case just in April, there was an Army drone that crashed in a schoolyard in Pennsylvania. So the circumstances after you read enough of these cases get pretty alarming. CORNISH: And meanwhile here in the U. S. , we're on the edge of a drone boom, right? Just how many drones are expected to be taking to airspace in the next few years? What kind of regulations are being discussed? WHITLOCK: Well, there's going to be an enormous boom, as you put it. They FAA's developing rules that will legalize commercial drones in U. S. airspace. Congress passed a law authorizing this two years ago. Nobody really knows for sure, but the FAA has estimated that we're looking at 7,000 or 8,000 drones - small drones, just in the next few years. After that, it's really anybody's guess. They'll be opening up airspace in stages, but eventually, the law says a complete integration of drones into American airspace. So that means the same airports, the same airspace. They'll be treated like other aircraft. CORNISH: What's the rush to open up this airspace and what is that rush doing to the FAA? What's the pressure on them? WHITLOCK: Well, you say rush, but the drone industry and manufacturers actually say this is going very, very slow - that other countries have moved ahead. In Japan and Australia, they're commonly use drones for agriculture, small delivery, things like this. And that the demand has been building for the last few years in the United States for civilian drones, for private companies, for deliveries, for surveillance, police agencies really want to use them. One poll I'm aware of by the Pew Research Center recently found that a majority - almost 60 percent of Americans - did have concerns about legalizing drones in U. S. airspace and commercial drones in particular. So there's certainly a lot of concern out there that the FAA and the industry are going to have to alleviate. CORNISH: I mean, despite the fairly significant number of accidents, there have been no reports of deaths or serious injuries. And, of course, U. S. military says that drone flights are getting safer with increased use. How concerned should we still be about the safety of drones going forward? WHITLOCK: Well, you're right, the military has not had any accidental deaths from drones. Although they have had at least one midair collision that certainly brought home the dangers of this. But I think one thing you have to recognize - the military's actually pretty good flying these. They've been flying them for millions of hours, they have more experience with drones than any other organization or country in the world, and they're still having problems. The concern is when civilians start flying them, whether it's businesses or government agencies or hobbyists, what's going to happen when they start flying them? And what are the standards going to be? And what are the requirements going to be to ensure that they can fly them safely?

It's called \"Tape for the Turn of the Year. \" He wrote it on a roll of adding machine paper, kind of like Jack Kerouac's famous \"On the Road\" scroll, only skinnier. At the time, he was full of anxiety and anticipation. (Reading) I'm waiting to hear if Cornell will give me a job, he writes. (Reading) I need to work and maybe I write too much. He also mixes in what he sees out his window - the touched, tasted, heard, seen, he says. Plus all sorts of silly musings - swing your partner, promenade, he tells us. And he describes the tape he writes on - how it coils again on the floor into the unity of its conflicts. Ammons shows us his actual mind. It's crabby, overexcited, scared and endlessly curious. This book doesn't contain evidence of illicit drug deals or gang memberships like the most scintillating smart phones, but it's more than most of us would show a stranger. It offers up what we always hide - the fabric of our innermost thoughts. That's something no warrant can uncover, nor any ruling protect. CORNISH: The book is \"Tape for the Turn of the Year\" by A.

It's called \"Tape for the Turn of the Year. \" He wrote it on a roll of adding machine paper, kind of like Jack Kerouac's famous \"On the Road\" scroll, only skinnier. At the time, he was full of anxiety and anticipation. (Reading) I'm waiting to hear if Cornell will give me a job, he writes. (Reading) I need to work and maybe I write too much. He also mixes in what he sees out his window - the touched, tasted, heard, seen, he says. Plus all sorts of silly musings - swing your partner, promenade, he tells us. And he describes the tape he writes on - how it coils again on the floor into the unity of its conflicts. Ammons shows us his actual mind. It's crabby, overexcited, scared and endlessly curious. This book doesn't contain evidence of illicit drug deals or gang memberships like the most scintillating smart phones, but it's more than most of us would show a stranger. It offers up what we always hide - the fabric of our innermost thoughts. That's something no warrant can uncover, nor any ruling protect. CORNISH: The book is \"Tape for the Turn of the Year\" by A. R. Ammons. It was recommended by Craig Morgan Teicher. His latest book is called \"To Keep Love Blurry. \" MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:  You're listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News.", "section": "This Week's Must Read", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2014 NPR.

I'm Guy Raz. And today on the show, what's original? Is there anything that can, like - we could really say is totally original? KIRBY FERGUSON: The Big Bang. RAZ: (Laughter). FERGUSON: As far as we know, the Big Bang is original. RAZ: And everything else after that's. . . FERGUSON: Everything else, yeah. . . RAZ: . . . I guess, sort of, you know, derivative. FERGUSON: Yes. RAZ: This is Kirby Ferguson. He's a filmmaker. And he made a series of films called \"Everything Is A Remix\" because, as Kirby explains in those films, every painting, every song, every idea comes from somewhere else. And the basic element of creativity comes from remixing. FERGUSON: All of our works emerge out of our influences, out of building, you know, upon the works and with the works of other people. RAZ: Like, for example, Bob Dylan. Here's Kirby from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)FERGUSON: All right. Let's head back to 1964, and let's hear where some of Dylan's early songs came from. Going to do some side-by-side comparisons here. All right. This first song you're going to hear is \"Nottamun Town. \" It's your traditional folk tune. After that you'll, hear Dylan's \"Masters Of War. \"(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"NOTTAMUN TOWN\")JEAN RITCHIE: (Singing) In Nottamun Town, not a soul would look up. Not a soul would look up. Not a soul would look down. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"MASTERS OF WAR\")BOB DYLAN: (Singing) Come you masters of war, you that build the big guns, you that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs. . . FERGUSON: So that's the same basic melody and overall structure. This next one is \"The Patriot Game\" by Dominic Behan. Alongside that, you're going to hear \"With God On Our Side\" by Dylan. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"THE PATRIOT GAME\")DOMINIC BEHAN: (Singing) Come all you young rebels and list while I sing, for love of one's land is a terrible thing. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WITH GOD ON OUR SIDE\")DYLAN: (Singing) Oh, my name, it ain't nothing. My age, it means less. The country I come from is called the Midwest. . . FERGUSON: OK. Now, there's a lot of these. It's been estimated that two-thirds of the melodies Dylan used in his early songs were borrowed. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WITH GOD ON OUR SIDE\")DYLAN: (Singing) The laws to abide. . . RAZ: So I'm hearing all these Bob Dylan things, right? And like, it's hard for me to say because we're talking about Bob Dylan. . . FERGUSON: Yeah. RAZ: . . . But he stole all this stuff. . . FERGUSON: (Laughter). RAZ: . . . Like if this happened today with Twitter, like, within seconds after the release of this record. . . FERGUSON: It's true. RAZ: . . . Like, he'd be hammered. FERGUSON: He would be. Yeah. I mean, it was a different era. He was a folk musician. And the idea back then was not that you came up with original songs. The idea was you took the songs that came before you and you did new things with them. You know, you would write new lyrics to an existing melody or vice versa. You contributed to this body of folk music. That was the idea back then. So he wasn't unusual in what he was doing. He was doing what they do in folk music. (SOUNDBITE OF SPIRIT'S \"TAURUS\")RAZ: And this happens all the time in all kinds of music. So take Led Zeppelin for example, who used to listen to another band called Spirit. FERGUSON: And Spirit were - you know, they haven't really stood the test of time. But they were a reasonably well-known band in the '60s, and Zeppelin toured with them. RAZ: Which could be why this song is not \"Stairway To Heaven. \" It's called \"Taurus,\" and it came out two years earlier. They basically ripped off Taurus. FERGUSON: Yeah. They sound a lot like. And it does sound like the opening. . . (SOUNDBITE OF LED ZEPPELIN'S \"STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN\")FERGUSON: . . . Of \"Stairway To Heaven\" is fairly difficult to distinguish from that segment of \"Taurus. \"(SOUNDBITE OF LED ZEPPELIN'S \"STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN\")RAZ: Kirby, there has to be an original idea out there in the world. FERGUSON: I don't really think so. Again, you can merge things together. And you can do that so much that it can be difficult to tell where something came from. You know, you can be layering and layering and layering until the end result is really unrecognizable. But I think human beings aren't really capable of coming up with something from nowhere. Like, I think we just do not do that. We build out of materials. We use tools to make things. That's what we do. I don't think we summon things out of the blue. RAZ: Even when we think of something as totally new, totally different, like \"Star Wars\". . . FERGUSON: George Lucas was a famous fan of Akira Kurosawa. RAZ: He was the Japanese director who made all those samurai films in the '50s and '60s. FERGUSON: Just the styling of the Jedi Knights is very samurai. And the look of Darth Vader - like, the look of his helmet - looks a lot like the armor of samurai warriors. And, you know, the famous cantina scene in the first \"Star Wars\". . . (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"STAR WARS: EPISODE IV - A NEW HOPE\")ALFIE CURTIS: (As Cornelius Evazan) I don't like you, either. You just watch yourself. We're wanted men. FERGUSON: There's a bragging bad guy who ends up getting his arm chopped off. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"STAR WARS: EPISODE IV - A NEW HOPE\")TOMMY ILSLEY: (As Ponda Baba, screaming)FERGUSON: That resembles a scene from - I believe it's \"Yojimbo. \"(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"YOJIMBO\")JERRY FUJIO: (As Roku, screaming). RAZ: But here's the thing - nobody thinks of \"Star Wars\" as derivative even though it clearly draws upon Kurosawa's work. So where's the line between copying and building on something that came before? FERGUSON: I mean, to me, it's about how much you - how much mimicry you do, how much of the other artist you are taking. So if you take a large chunk of it, to me, that is where you're being derivative. You're being unoriginal. You know, I think you need to be transforming the things that you copy. You need to be recontextualizing them. It's about, where are you taking your copying to? And you need to be, you know, transforming and combining those elements in exciting ways. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)FERGUSON: Now, American copyright and patent laws run counter to this notion that we build on the work of others. Instead, these laws and laws around the world use the rather awkward analogy of property. Now, creative works may indeed be kind of like property, but it's property that we're all building on. And creations can only take root and grow once that ground has been prepared. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: So it's 2007. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)STEVE JOBS: A widescreen iPod with touch controls, a revolutionary mobile phone and a breakthrough Internet communications device. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: Steve Jobs on stage at Macworld, and he introduces the iPhone. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOBS: These are not three separate devices. . . (APPLAUSE)JOBS: . . . This is one device. RAZ: It's a complete breakthrough. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOBS: And we have invented a new technology called multi-touch. You can do multi-finger gestures on it. (LAUGHTER)JOBS: And, boy, have we patented it. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)RAZ: OK. So that was in 2007. But a year earlier, in 2006, an interface designer named Jeff Han gave a TED talk describing the very same technology. And Kirby Ferguson actually showed that footage of Jeff Han in his TED talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)FERGUSON: Let's hear what Jeff Han has to say about this newfangled technology. JEFF HAN: Multi-touch sensing isn't anything - isn't completely new. I mean, people like Bill Buxton have been playing around with it in the '80s. The technology, you know, isn't the most exciting thing here right now, other than probably its newfound accessibility. FERGUSON: So he's pretty frank about it not being new. So it's not multi-touch as a whole that's patented, it's the small parts of it that are. And it's in these small details where we can clearly see patent law contradicting its intent - to promote the progress of useful arts. And this idea that everything is a remix might sound like common sense until you're the one getting remixed. RAZ: So remember that Picasso quote that Mark Ronson mentioned a bit earlier? Well, listen to Steve Jobs in 1996. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOBS: I mean, Picasso had a saying. He said, good artists copy, great artists steal. And we have, you know, always been shameless about stealing great ideas. RAZ: OK. So fast-forward 14 years later - 2010 - when Google's Android phones started to challenge Apple's iPhone. Steve Jobs was quoted saying this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOBS: I'm going to destroy Android because it's a stolen product. (LAUGHTER)JOBS: I'm willing to go thermonuclear war on this. (LAUGHTER)JOBS: OK. So in other words, great artists steal, but not for me. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: Yeah. I mean, you think about Steve Jobs, right? The idea that he, at one point in his career, you know, admits to sort of stealing great ideas and then later on in his career saying, I will crush. . . FERGUSON: (Laughter) Yeah. RAZ: . . . Those people who steal - you know, steal my ideas. . . FERGUSON: Yeah. RAZ: . . . Is crazy. I mean, the iPhone, which is an amazingly beautiful piece of technology. . . FERGUSON: It is. RAZ: . . . Is all the result of the work of other people, right? Touchscreen technology. . . FERGUSON: Yeah. RAZ: . . . In cellphones and GPS and the Internet. . . FERGUSON: Yeah. RAZ: . . . I mean, like, without any of those things, that wouldn't exist. FERGUSON: Yeah. Absolutely. RAZ: So why wouldn't he acknowledge that? FERGUSON: I think it's a very individualistic fantasy. It makes good stories. Talking about individuals, talking about Steve Jobs or Picasso or whoever, it's good stories. And I think that's what we are geared towards. We're geared towards stories that are about individuals because that's how we navigate this world, so we respond to stories that way. Whereas telling stories about society, about this incredibly complex mass of human activity, that is a much harder story to tell. RAZ: So how do we start to think about all this in a completely different way? FERGUSON: I think it is important to say what you took and from where. I think transparency about what you're doing is a big deal nowadays. And I think most people just want other people to know that, hey, like, that's my bit. You know, that little piece of that thing, that's mine. I did that. And I think just, you know, being more reflective, you know, when you're on the receiving end of getting copied. Just think for a moment about where that came from. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)FERGUSON: You know, is it really yours? Because we definitely fool ourselves about where our ideas come from.

I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, What's Original? - how everything is built on something that came before it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: Not too long ago, a group of shareholders met at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, Calif. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TODD MARON: Good morning. Welcome to Tesla's 2014 annual shareholder meeting. RAZ: And people in that room were waiting to hear from Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk. And unbeknownst to all of them, he was about to hint at something really big. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ELON MUSK: It is surprising that there hasn't been more activity from other car companies to make serious electric vehicles. RAZ: In other words, he was asking the question, why aren't more big automakers making new and better electric cars? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MUSK: Yeah. I mean, I'm contemplating doing something fairly significant on that front, which would be kind of controversial with respect to Tesla's patents. And. . . RAZ: Something controversial with respect to Tesla's patents - because when you're developing a new technology, that's the one thing you care about most; that the idea is yours and yours alone. But a couple days later, Elon Musk was interviewed on the BBC. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Now, you said a few days ago that you intended to do something fairly controversial with patents. It's not clear what you meant by that. I mean, are you considering giving technology away? MUSK: You're on the right track. RAZ: He was up to something. And a couple days after that, Elon Musk broke the news. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Elon Musk has never been one to follow the crowd. Now he's taking a unique approach to Tesla's patents. He's giving them away for free. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: He says this is part of the company trying to spur innovation and development of electric vehicles across the entire industry. RAZ: From now on, he said, anyone who wants to take Tesla's technology, anyone who thinks they can build on it or make it better, they can. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MUSK: We're trying to figure out how to accelerate the advents of electric cars. And to the degree that we create technological barriers to that, it's not going to happen. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: Now, while giving away a patent might seem totally radical today, it turns out that some of the greatest inventions in history happened because people shared their ideas and they let others build on them - people like Ben Franklin. STEVEN JOHNSON: Ben Franklin, like, never patented anything he did. And he always kind of released any information about what he'd come up with as widely as possible. And he had a great explanation to this, which is he said he sent his ideas out into the world so that they would attract the attentions of the ingenious. RAZ: This is Steven Johnson. He wrote a book called \"Where Good Ideas Come From. \"JOHNSON: Ideas and innovation thrive in environments where ideas are free to flow from mind to mind and to be reused and repurposed and remixed in interesting and surprising ways. And a lot of the technology we're dependent on has come out of that kind of collaborative network. RAZ: And Steven has argued in his books that the most innovative, inventive people are. . . JOHNSON: Building on top of other people's idea in lots of subtle and not-so-subtle ways. So you can't think a thought without it somehow echoing somebody else's thought. RAZ: And one of those innovative people Steven has written about is a man named Joseph Priestley, who lived during the 18th century. And even though he was British, he happened to be really tight with the American Founding Fathers. JOHNSON: Priestley's one of these figures from this period who made a number of huge breakthrough discoveries, in chemistry in particular. He isolated, for the first time, a number of different gases, collaborating with Franklin. He was really the first person to realize that plants were creating oxygen. And he did these things just kind of in his home lab. And so we look back at those people in that period and we're like, gosh, they were so smart back then, you know? How did this person, who had basically no official training as a scientist - how did he end up being the discoverer of so many things? And I think the answer to that mystery is really that that was a moment in time where we had this incredible new tool of the scientific method. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)JOHNSON: You could go out into your garden. And you could discover things for the first time. So in a sense, the kind of - the soil of scientific discovery was very shallow at that point. You didn't have to dig very far to get something really interesting. RAZ: But here's the thing. We think of ideas during this time as been completely new and original. But even then, people like Priestley and Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson - they didn't just come up with ideas of their own. They would build on each other's ideas. And they would actually get together. JOHNSON: And they would have these, like, endless sessions where they would talk about electricity and chemistry and the American political situation and new ideas and kind of religious developments and just a whole host of science and social and technological innovations. And out of those conversations, just an amazing series of new ideas emerged. RAZ: These kinds of sessions were happening in Boston, Philadelphia, Paris, Vienna and London in coffeehouses. Steven Johnson picks up the rest of the story from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)JOHNSON: The coffeehouse played such a big role in the birth of the Enlightenment in part because of what people were drinking there - right? - because before, what people drank day in and day out, from dawn until dusk was alcohol, right? Alcohol was the daytime beverage of choice - right? - because the water wasn't safe to drink. Until the rise of the coffeehouse, you had an entire population that was effectively drunk all day. (LAUGHTER)JOHNSON: And you can imagine what that would be like, right? If you were drinking all day, and. . . (LAUGHTER)JOHNSON: And then you switched from a depressant to a stimulant. In your life, you would have better ideas. It's not an accident that a great flowering of innovation happened as England switched to tea and coffee. But the other thing that makes the coffeehouse important is the architecture of the space. It was a space where people would get together from different backgrounds, different fields of expertise. And an astonishing number of innovations from this period have a coffeehouse somewhere in their story. I've been spending a lot of time thinking about coffeehouses for the last five years because I've been on this quest to investigate this question of where good ideas come from. What is the space of creativity? And what I've been looking for is shared patterns, kind of signature behavior that shows up again and again in all of these environments. And I think I found a few. But what you have to do to make sense of this is you have to do away with a lot of the way in which our kind of conventional metaphors and language steers us towards certain concepts of idea creation, right? We have this very rich vocabulary to describe moments of inspiration, right? We have the - kind of the flash of insight, epiphanies. We have eureka moments. We have the lightbulb moments, right? All of these concepts share this basic assumption, which is that an idea is a single thing. It's something that happens often in a wonderful, illuminating moment. But more often than not, they're cobbled together from whatever parts that happened to be around nearby. We take ideas from other people, from people we've learned from, from people we run into in the coffee shop. And we stitch them together into new forms, and we create something new. That's really where innovation happens. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: When we think about an idea or a moment in history, it's just that, right? Like, it's a moment where somebody says, I've got it. Like, I've figured this out. And that actually never happens, right? JOHNSON: Right. For some reason, we have this need to tell stories about creativity and innovation in terms of eureka moments. And it's partially because I think it's a good story, you know? It's just great to kind of be like, the apple fell from the tree. And thus, he had a theory of gravity. RAZ: Wait. That didn't happen? JOHNSON: Well, on some level - the tricky part about it is that there are moments where you become conscious of an insight about the world. But the important part of it is that it's inevitably preceded by this long kind of incubation period. This is what I call the slow hunch. And the most important ideas normally have this slow hunch formation. And sometimes, that can take months or years - and in some cases, for decades. RAZ: Yeah. So in your TED talk, you mentioned those American scientists in Maryland who were working at the Applied Physics Laboratory. . . JOHNSON: Yeah. RAZ: . . . Who were totally, like, psyched when. . . JOHNSON: Yeah. RAZ: . . . When Sputnik launched. JOHNSON: Right. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)JOHNSON: It's October of 1957, and Sputnik has just launched. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: The epical scientific achievement by Soviet Russia. . . JOHNSON: And of course this is nerd heaven, right? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Today, a new moon is in the sky - a 23-inch metal sphere placed in orbit by a Russian rocket. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)JOHNSON: And two 20-something researchers at the APL are there at the cafeteria table having an informal conversation with a bunch of their colleagues. And these two guys are named Guier and Weiffenbach. And they start talking. And one of them says, hey. You know, has anybody tried to listen for this thing? There's this, you know, man-made satellite up there in outer space. It's obviously broadcasting some kind of signal. We could probably hear it. And it turns out Weiffenbach is kind of an expert in microwave reception. And he's got a little antenna set up with an amplifier in his office. And they start kind of noodling around - hacking, as we might call it now. And after a couple of hours, they actually start picking up this signal because the Soviets made Sputnik very easy to track - it was right at 20 megahertz - because they were afraid that people would think it was a hoax. (SOUNDBITE OF BEEPING)JOHNSON: And so these two guys are sitting there listening to this signal. And before long, they think, well, jeez. This is kind of historic. We should record it. And they start recording these little bleep, bleeps. And they start writing down the kind of date stamp - time stamps for each little bleep that they record. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: You are hearing the actual signals transmitted by the Earth-circling satellite. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #7: Until two days ago, that sound had never been heard on this Earth. JOHNSON: And then they start thinking, well, gosh. You know, we're noticing small little frequency variations here. We could probably calculate the speed. (SOUNDBITE OF BEEPING)JOHNSON: And eventually, they get permission to use the new, you know, Univac computer that takes up an entire room that they've just gotten at the APL. And they run some more of the numbers. And at the end of about three or four weeks, turns out they have mapped the exact trajectory. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #8: Right now it's north of Auckland, New Zealand and moving southeast. . . JOHNSON: . . . Just from listening to this one little signal. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #8: . . . In 10 minutes, about 1,500 miles north of middle America. JOHNSON: A couple of weeks later, their boss, Frank McClure, pulls them into the room and says, hey. You've figured out an unknown location of a satellite orbiting the planet from a known location on the ground. Could you go the other way? Could you figure out an unknown location on the ground if you knew the location of the satellite? And they thought about it. And they said, well, let's run the numbers here. And so they went back. And they thought about it. And they came back and said, actually, it'll be easier. And he said, oh. That's great because, see. I have these new nuclear submarines. . . (LAUGHTER)JOHNSON: . . . That I'm building. And it's really hard to figure out how to get your missile so that it will land right on top of Moscow if you don't know where the submarine is in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. So we're thinking we could throw up a bunch of satellites and use it to track our submarines and figure out their location in the middle of the ocean. Could you work on that problem? And that's how GPS was born. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: That's such an incredible story. JOHNSON: Yeah. Yeah. You know, here we have this gesture that's second nature to us now. RAZ: Yeah. JOHNSON: We kind of look down on our phone. . . RAZ: Right. JOHNSON: . . . To figure out where we are or get directions. RAZ: Or, like, where can I find - the other day, I was looking for Target. JOHNSON: Right. RAZ: And my GPS was going really slowly. And I was annoyed. I was like, hurry up. Tell me where the Target is. JOHNSON: Yeah. We're irritated. . . RAZ: Yeah. JOHNSON: . . . At the idea that, like, this magic. . . (LAUGHTER)JOHNSON: . . . Device in our hands is not instantly telling us where Target is. But think of all the different fields of expertise and different kinds of problems that had to be solved to be able to make the magic of GPS happen. So obviously, the whole history of computing - to be able to have a small computational device with a screen and a graphic interface, you have to understand the way that gravity works. (Laughter) You have to understand the way that space works. You have to be able to build the rockets that can put the GPS satellites up there. You have to understand satellites and the way that satellite communications are going to work. You also have to have incredible timekeeping technology, down to a billionth of a second. So that's just the beginning of all the kinds of problems that had to be solved over thousands of years, in a way, for us to be able to look down at our phone and say, like, oh, Target is, like, five minutes away (laughter). RAZ: Yeah. Thousands of years went into that moment. JOHNSON: (Laughter) It's better - I hope you had a good time at Target because people worked for a very long time. RAZ: Yeah. I went there at the right time. There weren't very long lines. JOHNSON: (Laughter). RAZ: So here's the thing, right? We don't like copycats. Like, our instinct is to say, oh, that's unoriginal or that's derivative. And yet, we are all, like - to be human is to copy. JOHNSON: Yeah. I think there is a - still a useful distinction between copying and - to use the kind of musical phrase - remixing, right? RAZ: Yeah. JOHNSON: Look. We all have to copy. And to some extent, education is copying. But when we're looking at people who are creating things and we're trying to evaluate their work, I think there is an understandable criticism where we feel that something is completely derivative. The problem is when we get into the idea that something has to be wholly original, that's where we get into trouble. And in fact, when people seek out something that is wholly original, I think they often fail because they can't do it, right? Trying to come up with something that's entirely new is almost always impossible. And it's much more productive to think about, you know, how do I combine things? How do I take a bunch of things that already exist and remix them into something new? So one story I love - when Apple was trying to come up with the design and kind of functioning of their retail stores - and looking back on this, it's funny. You know, a lot of people were very skeptical about this. And they were like, what does Apple know about doing stores. . . RAZ: Yeah. JOHNSON: . . . You know, you're going to open these stores in shopping malls and downtown areas. And this is going to be a big flop. They don't know what they're doing with this. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)JOHNSON: And the normal way you would do this is you would look at their direct competitors in that field and say, OK. You know, we're a consumer electronics store, so let's look at Best Buy or RadioShack or something like that and see what they're doing and try and do it a little bit better. But Apple wanted to be Apple and wanted to think different and reinvent the whole process. And they were like, well, we want to create a store that's so great that people will just, like, come and hang out in it. You know, even if they don't want to buy anything, they just want to be there. So they said, well, you know, what would be an environment that's like that, where the customer is really happy and really enjoys it? And so they decided to study high-end hotel chains. And so they sent a bunch of employees into the Ritz-Carlton training program and had them, like, take this program. And then they came back. And they said, OK, so what's the secret? And one of the things that they came up with is they said, you know, the thing that people love about a high-end hotel is they love the concierge. Like, you go into the concierge. And whatever you ask for, like, they're working on it. And it's just such a great thing. And so they said, well, what would be the equivalent of high-end hotel concierge in a computer store? What would that look like? And that's how they came up with the Genius Bar. The Genius Bar is basically a hotel convention dragged over into a new environment, kind of reimagined slightly. And now the Genius Bar is so popular that, you know, you have to make an appointment three weeks in advance (laughter) to actually meet with them. RAZ: Yeah. JOHNSON: And the Apple Store is the most profitable by square foot retail environment on the planet. RAZ: So who knew? Without the Ritz-Carlton, you wouldn't have the Apple store. JOHNSON: Right. RAZ: Without, you know, I guess, like, the palace of Versailles, you wouldn't have the Ritz-Carlton. JOHNSON: On some level, you could look at each of those steps and say, well, that's derivative. Like, it was derivative of Apple to borrow an idea from Ritz-Carlton. But what's clear is that they've borrowed it, but they've repurposed it in a new way. And that's the line. That's where the - really, the most effective forms of creativity happen is where you, you know, reimagined something old in a new context.

In the front office - Portia Robertson Migas and Eric Newsome. Thanks to our partners at TED - Chris Anderson, June Cohen, Deron Triff and Janet Lee. I'm Guy Raz, and you've been listening to ideas worth spreading on the TED Radio Hour from NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"4 CHORDS\")THE AXIS OF AWESOME: (Singing) . . . Wherever you will go. And can you feel the love. . . GUY RAZ, HOST:   It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, What's Original? - how everything is built on something that came before it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: Not too long ago, a group of shareholders met at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, Calif. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TODD MARON: Good morning. Welcome to Tesla's 2014 annual shareholder meeting. RAZ: And people in that room were waiting to hear from Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk. And unbeknownst to all of them, he was about to hint at something really big. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ELON MUSK: It is surprising that there hasn't been more activity from other car companies to make serious electric vehicles. RAZ: In other words, he was asking the question, why aren't more big automakers making new and better electric cars? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MUSK: Yeah. I mean, I'm contemplating doing something fairly significant on that front, which would be kind of controversial with respect to Tesla's patents. And. . . RAZ: Something controversial with respect to Tesla's patents - because when you're developing a new technology, that's the one thing you care about most; that the idea is yours and yours alone. But a couple days later, Elon Musk was interviewed on the BBC. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Now, you said a few days ago that you intended to do something fairly controversial with patents. It's not clear what you meant by that. I mean, are you considering giving technology away? MUSK: You're on the right track. RAZ: He was up to something. And a couple days after that, Elon Musk broke the news. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Elon Musk has never been one to follow the crowd. Now he's taking a unique approach to Tesla's patents. He's giving them away for free. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: He says this is part of the company trying to spur innovation and development of electric vehicles across the entire industry. RAZ: From now on, he said, anyone who wants to take Tesla's technology, anyone who thinks they can build on it or make it better, they can. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MUSK: We're trying to figure out how to accelerate the advents of electric cars. And to the degree that we create technological barriers to that, it's not going to happen. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: Now, while giving away a patent might seem totally radical today, it turns out that some of the greatest inventions in history happened because people shared their ideas and they let others build on them - people like Ben Franklin. STEVEN JOHNSON: Ben Franklin, like, never patented anything he did. And he always kind of released any information about what he'd come up with as widely as possible. And he had a great explanation to this, which is he said he sent his ideas out into the world so that they would attract the attentions of the ingenious. RAZ: This is Steven Johnson. He wrote a book called \"Where Good Ideas Come From. \" JOHNSON: Ideas and innovation thrive in environments where ideas are free to flow from mind to mind and to be reused and repurposed and remixed in interesting and surprising ways. And a lot of the technology we're dependent on has come out of that kind of collaborative network. RAZ: And Steven has argued in his books that the most innovative, inventive people are. . . JOHNSON: Building on top of other people's idea in lots of subtle and not-so-subtle ways. So you can't think a thought without it somehow echoing somebody else's thought. RAZ: And one of those innovative people Steven has written about is a man named Joseph Priestley, who lived during the 18th century. And even though he was British, he happened to be really tight with the American Founding Fathers. JOHNSON: Priestley's one of these figures from this period who made a number of huge breakthrough discoveries, in chemistry in particular. He isolated, for the first time, a number of different gases, collaborating with Franklin. He was really the first person to realize that plants were creating oxygen. And he did these things just kind of in his home lab. And so we look back at those people in that period and we're like, gosh, they were so smart back then, you know? How did this person, who had basically no official training as a scientist - how did he end up being the discoverer of so many things? And I think the answer to that mystery is really that that was a moment in time where we had this incredible new tool of the scientific method. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) JOHNSON: You could go out into your garden. And you could discover things for the first time. So in a sense, the kind of - the soil of scientific discovery was very shallow at that point. You didn't have to dig very far to get something really interesting. RAZ: But here's the thing. We think of ideas during this time as been completely new and original. But even then, people like Priestley and Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson - they didn't just come up with ideas of their own. They would build on each other's ideas. And they would actually get together. JOHNSON: And they would have these, like, endless sessions where they would talk about electricity and chemistry and the American political situation and new ideas and kind of religious developments and just a whole host of science and social and technological innovations. And out of those conversations, just an amazing series of new ideas emerged. RAZ: These kinds of sessions were happening in Boston, Philadelphia, Paris, Vienna and London in coffeehouses.

I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, what's original - how every idea, every invention, every song is built on something that came before it. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LA DI DA DI\")SLICK RICK: OK, party people in the house - you're about to witness something you've never witnessed before. RAZ: And this song will make you wonder about this whole idea of originality because this song is one of the most-sampled songs of all time. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LA DI DA DI\")SLICK RICK: . . . Doug E. Fresh and his partner. . . RAZ: The track is by the rappers Doug E. Fresh and Slick Rick. They released it in 1984. And the story behind the song - we heard about it from this guy. MARK RONSON: My name is Mark Ronson. RONSON: He's a deejay, record producer and kind of a big deal. RONSON: I guess the thing that I'm most known for is production on Amy Winehouse's album \"Back To Black. \"RAZ: Or, more recently, this track. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"UPTOWN FUNK\")BRUNO MARS: (Singing) Don't believe me - just watch. RAZ: . . . With Bruno Mars. RONSON: I produced records for Lily Allen, Paul McCartney's last album. I just sound like I'm name-dropping. I'm just trying to grab onto the things that people might have heard of. RAZ: (Laughter). (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LA DI DA DI\")SLICK RICK: Oh, yeah. RAZ: Anyway, back to that first song. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LA DI DA DI\")SLICK RICK: La di da di. RAZ: It's called \"La Di Da Di. \"(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LA DI DA DI\")SLICK RICK: La di da di. RAZ: And back in the early 1990s, if you were a deejay in New York like Mark was, it was a staple of your set. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LA DI DA DI\")SLICK RICK: (Rapping) La di da di. We like to party. We don't cause trouble. We don't bother nobody. We're just some men that's on the mic. RONSON: It's literally, like, Chapter 1 of the hip-hop deejay bible. And it's an incredible song because it's just a beatbox and a rap over it. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LA DI DA DI\")SLICK RICK: (Rapping) But that's true. That's why we never have. . . RONSON: Yeah. You can play all five minutes of it on a dance floor and have the entire dance floor sing every word of that song. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LA DI DA DI\")SLICK RICK: (Rapping) . . . For my fingernails due to the night and on my behalf. . . RAZ: But what makes \"La Di Da Di\" more than just a really good rap song and why so many artists have borrowed from it in their own music is that it's full of these little lyrical moments. And those moments - those samples - would become the building blocks of hip-hop. RONSON: Especially because Slick Rick's voice is so iconic and has these little kind of, like, singsongy turns of phrases. Oh, these are, like, tick tock - you don't stop. And we go a little something like this. Hit it. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LA DI DA DI\")SLICK RICK: (Singing) Tick tock - you don't stop. And we go a little something like this. Hit it. RONSON: All those soundbites that have become, like. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LA DI DA DI\")SLICK RICK: (Singing) Hit it. Na, na, na, na, na. Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na (ph). RAZ: And that hit it - just that moment - it's been sampled in hundreds of songs from. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LA DI DA DI\")SLICK RICK: (Singing) Hit it. Na, na, na, na, na. . . RAZ: . . . Ini Kamoze in 1995. . . RONSON: They used the hit it. RAZ: . . . Way back to the Beastie Boys in 1986. RONSON: They used the hit it. RAZ: And it's not just this one line that's been sampled over and over again since 1984, as Mark explained from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)RONSON: Over the next 10 years, \"La Di Da Di\" continues to be sampled by countless records, ending up on massive hits. Snoop Doggy Dogg covers the song. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LODI DODI\")SNOOP DOGG: (Singing) Lodi Dodi (ph). We likes to party. We don't cause trouble. We don't bother nobody. We. . . RONSON: . . . On his debut album \"Doggystyle\" and calls it \"Lodi Dodi. \" Copyright lawyers are having a field day at this point. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LA DI DA DI\")SNOOP DOGG: (Singing) Oh, Ricky, Ricky, Ricky, can't you see? Somehow your words just hypnotize me. RONSON: And then you fast-forward to 1997. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"HYPNOTIZE\")THE NOTORIOUS BIG: (Singing) Biggie, Biggie, Biggie, can't you see? Sometimes your words just hypnotize me. RONSON: And The Notorious B. I. G. , or Biggie, reinterprets \"La Di Da Di\" on his No. 1 hit called \"Hypnotize. \" So if we come all the way out to the present day now, the cultural tour de force that is Miley Cyrus - she reinterprets \"La Di Da Di\" completely for her generation. And we'll take a listen to the Slick Rick part and then see how she's sort of flipped it. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LA DI DA DI\")SLICK RICK: (Rapping) La di da di. We like to party. We don't cause trouble. We don't bother nobody. We're. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WE CAN'T STOP\")MILEY CYRUS: (Singing) La da di da di. We like to party. RAZ: La di da da di. We like to party. Is that one right? Yeah. You know, I did the backing vocals for her on that. RONSON: You did. I could tell. RAZ: I didn't want to tell you before this. RONSON: That's very humble of you. I appreciate it. RAZ: And there are so many more. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LA DI DA DI\")SLICK RICK: OK. Party people in the house. . . RAZ: That party people in the house - sampled by Beyonce and Kanye West on this track. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"PARTY\")KANYE WEST: (Singing) You a bad girl, and your friend's bad, too. RAZ: Even by the indie rock band Spoon. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"FINER FEELINGS\")SLICK RICK: (Singing) OK, party people in the house. RONSON: It's like a grunt from James Brown or, you know, a saxophone blurt from Junior Walker. It's like it will sound good over everything, and it will always make your tracks sound more legit and more real and hip-hop. RAZ: And the other thing about sampling - it's like reinventing something to such an extent that it becomes something new. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)RONSON: See, 30 years ago, you had the first digital samplers, and they changed everything overnight. All of a sudden, artists could sample from anything and everything that came before them from a snare drum from the funky Meters or a Ron Carter baseline - you know, the theme to \"The Price Is Right. \" Albums like De La Soul's \"3 Feet High And Rising\" and the Beastie Boys' \"Paul's Boutique\" looted from decades of recorded music to create these sonic-layered masterpieces that were basically the Sgt. Peppers of their day. But the thing is, they were sampling those records because they heard something in that music that spoke to them that they instantly wanted to inject themselves into the narrative of that music. They heard it, they wanted to be a part of it. And all of a sudden, they found themselves in possession of the technology to do so, not much unlike the way the delta blues struck a chord with the Stones and the Beatles and Clapton, and they felt the need to co-opt that music for the tools of their day. You know, in music, we take something that we love, and we build on it. That's just how it goes. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"4 CHORDS\")THE AXIS OF AWESOME: (Singing) Forever young - I want to be forever young. RAZ: So the idea here is that a lot of songs. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"4 CHORDS\")THE AXIS OF AWESOME: (Singing) I'm your biggest fan. I'll follow you until you love me. RAZ: . . . Come from other songs. And, of course, this is not just true for music. It's the same for film or novels or technology - pretty much every idea out there. Like, we sort of celebrate things that seem original. But, like, what is original? RONSON: What's the quote, which is the T. S. Eliot quote, isn't it - which apparently he even stole from Picasso about, you know, genius steals - great artists. . . RAZ: Good artists borrow or copy, great artists steal. . . RONSON: Yes. RAZ: . . . Something like that. RONSON: We all - whether we steal or we borrow, it's impossible even if you're telling yourself you're not stealing, subconsciously, you're influenced whether you like it or not. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"4 CHORDS\")THE AXIS OF AWESOME: (Singing) Can you feel the love tonight? RAZ: We'll hear more of this song throughout the show, by the way. It's from a group called Axis of Awesome (ph), and the song is called \"4 Chords. \"(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"4 CHORDS\")THE AXIS OF AWESOME: (Singing) Country road, take me home. . . RAZ: OK. So in music, there's a fine line between sampling, borrowing, paying homage and just plain ripping off. Here's more of Mark Ronson from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)RONSON: Since the dawn of the sampling era, there's been endless debate about the validity of music that contains samples. You know, the Grammy committee says that if your song contains some kind of pre-written or preexisting music, you're ineligible for Song of the Year. Rockists (ph) - who are racists but only about rock music - constantly use. . . (LAUGHTER)RONSON: . . . The argument to - that's a real word. That is a real word. They constantly use the argument to devalue rap and modern pop. (LAUGHTER)RONSON: And these arguments completely miss the point because the dam has burst. We live in the post-sampling era. We take the things that we love, and we build on them. And when we really add something significant and original, and we merge our musical journey with this, then we have a chance to be a part of the evolution of that music that we love and be linked with it once it become something new again. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"REHAB\")AMY WINEHOUSE: (Singing) They tried to make me go to rehab. I said, no, no, no. RONSON: Which was something that I had learned when I was working with the late, amazing Amy Winehouse on her album \"Back To Black. \"(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"REHAB\")WINEHOUSE: (Singing) Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, you'll know, know, know. RONSON: A lot of fuss was made about the sonic of the album that myself and Salaam Remi, the other producer, achieved - how we captured this long-lost sound. But without the very, very 21st-century personality and firebrand that was Amy Winehouse and her lyrics about rehab, the whole thing would have ran the risk of being very pastiche, to be honest. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"REHAB\")WINEHOUSE: (Singing) I ain't got 70 days. RONSON: I mean, there was no doubt that Amy and I and Salaam all had this love for this gospel soul and blues and jazz that was evident listening to the musical arrangement. So it was - she brought the ingredients that made it urgent and of the time. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"REHAB\")WINEHOUSE: (Singing) . . . Didn't get a lot in class, but I know we don't come in a. . . RAZ: When you sit down to - like, to write or produce something, and you've been listening to all this music, and you always listen to music, how do you sort of separate yourself from what's in your head or put your own spin on a sound that's just been swirling around inside of you? RONSON: Well, you know, I deejay a lot as well. I still deejay, like, at, you know, clubs and all these festivals in the summer. And when it's time for me to make my own record, I really do have to just stop doing all that because you never know. You know, you've been playing all this other music for an hour and a half the night before you get in the studio, you're, like, you don't want that stuff to sort of filter into you. I mean, Prince - I used to read interviews where he said he never listens to anyone else's music but his own. I mean, I guess if the songs I wrote were as good as Prince's. . . RAZ: (Laughter). RONSON: . . . Maybe that would apply to me. But so I - you know, when it's time to work on the record, I kind of put the blinders on a bit more and make sure that, you know, I'm not too much listening to something - especially if it's something everyone is making a big fuss about because that's the last thing that you want to do - have that filter into your work. And by the time you put out this record, you've worked for a year and a half, someone says, like, oh, yeah, it sounds like Arcade Fire. RAZ: (Laughter). RONSON: And you just want to go jump out a window. RAZ: Has that happened to you before? RONSON: No, it hasn't. But it's - like, it's something that I'm, you know, wary of. Because, you know, at the end of the day, like, I think you'd be really hard-pressed to listen to something today and not be able to at least find four bars of it that's completely derivative of something else. Like, and that's why when I see young producers today - like, kids who are 19, 20 - they stay up all night just sampling straight from YouTube - which is dangerous in kind of, you know, there's troubled lines there because credit needs to go to the people that created this stuff in the first place. But it does make for some incredible, exciting art. And, you know, it does mean that some little kid sitting in his basement in Ohio with a laptop can be making some of the most interesting music around. RAZ: Deejay and producer Mark Ronson. We asked him what he's borrowed for his own music. He mentioned a song called \"Bang Bang Bang\" that uses this 19th-century nursery rhyme. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"ALOUETTE\")THE HIT CREW: (Singing) Je te plumerai la tete. Je te plumerai la tete. Je te plumerai (ph). . . (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"BANG BANG BANG\")MARK RONSON AND THE BUSINESS INTL: (Singing) . . . La tete. Je te plumerai la tete. RAZ: \"Alouette\" - a very interesting choice. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"BANG BANG BANG\")THE HIT CREW: (Singing) Alouette (ph). RONSON: Yes. That was a song that I'd given it to this singer named MNDR. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"BANG BANG BANG\")MNDR: (Singing, unintelligible). RONSON: And a lot of the singers that I work with - they just get on the mic, and they kind of freestyle, and the first thing that comes out. So I think what she sang the first time sounded a lot like Abu Dahdah (ph) or something like that. And she was, like, oh, what if I - can I make it alouette? And then. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"BANG BANG BANG\")MNDR: (Singing) Je te plumerai la tete. RONSON: Yeah. It's kind of - French Canadian nursery rhymes - anything's game. RAZ: Mark Ronson's TED talk on sampling is at ted. com. (SOUNDBITE OF MARK RONSON SONG, \"BANG BANG BANG\")RAZ: Stay with us for more ideas about what's original. I'm Guy Raz, and this is the TED Radio Hour. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"4 CHORDS\")THE AXIS OF AWESOME: (Singing) Mother Mary comes to me. . . RAZ: . . . From NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"4 CHORDS\")THE AXIS OF AWESOME: (Singing) Save tonight. Going to take a lot to drag me away from you. GUY RAZ, HOST:   It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz.

RONSON: And you just want to go jump out a window. RAZ: Has that happened to you before? RONSON: No, it hasn't. But it's - like, it's something that I'm, you know, wary of. Because, you know, at the end of the day, like, I think you'd be really hard-pressed to listen to something today and not be able to at least find four bars of it that's completely derivative of something else. Like, and that's why when I see young producers today - like, kids who are 19, 20 - they stay up all night just sampling straight from YouTube - which is dangerous in kind of, you know, there's troubled lines there because credit needs to go to the people that created this stuff in the first place. But it does make for some incredible, exciting art. And, you know, it does mean that some little kid sitting in his basement in Ohio with a laptop can be making some of the most interesting music around. RAZ: Deejay and producer Mark Ronson. We asked him what he's borrowed for his own music. He mentioned a song called \"Bang Bang Bang\" that uses this 19th-century nursery rhyme. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"ALOUETTE\") THE HIT CREW: (Singing) Je te plumerai la tete. Je te plumerai la tete. Je te plumerai (ph). . . (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"BANG BANG BANG\") MARK RONSON AND THE BUSINESS INTL: (Singing) . . . La tete. Je te plumerai la tete. RAZ: \"Alouette\" - a very interesting choice. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"BANG BANG BANG\") THE HIT CREW: (Singing) Alouette (ph). RONSON: Yes. That was a song that I'd given it to this singer named MNDR. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"BANG BANG BANG\") MNDR: (Singing, unintelligible). RONSON: And a lot of the singers that I work with - they just get on the mic, and they kind of freestyle, and the first thing that comes out. So I think what she sang the first time sounded a lot like Abu Dahdah (ph) or something like that. And she was, like, oh, what if I - can I make it alouette? And then. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"BANG BANG BANG\") MNDR: (Singing) Je te plumerai la tete. RONSON: Yeah. It's kind of - French Canadian nursery rhymes - anything's game. RAZ: Mark Ronson's TED talk on sampling is at ted. com. (SOUNDBITE OF MARK RONSON SONG, \"BANG BANG BANG\") RAZ: Stay with us for more ideas about what's original. I'm Guy Raz, and this is the TED Radio Hour. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"4 CHORDS\") THE AXIS OF AWESOME: (Singing) Mother Mary comes to me. . . RAZ: . . . From NPR.

But they've only captured a small part of the U. S. market. This week, the iconic name in American motorcycles, Harley-Davidson, rolled out its electric prototype at events in New York City and in Harley's corporate hometown of Milwaukee. Chuck Quirmbach of Wisconsin Public Radio reports. CHUCK QUIRMBACH, BYLINE: This is the gasoline fuel sound that many Harley riders covet and even add loud exhaust pipes to amp it up. (SOUNDBITE OF MOTORCYCLE)QUIRMBACH: Now here's what some Harley designers and engineers have been working on for the last four years. It's Harley's prototype electric motorcycle - a sportier looking model called LiveWire. Ben Lund is a leader of the project. He says he hopes the bike shows off Harley's technology skills and begins to reach out to a younger, more urban potential customer base. BEN LUND: People in an urban environment have a - have different needs and different requirements. You know, they're not riding, you know, a thousand miles across the country, right? They're maybe, you know, running around to the grocery store or they're - have a short commute. QUIRMBACH: Electric motorcycles are better suited to shorter trips because their batteries have to be recharged. But Harley is counting on the LiveWire to generate excitement. MARK-HANS RICHER: There it is baby. QUIRMBACH: Marketing officer Mark-Hans Richer introduced the bike before a few hundred people outside Milwaukee's Harley-Davidson Museum. RICHER: Come on in. Give it up band. Let's hear it. (SOUNDBITE OF LIVEWIRE ENGINE)RICHER: It's like an electric guitar. QUIRMBACH: Some in the crowd cheered and took pictures. But others were not getting a charge out of LiveWire. John Vozar and Randy Jones arrived on their twin-engine Harleys. RANDY JONES: Too quiet. JOHN VOZAR: Yeah, too quiet. QUIRMBACH: Jones also mentioned another shortcoming. JONES: I like a bigger motorcycle and more of a touring bike. QUIRMBACH: While Vozar pointed out the electric bike's slow charge. VOZAR: They're going to have to charge in a hurry. If they can charge as fast as you can pump gas, then I'll think about it. Until then, no thank you. QUIRMBACH: LiveWire can typically go about 50 miles before it needs to be plugged in for a few hours. Ken Condon, of Motorcycle Consumer News, says he welcomes Harleys potential entry into the electric motorcycle market. But, he says, the risk is in alienating more traditional customers. KEN CONDON: They tend to really identify very strongly with the look and feel and sound of the V-Twin engine. So how they're actually going to market this successfully within their customer base - that would be something that I think would be a very big challenge. QUIRMBACH: But as the first of about 150 Milwaukee test riders of the electric motorcycles ended their 15 minute jaunt, there's indication that Harley-Davidson may be onto something, at least with younger riders. Jerry Marousek of Fitchburg, Wisconsin, says he loves the acceleration of LiveWire. JERRY MAROUSEK: It just has so much more instant power than almost any other motorcycle that I have owned, which is smile inducing - or grin inducing actually. QUIRMBACH: Harley-Davidson plans to take its prototype electric motorcycle to more than 30 cities over the next few months. And sometime after that, decide whether to put LiveWire on the market.

If you were a Facebook user in January of 2012, you might remember logging on, scrolling through your newsfeed and feeling especially upbeat or maybe a little more down than usual. If so, you are not alone. Back then, Facebook's data scientists manipulated the newsfeed. More than 600,000 unwitting users were shown either mostly upbeat or more depressing news stories in an effort to determine if this affected their moods. Facebook recently published their findings, but a lot of people are not liking this experiment. We wanted to talk about it, so we called Rey Junco. He's a fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard. And Adrienne LaFrance is a senior associate editor at The Atlantic, and she wrote about the study and people's reaction to it. Welcome to you both. Thank you so much for joining us. ADRIENNE LAFRANCE: Thank you. REYNOL JUNCO: Thanks, Michel. MARTIN: Adrienne, you wrote that there was something new level creepy about this study, but you're also trying to figure out - because you pointed out that, you know, we know that the newsfeeds are curated or manipulated by somebody. And you were trying to investigate what it is that felt new level creepy about it. So what'd you come up with? LAFRANCE: I think there's a number of issues to unpack here and one of them is sort of the extent to which this manipulation has to do with consent. So it's sort of an ethical question as well as a legal question. But I thought it was telling - one of the authors who works at Facebook posted a statement over the weekend - something to the effect of, you know, we're just trying to better give you what you want. And to me there's a real contradiction there in them saying, we're trying to give you what you want, but, you know, we're not even going to give you the chance to give consent to let us know. MARTIN: So the first issue was they didn't ask people whether they were willing to, you know, participate in this. But what else? Is it the emotional manipulation, trying to evaluate your feelings as opposed to what you're interested in - is that what you think? LAFRANCE: I think so. I mean, yes, there is a contextual question here. So people are accustomed to being manipulated with the messages of say, like, an advertiser for instance. But when you go to your Facebook page, unless you've read the terms of service extensively - or even if you have frankly - you're not necessarily going to understand that there's sort of this puppet-master on the other side affecting what you see with the purpose of trying to see if it makes you happier or more sad. MARTIN: Rey Junco, what's your reaction to the study - what was your reaction to it? JUNCO: Well, my reaction was, oh, I have to take a look and let me see. But it's clear that there was, so that at least wasn't thought of when planning this study. Cornell released a statement saying that they took a look and what was told to them was that the researcher was using pre-existing data, so they didn't need to do a review. I mean, the data was already there. Facebook said that their internal review process, which clearly wasn't enough because they really didn't plan on what would happen if this would adversely affect people. I think the thing that bugs me the most about it is that you're toying with people's psychological states - that could have some pretty significant consequences. I mean, imagine if somebody who is depressed - who is going on Facebook to garner support from some friends - is exposed to a more negative newsfeed. They're probably more likely to be even more depressed because of that. So they really didn't consider how the risk reward balance, which you have to do ethically when you're planning a study, you have to purposely and thoroughly consider the risk inherent in the study and whether that risk is justified given what you might find. And then you also have to put in place protections for people who might experience some negative effects. MARTIN: Adrienne, you contacted Susan Fiske, who edited the study before it was printed in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of America. And presumably you asked her these questions about what ethical considerations were made before utilizing this technique. What did she say in response to these questions? LAFRANCE: This is actually an area where some confusion emerged because when I first talked to her, she described the process in which - when the paper first crossed her desk, it raised some concerns for her. And so she went back to the authors and asked them about what kind of review process the paper had gone through. And her understanding was that it had been held to the scrutiny of a local institutional review board. And what that means is - an institutional review board - or IRB a lot of people call them - are boards that consider the ethics and sort of hold research to a standard, particularly when human subjects are involved. And so at first it seemed from my conversation with her as though there was this level of scrutiny. And then later came out that no, a university IRB or institutional review board, hadn't been used. And in fact, Facebook used an internal review process - the details of which are not public and don't appear to be (laughing) anywhere near being made public given Facebook's reluctance to talk in detail about this. MARTIN: So, Rey, is the issue for users is that you think you're creating a newsfeed based on your interests, and then you find out that actually the person on the other end is deciding what you see based on what - a desire to affect your mood, right? And that's different from say advertising, where you turn on your favorite show and you realize that the advertisers are trying to get you to buy something. That's the point of advertising, right? Or to do something, which is the point of political advertising. And in this instance ,you're being manipulated but you don't know why. Is that really kind of the issue here? JUNCO: Yeah, I think - I think that's it. I mean, hey, we live in a very consumerist society. We're kind of used to this, right? We're kind of used to billboards and advertising pushing us to buy a product. But this isn't about buying a product, this is about messing with people's emotions. I mean, I don't want to blow this out of proportion - their effect sizes were small. However, that being said, the Facebook team had little way of knowing that the effect sizes were going to be small. So - so, you know, before the fact they should've planned this out. So I think people are justifiably upset because they are messing with your emotions without your permission. I mean, you know, who needs more drama in their life, right? MARTIN: (Laughing) Unless you want it - unless you're seeking the drama. In which case. . . JUNCO: Hey, if that's your thing. . . MARTIN: . . . You can turn on \"Scandal. \" Adrienne, what's Facebook's response to this? As I mentioned it - when you talked to Susan Fiske, who edited the study, she said that this was really Facebook's issue to decide how they are allowing people to look at their data. So what did Facebook have to say about this? LAFRANCE: Facebook has issued a couple of statements, including a public statement from one of the authors of the study who's a Facebook employee. But they haven't, at least to me - and I know several other reporters at other outlets - they haven't been willing to answer follow-up questions asking for more specifics. So they've really circled the wagons. One of the things that keeps sort of sticking out to me - it's a quote from the study that they found they were able to lead people to experience the same emotions without their awareness. So sort of taking a step back from this specific study - to know that a company like Facebook, who doesn't have necessarily much interest in giving public disclosure about its intentions, is trying to lead people to experience emotions without their awareness. I think that that raises much larger concerns, especially when they have access to data about everybody - at levels that we don't fully understand. MARTIN: Do you think that there will be consequences going forward now that this has come to light? LAFRANCE: Well, I mean, Facebook's stock price was not affected (laughing) so not - it doesn't appear to be hurting the company in the immediate short-term. You know, I'm hopeful that it will launch a larger conversation, and an overdue one, about data use and data privacy and the intersection of these companies that actually wield enormous power over information but don't adhere to ethics in the professional sense that we as journalists might think, or even federal regulations that academics are - are scrutinized to. So hopefully the conversation will continue. But, you know, it's hard to say if Facebook has any incentive to change. MARTIN: Rey Junco, what about you? What - do you think there will be consequences as a result of this? JUNCO: I - well, I hope so. I hope that Facebook and other technology companies will implement more stringent independent reviews of their research. I think it's important for these companies to understand the power they hold over their users. And that when you are doing social science research, that you should follow the same ethics as all other social science researchers - as the ethics recommended by the federal government. And even ethics that are not recommended (laughing) by the federal government, just the basic ethical business of doing no harm. MARTIN: Well, Rey, can I just push through on this for one second? Now, what would you say to those who argue that - first of all, users are giving their consent to these kinds of experiments when they sign up for Facebook and then they click the I agree on the user agreement, which is very expansive. And other people who say well, you know, maybe I as a journalist don't agree with this statement but a lot of people feel that there are certain cable channels who are to doing the same thing. In essence, they are stacking the story selection in an effort to achieve a certain response in their viewers, so what's the difference? JUNCO: Well, I think - I certainly wouldn't suggest that we limit the ability of companies to analyze their data. I think where we need to draw the line is when there is a manipulation of something about the user - what they might feel, what they might experience, if there is a possibility of some negative effect. That needs to be thought through and there need to be some kind of protections in place. MARTIN: Rey Junco is an associate professor in the school of education at Iowa State University. He's a fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard. We go to him often to talk about matters related to the Internet and society and social media.

I mean, imagine if somebody who is depressed - who is going on Facebook to garner support from some friends - is exposed to a more negative newsfeed. They're probably more likely to be even more depressed because of that. So they really didn't consider how the risk reward balance, which you have to do ethically when you're planning a study, you have to purposely and thoroughly consider the risk inherent in the study and whether that risk is justified given what you might find. And then you also have to put in place protections for people who might experience some negative effects. MARTIN: Adrienne, you contacted Susan Fiske, who edited the study before it was printed in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of America. And presumably you asked her these questions about what ethical considerations were made before utilizing this technique. What did she say in response to these questions? LAFRANCE: This is actually an area where some confusion emerged because when I first talked to her, she described the process in which - when the paper first crossed her desk, it raised some concerns for her. And so she went back to the authors and asked them about what kind of review process the paper had gone through. And her understanding was that it had been held to the scrutiny of a local institutional review board. And what that means is - an institutional review board - or IRB a lot of people call them - are boards that consider the ethics and sort of hold research to a standard, particularly when human subjects are involved. And so at first it seemed from my conversation with her as though there was this level of scrutiny. And then later came out that no, a university IRB or institutional review board, hadn't been used. And in fact, Facebook used an internal review process - the details of which are not public and don't appear to be (laughing) anywhere near being made public given Facebook's reluctance to talk in detail about this. MARTIN: So, Rey, is the issue for users is that you think you're creating a newsfeed based on your interests, and then you find out that actually the person on the other end is deciding what you see based on what - a desire to affect your mood, right? And that's different from say advertising, where you turn on your favorite show and you realize that the advertisers are trying to get you to buy something. That's the point of advertising, right? Or to do something, which is the point of political advertising. And in this instance ,you're being manipulated but you don't know why. Is that really kind of the issue here? JUNCO: Yeah, I think - I think that's it. I mean, hey, we live in a very consumerist society. We're kind of used to this, right? We're kind of used to billboards and advertising pushing us to buy a product. But this isn't about buying a product, this is about messing with people's emotions. I mean, I don't want to blow this out of proportion - their effect sizes were small. However, that being said, the Facebook team had little way of knowing that the effect sizes were going to be small. So - so, you know, before the fact they should've planned this out. So I think people are justifiably upset because they are messing with your emotions without your permission. I mean, you know, who needs more drama in their life, right? MARTIN: (Laughing) Unless you want it - unless you're seeking the drama. In which case. . . JUNCO: Hey, if that's your thing. . . MARTIN: . . . You can turn on \"Scandal. \" Adrienne, what's Facebook's response to this? As I mentioned it - when you talked to Susan Fiske, who edited the study, she said that this was really Facebook's issue to decide how they are allowing people to look at their data. So what did Facebook have to say about this? LAFRANCE: Facebook has issued a couple of statements, including a public statement from one of the authors of the study who's a Facebook employee. But they haven't, at least to me - and I know several other reporters at other outlets - they haven't been willing to answer follow-up questions asking for more specifics. So they've really circled the wagons. One of the things that keeps sort of sticking out to me - it's a quote from the study that they found they were able to lead people to experience the same emotions without their awareness. So sort of taking a step back from this specific study - to know that a company like Facebook, who doesn't have necessarily much interest in giving public disclosure about its intentions, is trying to lead people to experience emotions without their awareness. I think that that raises much larger concerns, especially when they have access to data about everybody - at levels that we don't fully understand. MARTIN: Do you think that there will be consequences going forward now that this has come to light? LAFRANCE: Well, I mean, Facebook's stock price was not affected (laughing) so not - it doesn't appear to be hurting the company in the immediate short-term. You know, I'm hopeful that it will launch a larger conversation, and an overdue one, about data use and data privacy and the intersection of these companies that actually wield enormous power over information but don't adhere to ethics in the professional sense that we as journalists might think, or even federal regulations that academics are - are scrutinized to. So hopefully the conversation will continue. But, you know, it's hard to say if Facebook has any incentive to change. MARTIN: Rey Junco, what about you? What - do you think there will be consequences as a result of this? JUNCO: I - well, I hope so. I hope that Facebook and other technology companies will implement more stringent independent reviews of their research. I think it's important for these companies to understand the power they hold over their users. And that when you are doing social science research, that you should follow the same ethics as all other social science researchers - as the ethics recommended by the federal government. And even ethics that are not recommended (laughing) by the federal government, just the basic ethical business of doing no harm. MARTIN: Well, Rey, can I just push through on this for one second? Now, what would you say to those who argue that - first of all, users are giving their consent to these kinds of experiments when they sign up for Facebook and then they click the I agree on the user agreement, which is very expansive. And other people who say well, you know, maybe I as a journalist don't agree with this statement but a lot of people feel that there are certain cable channels who are to doing the same thing. In essence, they are stacking the story selection in an effort to achieve a certain response in their viewers, so what's the difference? JUNCO: Well, I think - I certainly wouldn't suggest that we limit the ability of companies to analyze their data. I think where we need to draw the line is when there is a manipulation of something about the user - what they might feel, what they might experience, if there is a possibility of some negative effect. That needs to be thought through and there need to be some kind of protections in place. MARTIN: Rey Junco is an associate professor in the school of education at Iowa State University. He's a fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard. We go to him often to talk about matters related to the Internet and society and social media. Adrienne LaFrance is a senior associate editor at The Atlantic. Thank you both so much for speaking with us. JUNCO: Thanks Michel.

I'm Kelly McEvers. The Internet of things, it's one of those phrases that once you hear it, it might stick in your head. And this is what you need to know. Soon, the majority of devices that connect to the Internet will not be computers or smart phones but the rest of the stuff we use in our lives - fridges, light bulbs, door locks, bags of lettuce, automatically changing temperature, checking for freshness, turning on or off, locking and unlocking, quietly running our homes and gathering tons of information about how we live. So are you creeped out or ready to let the robots take over? Let's ask Carlos Watson about this. He's the founder of the online magazine Ozy, and he's joining me from his lookout in Mountain View, California. Hey, Carlos. CARLOS WATSON: Hey, Kelly. How are you? MCEVERS: Good. This all sounds a little like, you know, 3-D, sci-fi, fantasy. How far away are we from this being real? WATSON: Well, if you've got a smart phone, which most of us do, it's not that far. And the fact that there are companies like Nest, the makers of those kind of cool smart thermostats, getting bought up for billions of dollars by companies like Google and the fact that we're talking about things like Google glasses or even the kind of so-called wearable computers like Fitbit or Nike Fuel, means that after years of talking about it, it's here. MCEVERS: OK, so it doesn't just apply to some of those things we're familiar with, what else? What other kind of devices are we talking about? WATSON: Well, you know, the really interesting thing is that while we're talking about it a lot, Kelly, in terms of consumer facing things, maybe even a bigger market for this, the true trillion-dollar market, may be when businesses try and run their own factories or offices better. So now they're saying, boy, we could manage things like how hot and cold the building is or how smartly our factory runs or even a hospital thinking about managing the beds and how warm the bed is for different patients. So that's even a bigger conversation that's starting to emerge. MCEVERS: And I'm told there's even applications for prisons. What's that? WATSON: Indeed. One of our writers this week, Melissa Pandika, wrote about the epidemic in many cases of suicide in prisons - two to three times more suicide in prisons, much more mental illness. And in order to begin to deal with that in a very different way a number of prisons have begun to use sensors, that can sense early leading indicators of depression, whether that's a prisoners breathing, the amount of movement. So you are seeing this idea, the Internet of things - this idea that so many different things are connected to the Internet that they can gather information and try and react smartly, as you're saying, show up in places you might not expect. MCEVERS: What about the creepy part of this, though - I mean, the privacy and security concerns about all of the data that's being collected. WATSON: So totally freaking people out. It sounds a lot like big brother in \"1984\" and George Orwell. How much information do I really want someone to know about how often I sleep or about exactly when I show up at work or about how active I am when I'm working? And am I that comfortable with my boss or, frankly in some cases, Facebook or Google knowing that information? The other piece that you're hearing a lot of concern about, security. How much am I at risk if someone hacks that information? If everything is connected to the Internet, how vulnerable is not just your email, but health devices, your bank account, all sorts of other things?

I'm Guy Raz. Our show today - the making of a champion. (SOUNDBITE OF OLYMPIC MARATHON)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER: And he'll turn right, into the mount, and head towards gold. RAZ: So the winner of the 2012 Olympic marathon ran it in two hours, eight minutes. (SOUNDBITE OF OLYMPIC MARATHON)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER: This is the Olympic champion. Stephen Kiprotich of Uganda is the Olympic gold medalist. A brilliant, brilliant. . . RAZ: And had Stephen Kiprotich been running in the 1904 Olympic marathon, he'd have beat the actual winner, Thomas Hicks, by an hour and a half, a story told in a book by this guy. DAVID EPSTEIN: I'm David Epstein. RAZ: Who is full of facts like these. EPSTEIN: I'm author of \"The Sports Gene. \"RAZ: David writes about sports science and medicine. EPSTEIN: But I'm also an investigative reporter at ProPublica. RAZ: Which means it's basically his job to figure out how athletes do what they do. And he's particularly interested in why, over the past hundred years, they seem to have gotten so much better. EPSTEIN: We definitely are better. Although, it sort of depends how you look at the question because in some ways, if we're talking about raw human capabilities, we might not be as much better as we like to believe that we are. RAZ: Here's David on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)EPSTEIN: The Olympic motto is citius, altius, fortius - faster, higher, stronger. And athletes have fulfilled that motto rapidly. In 1936, Jesse Owens held the world record in the 100 meters. Had Jesse Owens been racing last year in the world championships of the 100 meters when Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt finished, Owens would have still had 14 feet to go. That's a lot in sprinter land. To give you a sense of how much it is, I want to share with you a demonstration conceived by sports scientist Ross Tucker. Now, picture the stadium at the world championships of the 100 meters. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS COMPETITION)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER 2: The Olympic, men's 100 meters finals. Thompson - Trinidad, Powell - Jamaica. EPSTEIN: Thousands of fans waiting with bated breath to see Usain Bolt. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS COMPETITION)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER 2: Bolt - Jamaica. EPSTEIN: The fastest man in history. Flashbulbs popping as the nine fastest men in the world coil themselves into their blocks. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS COMPETITION)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER 2: On your mark. . . EPSTEIN: And I want you to pretend that Jesse Owens is in that race. Now close your eyes for a second and picture the race. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS COMPETITION)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER 2: Set. UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER 3: On their way. And Gatlin got away brilliantly, and he's ahead of the field at the moment. . . EPSTEIN: An American sprinter jumps out to the front. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS COMPETITION)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER 3: Bolt going very near. (Yelling) Here comes Usain Bolt. EPSTEIN: Usain Bolt starts to catch him. Usain Bolt passes him. And as the runners come to the finish, you'll hear a beep. . . (SOUNDBITE OF BEEP)EPSTEIN: . . . As each man crosses the line. UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER 3: (Yelling) Usain Bolt storming through. . . (SOUNDBITE OF TWO BEEPS)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER 3: (Yelling) He takes it again. Blake gets the silver. . . EPSTEIN: That first beep was Usain Bolt. That last beep was Jesse Owens. Listen to it again. (SOUNDBITE OF TWO BEEPS)EPSTEIN: When you think of it like that, it's not that big a difference, is it? And then consider that Usain Bolt started by propelling himself out of blocks down a specially fabricated carpet, designed to allow him to travel as fast as humanly possible. Jesse Owens, on the other hand, ran on cinders. Rather than blocks, Jesse Owens had a gardening trowel that he had used to dig holes in the cinders to start from. Biomechanical analysis of the speed of Owens' joints shows that if he'd been running on the same surface as Bolt, he wouldn't have been 14 feet behind; he would have been within one stride. Rather than the last beep, Owens would have been the second beep. Listen to it again. (SOUNDBITE OF TWO BEEPS)EPSTEIN: That's the difference track surface technology has made, and it's done it throughout the running world. RAZ: I mean, this is an incredible story. I mean, this - this would suggest that runners aren't really all that much faster today. EPSTEIN: No, that's true that the differences are certainly wildly exaggerated. I mean, granted, Jesse Owens was blowing people away in his day, but there's no question about it, and. . . RAZ: Yeah, I mean, you hear those beeps, and you cannot distinguish them - barely. EPSTEIN: Yeah, right. It just - it's like (imitating beep noise) - that's like pretty much it. That's - and the difference between those guys - so what? It's about half a percent difference or 1 percent difference between a guy who's a living legend - and I don't think anybody else could even name one of those other beeps. RAZ: Yeah. EPSTEIN: That's what we're talking about. You're talking about a half percent difference in performance. RAZ: It's incredible. EPSTEIN: And it means, like, the difference between someone being a living legend and having an off-season job. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)EPSTEIN: Still, technology isn't the only thing pushing athletes forward. While indeed we haven't evolved into a new species in a century, the gene pool within competitive sports most certainly has changed. In the early half of the 20th century, physical education instructors and coaches had the idea that the average body type was the best for all athletic endeavors - medium height, medium weight, no matter the sport. And this showed in athletes' bodies. In the 1920s, the average elite high jumper and average elite shot putter were the same exact size. But as that idea started to fade away, as sport scientists and coaches realized that rather than the average body type, you want highly specialized bodies that fit into certain athletic niches, a form of artificial selection took place, a self-sorting for bodies that fit certain sports. And athletes' bodies became more different from one another. Today, rather than the same size as the average elite high jumper, the average elite shot putter is two and a half inches taller and 130 pounds heavier. And this happened throughout the sports world. And at the same time, digital technology - first radio, then television and the Internet - gave millions or, in some cases, billions of people a ticket to consume elite sports performance. The financial incentives and fame and glory afforded elite athletes skyrocketed, and it tipped toward the tiny upper echelon of performance. It accelerated the artificial selection for specialized bodies. In sports where height is prized, like basketball, the tall athletes got taller. In 1983, the National Basketball Association signed a groundbreaking agreement, making players partners in the league - entitled to shares of ticket revenues and television contracts. Suddenly, anybody who could be an NBA player wanted to be, and teams started scouring the globe for the bodies that could help them win championships. Almost overnight, the proportion of men in the NBA who were at least 7 feet tall doubled to 10 percent. Today, 1 in 10 men in the NBA are at least 7 feet tall. But a 7-foot-tall man is incredibly rare in the general population. So rare that if you know an American man between the ages of 20 and 40 who's at least 7 feet tall, there's a 17 percent chance he's in the NBA right now. (LAUGHTER)EPSTEIN: Still, even changing technology and the changing gene pool in sports don't account for all the changes in performance. Athletes have a different mindset than they once did. RAZ: And one of those athletes is Pam Reed. EPSTEIN: Who's a legendary ultra marathoner, one of the greatest female ultra endurance athletes of all time. RAZ: And back in 2002, Pam became the first-ever female winner of the Badwater Ultramarathon, which is a 130 mile race in the middle of summer in Death Valley, which is also one of the hottest places on earth. PAM REED: Hi there, this is Pam Reed. You know what? It is 2 o'clock here. I'm in Salt Lake City. RAZ: Pam is 53. REED: I'm going to go for an hour run, and it's about 100 degrees. I'm doing some heat training right now. RAZ: And a few years ago, David tracked Pam down to find out what makes her different. EPSTEIN: Pam has an incessant drive to be active. So this was my favorite interview because the day I interviewed her, she had just finished the national championships and Ironman Triathlon here in New York the day before. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: A 2. 4 mile swim - 112 mile bike - 26. 2 mile run - discover it in a test of strength, resolve, endurance. REED: I got second. And it was a great race (laughing). RAZ: OK, so the very next day, Pam was flying out of LaGuardia. EPSTEIN: And her flight was delayed, and she gets so uncomfortable sitting still, that she stashed her bags in a corner and was running laps around the parking structure while I was interviewing her. . . RAZ: (Laughing). EPSTEIN: . . . The day after the Ironman Triathlon national championships. REED: You know, it's funny because I've done that in LA, New York, Chicago, Phoenix, Tucson (laughing) - you know - in the parking garages in all those airports. You know, I'll tell my husband, OK, I'll be back in an hour and a half, and I'll just go run around for an hour. I take my radio and - yeah, so it's - because it's so boring, you know, sitting there (laughing). RAZ: Now, scientists have tried for years to figure out how people like Pam do what they do. And as David was researching all of these elite athletes like Pam, he started to notice a pattern in the way they set goals. EPSTEIN: Where it's not like, I'm going to win, you know, the marathon at the Olympics. It's more like, today in my workout from mile three to four, I'm going to push hard - like actionable goals, where you have that Diana Nyad-sized feat off in the distance but are really good at setting these sort of more proximate goals that actually tell you what to do today. RAZ: But there's something else that might set Pam apart. Now, normally your brain is designed to limit what you can do with your body. At a certain point, if you're pushing your body beyond its limits, your brain will just shut your body down to make sure you don't die. EPSTEIN: I mean, like, if you land at altitude, your brain will start holding back some of your physical resources before you've even tried to do anything. RAZ: Wow. EPSTEIN: It will just sense, like, something's different in this atmosphere. I'm not going to let you use all of your resources. And part of pushing yourself farther is convincing your brain that, look, we're not going to die or this is - this is really important. REED: Well, yes, yes, definitely. You have to over - you have to just tell yourself - you feel like death, you do. He's right. You feel like death. And then for some reason, you come back to life. It's really bizarre. That's happened to me so many times. EPSTEIN: There's no question that training is - is the ultimate biological exploration of your mind. . . RAZ: Yeah. EPSTEIN: . . . Beyond what any cutting-edge science can provide you at this point. RAZ: I mean, that's how you convince your brain that you're not going to die, right? EPSTEIN: That's right. That's - look, when you start training - and, you know, exercise physiologists know this - before your muscles get bigger or you're - you know, you produce more red blood cells, you have an integration of your central nervous system that starts making activity smoother. Like, if you've ever started to training for running, you'll notice after a couple weeks, you start to feel smoother while running before you've even gotten in shape because your brain is sort of integrating the movements and adjusting to your new reality. RAZ: So I'm wondering, like, even in these elite athletes - right? - who are wired and built, I guess, differently in so many ways - I mean, even for them, like, how important is winning, is victory? EPSTEIN: It depends. It really depends. I think in many ways, for many athletes, it is. I mean, when I went to, you know, places like rural Kenya to visit the tribe that produces - the Kalenjin - that produces all the great runners - like, they are running to live. Like, that's - you know - if they had an economic renaissance tomorrow, like, their running phenomenon would be done. So they will often drop out of races if they're not going to win because they're doing it purely to make a living. And in other cases, I don't think winning is everything for an athlete, but I think they do have to feel like they're improving. I think a lot of athletes get addicted to improvement, and if they feel like they're stagnating, not sort of beating themselves, then they get pretty disappointed pretty fast. At the same time, I think there's something natural to us about physical competition. And it's such a direct and sort of pure way to measure achievement that's very difficult to come by in other ways in life. And I think that can really motivate people to kind of tweak and tweak and tweak and try to find ways to get just a little bit better. RAZ: David Epstein, his book is called \"The Sports Gene. \" Check out his talk at ted. com. GUY RAZ, HOST:  It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. Our show today - the making of a champion. (SOUNDBITE OF OLYMPIC MARATHON) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER: And he'll turn right, into the mount, and head towards gold. RAZ: So the winner of the 2012 Olympic marathon ran it in two hours, eight minutes. (SOUNDBITE OF OLYMPIC MARATHON) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER: This is the Olympic champion. Stephen Kiprotich of Uganda is the Olympic gold medalist. A brilliant, brilliant. . . RAZ: And had Stephen Kiprotich been running in the 1904 Olympic marathon, he'd have beat the actual winner, Thomas Hicks, by an hour and a half, a story told in a book by this guy. DAVID EPSTEIN: I'm David Epstein. RAZ: Who is full of facts like these. EPSTEIN: I'm author of \"The Sports Gene. \" RAZ: David writes about sports science and medicine. EPSTEIN: But I'm also an investigative reporter at ProPublica. RAZ: Which means it's basically his job to figure out how athletes do what they do. And he's particularly interested in why, over the past hundred years, they seem to have gotten so much better. EPSTEIN: We definitely are better. Although, it sort of depends how you look at the question because in some ways, if we're talking about raw human capabilities, we might not be as much better as we like to believe that we are. RAZ: Here's David on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) EPSTEIN: The Olympic motto is citius, altius, fortius - faster, higher, stronger. And athletes have fulfilled that motto rapidly. In 1936, Jesse Owens held the world record in the 100 meters. Had Jesse Owens been racing last year in the world championships of the 100 meters when Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt finished, Owens would have still had 14 feet to go. That's a lot in sprinter land. To give you a sense of how much it is, I want to share with you a demonstration conceived by sports scientist Ross Tucker. Now, picture the stadium at the world championships of the 100 meters. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS COMPETITION) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER 2: The Olympic, men's 100 meters finals. Thompson - Trinidad, Powell - Jamaica. EPSTEIN: Thousands of fans waiting with bated breath to see Usain Bolt. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS COMPETITION) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER 2: Bolt - Jamaica. EPSTEIN: The fastest man in history. Flashbulbs popping as the nine fastest men in the world coil themselves into their blocks. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS COMPETITION) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER 2: On your mark. . . EPSTEIN: And I want you to pretend that Jesse Owens is in that race. Now close your eyes for a second and picture the race. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS COMPETITION) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER 2: Set. UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER 3: On their way. And Gatlin got away brilliantly, and he's ahead of the field at the moment. . . EPSTEIN: An American sprinter jumps out to the front. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS COMPETITION) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER 3: Bolt going very near. (Yelling) Here comes Usain Bolt. EPSTEIN: Usain Bolt starts to catch him. Usain Bolt passes him. And as the runners come to the finish, you'll hear a beep. . . (SOUNDBITE OF BEEP) EPSTEIN: . . . As each man crosses the line. UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER 3: (Yelling) Usain Bolt storming through. . . (SOUNDBITE OF TWO BEEPS) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER 3: (Yelling) He takes it again. Blake gets the silver. . . EPSTEIN: That first beep was Usain Bolt. That last beep was Jesse Owens. Listen to it again. (SOUNDBITE OF TWO BEEPS) EPSTEIN: When you think of it like that, it's not that big a difference, is it? And then consider that Usain Bolt started by propelling himself out of blocks down a specially fabricated carpet, designed to allow him to travel as fast as humanly possible. Jesse Owens, on the other hand, ran on cinders. Rather than blocks, Jesse Owens had a gardening trowel that he had used to dig holes in the cinders to start from. Biomechanical analysis of the speed of Owens' joints shows that if he'd been running on the same surface as Bolt, he wouldn't have been 14 feet behind; he would have been within one stride. Rather than the last beep, Owens would have been the second beep. Listen to it again. (SOUNDBITE OF TWO BEEPS) EPSTEIN: That's the difference track surface technology has made, and it's done it throughout the running world. RAZ: I mean, this is an incredible story. I mean, this - this would suggest that runners aren't really all that much faster today. EPSTEIN: No, that's true that the differences are certainly wildly exaggerated. I mean, granted, Jesse Owens was blowing people away in his day, but there's no question about it, and. . . RAZ: Yeah, I mean, you hear those beeps, and you cannot distinguish them - barely. EPSTEIN: Yeah, right. It just - it's like (imitating beep noise) - that's like pretty much it. That's - and the difference between those guys - so what? It's about half a percent difference or 1 percent difference between a guy who's a living legend - and I don't think anybody else could even name one of those other beeps. RAZ: Yeah. EPSTEIN: That's what we're talking about. You're talking about a half percent difference in performance. RAZ: It's incredible. EPSTEIN: And it means, like, the difference between someone being a living legend and having an off-season job. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) EPSTEIN: Still, technology isn't the only thing pushing athletes forward. While indeed we haven't evolved into a new species in a century, the gene pool within competitive sports most certainly has changed. In the early half of the 20th century, physical education instructors and coaches had the idea that the average body type was the best for all athletic endeavors - medium height, medium weight, no matter the sport. And this showed in athletes' bodies. In the 1920s, the average elite high jumper and average elite shot putter were the same exact size. But as that idea started to fade away, as sport scientists and coaches realized that rather than the average body type, you want highly specialized bodies that fit into certain athletic niches, a form of artificial selection took place, a self-sorting for bodies that fit certain sports. And athletes' bodies became more different from one another. Today, rather than the same size as the average elite high jumper, the average elite shot putter is two and a half inches taller and 130 pounds heavier. And this happened throughout the sports world. And at the same time, digital technology - first radio, then television and the Internet - gave millions or, in some cases, billions of people a ticket to consume elite sports performance. The financial incentives and fame and glory afforded elite athletes skyrocketed, and it tipped toward the tiny upper echelon of performance. It accelerated the artificial selection for specialized bodies. In sports where height is prized, like basketball, the tall athletes got taller. In 1983, the National Basketball Association signed a groundbreaking agreement, making players partners in the league - entitled to shares of ticket revenues and television contracts. Suddenly, anybody who could be an NBA player wanted to be, and teams started scouring the globe for the bodies that could help them win championships. Almost overnight, the proportion of men in the NBA who were at least 7 feet tall doubled to 10 percent. Today, 1 in 10 men in the NBA are at least 7 feet tall. But a 7-foot-tall man is incredibly rare in the general population. So rare that if you know an American man between the ages of 20 and 40 who's at least 7 feet tall, there's a 17 percent chance he's in the NBA right now. (LAUGHTER) EPSTEIN: Still, even changing technology and the changing gene pool in sports don't account for all the changes in performance. Athletes have a different mindset than they once did. RAZ: And one of those athletes is Pam Reed. EPSTEIN: Who's a legendary ultra marathoner, one of the greatest female ultra endurance athletes of all time. RAZ: And back in 2002, Pam became the first-ever female winner of the Badwater Ultramarathon, which is a 130 mile race in the middle of summer in Death Valley, which is also one of the hottest places on earth. PAM REED: Hi there, this is Pam Reed. You know what? It is 2 o'clock here. I'm in Salt Lake City. RAZ: Pam is 53. REED: I'm going to go for an hour run, and it's about 100 degrees. I'm doing some heat training right now. RAZ: And a few years ago, David tracked Pam down to find out what makes her different. EPSTEIN: Pam has an incessant drive to be active. So this was my favorite interview because the day I interviewed her, she had just finished the national championships and Ironman Triathlon here in New York the day before. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN: A 2. 4 mile swim - 112 mile bike - 26. 2 mile run - discover it in a test of strength, resolve, endurance. REED: I got second. And it was a great race (laughing). RAZ: OK, so the very next day, Pam was flying out of LaGuardia. EPSTEIN: And her flight was delayed, and she gets so uncomfortable sitting still, that she stashed her bags in a corner and was running laps around the parking structure while I was interviewing her. . . RAZ: (Laughing). EPSTEIN: . . . The day after the Ironman Triathlon national championships. REED: You know, it's funny because I've done that in LA, New York, Chicago, Phoenix, Tucson (laughing) - you know - in the parking garages in all those airports. You know, I'll tell my husband, OK, I'll be back in an hour and a half, and I'll just go run around for an hour. I take my radio and - yeah, so it's - because it's so boring, you know, sitting there (laughing). RAZ: Now, scientists have tried for years to figure out how people like Pam do what they do. And as David was researching all of these elite athletes like Pam, he started to notice a pattern in the way they set goals. EPSTEIN: Where it's not like, I'm going to win, you know, the marathon at the Olympics. It's more like, today in my workout from mile three to four, I'm going to push hard - like actionable goals, where you have that Diana Nyad-sized feat off in the distance but are really good at setting these sort of more proximate goals that actually tell you what to do today. RAZ: But there's something else that might set Pam apart. Now, normally your brain is designed to limit what you can do with your body. At a certain point, if you're pushing your body beyond its limits, your brain will just shut your body down to make sure you don't die. EPSTEIN: I mean, like, if you land at altitude, your brain will start holding back some of your physical resources before you've even tried to do anything. RAZ: Wow. EPSTEIN: It will just sense, like, something's different in this atmosphere. I'm not going to let you use all of your resources. And part of pushing yourself farther is convincing your brain that, look, we're not going to die or this is - this is really important. REED: Well, yes, yes, definitely. You have to over - you have to just tell yourself - you feel like death, you do. He's right. You feel like death. And then for some reason, you come back to life. It's really bizarre. That's happened to me so many times. EPSTEIN: There's no question that training is - is the ultimate biological exploration of your mind. . . RAZ: Yeah. EPSTEIN: . . . Beyond what any cutting-edge science can provide you at this point. RAZ: I mean, that's how you convince your brain that you're not going to die, right? EPSTEIN: That's right. That's - look, when you start training - and, you know, exercise physiologists know this - before your muscles get bigger or you're - you know, you produce more red blood cells, you have an integration of your central nervous system that starts making activity smoother. Like, if you've ever started to training for running, you'll notice after a couple weeks, you start to feel smoother while running before you've even gotten in shape because your brain is sort of integrating the movements and adjusting to your new reality. RAZ: So I'm wondering, like, even in these elite athletes - right? - who are wired and built, I guess, differently in so many ways - I mean, even for them, like, how important is winning, is victory? EPSTEIN: It depends. It really depends. I think in many ways, for many athletes, it is. I mean, when I went to, you know, places like rural Kenya to visit the tribe that produces - the Kalenjin - that produces all the great runners - like, they are running to live. Like, that's - you know - if they had an economic renaissance tomorrow, like, their running phenomenon would be done. So they will often drop out of races if they're not going to win because they're doing it purely to make a living. And in other cases, I don't think winning is everything for an athlete, but I think they do have to feel like they're improving. I think a lot of athletes get addicted to improvement, and if they feel like they're stagnating, not sort of beating themselves, then they get pretty disappointed pretty fast. At the same time, I think there's something natural to us about physical competition. And it's such a direct and sort of pure way to measure achievement that's very difficult to come by in other ways in life. And I think that can really motivate people to kind of tweak and tweak and tweak and try to find ways to get just a little bit better.

PURDY: For me, I was up against people who had their legs (laughing). RAZ: Amy was actually used to competing in the Paralympics as a snowboarder. But to be dancing on national television, where her prosthetic legs had nothing to do with the competition, was totally different. PURDY: I had to keep reminding myself as I went on throughout the weeks that this is pretty unbelievable. RAZ: Just a few weeks before she was on the show, Amy won a bronze medal at the Sochi Paralympics. (SOUNDBITE OF SOCHI PARALYMPICS)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER: Amy Purdy has a bronze. She's smiling. She can take it as easy as she likes. . . RAZ: Amy started snowboarding when she 14. But five years later, the sport she'd loved suddenly became very different for her. What do you remember about getting sick? PURDY: I actually remember waking up feeling great that day. I remember the cold tile in my parents' house under my feet but, you know, not thinking anything of it, of course. That's just a memory I had - but getting ready, going to work and I felt exhausted. And I was thinking, maybe I'm coming down with the flu or something. But the next morning, my mom called to check on me and I said gosh, I feel like I'm dying. But I got to say, I'm known for being the dramatic one in the family. I'm - I'd probably - I still say that when I get a flu. I'm like, I'm pretty sure I'm dying. So I said, I feel like I'm dying, and she said, well, you're probably dehydrated. Make sure just to drink water, and I'm sure you'll be fine. And we got off the phone, and I fell into the deepest sleep that I have ever felt. All of a sudden, I open my eyes, and as I was sitting up, I realized that something was really, really wrong. My heart was beating out of my chest. I was nauseous. I was sweating. I had chills. And I scooted to the edge of the bed. And I put my feet on the floor, and I stood up. And I realized that I couldn't feel my feet. And I looked down at the floor, and I saw that my feet were purple. And I saw that my hands were purple, and I saw that my nose, my chin, my cheeks were all purple as well. Right then, my cousin walked in. My mom had called her to come check on me. And she ended up rushing me to the hospital. RAZ: Amy picks up the rest of the story in her TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)PURDY: I was in the hospital on life support with less than a 2 percent chance of living. It wasn't until days later, as I lay in a coma, that the doctors diagnosed me with bacterial meningitis - a vaccine-preventable blood infection. Over the course of two and a half months, I lost my spleen, my kidneys, the hearing in my left ear and both of my legs below the knee. When my parents wheeled me out of the hospital, I felt like I had been pieced back together like a patchwork doll. I was absolutely physically and emotionally broken. But I knew that in order to move forward, I had to let go of the old Amy and learn to embrace the new Amy. And I begin to daydream. I daydreamed like I did as a little girl. And I imagined myself walking gracefully and snowboarding again. And I didn't just see myself carving down a mountain of powder. I could actually feel it. I could feel the wind against my face and the beat of my racing heart as if it were happening in that very moment. And that is when a new chapter in my life began. RAZ: Amy Purdy's story continues in a moment. I'm Guy Raz, and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. RAZ: It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. And today on the show, the making of a champion. And before the break, we were hearing the story of Amy Purdy. She was 19 when she lost both of her legs below the knee. Meningitis nearly killed her. But at the time, Amy was just grateful to be alive. PURDY: Because I knew how bad it was. I knew how close I was to dying. And I also knew that it could have been worse because I almost lost my hands as well. I almost lost my nose. So my nose turned black. My fingers turned black. My feet turned black. So, you know, preparing yourself to lose all these things and then only losing my legs was, for me, a blessing. RAZ: Amy was fitted with a pair of prosthetic legs. They were these bulky blocks of metal with pipes that were bolted together for the ankles. And the feet were made out of yellow rubber. But still. . . PURDY: I loved snowboarding, and it's kind of all I could think about as soon as I started to get kind of healthy enough to, you know, not be in survival mode. I - and this is still in the hospital bed - all I would think about was snowboarding and, OK, how am I going to do this again? I never questioned, am I going to do this again? I just thought, how am I going to do this again? (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)PURDY: Four months later, I was back up on a snowboard, although things didn't go quite as expected. My knees and my ankles wouldn't bend, and at one point, I traumatized all the skiers on the chair lift when. . . (LAUGHTER)PURDY: . . . I fell and my legs, still attached to my snowboard. . . (LAUGHTER)PURDY: . . . Went flying down the mountain. (LAUGHTER)PURDY: And I was on top of the mountain still. I was so shocked. I was just as shocked as everybody else. And I was so discouraged, but I knew that if I could find the right pair of feet, that I would be able to do this again. And this is when I learned that our borders and our obstacles can only do two things. One - stop us in our tracks, or two - force us to get creative. I did a year of research, still couldn't figure out what kind of legs to use, couldn't find any resources that could help me. So I decided to make a pair myself. My leg-maker and I put random parts together, and we made a pair of feet that I could snowboard in - rusted bolts, rubber, wood and neon-pink duct tape. And yes, I can change my toenail polish. It was these legs and the best 21st birthday gift I could ever receive - a new kidney from my dad - that allowed me to follow my dreams again. And just this past February, I won two back-to-back World Cup gold medals. . . (APPLAUSE)PURDY: . . . Which made me the highest-ranked adaptive female snowboarder in the world. Eleven years ago, when I lost my legs, I had no idea what to expect. But if you asked me today if I would ever want to change my situation, I would have to say no because my legs haven't disabled me. If anything, they've enabled me. They forced me to believe in the possibilities. And that's why I believe that our imaginations can be used as tools for breaking through borders because in our minds we can do anything, and we can be anything. It's believing in those dreams and facing our fears head-on that allows us to live our lives beyond our limits. So the thought that I would like to challenge you with today is that maybe instead of looking at our challenges and our limitations as something negative or bad, we can begin to look at them as blessings - magnificent gifts that can be used to ignite our imaginations and help us go further than we ever knew we could go. It's not about breaking down borders. It's about pushing off of them and seeing what amazing places they might bring us. RAZ: I know it's - it might sound like a weird question, but, I mean, you've won all of these medals and you're sort of, like, this elite athlete and - I don't know - in, like, a weird way, do you almost feel like you're a better snowboarder now, like, after everything that happened to you? PURDY: I wouldn't necessarily say that I'm better at snowboarding now. I am. I am. But it's still very challenging for me because my feet don't move the right way. I think I'm better because I work harder at it, and I'm passionate about it. And it becomes a challenge, and I thrive on challenge. The amount of work that I have put into my legs and snowboarding - the amount that have gone into the development of my feet and my legs and the mechanics is crazy amounts of work. And the motivation just comes from - I guess it just comes from wanting to figure it out, like finding a way. And that's kind of how I go into everything. It's like I just don't like to hear that things are impossible. RAZ: When you compete, is a part of it to win, to be victorious? PURDY: Yeah, but, you know, it's interesting because I don't necessarily find myself being really competitive with other people. I'm more very competitive with myself because as of right now, I'm the only international, like, male and female competitive snowboarder with two prosthetic legs. So it's just doing the absolute best that I can because it's fulfilling. It's fulfilling to me to find out what those limitations are or to blow through the limitations that you thought you had. You know, we put so much on ourselves. We put so many limits on ourselves, it's unbelievable. I'm always, like, realizing, wow, so much of what I thought, you know - oh, my legs don't really do that, they don't do this, they don't do that - I ended up doing it and realizing, wow, it was in my head the entire time. RAZ: What is it, like - what's that thing that's inside of you that, like, drives you, that pushes you, that motivates you? I mean, is there something that you have that most of us don't? PURDY: I don't think so. I mean, if somebody would've told me, you know, when I was 18 years old that, OK, this is what your life is going to be like; you're going to have the world at your fingertips and then - bam, you're going to lose your legs, lose your kidneys, lose your spleen, lose the hearing in your left ear, you know, stuck in a wheelchair, you know, I would've said there's absolutely no way that I would be able to handle that - no way. I mean, I actually remember - and this is horrible - but this is just kind of what I think a teenager thinks about. I remember hearing about a kid who had lost his legs when I was in high school and thinking, oh, if I lost my legs, I would get myself in a wheelchair, and I'd wheel myself off a cliff (laughing). Like, that was my thinking as a teenager - that that would be the worst thing in the world that I would have to, you know, take my own life or something. So then to be in this situation and handle it, it makes me feel like anybody would. You know, you don't know how strong you are until you're forced to find it - until you're forced to use it.

They were these bulky blocks of metal with pipes that were bolted together for the ankles. And the feet were made out of yellow rubber. But still. . . PURDY: I loved snowboarding, and it's kind of all I could think about as soon as I started to get kind of healthy enough to, you know, not be in survival mode. I - and this is still in the hospital bed - all I would think about was snowboarding and, OK, how am I going to do this again? I never questioned, am I going to do this again? I just thought, how am I going to do this again? (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) PURDY: Four months later, I was back up on a snowboard, although things didn't go quite as expected. My knees and my ankles wouldn't bend, and at one point, I traumatized all the skiers on the chair lift when. . . (LAUGHTER) PURDY: . . . I fell and my legs, still attached to my snowboard. . . (LAUGHTER) PURDY: . . . Went flying down the mountain. (LAUGHTER) PURDY: And I was on top of the mountain still. I was so shocked. I was just as shocked as everybody else. And I was so discouraged, but I knew that if I could find the right pair of feet, that I would be able to do this again. And this is when I learned that our borders and our obstacles can only do two things. One - stop us in our tracks, or two - force us to get creative. I did a year of research, still couldn't figure out what kind of legs to use, couldn't find any resources that could help me. So I decided to make a pair myself. My leg-maker and I put random parts together, and we made a pair of feet that I could snowboard in - rusted bolts, rubber, wood and neon-pink duct tape. And yes, I can change my toenail polish. It was these legs and the best 21st birthday gift I could ever receive - a new kidney from my dad - that allowed me to follow my dreams again. And just this past February, I won two back-to-back World Cup gold medals. . . (APPLAUSE) PURDY: . . . Which made me the highest-ranked adaptive female snowboarder in the world. Eleven years ago, when I lost my legs, I had no idea what to expect. But if you asked me today if I would ever want to change my situation, I would have to say no because my legs haven't disabled me. If anything, they've enabled me. They forced me to believe in the possibilities. And that's why I believe that our imaginations can be used as tools for breaking through borders because in our minds we can do anything, and we can be anything. It's believing in those dreams and facing our fears head-on that allows us to live our lives beyond our limits. So the thought that I would like to challenge you with today is that maybe instead of looking at our challenges and our limitations as something negative or bad, we can begin to look at them as blessings - magnificent gifts that can be used to ignite our imaginations and help us go further than we ever knew we could go. It's not about breaking down borders. It's about pushing off of them and seeing what amazing places they might bring us. RAZ: I know it's - it might sound like a weird question, but, I mean, you've won all of these medals and you're sort of, like, this elite athlete and - I don't know - in, like, a weird way, do you almost feel like you're a better snowboarder now, like, after everything that happened to you? PURDY: I wouldn't necessarily say that I'm better at snowboarding now. I am. I am. But it's still very challenging for me because my feet don't move the right way. I think I'm better because I work harder at it, and I'm passionate about it. And it becomes a challenge, and I thrive on challenge. The amount of work that I have put into my legs and snowboarding - the amount that have gone into the development of my feet and my legs and the mechanics is crazy amounts of work. And the motivation just comes from - I guess it just comes from wanting to figure it out, like finding a way. And that's kind of how I go into everything. It's like I just don't like to hear that things are impossible. RAZ: When you compete, is a part of it to win, to be victorious? PURDY: Yeah, but, you know, it's interesting because I don't necessarily find myself being really competitive with other people. I'm more very competitive with myself because as of right now, I'm the only international, like, male and female competitive snowboarder with two prosthetic legs. So it's just doing the absolute best that I can because it's fulfilling. It's fulfilling to me to find out what those limitations are or to blow through the limitations that you thought you had. You know, we put so much on ourselves. We put so many limits on ourselves, it's unbelievable. I'm always, like, realizing, wow, so much of what I thought, you know - oh, my legs don't really do that, they don't do this, they don't do that - I ended up doing it and realizing, wow, it was in my head the entire time. RAZ: What is it, like - what's that thing that's inside of you that, like, drives you, that pushes you, that motivates you? I mean, is there something that you have that most of us don't? PURDY: I don't think so. I mean, if somebody would've told me, you know, when I was 18 years old that, OK, this is what your life is going to be like; you're going to have the world at your fingertips and then - bam, you're going to lose your legs, lose your kidneys, lose your spleen, lose the hearing in your left ear, you know, stuck in a wheelchair, you know, I would've said there's absolutely no way that I would be able to handle that - no way. I mean, I actually remember - and this is horrible - but this is just kind of what I think a teenager thinks about. I remember hearing about a kid who had lost his legs when I was in high school and thinking, oh, if I lost my legs, I would get myself in a wheelchair, and I'd wheel myself off a cliff (laughing). Like, that was my thinking as a teenager - that that would be the worst thing in the world that I would have to, you know, take my own life or something. So then to be in this situation and handle it, it makes me feel like anybody would. You know, you don't know how strong you are until you're forced to find it - until you're forced to use it.

I'm Michel Martin. If you've been following the program, then you know we have a very deep interest in technology - how it's created, how it's used and how it affects the country. We've been particularly interested in groups that haven't had as much access to this vital area. In our \"Women in Tech\" and \"Blacks in Tech\" series on Twitter and on the radio, we've been able to experience in real-time the impact of so called minorities and women are making on this country's science and technology engine. And I think it is fair to say the engagement we generated close to 200 million impressions on Twitter demonstrates incredible appetite for knowledge about the contributions of these thought-leaders, entrepreneurs and scientists. And as our program winds down, you know our last program is August first, we wanted to touch base on some of these important issues a least one more time. So we've called upon Ben Jealous. He is the former president and CEO of the NAACP. He recently joined Kaper Capital. It is a Bay Area group that invests in social-impact tech startups. He's with us now in our Washington D. C. studios. Once again, welcome back. BEN JEALOUS: Thank you, it's good to be back. MARTIN: And your new incarnation. James Oliver, Jr. is the founder of  WeMontage and was part of our \"Blacks in Tech\" series. He joins us from WHID which is in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Welcome back to you Mr. Oliver. JAMES OLIVER JR: Thank you, it's good to be here. MARTIN: And also joining us, entrepreneur Francesca Escoto of Latina Startup Tour. She joins from WUSF which is in Tampa, Florida. Francesca Escoto, welcome to you as well. Thank you for joining us. FRANCESCA ESCOTO: Thank you for having me. It's great to be here. MARTIN: So Ben Jealous, let me start with you. When you left the NAACP to join Kaper Capital - does this tie into your civil rights background in some way or is this just a fresh start for you? JEALOUS: You know - look - I think it's both. I think it's both and I think like most people, the first 10 years of my professional life I excelled because I was willing to do things that were new every day if possible. And in the second decade I excelled because I found a few things I was better at than most and was willing to them over and over. So this is exciting to me personally because - it's - it's an opportunity to - to do something in a new way, but it's something I've been doing for a long time, which is trying to figure out fairly simple ways to solve big social problems for hundreds of thousands or millions of people. And some of the issues that we're dealing with at K-Cap are precisely the same I dealt with at the NAACP. But we're finding more effective ways to actually move the ball forward. I'll give, you know. . . MARTIN: Just give me one example. JEALOUS: Sure. The cost of inmates calling home is something I was dealing with the FCC with on for years and we just never seemed to get very far because there's a whole lot of profit in it. It can cost up to $3 per minute. MARTIN: Per minute? JEALOUS: . . . Per minute to call home, depending on where you are. So at K-Cap we've supported a guy named Frederick and Frederick has a company called Pigeonly. And Pigeonly has disrupted the market for inmates calling home from - from first federal prisons and now state prisons dramatically - dropping the cost by about 90%. MARTIN: So you don't have to go through the whole regulatory hoops - the flight hoops. JEALOUS: That's exactly right. MARTIN: You just find a technological solution to the problem. JEALOUS: He just took - he just took Google Voice-type technology and used it to help folks who are imprisoned get a phone number that is local to the prison but connected to their home thousands of miles away, and cut the calling home by about 90 percent in the process. You know, similarly we have a company up in Washington Heights called Regalii. They've cut the cost of people sending money home to a foreign country also by about 90 percent versus Western Union -and made it safer. You know, in the past, look - and - and even for many people right now - when they want to send money home, say to the Dominican Republic, it cost them about 30 percent. But also, you know, their grandmother who is waiting, is waiting at a storefront window where people have her marked the moment she walks out and they know she is cash in her pocket. What Regalii have done is cut that cost, but also made it possible to transfer the funds on the cell phone. MARTIN: OK, I think we - I think we get it. One of the other efforts that the Kapor Center is supporting is an effort to take tech tools directly to Latino communities around the country. Francesca Escoto is part of that. So, Francesca, why don't you tell us about the Latina Startup Tour. ESCOTO: Absolutely, yeah. First of all, thank you to Kapor for what they are doing. They are very intentional about identifying talent in communities of color and supporting it through both development training but also financially. What the Latina Startup Tour aims to do - we're reaching 800 women in eight cities in 2014, and the goal is to bring the training to them. We deal with both a gap in technology access but also language access, and so there's a lot of lingo that is built up and whether you call them accelerators, incubators, whatever - throughout Silicon Valley. Well, that doesn't reach our communities and it doesn't reach them in a language or at an academic level that they can fully grasp and so we are taking that on the road and we're making sure that we bring that to Latinas. We are the fastest-growing entrepreneur segment in the U. S. We are starting businesses at a faster pace than any other group and what we're trying to do is bring awareness to these Latina mothers, in many cases, and recent immigrants that - you know, you make a dress, you're seamstress. You make 50 dresses, you're really good seamstress, you make 100 dresses, you're into garment manufacturing. You make. . . MARTIN: So what's the plan here? Is the plan to allow - to - to - to give people opportunities to understand how technologies can improve their existing businesses? Is it to try to encourage people to encourage their children to pursue STEM careers? What's the - what's the goal of this immediate project here? ESCOTO: The goal here is to help Latinas see themselves, not only as users, but also creators of technology. And to see their businesses as opportunities to embrace technology and to become partakers of the tech startup economy. MARTIN: OK. James Oliver, Jr. , you were part of our \"Blacks in Tech\" series back December of 2013 and I do want to hear about your company and what you're doing but I'm also - I'm really interested in this whole question of what - the whole question of diversity in the tech field. What would make - what makes a difference in getting more people of different backgrounds into this field? So briefly, I understand that WeMontage - am I - am I pronouncing it properly? OLIVER JR: Yeah,  you are. MARTIN: And you - it - it makes - tell me what you do. You can create, what? Big wall display art with  family photos, right? OLIVER JR: Kind of, yeah. So it's the only website on the Internet that I know of, that will let you take your pictures and turn them into large custom photo collages on removable wallpaper. MARTIN: And -and that's particularly helpful, say if you have family members who are in assisted living or nursing homes or something like that. OLIVER JR: Oh, yeah. MARTIN: So it's to jog their memories. it's also of a size where it's easy to see. OLIVER JR: Yeah college dorm kids - dorm students as well, exactly. Just - you know, really any place you want to display photos or you can't put nails in the wall, like people in military housing, when they move out they have to pay fees - move-out fees for putting holes in the wall - but anybody who's a picture enthusiast, it's an affordable alternative to things like popular canvas wraps, as well as picture frames, which are incredibly expensive for custom framing. MARTIN: What - what gave you the idea for this? I'm just wondering - forgive me - I don't mean to be crude about it, but do you think your background had something to do - your own identity had something to do with what gave you the idea? OLIVER JR: Oh, my God, no. It was actually my wife was watching an interior design show on television and they were in the basement covering the wall with these big black-and-white collages and for me, that was really a moment of inspiration. And I say inspiration - I mean that in like the spiritual sense. It was like a huge ah-ha moment for me. But in terms of why thought I could do that - my background is not tech-oriented. I'm the guy that wants to start up a tech company but doesn't know how to write a lot of code but I would attribute that to my mom who taught me ever since I was a kid, that I could do whatever I put my mind to and then - I went to Morehouse College and graduated a million years ago, I'm not going to say when, but, you know, going to Morehouse - they instill in you a certain confidence and I think, you know, a combination of my mom and - is - something really stubborn about me because I'm a Taurus and just I believe I can, you know, persist and these things done. MARTIN: But - Ben, I was going to go back to this whole question of the diversity in the field and why do you think this - why does it matter? JEALOUS: Well, you know, it gets actually to what you were just talking about, which is that it's not so much about identity as it is about your lived life - what you experience. People solve the problems that they see. When you talk about somebody who starts a new - a new  business it's because they're trying to scratch their own itch. And so, if you're in San Francisco there is not just one startup, there are probably 10 startups for every problem that a rich person has. If you go across the bridge to Oakland where - where we have our offices there's a whole bunch of problems waiting to be solved and there's not even one startup to solve them. What you see with a Pigeonly, with a - a Regalii, even with a WeMontage is - is  somebody's seeing something that most of the folks who are of the class, if you will, starting startups these days don't see. And for us. . . MARTIN: So they wouldn't necessarily think about what it's like to have to pay a fee to take something off the walls, so it would not necessarily occur to them that this is a problem. JEALOUS: Yes, exactly. MARTIN: They wouldn't necessarily understand. JEALOUS: Because when you're packing up in Pac Heights, you don't - you don't pay a fee to take something off the walls, right? But. . . MARTIN: Good. JEALOUS: . . . The key point here is that there's profit in that. Because most people are like the people in Oakland if you will. . . ESCOTO: I got. . . JEALOUS: You know, and not like the people in Pac Heights and increasingly throughout San Francisco. MARTIN: Francesca, you wanted to say something? ESCOTO: Well, yeah. I'm like bursting here. That's exactly it. What happens is we, are solving problems, we're just not calling it technology. And so we are marginalized to some extent, either by ourselves or society - there's a lot of factors that go into that - but we are solving problems, we're are not calling it what it is, so we're not participating in all the full extent of this economy. So what we're doing - and I think that it's the same thing that the other gentlemen are talking about - what we're doing is - OK, you don't know how to code, guess what? It's OK, because you could still solve this problem. There are people who can code. What you need to bring to the table is the idea. You need to bring the problem and we'll help you get the tools and the resources to solve the problem. MARTIN: James, what about you? And I'm also particularly interested in whether you feel as a - as an African-American entrepreneur that there - are other obstacles for you that don't exist for others like you? I mean, for example is it a question of whether you put your own picture on your website? OLIVER JR: That's a great question. Just circling back to what she said, I think she's right and fortunately for me, I was really fortunate enough to get into a tech accelerator in Wisconsin called Generator. And you know, they were very helpful in helping me bring the idea to the market with access to resources, credibility etc. - and raising capital. But yeah, I mean, there're a couple things I think about that I don't think the average entrepreneur thinks about. Like for example, like you said on our website are twins who, you know - have African-American twins who are just beautiful - they're 18 months - well, I think they're beautiful, and that's the feature image on the website. And just, you know - I wonder sometimes if, you know, that could that be hurting my business. You know, I don't know, but I'm not changing it because I love my kids. MARTIN: I hear you. They are gorgeous. OLIVER JR: Thank you. MARTIN: Let me give a final thought to Ben Jealous here. Could you tell us - I promised I would ask you about the Impact Generation, what does that mean? JEALOUS: We have a rising generation in this country that is totally wired - that knows that they can make a huge profit, but that that also wants to make the world better at the same time. And you know, I have faith that that generation will ultimately get, sort of capitalism in our country back to what it was supposed to be a long time ago when it was about people in villages making the most of their possibilities. Back then if you will, who you were - your reputation had something to do with whether or not you were successful. Today, you actually have to be very intentional if you want to bring, sort of who you are, and what you're about, and how you make money, into one place. MARTIN: Alright, well let's hear more about this in the future - we hope we'll be talking more about this in the future. I'm speaking with Ben Jealous of the Kapor Center for social impact and Kapor Capital - former president and CEO of the NAACP. James Oliver Jr. , is the founder of the WeMontage. Francesca Escoto of Latina Startup Tour. They were all here with us today. Thank you all for joining us today. JEALOUS: Thank you. ESCOTO: Thank you. OLIVER JR: Thanks. MARTIN: And the social media note - you can follow our conversations on Twitter and Facebook @NPRMICHEL. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  This is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. I'm Michel Martin.

JEALOUS: You know, and not like the people in Pac Heights and increasingly throughout San Francisco. MARTIN: Francesca, you wanted to say something? ESCOTO: Well, yeah. I'm like bursting here. That's exactly it. What happens is we, are solving problems, we're just not calling it technology. And so we are marginalized to some extent, either by ourselves or society - there's a lot of factors that go into that - but we are solving problems, we're are not calling it what it is, so we're not participating in all the full extent of this economy. So what we're doing - and I think that it's the same thing that the other gentlemen are talking about - what we're doing is - OK, you don't know how to code, guess what? It's OK, because you could still solve this problem. There are people who can code. What you need to bring to the table is the idea. You need to bring the problem and we'll help you get the tools and the resources to solve the problem. MARTIN: James, what about you? And I'm also particularly interested in whether you feel as a - as an African-American entrepreneur that there - are other obstacles for you that don't exist for others like you? I mean, for example is it a question of whether you put your own picture on your website? OLIVER JR: That's a great question. Just circling back to what she said, I think she's right and fortunately for me, I was really fortunate enough to get into a tech accelerator in Wisconsin called Generator. And you know, they were very helpful in helping me bring the idea to the market with access to resources, credibility etc. - and raising capital. But yeah, I mean, there're a couple things I think about that I don't think the average entrepreneur thinks about. Like for example, like you said on our website are twins who, you know - have African-American twins who are just beautiful - they're 18 months - well, I think they're beautiful, and that's the feature image on the website. And just, you know - I wonder sometimes if, you know, that could that be hurting my business. You know, I don't know, but I'm not changing it because I love my kids. MARTIN: I hear you. They are gorgeous. OLIVER JR: Thank you. MARTIN: Let me give a final thought to Ben Jealous here. Could you tell us - I promised I would ask you about the Impact Generation, what does that mean? JEALOUS: We have a rising generation in this country that is totally wired - that knows that they can make a huge profit, but that that also wants to make the world better at the same time. And you know, I have faith that that generation will ultimately get, sort of capitalism in our country back to what it was supposed to be a long time ago when it was about people in villages making the most of their possibilities. Back then if you will, who you were - your reputation had something to do with whether or not you were successful. Today, you actually have to be very intentional if you want to bring, sort of who you are, and what you're about, and how you make money, into one place. MARTIN: Alright, well let's hear more about this in the future - we hope we'll be talking more about this in the future. I'm speaking with Ben Jealous of the Kapor Center for social impact and Kapor Capital - former president and CEO of the NAACP. James Oliver Jr. , is the founder of the WeMontage. Francesca Escoto of Latina Startup Tour. They were all here with us today. Thank you all for joining us today. JEALOUS: Thank you. ESCOTO: Thank you. OLIVER JR: Thanks.

ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: That's right. It is time to talk about cats. Millions and millions of cat photos have been uploaded to the Internet. CORNISH: Little cats. (CAT MEOWING)SIEGEL: Big cats. (CAT MEOWING)CORNISH: Grumpy cat. (CAT HISSING)SIEGEL: And those cat photos can reveal more than just how cute your cat is or how much time you have on your hands. OWEN MUNDY: I was using Instagram like everybody and photographing, you know, my life. SIEGEL: That's Owen Mundy, an associate professor from Florida State University. MUNDY: And it never occurred to me that my phone was geotagging all the photographs with the location and including that information and uploading that. CORNISH: The surprise drove Mundy to create the website, I Know Where Your Cat Lives. He took pictures publicly shared on photo sites like Instagram and Flickr - photos tagged with the word cat. SIEGEL: He then used the location data embedded in those pictures to place them on a Google map. And we should say he gathered a million of these cat photos. Well, every so often it's someone dressed in a catsuit. CORNISH: So when you go to iknowwhereyourcatlives. com, you never know what you're going to see. A different photo pops up every time you visit the site. MUNDY: You get to see inside of other people's houses. You get to see their cats. And you get to see sometimes them holding their cats. CORNISH: Mundy says he wants to raise awareness about online privacy and how much information we give out. SIEGEL: If your cat pic appears on the site, you can remove it by changing the privacy settings on the original photo. Oddly, for a person who created a cat website, he is not a cat person. But he's coming around. MUNDY: It wasn't when I started. I'm about 50 percent of the way there now, actually. That's an outcome I didn't expect. SIEGEL: And one other surprise. . . CORNISH: People have e-mailed him Mundy not to get their cats taken off the map but put on it. SIEGEL: Which goes to show you can't herd cats, but you can't herd cat owners either.

But how does a viewer know if they're real? This month, Amnesty International launched the Citizen Evidence Lab, a site to help users try to determine the veracity of those images. We're joined at our studios by the lab's founder, Christoph Koettl. Mr. Koettl, thanks so much for being with us. CHRISTOPH KOETTL: Thanks for having me. SIMON: How does this work? Someone see a video, and what do they do? KOETTL: The website provides you very, very clear guidelines how to assess the video. There are a few very simple steps that everyone of us can do in a few minutes to check, is this new footage? Is this old footage? Has this footage been used before? Does it come, maybe, from a potentially completely different conflict at all. SIMON: Yeah. So even if the image is real, it could be something that happened five years ago or in a country 2000 miles away. KOETTL: Exactly. And what you just described is really the core problem. We don't see a lot of technically manipulated footage. But what we see a lot is that footage is shared from a different conflict or it has been used, already, a year before. So it's something that happened already, a long time before. SIMON: What are some of the telltale signs people should look for? Or some of the first questions they should ask might be a better way to put it. KOETTL: So I think the first question people should ask - is this actually new footage? And there's some really easy steps that you can take to do that sort of work. So you can do what we call a reverse image search. So you see has this image already been used before? Has this video already been used before somewhere on the Internet? So that's one of the first things you do. But then it really comes down to three specific things. What is the source? Can you confirm the date? Can you confirm the location? And there are a lot of red flags that we look for. So for example, somebody uploads a new YouTube video on a completely new YouTube account that was created the day before. That might be a red flag that this account was just created to promote the specific video, which might be misinformation. SIMON: There's a famous picture of white phosphorus coming down in Gaza. KOETTL: Yes. It's a really, really dramatic picture. That is a picture from January, 2009. And somebody posted it in the context of the current conflict and claimed that this is what happened today. And in a very tense situation, as we see between Hamas and Israel, posting this sort of material really can lead to a further escalation. So that's why it's really important be able to very fast say, like, this is old footage. That doesn't, of course, diminish the actual human rights violation, but it's important to say right away, this is not what happened today. SIMON: What if somebody knows which one of your algorithms they have to meet and decides to concoct something theatrically but makes certain it has the right timestamp? KOETTL: Yes. So that's a great question, I think. So that's why I also wanted to build a resource that is online, so we can adapt it because if you look at the other side, people adapt their tactics as well. I can give a very concrete example. Somebody posted a picture of the conflict in Ukraine. It was of a picture of a destroyed tank. But actually, it was a picture of a destroyed tank from the Georgia-Russia conflict in 2008. And they flipped the picture, so it was much more difficult to detect it. So that's something we have to integrate into our work. That's why it's important to have an online website where you can, like, expose these sort of tactics. SIMON: What do you hope the Citizens Evidence Lab can accomplish, ultimately? KOETTL: I think that's really the most important question that we have to discuss here. We want to document human rights violations. And we have to have credible evidence. And the ultimate goal is to bring perpetrators to justice. So this sort of video footage and pictures give us a completely new level of detail. So you see specific military units. You see specific, individual perpetrators. That will be crucial to ensure individual criminal justice, and that's the ultimate goal of our work. SIMON: Christoph Koettl is founder and editor of Amnesty International Citizens Evidence Lab.

If a civilian flying a Hairier sounds ridiculous, well, there's already a guy doing it. ART NALLS: Hi, my name is Art Nalls and I'm a retired Marine Corps pilot. WESTERVELT: Nalls says he's the only civilian in the world to privately own and fly a Harrier. He's got a history with these planes. The first time he sat in the cockpit of one was 35 years ago.

WESTERVELT: That's why Nalls bought one. Back in 2006 a Sea Harrier went up for sale in the UK. Like the Harrier from this weekend's auction it had no weapon systems and it was no longer equipped to fly. But Nalls was determined to get it back in the air.

NALLS: We started following the instructions step by step by step by step. WESTERVELT: Finally his plane was restored and airborne. NALLS: It can come to a complete stop in the air. It can back up, it can turn sideways. WESTERVELT: Those big Rolls-Royce engines roar. It takes a lot of thrust to keep these planes hovering. NALLS: Well, it burns a little bit of gas. And when we're in a hover, we're burning a gallon of fuel - jet fuel, every two seconds. One thousand one, one thousand two, that was a gallon of jet fuel right there.

You go to the site, answer a bunch of personal questions, and you're matched up with people based on your answers. Here's how OkCupid describes their system. It's extremely accurate as long as, A - you are honest, and B - you know what you want. Well, you may know what you want, but what users probably didn't know until yesterday is that the company sometimes manipulates dating profiles. OkCupid's president, Christian Rudder, disclosed this in a company blog post. He says the company has been running experiments with the data in the profiles. Christian Rudder joins me now from our New York bureau to talk more about this. Christian, welcome to the program. CHRISTIAN RUDDER: Hi, I'm glad to be here. CORNISH: So your blog post reveals the results of several OkCupid experiments. One, you strip the photos from people's profiles - right? - so that they had to decide. . . RUDDER: That's right. CORNISH: . . . whether to pursue someone without the benefit of knowing what they look like - kind of  virtual blind date. But in another instance, you tried to test the power of suggestion. How did you do it? RUDDER: Well, we did in two ways. We took people who we thought weren't compatible, and we told them that they were. And then we did kind of the opposite where we took people who we thought were compatible and told them that we weren't. And then we basically monitored the conversations that these people had under these auspices. CORNISH: How did they act? RUDDER: The power of suggestion was powerful. It turns out that our own internal prediction, our match percentage which is our guess at your compatibility, was kind of half the story and then just the mere label was the other half. CORNISH: So the mere suggestion that you're compatible is actually as good as really being compatible? RUDDER: It seems like it, at least, you know, from our experiment. Of course the best thing - that it's doubly powerful to both be a good match and be told that you're a good match, which of course is what we do almost all the time. CORNISH: Now, you've essentially sent people on bad dates in the name of science. What's been the response to you revealing this? RUDDER: Well, my last interview - this British dude called me a sociopath, so there's that. CORNISH: What? (LAUGHTER)RUDDER: But, I mean, just to clarify, we did tell people after the fact - after we had collected the messaging data that they had been in an experiment and we gave them the correct match percentage. CORNISH: You know, we asked some of our listeners to weigh in on twitter and several noted that in academia. . . RUDDER: (Laughing) A fair and balanced medium if there ever was one. CORNISH: Yes, a fair and balanced medium. Research involving human subjects is limited. It's monitored. It's run by an institutional review board. How is what you're doing - what other companies are doing ethical? RUDDER: I'll just sidestep the fact that you at least have the charade of consent with these terms and conditions. CORNISH: You call it a charade of consent. That's not a good sign. RUDDER: Yeah, I mean - yeah, sure. But at the same time, look, when I was in college, you get 20 bucks to go sit down in the - you know I went to Harvard, and William James Hall is where they do all these psychology experiments. You need 20 bucks, you're like sure, I'll go sign up for something, and you sign a form. You have no idea what the experiment is. And so you - 'cause if there is information, it ruins the experiment. So this kind of good old days of past research standards - I don't even think - it doesn't pertain even there, you know? I think, also, experiment is such a loaded word. You know, I mean we test things all the time. I honestly cannot remember the last time we launched a significant feature on OkCupid that we didn't at least roll out to ten percent of the user base beforehand just to make sure that it behaved equivalently with the kind of status quo. CORNISH: You know, another question that people asked us to ask you was did you give any consideration to the people who are genuinely looking for a relationship and feel betrayed? RUDDER: Yes. We have a tremendous amount of empathy for our users. People are at that office because they like what we do. We create love in the world. We create sex - whatever people want, you know? Yeah, we do take that very seriously. Now, the betrayed part - I feel like that is the misunderstanding part that I'm kind of here to address or that I kind of poked in the eye in the blog post is that it's not betrayal. It's part of how we got to serving that first goal. Just consider the alternative for running the experiment that we ran. What if our algorithm had been garbage, you know? Then, if we hadn't run this kind of experiment and all these other kinds of experiments to test it, then instead of running garbage at a thousand users or whatever it was in this experiment, we're throwing garbage at four million people instead. And we don't - you've got to ask the question in order make sure you're doing a good job. CORNISH: Christian Rudder, he's president of OkCupid and author of the forthcoming book \"Dataclysm. \" Thanks so much for speaking with us. RUDDER: It was my pleasure, Audie. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  The online dating website OkCupid claims it uses, quote, \"math,\" to get you dates. You go to the site, answer a bunch of personal questions, and you're matched up with people based on your answers. Here's how OkCupid describes their system. It's extremely accurate as long as, A - you are honest, and B - you know what you want. Well, you may know what you want, but what users probably didn't know until yesterday is that the company sometimes manipulates dating profiles. OkCupid's president, Christian Rudder, disclosed this in a company blog post. He says the company has been running experiments with the data in the profiles. Christian Rudder joins me now from our New York bureau to talk more about this. Christian, welcome to the program. CHRISTIAN RUDDER: Hi, I'm glad to be here. CORNISH: So your blog post reveals the results of several OkCupid experiments. One, you strip the photos from people's profiles - right? - so that they had to decide. . . RUDDER: That's right. CORNISH: . . . whether to pursue someone without the benefit of knowing what they look like - kind of  virtual blind date. But in another instance, you tried to test the power of suggestion. How did you do it? RUDDER: Well, we did in two ways. We took people who we thought weren't compatible, and we told them that they were. And then we did kind of the opposite where we took people who we thought were compatible and told them that we weren't. And then we basically monitored the conversations that these people had under these auspices. CORNISH: How did they act? RUDDER: The power of suggestion was powerful. It turns out that our own internal prediction, our match percentage which is our guess at your compatibility, was kind of half the story and then just the mere label was the other half. CORNISH: So the mere suggestion that you're compatible is actually as good as really being compatible? RUDDER: It seems like it, at least, you know, from our experiment. Of course the best thing - that it's doubly powerful to both be a good match and be told that you're a good match, which of course is what we do almost all the time. CORNISH: Now, you've essentially sent people on bad dates in the name of science. What's been the response to you revealing this? RUDDER: Well, my last interview - this British dude called me a sociopath, so there's that. CORNISH: What? (LAUGHTER) RUDDER: But, I mean, just to clarify, we did tell people after the fact - after we had collected the messaging data that they had been in an experiment and we gave them the correct match percentage. CORNISH: You know, we asked some of our listeners to weigh in on twitter and several noted that in academia. . . RUDDER: (Laughing) A fair and balanced medium if there ever was one. CORNISH: Yes, a fair and balanced medium. Research involving human subjects is limited. It's monitored. It's run by an institutional review board. How is what you're doing - what other companies are doing ethical? RUDDER: I'll just sidestep the fact that you at least have the charade of consent with these terms and conditions. CORNISH: You call it a charade of consent. That's not a good sign. RUDDER: Yeah, I mean - yeah, sure. But at the same time, look, when I was in college, you get 20 bucks to go sit down in the - you know I went to Harvard, and William James Hall is where they do all these psychology experiments. You need 20 bucks, you're like sure, I'll go sign up for something, and you sign a form. You have no idea what the experiment is. And so you - 'cause if there is information, it ruins the experiment. So this kind of good old days of past research standards - I don't even think - it doesn't pertain even there, you know? I think, also, experiment is such a loaded word. You know, I mean we test things all the time. I honestly cannot remember the last time we launched a significant feature on OkCupid that we didn't at least roll out to ten percent of the user base beforehand just to make sure that it behaved equivalently with the kind of status quo. CORNISH: You know, another question that people asked us to ask you was did you give any consideration to the people who are genuinely looking for a relationship and feel betrayed? RUDDER: Yes. We have a tremendous amount of empathy for our users. People are at that office because they like what we do. We create love in the world. We create sex - whatever people want, you know? Yeah, we do take that very seriously. Now, the betrayed part - I feel like that is the misunderstanding part that I'm kind of here to address or that I kind of poked in the eye in the blog post is that it's not betrayal.

KANTROWITZ: And even to friends who are working on startups - I always ask them, hey, what's your marketing strategy? And they're like, we don't have one. It's sort of cool in Silicon Valley and in the tech world to think that your product will soar if you don't market it, but in reality, it's just not the case. NANCY KOEHN: The testosterone of Silicon Valley is not primarily a hormone of empathy and outreach. CORNISH: That's Nancy Koehn of Harvard Business School. She's says, too often, the male-dominated tech industry assumes the consumer will follow its lead. KOEHN: A lot of the inventors and the technology experts in these creative firms presume that what they've invented is something that the consumer couldn't even have dreamed of and that they know best about that. CORNISH: But knowing best doesn't always translate to selling best. As it turns out, some of the most popular products aren't the best. They rose to the top because of marketing.

You will never, ever do another press conference. Man, if I was you, I wouldn't even press my shirt. CORNISH: That ad, says Alex Kantrowitz, shows the power of celebrity endorsement in marketing. KANTROWITZ: Beats - even though their headphones aren't as good as the other competitors', they actually ended up making a big cut into the market and beating out a lot of products that were probably better. CORNISH: And sometimes, marking makes the difference between one technology becoming dominant, while others dwindle or die. Nancy Koehn takes us back more than a century with the triumph of the internal combustion engine. KOEHN: And really that means the triumph of the Model T car over electric cars, steam powered cars and even some other technologies. CORNISH: Those other technologies were popular. KOEHN: And then, in 1908, Henry Ford comes out with the Model T, you know, with no options and no choice and yet, brilliantly marketed in terms of its pricing - Ford wanted to create a mass-market so every American family could have a car - brilliantly marketed in terms of Henry Ford as literally this entrepreneuring American who became one of the most famous people the early 20th century. And so a lot of the reason that Americans bought Model Ts was Henry Ford told them to, and they found him very appealing. And he kept lowering the price. So he and his insight about the consumer created the American car market based on a technology that, at the beginning of the game, at the beginning of the story in 1908, should not necessarily have triumphed.

It's some hackers stealing data - credit card numbers, income tax records. This week, it was news of Russian hackers making off with a billion passwords. Steve Henn from our Planet Money team reports on how this crime spree is making some in Silicon Valley rethink their big data obsession. STEVE HENN, BYLINE: If you want to know how valuable your data has become, think of it this way - it's bigger than Bitcoin, accepted in places where your dollars aren't welcome. And look at what your data buys. Gmail, alone, is amazing and free. Facebook, Twitter, Google - all free. YouTube, including videos of ranchers serenading cattle with trombones - you can't buy any of these services with real money. CHRIS SOGHOIAN: It's actually pretty tough to write a check to Google or Facebook or Twitter. What they want is your data. HENN: That's Chris Soghoian. He studies data security and privacy, and he now works for the ACLU. These companies, he says, collect your data, combine it, manipulated it, use it to target ads and make predictions about your behavior. SOGHOIAN: When a company's profit depends upon the amount of data that it collects, all of the incentives are aligned for it to collect as much data as possible. HENN: Today Google and Facebook combined are worth more than half a trillion dollars. And the giant piles of data about us that they've collected - they're a honeypot. That data attracts hackers, identity thieves, cops, courts, stalkers, Chinese military hacking collectives, Russian mobsters and intelligence analysts from the NSA. Stores like Target and Neiman Marcus can't keep this stuff safe. Even the NSA - the NSA - couldn't stop Edward Snowden from walking out the door with big, huge piles of its most sensitive secrets. MOXIE MARLINSPIKE: The one thing that we've learned in the security industry, at least over the past 15 years, is that the attackers always win. HENN: That's a hacker and computer encryption expert. He goes by the name Moxie Marlinspike. MARLINSPIKE: If what you do is have a lot of really valuable information in one place and you try to secure that, you're going to lose. You know, like, you lose every time. If you have the data, someone's going to get it. HENN: Now, if you had a bank and guys in ski masks kept coming in and stealing your cash, there are a couple of things you could do, right? You might hire more big, burly security guards or you might decide to keep less cash lying around. And today in Silicon Valley there is a dawning awareness that perhaps big vaults filled with sensitive data are not the best way to go. There is a small movement of developers and entrepreneurs who are trying to change the way the Internet works. They're trying to build systems that collect as little data about you as possible. NICO SELL: I look at the companies that are making money off of personally identifiable information. They need to find another way to make money because that's nuclear waste. HENN: So Nico Sell has cofounded a social network that allows people to connect without collecting tons of personal information. Her company, Wickr, doesn't even know your password. This might sound fringy, but Wickr just landed a $30 million investment from one of the first people to back Facebook. SELL: Will I kill those business models - the business models of making money off tons of little pieces of personal information? I hope so. HENN: In most cases, folks will use Wickr for free. But Sell believes in certain circumstances privacy and security are so important that people and companies would be willing to pay for it the old-fashioned way - with real money. And she's not the only one searching for ways to limit the use of data as a digital currency. Moxy Marlinspike has launched a series of free open-source apps that use end-to-end encryption to keep the content of messages or phone calls secret. MARLINSPIKE: The point of cryptography is to trust algorithms and not people. You know, we shouldn't have to trust an individual or an organization to keep us safe or to behave appropriately. You know, we should be able to put our trust into math itself. I don't think we can expect, you know, an individual or an organization to go to jail for us. But, you know, math doesn't have that problem. HENN: You can't put math in jail. MARLINSPIKE: No, you can't. HENN: He says if the government served him with a subpoena or a hacker held a gun to his head and demanded the contents of your calls, he couldn't help them out. There would be nothing he could do. And he's saying to companies everywhere, go ahead, use my technology. I'm not even going to charge you for it. And maybe you'll be better off if you have less data lying around.

I'm Lourdes Garcia-Navarro. It seems like not a week goes by that we don't hear about a major crime on the Internet - credit card data stolen, our home computers infected with bad software that we never downloaded. The problems of cyber security seem big but also really abstract. All this week, NPR's Aarti Shahani has been in Las Vegas with thousands of experts for whom these problems are very real. Hi, Aarti. AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: Hi. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So we heard this week about the supposed theft of 1. 2 billion usernames and passwords. That's billion with a B. That sounds like a big problem to me. Do the experts there think so? SHAHANI: Yes and no. It's important to keep in mind about the Russian hack that it was not independently verified. And so we don't actually know what the company has in its databases, who exactly was hacked, whether the passwords and usernames are old - from five years ago - or recent. So we have to put that in perspective. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Yeah, it seems like we're hearing about these security threats all the time. I mean, they're in the news everyday. How real are they or do they just get a lot of attention? SHAHANI: They definitely are real. And part of what's happening here this week in Vegas is some of the best minds in the industry are trying to come up with solutions. And, you know, some of the solutions that I've actually seen this year that I found interesting - and the variety that I've seen here is - for example, this company Tanium is working on real-time detection - meaning that, you know, it's not good enough to find out you've been breached 5 weeks or even 5 days later. To know when it's happening will actually help you to respond. So they're trying to work on systems that help corporations to do that. And apparently it's a very hard problem - to even know that you've been breached. Another company that I ran into called Pindrop - which maybe I'm interested in because I'm a broadcaster. They focus on phone fraud. So apparently, when you're getting a call - let's say you're working at a bank or something. And you get a call from someone who says that they're the account holder. Through an analysis of the quality of their phone call, you can tell if they're on a Skype line or a regular line and, you know, are they calling from Nigeria or Minnesota. GARCIA-NAVARRO: There's two conferences. There's the Black Hat one that we've just been talking about. But there's also DefCon, the original conference for underground hackers. What was that scene like? SHAHANI: Oh, I really like the scene at DefCon. I don't think there's a single corner of the U. S. or, you know, maybe even the world, where people take their privacy more seriously. GARCIA-NAVARRO: People pay their own way, right? Why do they go? SHAHANI: Well, people come here for a mix of reasons, OK? Some people are coming here for skills building. There are little villages in DefCon - as they're called. So one village, for example, teaches you how to break locks. Another village is focused on social engineering. And that's when you can learn to how to use the deep web - the parts of the web that are not on Google - to fish for information, which is a great tool for a journalist to have. Other people come here for recruitment. While this is a very countercultural space and you have, you know, mohawks and tattoos - even face tattoos - you know, this is also a place where the establishment comes over to look for their next talent. So you actually have a lot of side-conversations between people that look very different. And you can tell that people are talking about jobs and career. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Have they played spot the fed this year? I mean, has there been any government presence - any NSA on site? SHAHANI: Last year, the NSA was very much the talk of the town, particularly with the Snowden revelations. I think that this year the assumption is yes, obviously the government is here. Obviously, the NSA is here. That's been the case for a long time. But an interesting kind of government presence, for example, is the FTC - the Federal Trade Commission - is here.  And they're actually sponsoring a hackathon - a competition - because they're trying to recruit hackers to help them with the problem of phone fraud. And I think the fact that there's another kind of government agency here illustrates a bigger problem that we have across government agencies, which is that there's one that is hyper-concentrated with cyber security knowledge. And then every other agency is just, you know, really limping along trying to do some basics and not having very many resources. GARCIA-NAVARRO: NPR's Aarti Shahani joining us from Las Vegas. Thank you, Aarti. SHAHANI: Thank you. LOURDES GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:  This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. I'm Lourdes Garcia-Navarro. It seems like not a week goes by that we don't hear about a major crime on the Internet - credit card data stolen, our home computers infected with bad software that we never downloaded. The problems of cyber security seem big but also really abstract. All this week, NPR's Aarti Shahani has been in Las Vegas with thousands of experts for whom these problems are very real. Hi, Aarti.

I'm Linda Wertheimer. If you are a die-hard geek or just an average civilian, it's getting easier to own drones. You can buy one online or at a store for less than a $100. You can even make your own. But in New York, there are still questions about whether you're allowed to fly those drones and where, as Sarah Gonzalez of member station WNYC reports. SARAH GONZALEZ, BYLINE: Drones might make you think stealth million-dollar jets that carry bombs. But a drone is any aircraft that doesn't have passengers or a pilot onboard - think remote-controlled helicopters that are little more sophisticated. (SOUNDBITE OF DRONE SPEAKING)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Time remaining - 9 minutes, 40 seconds. GONZALEZ: In an open field at Bergen Community College in New Jersey, students fly drones they built in class. (SOUNDBITE OF DRONE SPEAKING)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Flight mode two - attitude mode. Flight mode one - GPS mode. GONZALEZ: This particular model looks like a really big spider - six arms with blades on them sticking out of what looks like a big Oreo cookie. It's about the size of a beach ball, and within a second, it can shoot up hundreds of feet in the air. (SOUNDBITE OF DRONE TAKING OFF)GONZALEZ: Students mounted a camera to their drone and programmed it to take pictures every few seconds. Maria Alibekova says their mission is to create a 3-D map of their campus. MARIA ALIBEKOVA: It's like our baby - like, little baby bird flying in the sky. I feel like a bird mama. GONZALEZ: And they can park their bird in the sky, leave it hovering up there and make it come back home on its own. (SOUNDBITE OF DRONE SPEAKING)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Failsafe - return home, one minute. GONZALEZ: FAA regulations say drones shouldn't be flown above 400 feet - after that, it  starts to interfere with the national airspace. They can't be flown within a few miles of an airport, and they can only be used for fun, not for commercial purposes. So you can take a video of your drone flying above a cliff and over an ocean, but you can't sell that the video. And an FAA spokesman says big, congested cities, like New York, are off-limits to drones completely - the entire city. It's called class B airspace. But New Yorkers don't seem to know that. Unmanned aircraft are being flown all over the city. BILL DICKEY: Oh, every day. GONZALEZ: Bill Dickey manages Pilotage Fun and Hobby in Manhattan. They sell drones. He says slate workers throw them up over a building to take pictures of some of their work. DICKEY: I mean, it's been a great thing for my business because I think the drone industry is the industry for our era. GONZALEZ: The FAA fined one resident more than $2,000 for flying a small drone off a building in Manhattan after it bumped into other buildings and landed on a public sidewalk. Peter Kalaitzidis, an Air Force vet who owns drones, says they need to be taken more seriously. PETER KALAITZIDIS: Everyone is doing these high-elevated shots, and they're failing. You can go on YouTube and see epic crashes all day, every day. GONZALEZ: It's why lawmakers want more regulations. Senator Charles Schumer called New York City the wild west of drones. And he says they threaten the privacy of citizens. The FAA is expected to issue more regulations in the fall. But Brendan Schulman, a drone lawyer in Manhattan, says there are already laws that protect against the types of illegal acts someone might commit with a drone. BRENDAN SCHULMAN: So you have trespass laws, anti-stalking laws, peeping Tom laws, unlawful surveillance. And those would apply to the use of any technology. GONZALEZ: Schulman says those who worry about drones invading their privacy overlook the good they can do. Cameras on drones have found missing children and stranded hikers. SCHULMAN: These are real technologies that are going to save lives and help people. GONZALEZ: Back at the campus of the Bergen Community College, professor Steve Cohen says drones are becoming a part of everyday activities. And perhaps the best indicator of that is this new trend - taking a selfie with your drone. STEVE COHEN: So yes, taking dronies with your bronies. JOAN MADERA: Look at the pictures here. GONZALEZ: His student, Joan Madera, shows us the aerial shots they took from their drone, and we're all in the pictures. ALIBEKOVA: We took a dronie. (LAUGHTER)MADERA: That's going to become a thing.

And this summer has been no different. As soon as people head to the beach, interest in sharks picks up. The good news is shark attacks were actually down a bit last year compared with previous years. Even so, surfers, divers and others who spend a lot of time in the water have been buying electronic devices that help protect them against shark attacks. From Miami, NPR's Greg Allen reports. GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: There are two companies selling electronic anti-shark devices. One of them, Shark Shield, sells them at dive shops in Florida. DOUG AUSTIN: Actually, I just sold - just sent two out the door today that's going to some charter, I think, over in the Mediterranean. ALLEN: Doug Austin manages Austin's Diving Center in Miami, a shop that's popular with scuba divers who often encounter sharks while spear-fishing. Austin says, as predators, sharks are always on the lookout for the weak and wounded. AUSTIN: When you shoot a fish, he is now weak and wounded. They're flailing around and sometimes bleeding. And so the sharks will come in, and they will steal your fish. ALLEN: The people who use them, do they come back and talk to you about them? What kind of. . . AUSTIN: As long as they don't come back missing any limbs, I don't have a problem (laughter). ALLEN: Owner and general manager of Shark Shield, Amanda Wilson, says the technology is effective because of a characteristic peculiar to sharks; they're very sensitive to electromagnetic fields. AMANDA WILSON: Sharks have electrical receptors in their snout called the Ampullae of Lorenzini. And the waveform that our product creates, it actually induces spasms in the shark's snout. So they don't want to come within 15 to 20 feet of the person wearing a Shark Shield. ALLEN: Electronic shark deterrents were first developed more than 20 years ago. In that time, scientists have conducted thousands of hours of tests using chunks of fish and seal decoys protected by Shark Shields. Wilson says the tests show sharks recoil and avoid the device's electrical field. WILSON: Besides the scientific testing that's been done, we've got hundreds of testimonials from customers over the years that said, you know, a shark was charging me, a great white was charging me, and as soon as it got to 20 feet away, it was like it hit a brick wall and just turned around. ROBERT HUETER: The theory behind this device is solid. ALLEN: Robert Hueter is director of the Center for Shark Research at the Mote Marine Laboratory in Sarasota, Florida. He says the device might make sense for surfers, divers and others who spend a lot of time around sharks who don't mind spending $600 or $700 for the device. Hueter says the question with any sharp repellant is, will it work 100 percent of the time? HUETER: Sharks do habituate to different kinds of noxious stimuli, whether it's a smell or a sound or, in this case, an electrical burst essentially. Will they be repelled in all cases, or will one occasionally get through? ALLEN: Hueter says shark researchers don't use the devices because their work doesn't often expose them to attacks. But if you're planning a 100-mile-plus open-water swim from Cuba to Key West, Diana Nyad says sharks are definitely a worry. DIANA NYAD: Kicking on the surface, you're making low-frequency vibrations. So you're making, as a lot of shark experts will tell you, the sound of a dinner bell. ALLEN: Nyad completed her Havana-to-Key West swim nearly a year ago flanked by kayaks equipped with Shark Shield devices. But on her 53-hour long swim across the Florida Strait, Nyad was also accompanied by a rotating team of divers in the water to fend off sharks. NYAD: I want to be fair and say that I felt confident that the Shark Shield was a big part of our deterrent force. On the other hand, I wouldn't have gone with just the electricity way out there. I wanted my guys. ALLEN: Along with the Shark Shields and her team of divers, Nyad had a third line of defense. It's another new product, a chemical shark repellent sold in an aerosol can. If you're an NPR listener of a certain age, that may sound familiar. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"BATMAN: THE MOVIE\")BURT WARD: (As Robin/ Dick Grayson) Holy sardines. ADAM WEST: (As Batman/ Bruce Wayne) Hand me down the shark repellent. ALLEN: Unlike the shark repellent in the 1966 Batman movie, this one was developed by scientists. It puts in the water a milky chemical found in putrefied shark tissue. Greg Allen, NPR News, Miami. LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST:  Every summer, like clockwork, we hear stories about sharks.

For more on when to pull the plug or just jiggle the switch, we're going to turn to Glenn Derene, who's electronics editor at Consumer Reports. Welcome to the program. GLENN DERENE: Thanks for having me. SIEGEL: And to start, give us a few examples of warning signs of when you would recommend fixing a computer - obviously, doing more than just jiggling a switch. DERENE: Well, so there's two real ways that your computer could be failing. And one is that the hardware is compromised - either something you did where you either spilled a cup of coffee on it or it fell down a flight of stairs or something where a part has failed. And in that case, you really want to consider fixing it in the conventional sense. Either - if it's under warranty, send it back to the manufacturer and repair it as a warranty repair. Or you really can do a cost-benefit analysis - try and figure out how much your computer is worth right now versus how much it would cost to get a new one. But if it's a software issue, one of the easiest things you can do is actually just reinstall your operating system. And if you have the original media that your operating system came on, within, you know, an hour to two hours' worth of work, you'll have your computer, sort of - it's almost like giving it a new brain all over again. And it's - it'll be back like a normal, new computer. SIEGEL: Well, what about when it's time actually put the machine out to pasture? DERENE: (Laughing). Well, so we have some pretty good guidance on that. Based on survey data that we've collected, we found that within the first one to two years, it's pretty obvious that you should attempt to repair it. Very often, it's still under warranty. If you're talking three to five years, then it's kind of in a bit of a gray area and you really should - you might want to consider repairing it. But you also should really also take a look at what it would cost to replace it, how much you paid initially, so on and so forth. After five years, it's almost a no-brainer. Just get rid of it and get a new one. SIEGEL: Now, working with your five-year figure, this could be some kind of corollary to Moore's law. Almost by definition, five years after this machine that you bought, the market is totally different. And today, it's full of tablets and fablets and light-weight laptops. And there's still some desktops out there. So what's the best way to go if you're in the market for something new? DERENE: Well, most people these days actually go for a laptop. And increasingly, laptops are moving towards the ultrabook category - very, very thin, very light computers that don't necessarily - and people should be aware that when you shop for one of these things, you're not necessarily getting anything with an optical drive. If you have a lot of stuff stored on CDs and DVDs, you might not be able to easily migrate it to one of these new computers. And ironically, they're not easy to repair. They're not easy to fix yourself. You should also note that the hardware is sealed so that you can't easily get into it. You can't get at the hard drive or a lot of other components that in the past you could just swap right out. SIEGEL: Mr. Durene, how old is your computer right now? DERENE: (Laughing). That's a tricky question. I actually have around five computers. So they range in age from around six years old all the way to only a couple of months. SIEGEL: Six years old and still on the road? DERENE: Eh, it's my tinkering computer. It's what I like to actually swap the parts out on and replace them and upgrade it. So it's kind of a Frankenstein beast. SIEGEL: OK, that's Glenn Durene, electronics editor at Consumer Reports. Thanks for talking with us. DERENE: Thank you. SIEGEL: And we're also wondering how old your computer is. Who has the oldest working machine out there still in regular use? Tell us about it. Take a photo. We'll share some of your responses in the future All Tech segment. And you can tweet those photos and stories to us or send us a message on Facebook. We are in both places at @npratc. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:   But how do you know when it's time to repair a computer and when it's time to replace it? For more on when to pull the plug or just jiggle the switch, we're going to turn to Glenn Derene, who's electronics editor at Consumer Reports. Welcome to the program. GLENN DERENE: Thanks for having me. SIEGEL: And to start, give us a few examples of warning signs of when you would recommend fixing a computer - obviously, doing more than just jiggling a switch. DERENE: Well, so there's two real ways that your computer could be failing. And one is that the hardware is compromised - either something you did where you either spilled a cup of coffee on it or it fell down a flight of stairs or something where a part has failed. And in that case, you really want to consider fixing it in the conventional sense. Either - if it's under warranty, send it back to the manufacturer and repair it as a warranty repair. Or you really can do a cost-benefit analysis - try and figure out how much your computer is worth right now versus how much it would cost to get a new one. But if it's a software issue, one of the easiest things you can do is actually just reinstall your operating system. And if you have the original media that your operating system came on, within, you know, an hour to two hours' worth of work, you'll have your computer, sort of - it's almost like giving it a new brain all over again. And it's - it'll be back like a normal, new computer. SIEGEL: Well, what about when it's time actually put the machine out to pasture? DERENE: (Laughing). Well, so we have some pretty good guidance on that. Based on survey data that we've collected, we found that within the first one to two years, it's pretty obvious that you should attempt to repair it. Very often, it's still under warranty. If you're talking three to five years, then it's kind of in a bit of a gray area and you really should - you might want to consider repairing it. But you also should really also take a look at what it would cost to replace it, how much you paid initially, so on and so forth. After five years, it's almost a no-brainer. Just get rid of it and get a new one. SIEGEL: Now, working with your five-year figure, this could be some kind of corollary to Moore's law. Almost by definition, five years after this machine that you bought, the market is totally different. And today, it's full of tablets and fablets and light-weight laptops. And there's still some desktops out there. So what's the best way to go if you're in the market for something new? DERENE: Well, most people these days actually go for a laptop. And increasingly, laptops are moving towards the ultrabook category - very, very thin, very light computers that don't necessarily - and people should be aware that when you shop for one of these things, you're not necessarily getting anything with an optical drive.

These companies are designed to let people rent out their homes directly, even for just a few days. Maybe you go away on vacation, so you rent your house to somebody else who's coming to your town on vacation. Now in San Francisco, some landlords have found that renting apartments through these brokers on a nightly basis can bring in a lot more money than renting to long-term tenants. And concerns over the city's shrinking market for rental housing has prompted protests and even legal action. For member station KALW, Ben Trefny reports. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) How do you spell money? A-I-R, B-N-B. BEN TREFNY, BYLINE: Protesters gathered in San Francisco's North Beach neighborhood recently to call attention to part of the city's housing crisis. UNIDNETIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) Sharing economy, you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t evict me. TREFNY: They got together around a three-unit apartment with flats being rented out to vacationers through an online broker. This used to be the rent-controlled home of elderly tenants, until out-of-town investors bought the building and evicted the residents. Ted Gullicksen of the San Francisco Tenants Union says those units were added to the 7,500 or so available to tourists in San Francisco using sites like Airbnb and VRBO. TED GULLICKSEN: I mean, the underlying problem in San Francisco is the conversion of rent-controlled apartments to other uses be they condo or tourist, which is taking sorely needed rent-controlled units off the market. TREFNY: The city already has one of the lowest vacancy rates in the nation, about 3 percent. It's also got some of the most expensive median rents at nearly $3,300 per month. Local law limits rent increases for long-term residents. But if tenants are evicted, like they were here, they'll probably have to pay market rent to stay in the city. PETER KWAN: You know, I applaud the Tenants Union for bringing attention to the bad actors. TREFNY: Peter Kwan heads a group called Home Sharers of San Francisco. KWAN: But they may be giving the impression that everybody who hosts, equally bad actors - which is simply not the case. TREFNY: Kwan's organization has over 1000 members and a lot are like him. They don't evict tenants; they live in the property they rent to tourists. Kwan gets about 130 bucks a night for a room in his house and its booked pretty solid in the summer. KWAN: Oh, yeah, during the summer, it would be more than 20 days a month. TREFNY: So the room in your house that you rent out, is that legal in San Francisco? KWAN: It could be a violation of the zoning code. I haven't looked into it. TREFNY: Are you going to do that? KWAN: I may do. TREFNY: There are at least two codes and ordinances that make private rentals of less than 30 days illegal in San Francisco. And two lawsuits have been filed so far. The law's the same in New York City, which has been cracking down on rental scofflaws. But San Francisco planning director John Rahaim, says his city is trying to walk a fine line. It wants to protect vulnerable tenants. JOHN RAHAIM: And in a way that isn't causing heartache to people who are just trying to make a little bit of money out of their apartment or house. TREFNY: Next month, the city's Board of Supervisors is expected to consider a compromise measure that would legalize tourist rentals but only under some conditions. Carl Shepherd, co-founder of HomeAway, which runs many vacation rental websites such as VRBO, is pro-regulation. But he says too much could just send the hot market underground. CARL SHEPHERD: So it's a little bit like prohibition in the '30s, and what you don't want to do is create a law that can't be enforced because that does no one any good. TREFNY: Other cities around the world have made definitive choices. Amsterdam and Paris recently passed laws allowing short-term residential rentals. Berlin and Barcelona both banned them. The short-term rental arm of the so-called, sharing economy will have to adjust one way or the other as regulations slowly catch up with the supply, the demand and the technology that connect the two.

BLOCK: That's writer Matt de la Pena and he's ready to confess. DE LA PENA: Whenever some one from my working-class family asked how I met my now wife I make up stories. The truth just doesn't live up to my machismo Mexican roots. Take my old man for example. He met my mom in the aftermath of a car wreck. He was riding shotgun when my uncle sideswiped a Datsun carrying four women. One of them my mom. Pops made his initial approach in the ER waiting room while a doctor was plucking glass out of his brothers forehead. Now that's game. It's the same with my uncles. They've stepped to women at bars and street fairs and neighborhood barbecues - always in person and always with bravado. It's bad enough I live clear across the country from them now in gentrified Brooklyn, that I make a living writing books instead of working with my hands. If they found out how I actually met my wife I'd lose what little street cred I have left. I remember my uncle Tim, an imposing construction worker, pulling me aside during a Dos-Equis-fueled  game of horseshoes when I was home visiting. He'd heard about this new girl in New York and wanted details. I invented a slick pickup line, told him I'd delivered it in a crowded subway car. We got off at the next stop, I told my uncle, so I could hook her up with a beer and a shot of tequila and went from there. He nodded approvingly and clapped me on the show shoulder saying, you're a true de la Pena. As I watched him go off to make his throws I felt proud because that's all I've ever wanted to be - a true de la Pena. I understand how absurd this probably sounds. These days people all around me are finding love online and no one seems it the least bit ashamed. That's why I've decided to man up and finally own the truth. Are you listening uncle Tim? I met my wife on MySpace. I repeat, MySpace. It was late 2005 and my first book was about to come out. Instant fame I assumed was right around the corner when an author buddy suggested I try to network online, I rolled my eyes. But then my book dropped and crickets. My first public event was at the Albany Museum and not one single human showed up. I created a MySpace profile that night, sent friend requests to every industry person who came up in my publishing search. But when I clicked on to the profile one publicist, I forgot all about networking. She seemed beautiful and funny and we lived in the same Brooklyn neighborhood. I spent the rest of the night writing and rewriting a simple three line e-mail to her and when I saw her response sitting in my inbox early the next morning I got butterflies. It turned out she was even funnier in person and more beautiful. We've been together over eight years now and a couple of months ago we had a baby girl. The whole thing uncle Tim started in the glowing light of my MacBook Pro, but I swear to you I'm still a true de la Pena, right? BLOCK: That's writer Matt de la Pena.

Dozens of colleges are being investigated over their handling of sexual assault cases. It turns out incoming freshmen are especially vulnerable. The first 6 weeks of the semester are known as the \"red zone\" when a student is most likely to experience rape or an attempted rape. NPR has been reporting on ways to prevent sexual assaults on campus. And this morning, some new technology. Several new smartphone apps offer quick ways for students who are facing dangerous or uncomfortable situations to reach out to friends, connect with resources on campus or call the police. We spoke with Juana Summers from NPR's Ed team. JUANA SUMMERS, BYLINE: One of the most popular ones is something called the Circle of 6. And what it does - a person can pick six friends to reach out to at a moment's notice if they need help or support. GREENE: Now, you say a moment's notice - I'm imagining someone being in a difficult situation where they feel like they're being threatened by a person they're with. I mean, you can't imagine they would have that much time to actually do something on their mobile device. What actually happens? What plays out here? SUMMERS: You're exactly right. And that's one of the questions I  asked Nancy Schwartzman, who's one of the creators of Circle of 6. And she said that it's really a two-click process - because a man or woman has already selected six friends as part of their circle, they can just click an icon, click again and it sends a text message to those friends. For example, call me and pretend you need me, I need an interruption. Another one is come and get me, I need help getting home safely. Call when you're close. And that'll actually add a GPS alert so the person can see where you are because sometimes if you're at an unfamiliar place, you might not have an address at your disposal. But you really need someone to be there in that moment. GREENE: I see. And these are messages that have already been scripted out and that would automatically send to your six friends in  your network. SUMMERS: Absolutely. I tried it on my own iPhone. It's literally you click the icon that corresponds to what you want the friend to do, you click it again to fire off the text message. So it's really a matter of seconds. And that's what they're hoping will really make the difference. GREENE: Now, I mean, college campuses have been dealing with this threat for a long time. It's the famous blue light phone boxes on campuses. Is this definitely some sort of improvement over those things? SUMMERS: First of all, statistics show they're not really all that often used. And what's also really interesting is that research shows that most rapes and sexual assault that happen, happen from someone you know. It's not someone jumping out of the bushes when you're walking out of the library. But what people do have in their hands is a smartphone at all times, whether you're in the library or in a bar off-campus. You're more likely to have that piece of technology with you. And that's why so many developers are focusing on that. GREENE: So let's imagine a scenario here - if someone has their smartphone, they do a click. It sends a message out to your six friends. You know, you've done your part to get the message out. You're relying though on these six people, or at least one of them, to actually do something and be available too. SUMMERS: You absolutely are. And that's part of the cultural aspect of this that many of these developers talk about. It's creating a broader network of bystanders on campus. So while you might be alone in the room with someone who's perhaps making you uncomfortable, you're calling on your friends and you're letting them  know hey, I'm counting on you to be here for me, to help me stay safe, to be part of my network and part of my support system. GREENE: So have they actually tested this app yet? Is it effective? SUMMERS: That is actually starting this fall. Circle of 6 will be going to Williams College in Massachusetts for a two-year pilot program. They will be rolling this out to freshman at orientation. So it'll be really interesting to see what that research says and how those men and women are able to build out their networks and use this as they'll be entering a new space in testing this out firsthand. GREENE: So Circle of 6 is one of these. There some other apps that you've been looking at too? SUMMERS: There are a number of other apps. Some are coming from colleges - Loyola University in Chicago for example recently released a campus-specific app. And some of these solutions - one of the more interesting ones I found actually doesn't have anything to do with your smartphone at all. It's a tool called Calysto, it's still in beta. And what Calysto aims to do is gives a person a safe space to say these are the very concrete details of what happened and when and how and then you can just store it there. You don't have to do anything with it. At the end, you have three options - you can either trigger a report to law enforcement right then and there, you can choose to save the information, do nothing with it, come back to it later, just kind of leave it in the vault, or the third option is if you perhaps name your assailant or other person who's assaulted you, you then have the opportunity to trigger a report if more than one person says that they have been a victim of that person. GREENE: That's Juana Summers from NPR's Ed team. Juana, thanks for coming by. SUMMERS: Thank you, David. GREENE: It's an important issue that NPR Ed team plans to keep covering. You hear their reporting here on MORNING EDITION and also on our sister program All Things Considered. We have much more here on MORNING EDITION and All Things Considered picks up where we left off later today. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  All right, let's report now on a different kind of threat - sexual assault on campus. Dozens of colleges are being investigated over their handling of sexual assault cases. It turns out incoming freshmen are especially vulnerable. The first 6 weeks of the semester are known as the \"red zone\" when a student is most likely to experience rape or an attempted rape. NPR has been reporting on ways to prevent sexual assaults on campus. And this morning, some new technology. Several new smartphone apps offer quick ways for students who are facing dangerous or uncomfortable situations to reach out to friends, connect with resources on campus or call the police. We spoke with Juana Summers from NPR's Ed team. JUANA SUMMERS, BYLINE: One of the most popular ones is something called the Circle of 6. And what it does - a person can pick six friends to reach out to at a moment's notice if they need help or support. GREENE: Now, you say a moment's notice - I'm imagining someone being in a difficult situation where they feel like they're being threatened by a person they're with. I mean, you can't imagine they would have that much time to actually do something on their mobile device. What actually happens? What plays out here? SUMMERS: You're exactly right. And that's one of the questions I  asked Nancy Schwartzman, who's one of the creators of Circle of 6. And she said that it's really a two-click process - because a man or woman has already selected six friends as part of their circle, they can just click an icon, click again and it sends a text message to those friends. For example, call me and pretend you need me, I need an interruption. Another one is come and get me, I need help getting home safely. Call when you're close. And that'll actually add a GPS alert so the person can see where you are because sometimes if you're at an unfamiliar place, you might not have an address at your disposal. But you really need someone to be there in that moment. GREENE: I see. And these are messages that have already been scripted out and that would automatically send to your six friends in  your network. SUMMERS: Absolutely. I tried it on my own iPhone. It's literally you click the icon that corresponds to what you want the friend to do, you click it again to fire off the text message. So it's really a matter of seconds. And that's what they're hoping will really make the difference. GREENE: Now, I mean, college campuses have been dealing with this threat for a long time. It's the famous blue light phone boxes on campuses. Is this definitely some sort of improvement over those things? SUMMERS: First of all, statistics show they're not really all that often used. And what's also really interesting is that research shows that most rapes and sexual assault that happen, happen from someone you know. It's not someone jumping out of the bushes when you're walking out of the library. But what people do have in their hands is a smartphone at all times, whether you're in the library or in a bar off-campus. You're more likely to have that piece of technology with you. And that's why so many developers are focusing on that. GREENE: So let's imagine a scenario here - if someone has their smartphone, they do a click. It sends a message out to your six friends. You know, you've done your part to get the message out. You're relying though on these six people, or at least one of them, to actually do something and be available too. SUMMERS: You absolutely are. And that's part of the cultural aspect of this that many of these developers talk about. It's creating a broader network of bystanders on campus. So while you might be alone in the room with someone who's perhaps making you uncomfortable, you're calling on your friends and you're letting them  know hey, I'm counting on you to be here for me, to help me stay safe, to be part of my network and part of my support system. GREENE: So have they actually tested this app yet? Is it effective? SUMMERS: That is actually starting this fall. Circle of 6 will be going to Williams College in Massachusetts for a two-year pilot program. They will be rolling this out to freshman at orientation. So it'll be really interesting to see what that research says and how those men and women are able to build out their networks and use this as they'll be entering a new space in testing this out firsthand. GREENE: So Circle of 6 is one of these. There some other apps that you've been looking at too? SUMMERS: There are a number of other apps. Some are coming from colleges - Loyola University in Chicago for example recently released a campus-specific app. And some of these solutions - one of the more interesting ones I found actually doesn't have anything to do with your smartphone at all. It's a tool called Calysto, it's still in beta. And what Calysto aims to do is gives a person a safe space to say these are the very concrete details of what happened and when and how and then you can just store it there. You don't have to do anything with it. At the end, you have three options - you can either trigger a report to law enforcement right then and there, you can choose to save the information, do nothing with it, come back to it later, just kind of leave it in the vault, or the third option is if you perhaps name your assailant or other person who's assaulted you, you then have the opportunity to trigger a report if more than one person says that they have been a victim of that person. GREENE: That's Juana Summers from NPR's Ed team. Juana, thanks for coming by. SUMMERS: Thank you, David. GREENE: It's an important issue that NPR Ed team plans to keep covering.

It's on the website of The Atlantic Monthly. And that should be a tip-off that the Zuckerman mea culpa is for no garden-variety misdeed. Ethan Zuckerman is now at MIT. Before that he was at Harvard and in the 1990s he was at tripod. com. And it was there that he committed the offense at hand. And Ethan Zuckerman, why don't you describe the thing that you are personally involved in inventing that you're now apologizing for. ETHAN ZUCKERMAN: So Robert, I am now publicly apologizing to you, to the nation and to the world for my role in inventing the pop-up ad. SIEGEL: The pop-up ad. Now the title of your article in The Atlantic is \"The Internet's Original Sin. \" It's not just the annoyance of the pop-up ad, it's the dependence of the Internet on advertising that you're saying is the original sin. ZUCKERMAN: Well, that's right. I wrote the article not to make a public confession about my role in bringing the pop-up to life, but I wanted to go back to this question of why advertising has become the default business model for the Internet. And I wanted to share my concern that by letting ourselves become dependent on advertising as the main revenue model, we've all gotten way too used to putting ourselves under surveillance. And I think that not only is this a bad way for us to build businesses online, I think it's bad for us as citizens. SIEGEL: You're saying that in that respect advertising and on the Internet is qualitatively different from advertising in The Atlantic say or sponsorship in public broadcasting? ZUCKERMAN: I think that's absolutely true. I think when someone buys a page in The Atlantic or when someone sponsors NPR, they know very little about those readers or those listeners. We know about them in aggregate. But on the Internet we have advertising-supported companies like Facebook that are analyzing as much as they can possibly find out about us. They're analyzing our demographic. They're analyzing our friendship patterns. And they're trying to create these very complex sophisticated profiles of us to market to. And that I think over time has a very corrosive effect. I think that regularizes surveillance and makes us feel like we're being watched at all times. SIEGEL: So describe the path not taken. What kind of Internet would it be if it weren't supported and generally free as a result in terms of access to sites - if it weren't supported by advertising? ZUCKERMAN: There's a couple of paths not taken. One that people are pursuing now is a subscription model where people are paying modest fees for services that they really care about. In my article in The Atlantic, I write about an online bookmarking service called Pinboard. I paid $5 for it. It's mine to use for the rest of my natural days as long as they run the service. And for something like Twitter which I use every day, I would happily pay $5 a year to make that accessible. Another one Micropayment - paying small fractions of a cent for content might actually be a very good way to launch new businesses and services. Finally, there are sort of philanthropic-based models where people are crowdfunding or giving as ways of supporting projects and services that they care about. My point in this piece was not just to apologize for the pop-up ad, but really to challenge the idea that we have to build businesses around advertising. I really do think there are other ways to do it. SIEGEL: But would those alternatives to advertising lead online institutions and companies to stop trying to find out more about us? Wouldn't it still be in their interest to try to expand their membership use, for example, to keep on investigating who we are if we use them? ZUCKERMAN: I think it's a slightly different prospect between getting people to pay for subscriptions and trying to target the ads. Because the arms race is not so much about the quality of the ad, it's persuading investors that they're going to make more money off of advertising with our service than with anybody else. So Facebook has set a very very high bar. They know an enormous amount about you. If you want to start a new advertising-based web business, you have to somehow demonstrate you're going to find out even more about your user than Facebook does. And we need some combination of new business models and probably a certain amount of regulation to protect our online behavior and identities - to really get us out of what looks like an increasingly complicated trap. SIEGEL: Well, Ethan Zuckerman, I can't speak for the whole world or the audience, but personally I accept your apology. ZUCKERMAN: The forgiveness feels wonderful to me, Robert. And thank you for the chance to confess to your audience. SIEGEL: OK.

We are what we Google. Columnist David Leonhardt reports on a comparison between what terms people search for in counties where The Times figures life is easiest and in the counties where it's hardest. And he joins us right here in the main streets of downtown Washington D. C. Hi. DAVID LEONHARDT: Hi. Thanks for having me. SIEGEL: Actually, I assume Washington and the area around it would qualify as a relatively easy place to live. LEONHARDT: They would. It's County-based analysis and it would qualify as relatively un-mean - place where life was pretty good. SIEGEL: Places, other parts of the country that are easy? LEONHARDT: I would say there are maybe two broad areas. One, the Western-Midwest - Iowa, the Dakotas, even into Wyoming. And then the big metropolitan areas of the Northeast and California and the Pacific North-West. Life tends to be hardest in the South-East - in Louisiana, in Arkansas, in Kentucky. And we did these definitions based on six things - income, education, health. What you might expect. SIEGEL: So before we get to the differences in what people are searching for, what are some things that people search for all over the United States regardless of whether they're in the easy places or the hard places? LEONHARDT: Well, that's an important distinction. What we're looking for here are differences. So people all over the country search for the Super Bowl. They search for Oprah Winfrey. They search for celebrities - whether it's the Kardashian's or Justin Bieber. What this is picking up are the things that people tend to search for in one place and not in the other kind of places. SIEGEL: OK. First where life is easiest. What are people searching for that people in the hard places aren't searching for? LEONHARDT: The thing that really stands out - and this surprised us - were cameras. People spend a lot of time searching for digital cameras in places where life is easy. Now some of that, points out Hal Varian who's the chief economist at Google who helped us with this, is that digital cameras are a piece of technology that had been popular for the entire last decade - which is the span of this study. But people really like their digital cameras. So we hypothesized part of that is they like their life, they like recording their life. SIEGEL: Want to get a picture of it. LEONHARDT: Yeah. There are also all kinds of products involved with keeping themselves and their kids healthy - BabyBjorns, baby joggers, baby massage. I didn't confess to know what a foam roller was until I did this exercise. And I Googled it and it turns out it's a piece of exercise equipment that you roll over to stay in good shape. SIEGEL: So these are the Google search markers for those who are living the life. People where life is hardest in the U. S. , what are they searching for? LEONHARDT: That's more depressing, to be honest about it. You see a lot of stuff about health problems. You see a lot of searches on blood sugar, on diabetics. You see a lot of searches about what might be called the dark side of religion. In the top 10 were anti-christ, the rapture and hell. You see a lot of searches about trying to make money - things about selling Avon, things about getting Social Security checks. And you see a lot of searches about guns - specific kinds of guns. The same way you see specific kinds of exercise equipment in the good place, you see specific kinds of guns in places where life is hard. SIEGEL: What's implicit here is that where ever you are people are searching. People are Googling all over the place. LEONHARDT: That's right. And I think this is the kind of analysis that wouldn't have been possible even a decade ago. Because a decade ago in the places where life was harder you wouldn't have had the kind of internet penetration. But now we're up toward 90 percent internet penetration. It really is becoming universal. And so it really is a window into what people are thinking. SIEGEL: These distinctions are very interesting. Do they contribute to the store of knowledge about American society much, do you think? LEONHARDT: I think they do in that as you note, some of them are amusing, some are entertaining, some are just about cultural preferences that are fun to look at. But I think the underlying message is important and I think it's sobering - we live in a society where inequality has increased dramatically over the last 40 years. And one of the things you can really tell from this is that life really is a lot harder in some parts of America than another. A lot harder - people are much more likely suffer health problems, they're much more likely to worry about money. And I think what you can see in this is a manifestation of these economic trends in people's everyday lives -how the economic trends of the last 40 years, how the rising inequality - are affecting people's day-to-day thoughts and day-to-day lives.

(SOUNDBITE OF ADVERTISEMENT)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Car thieves are out there prepared to steal your car. Now, more than ever, you need The Club, antitheft device. GREENE: That was back in the 1990s. You know, you locked it onto your steering wheel to keep your car from being stolen. Well, you don't see it around as much these days, and there's a reason for that. Car theft is on the decline in the United States in a big way. And to find out why this is happening, we turn to Roger Morris. He's vice president of the National Insurance Crime Bureau, a trade agency that represents the car insurance industry. Mr. Morris, welcome to the program. ROGER MORRIS: Good morning. How are you? GREENE: I'm well. Thank you. So tell me about this. You have a new report out showing that car thefts are really dramatically down. What exactly did you to find? MORRIS: Well, every year we put out a hot wheels report listing the top 10 most stolen vehicles in the country. We've been doing this for a lot of years. And the latest one based on the 2013 data that's out there from the National Crime Information Center shows that once again, the older model Hondas - Accords and Civics - are the most stolen vehicles in the country. But when you get past the late 1990 models and into the newer models, those drop dramatically. So the technology that has been put in place since the late 90s has really had a major impact on car thefts. Thefts reached their peak back in 1991 at 1. 6 million thefts a year in this country. And we think that when the final figures are ran for 2013 from the FBI, that number may drop below 700,000. GREENE: Well, before I get to sort of the technology broadly, what is it about Hondas that seems so tantalizing for thieves? MORRIS: Well, first of all, the Hondas back in the 90s were very popular, very well made. And they are very much valued by car thieves for their parts and their engines. However, they were made - the 1997 model was the first model that came out with a key code in it, which was really the major first step in antitheft technology. So when you look at the 1996 model Accord, which was the most stolen model in the country last year, there were 8,166 thefts of those models. Compare that to a 2013 Accord with the new technology on it. Last year, there were only 276 of those stolen. GREENE: And what exactly is this technology that came in in the late 90s the made cars much harder to steal? MORRIS: Well, they put a code in the key that matches up with the ignition that says, you know, unless this key is in this ignition, it won't start. So it basically stopped the hot wiring and, you know, the joy riding, so to speak. GREENE: Please don't jump to any conclusions about me when I ask you this - but how do you steal a car these days with this new technology? MORRIS: A lot of the thefts today are, unfortunately, the drivers leaving their car unlocked with the keys somewhere in the car. You'd be surprised how many people will stop at a parking lot or a convenience store or something, jump out, leave the car running. . . GREENE: I'm just grabbing coffee and a newspaper. I'll be back to my car in three minutes. MORRIS: Exactly. GREENE: Let me just ask you about one thing I noticed in your statistics here. It seems like a large number of the communities that are still seeing a lot of car thefts are in the state of California. Why is that? MORRIS: California has been having five or six or seven of the top spots for the last several years. And this year, they had 9 of the top 10 hot spots in the country. Basically, it's because California's huge. There's a lot of cars out there. I-5, Interstate 5, is kind of a corridor for car thieves. They steal them and head down, and a lot of them go across the border into Mexico. GREENE: Roger Morris is vice president of the National Insurance Crime Bureau. Thanks so much for talking to us. MORRIS: Thank you. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  Remember The Club? (SOUNDBITE OF ADVERTISEMENT) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Car thieves are out there prepared to steal your car.

And the latest one based on the 2013 data that's out there from the National Crime Information Center shows that once again, the older model Hondas - Accords and Civics - are the most stolen vehicles in the country. But when you get past the late 1990 models and into the newer models, those drop dramatically. So the technology that has been put in place since the late 90s has really had a major impact on car thefts. Thefts reached their peak back in 1991 at 1. 6 million thefts a year in this country. And we think that when the final figures are ran for 2013 from the FBI, that number may drop below 700,000. GREENE: Well, before I get to sort of the technology broadly, what is it about Hondas that seems so tantalizing for thieves? MORRIS: Well, first of all, the Hondas back in the 90s were very popular, very well made. And they are very much valued by car thieves for their parts and their engines. However, they were made - the 1997 model was the first model that came out with a key code in it, which was really the major first step in antitheft technology. So when you look at the 1996 model Accord, which was the most stolen model in the country last year, there were 8,166 thefts of those models. Compare that to a 2013 Accord with the new technology on it. Last year, there were only 276 of those stolen. GREENE: And what exactly is this technology that came in in the late 90s the made cars much harder to steal? MORRIS: Well, they put a code in the key that matches up with the ignition that says, you know, unless this key is in this ignition, it won't start. So it basically stopped the hot wiring and, you know, the joy riding, so to speak. GREENE: Please don't jump to any conclusions about me when I ask you this - but how do you steal a car these days with this new technology? MORRIS: A lot of the thefts today are, unfortunately, the drivers leaving their car unlocked with the keys somewhere in the car. You'd be surprised how many people will stop at a parking lot or a convenience store or something, jump out, leave the car running. . . GREENE: I'm just grabbing coffee and a newspaper. I'll be back to my car in three minutes. MORRIS: Exactly. GREENE: Let me just ask you about one thing I noticed in your statistics here. It seems like a large number of the communities that are still seeing a lot of car thefts are in the state of California. Why is that? MORRIS: California has been having five or six or seven of the top spots for the last several years. And this year, they had 9 of the top 10 hot spots in the country. Basically, it's because California's huge. There's a lot of cars out there. I-5, Interstate 5, is kind of a corridor for car thieves. They steal them and head down, and a lot of them go across the border into Mexico. GREENE: Roger Morris is vice president of the National Insurance Crime Bureau. Thanks so much for talking to us.

I'm Scott Simon. The city of Ferguson, Missouri has found some calm this week. It comes after many days of clashes between protesters and police following the shooting of Michael Brown. In an attempt to try to rebuild trust, Ferguson officials said the city would explore the possibility of outfitting police with personal video cameras. NPR's Martin Kaste's been looking into the spread of these types of cameras in police departments across the country and has this report. MARTIN KASTE, BYLINE: When you ask people in Ferguson what piece of gear they want to see the police wearing, they almost always say this. ALONZO BOND: All the cops need to have body cameras and dashboard cameras. KASTE: Why is that? BOND: So everybody can be accounted. KASTE: Alonzo Bond is not alone in thinking this. Around the country, body-worn cameras have become the go-to technology for troubled police departments - places like New Orleans. This spring, the department there started requiring all of its patrol cops to where the cameras. Lieutenant Travis St. Pierre demoed the camera for NPR in May. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRAVIS ST. PIERRE: When I activate this event button, which is on this controller right here - either on my chest or on my belt - it'll give me an audible tone letting me know that the camera is on. KASTE: Police chiefs are just as enthusiastic about the cameras as police reformers. Both sides seem to share a belief that the cameras can resolve disputes by recording what really happened. Charles Ramsey's the police commissioner of Philadelphia and president of the Police Executive Research Forum. POLICE COMMISSIONER CHARLES RAMSEY: Everybody's got their own version of a story, but when it's on tape, it's on tape. It is what it is. KASTE: But is it? Howard Wasserman is a law professor at Florida International University, and he's written about this. He says lawyers are starting to discover what any college film student could've told them - that recorded images are not neutral. HOWARD WASSERMAN: You know, how the camera is held - the angle at which the camera is held - you know, is the camera sort of panning? Is the camera held steady? All of that affects the perception of what you see. KASTE: He says, in court, whatever video you do have - however fragmentary or confusing - has the potential of becoming the star of the show. WASSERMAN: And the problem that I think we get into is the assumption that the video shows all. So we can disregard all the other evidence that's not the video. KASTE: The other big concern with police videos is control. SUSAN HUTSON: It's interesting. KASTE: That's Susan Hutson. She's the independent police monitor in New Orleans. She says the department there has given its officers some mixed signals about when to press record. HUTSON: We saw that the department was struggling with that a little bit - trying to make sure that officers knew when they can turn it off and when they can't. KASTE: Even when an officer willfully refuses to record, it's not a fireable offense in New Orleans. And then there's the potential for technical glitches. That's long been an issue with the dash cameras. One of Hutson's staffers says it's suspicious how often those seem to malfunction. And that's a complaint you hear in some other cities, too. Finally, there's the matter of the 30 second buffer. Here's how New Orleans officer Travis St. Pierre describes the workings of the most popular model of body camera. ST. PIERRE: The camera's always on. It's buffering the last 30 seconds of what this camera saw -will always be in a loop - just video - not audio. KASTE: Did you catch that? It buffers video - meaning when the officer presses record, it saves the 30 seconds of images that led up to that moment. But it doesn't save the audio of those 30 seconds. The manufacturer did this to protect the privacy of police officers, but it also means the cameras may miss crucial noises or words that trigger an incident. Howard Wasserman thinks that's a mistake. WASSERMAN: I think if we're going to do this, we need to do it right. And if anybody's privacy is going to be compromised, it would be - it ought to be the government officials who are wielding the power in all of these encounters. KASTE: He says it's another argument for more video recording by civilians to fill in the gaps of what really happened now that that's increasingly decided by what's captured on camera.

I'm Tess Vigeland. If you're ready for some football, well, the NFL season is just a couple of weekends away and with it the new version of \"Madden. \" Each year, the latest edition of the only official NFL videogame tries to be more and more realistic whether it's the commentary or the gameplay. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO GAME, \"MADDEN NFL 15\")VIGELAND: Or even the touchdown dances. But the game has never displayed players real-life tattoos until now. NPR's Becky Sullivan explaines. BECKY SULLIVAN, BYLINE: Samit Sarkar has been playing \"Madden\" for more than 20 years. Now he's a reporter for the gaming website Polygon. He says the franchise has made realistic visuals a huge priority. SAMIT SARKAR: NFL superstars definitely look like their real-life counterparts would. I mean, you'd be able to look at their face in game and go, oh, man, that's Eli Manning. SULLIVAN: But tattoos have long been an exception. Some old versions had generic tattoos Sarkar says, but no player has ever had their real ink appear in the game until now. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO GAME, \"MADDEN NFL 15\")COMMENTATOR: And here is quarterback Colin Kaepernick. SULLIVAN: In real life, Colin Kaepernick, the young starting quarterback for the San Francisco 49er's is covered in tattoos - his chest, his back, his arms. In the newest \"Madden,\" the computerized Kaepernick sticks out like a sore thumb in the sea of bare arms along the line of scrimmage because he is the only character in the game displaying his real-life tattoos. Tim Bradley is an intellectual property attorney. I asked him why some videogame makers have been so cautious. He explained to me that copyright law is actually very friendly to tattoo artists. All they have to do to get the protection of the law is use a, quote, \"modicum of creativity in the design\" and put it on a, quote, \"tangible medium. \"TIM BRADLEY: So that could be paper or film or what have you. And you automatic own the copyrights to that. SULLIVAN: With tattoos, the medium is the person they've tattooed. But it's tricky. While the artist definitely owns the copyright to their design. BRADLEY: The recipient certainly owns their body. So they own a copy of your work. And so the thorny question comes in about what happens when the additional copies are made. SULLIVAN: Meaning a recreation of the tattoo. Like, say a videogame version of it or more famously this bit from the movie, \"The Hangover Part II. \"(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE HANGOVER PART II\")SULLIVAN: The guys have just woken up from their black out night. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE HANGOVER PART II\")ED HELMS: (As Stuart Price) This is a real tattoo. SULLIVAN: In a nod to Mike Tyson's role in the first \"Hangover\" movie, Ed Helms's uptight dentist character wakes up to find his own face now has a copy of Tyson's famous and distinctive facial tattoo. But the tattoo artist was never asked for permission for his work to appear on someone else's face. So he sued. And Warner-Brothers settled. No surprise the NFL Players Association started advising players to acquire the rights to their tattoos, especially players like Colin Kaepernick whose real tattoos have become a signature part of his on-field persona. NES ANDRION: And especially the one that, you know, the one that makes the pictures, you just go for that bicep and kiss that. SULLIVAN: This is Nes Andrion, he's the artist who made the tattoos on Kaepernick's bicep. He runs a tattoo shop in Reno called Endless Ink. He says business has been booming since Kaepernick started doing all those bicep kisses on national TV. Andrion's gotten used to seeing his designs everywhere that Kaepernick and his famous body art appear. Newspapers, magazine covers. It was no surprise to see the tattoos star in a yahoo fantasy football commercial. (SOUNDBITE OF COMMERCIAL)COLIN KAEPERNICK: Oh, hey Colin Kaepernick here. SULLIVAN: In the commercial, Kaepernick is shirtless sitting in a tattoo parlor surrounded by three tattoo artists working away with their needles. Nes Andrion's work on Kaepernick's chest and arms is on full display. (SOUNDBITE OF COMMERCIAL)KAEPERNICK: Wow, this says I'm the fancy QB of the future. Let's write that in somewhere. SULLIVAN: With lawsuits over tattoo use looming, it's no surprise that Kaepernick's agent got Andrion's permission before that commercial aired. ANDRION: No, it's good for him is good for you right. I'm like yes and no, but he's not understanding my point of view. You know, like I'm supposed to be in that commercial. You know what I mean? It's my work that they're showing, you know. SULLIVAN: Nes Andrion told me he had mixed feelings about signing the waiver. And he says he hasn't received any money in return for signing. But he says working with Kaepernick has been a good thing for him overall. And once Kaepernick and his agents had the rights to the tattoos on his body, he was free to extend those to \"Madden. \" So, if you're planning to pick up a copy of the newest \"Madden\" next week, try this out. Pick the 49ers as your team, send your quarterback in for a rushing touchdown and watch as the computerized Kaepernick gives that signature bicep kiss to the Nes Andrion tattoo faithfully recreated on his digital arm.

And it's time now for All Tech Considered. Do you agree to the terms of service? For most of us the answer is yes, after blindly scrolling down to the bottom to check the box. We have to if we want to use that cool new software we just downloaded or that smartphone we just bought. But what exactly are we agreeing to? Many of us don't know and don't care until it affects us directly, especially when it comes to privacy. And one of the more recent dustups has been around Facebook's new messenger app. REED ALBERGOTTI: Basically, Facebook Messenger is the same thing as sending a Facebook message right within Facebook. But it's a separate app with some different features. CORNISH: That's Reed Albergotti. He covers Facebook for The Wall Street Journal, talking about Facebook's new feature for mobile phones. ALBERGOTTI: A lot of people, when they downloaded the Facebook Messenger app, especially in the Android operating system, they realized that they were being asked to give Facebook permission to access all sorts of things. CORNISH: Things such as your microphone, camera and location. That's when people started complaining to Facebook. They had downloaded something and agreed to the terms to use it, but they hadn't realized until later all the things it could possibly do. ALBERGOTTI: I mean, Facebook has amassed the largest store of data, of personalized information about people, in the history of the world. Nobody, not even the NSA, has this much data stored on servers about people. So I think that's one of the reasons these privacy concerns flare up about Facebook from time to time - because I don't think most people realize really what they're giving up. CORNISH: And, of course, it's not just Facebook. We agree all the time to terms for software and websites, and we do it blindly. Why do we have these boxes to click on, anyway? For that, we turn to Omri Ben Shahar. He teaches contract law at the University of Chicago. He's co-author of the book, \"More Than You Wanted To Know: The Failure Of Mandated Disclosure. \" Welcome to the program. OMRI BEN SHAHAR: Happy to be here, Audie. CORNISH: So the idea of mandated disclosure people might recognize as the terms and conditions. And you've studied this issue, at one point actually printing out the Apple iTunes contract, right? What did that look like? SHAHAR: Yes, after I received one of their new versions on my iPhone. When I scrolled down and it said, page 1 of 55, I emailed it to myself, printed it out, and it looked like a 30-feet long monster of eight-point font. So to display its enormity, I hung it from the roof of the building of University of Chicago Library, for all to see, to try to exhibit the length and the pointlessness of trying to read the disclosure that we receive from all sorts of services. CORNISH: Pointless, even for an expert in contract law? SHAHAR: It is pointless, probably even for the lawyers that drafted it because when I looked at that particular version, I found many typos. It looked like probably not even the disclosers read their own texts carefully. CORNISH: Now, there's actually a little legal history behind that popup box - right? - like the idea that hey, before you go any further, you've got to click yay or nay. SHAHAR: There's actually a very interesting decision by then-Judge Sonia Sotomayor, before she became a Supreme Court justice. In the early days of the Internet, when we all used the program - I don't know if you remember it - Netscape Navigator. CORNISH: Yes, of course. (Laughter). SHAHAR: Yep. So Netscape invented one of these data harvesting devices. But it wanted people's agreement. The problem is that their lawyers did not advise them to get expressed agreement by these mechanical clicks of, I agree. Instead, they only explained what they're doing in a link. And the link, Judge Sotomayor held, was not conspicuous enough. So people were denied the opportunity to give meaningful agreement to that. And I think most businesses learn that if they want to make sure they are not subject to lawsuits, they have to get these agreements through the I agree click. CORNISH: Now, what's wrong with doing it this way? I mean, yes, it's annoying. Yes, we should probably read them. But what's damaging about it? SHAHAR: There's nothing wrong. It's a very minor annoyance. But there's also nothing good. We know from studies that nobody reads it. And when I say nobody, I'm not rounding up a small number to zero. CORNISH: (Laughter). SHAHAR: The actual - the number is actually zero. So this is a fiction of informed consent. And if we think that there are reasons to protect people, to help them make meaningful choices, this particular regime is failing. CORNISH: What are some of the alternatives that will, A - let consumers know what they're getting into, right? SHAHAR: Yes. CORNISH: And corporations don't want to be sued. I mean, what's the next option? SHAHAR: Well, I think to know what the solution has to be, we have to understand if there is a problem here. And so far, the problem of websites collecting people's information seems a bit abstract. We don't have actual victims who say, look what happened to me and ask for some kind of legal protection. CORNISH: But you - you did say earlier that corporations are trying to protect themselves legally, right? I mean, they must perceive a problem, then. SHAHAR: They perceive the problem that they might be sued for using people's private information without consent. And because of that, they try to protect themselves to avoid lawsuits. But in the area of data collection and privacy concerns, it seems that what's going on in this market is a grand bargain. The businesses give you these fantastic services, Google Search, Facebook and many other things, for free. You, in return, give us the information, and we commercialize it by selling it to advertisers and sending you targeted ads. Now, if you don't like it, you don't have to use our service. This is how we do it. If you're very sophisticated and you don't like it, there are ways in which you can opt out. You can pay probably up to a hundred dollars a year to all sorts of online services that will anonymize you. But for many people, the bargain is a great bargain. They don't really care that much about a hypothetical dignitary effect of having their information stored by someone. And at the same time, they like very much that they don't have to pay. CORNISH: Sounds like you're saying we shouldn't bother reading those terms and conditions. SHAHAR: Oh, absolute not - don't even try. You don't have enough time in the year. Don't feel guilty about it. What you should do is follow some of these watchdog and watch groups that circulate information about particularly annoying new practices, like the one that you mentioned that Facebook is launching. And in the past, this kind of consumer pushback has led Facebook and Google and others to scale back their aggressive data harvesting practices. To the extent that something truly upsets a large number of consumers, we see that this - the mechanism forces businesses to respond to consumer demand. CORNISH: Omri Ben Shahar. He teaches contract law at the University of Chicago. He's also co-author of the book, \"More Than You Wanted To Know : The Failure Of Mandated Disclosure. \" Thanks so much for talking with us. SHAHAR: It's been a pleasure. CORNISH: OK, one note for you privacy hawks who just know there are keys to look for in that gobbledygook, if only you could understand it. For you, there's Jonathan Zittrain, law professor at Harvard. He says you can look for certain things in a website's privacy policy. JONATHAN ZITTRAIN: It will be important to see if that site reserves the right to sell your data or provide it to third parties that it selects. CORNISH: And Zittrain says if you want your computer to warn you about less-than-kosher policies, you can download a plug-in called Disconnect. ZITTRAIN: It will have, ahead of time, parsed that ridiculously long terms of service. And it will purport to give you red flags if there's something within it that isn't normal. CORNISH: Then again, even Disconnect has its own terms of use. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. And it's time now for All Tech Considered. Do you agree to the terms of service? For most of us the answer is yes, after blindly scrolling down to the bottom to check the box. We have to if we want to use that cool new software we just downloaded or that smartphone we just bought. But what exactly are we agreeing to? Many of us don't know and don't care until it affects us directly, especially when it comes to privacy. And one of the more recent dustups has been around Facebook's new messenger app. REED ALBERGOTTI: Basically, Facebook Messenger is the same thing as sending a Facebook message right within Facebook. But it's a separate app with some different features. CORNISH: That's Reed Albergotti. He covers Facebook for The Wall Street Journal, talking about Facebook's new feature for mobile phones. ALBERGOTTI: A lot of people, when they downloaded the Facebook Messenger app, especially in the Android operating system, they realized that they were being asked to give Facebook permission to access all sorts of things. CORNISH: Things such as your microphone, camera and location. That's when people started complaining to Facebook. They had downloaded something and agreed to the terms to use it, but they hadn't realized until later all the things it could possibly do. ALBERGOTTI: I mean, Facebook has amassed the largest store of data, of personalized information about people, in the history of the world. Nobody, not even the NSA, has this much data stored on servers about people. So I think that's one of the reasons these privacy concerns flare up about Facebook from time to time - because I don't think most people realize really what they're giving up. CORNISH: And, of course, it's not just Facebook. We agree all the time to terms for software and websites, and we do it blindly. Why do we have these boxes to click on, anyway? For that, we turn to Omri Ben Shahar. He teaches contract law at the University of Chicago. He's co-author of the book, \"More Than You Wanted To Know: The Failure Of Mandated Disclosure. \" Welcome to the program. OMRI BEN SHAHAR: Happy to be here, Audie. CORNISH: So the idea of mandated disclosure people might recognize as the terms and conditions. And you've studied this issue, at one point actually printing out the Apple iTunes contract, right? What did that look like? SHAHAR: Yes, after I received one of their new versions on my iPhone. When I scrolled down and it said, page 1 of 55, I emailed it to myself, printed it out, and it looked like a 30-feet long monster of eight-point font. So to display its enormity, I hung it from the roof of the building of University of Chicago Library, for all to see, to try to exhibit the length and the pointlessness of trying to read the disclosure that we receive from all sorts of services.

We've heard the story before but this time the implications could be more worrisome. Actress Jennifer Lawrence and model Kate Upton are the - among the latest who've been hacked. Intimate photos of dozens of celebrities - all of them women, were posted yesterday on the anonymous website 4chan. The thinking is that the hacker or hackers got into the celebrities iCloud accounts, but Apple released a statement today saying none of the cases resulted from any breach of its systems, including iCloud or Find My iPhone. We're going to talk more about this with Matthew Green. He teaches computer science at Johns Hopkins University and specializes in information security. Welcome to the program. MATTHEW GREEN: Thank you. BLOCK: So Matthew, Apple is saying it is outraged by this. They call it a very targeted attack on usernames, passwords and security questions. But again they say not a breach of its systems. How do you read that? GREEN: Well, I think that word breach is a - is a kind of a technical term and here it's being used in a very specific way. The way I world read this is that they're saying there's no fundamental error or flaw in their system that's allowing people to go in and scoop out massive amounts of data. What they're saying is that the hackers in this case, if there are hackers against iCloud, what they did is they guessed passwords and they guessed security questions and they were able to compromise just these specific accounts. BLOCK: And isn't the idea though that you should be able to - if you try passwords too many times you get locked out? I mean, that happens to me all the time, when I forget my password it tells me, sorry your time is up. GREEN: Well, so this is actually an interesting part of the story. So, usually there is a lockout. You get three or five chances and then you're locked out and that means that even if you have a pretty bad password most people won't be able to guess your password after three or five attempts. Up until recently there was actually a bit of a bug in some of Apple's systems that allowed people to go in and guess as many times as they wanted - even run programs that would run through every possible password they could think up and see if they got one that was a match. Now it's not clear from this press release if Apple is denying that that particular bug was exploited here or if they just got very lucky in the three or five attempts that they had to make a guess. BLOCK: There is also this issue, that this whole thing raises, which is that some of the people who were victimized here had deleted photographs on their iPhones but those photos still exist in the cloud. GREEN: So, this is one of the hardest things. I mean, we have backups of our phone and by default when you buy an iPhone it will ask you to make a backup. When you delete things from your phone, usually you're doing that on purpose. You want it to go away. But right now the way the cloud works is it doesn't know that. It keeps copies of things as a back, for a long time potentially. That means they're vulnerable to hackers or anybody else who might want to get their hands on them. BLOCK: So, if you're vulnerable how can you do your best to protect the data that you do have? GREEN: Well, right now we don't have great solutions but the number one thing is pick a very good password, even if that means it's a little bit of hassle to enter it. The number two thing is, you know, be aware of what you're putting on your phone. And the number three thing - which is a  bit of inconvenient, is try something called, two factor authentication.  What that does is it means that Apple will send you, for example, a text message every time somebody tries to log into your account and only the person who receives that text message will be able to continue and login.

I Arun Rath. Thanks to a bunch of extremely popular online dating sites there's a growing mountain of data about how we hook up, date and generally judge people we don't know. Christian Rudder is the co-founder of the dating site OkCupid. In his new book, \"Dataclysm\" he looks at the information OkCupid and other sites gather from their users and tries to reveal the gap between what people say and they do. Christian welcome to the program. CHRISTIAN RUDDER: Thank you. I'm very happy to be here. RATH: There are a lot of very interesting charts and graphs in this book. So, I want to start with one that shows the average length of messages people post on OkCupid. You show that messages now are about just a third as long as they were back in 2005. What happened? Well, I mean smartphones happened basically and OkCupid developed a App and people started typing on their phones, which just kind of in a physical sense is harder but also it's just more chatty, I guess. You don't have a keyboard, it's very hard to go back and edit all this kind of stuff. So, it's a lot more concise. RATH: One of the nicer surprises in this book for me was that shorter messages don't necessarily mean that the writing is bad or getting worse. Can you talk about how Twitter compares with Shakespeare? (Laughter)RUDDER: Yes, of course. I looked at a large sample of tweets and looked at the average word length in tweets and of course, you know, the first blush would be, you know, with all the abbreviations like, U, for Y-O-U, and thx, you know T-H -X, - that there would be shorter words on Twitter and I found that just wasn't the case. They were longer, not only in Shakespearean English also in kind of long form journalism. It's much shorter obviously because there's only 140 characters but it is just as robust in a certain sense, that it's the kind of an unfettered writing environment. RATH: You spend a lot of time in the book on race. Some really fascinating stuff because your tracking what people are actually doing and saying as opposed to what they might think or profess in other ways. What were the biggest surprises that you found? RUDDER: All the data on race that I have is from dating, but on these sites black users especially, there's a bias against them. Every kind of way you can measure their success on a site. How people rate them, how often they reply to their messages, how many messages they get, it's all reduced and so I obviously race is always a topic in this country but especially now with Ferguson. It's such a emotional issue and it's rare that you can find data that speaks of how one person of whatever race treats another person of race and an aggregate and kind of measurable kind of way. And so online data is very good at that and specifically dating data because it's all just strangers mixing with each other. And the whole premise of a dating site is to judge people. And so you really are able to tease that out free of any sort of off-line social constraints. You know, your friends don't know what you do a dating site, like they do know what you do on Facebook. So, that's why I relied so heavily dating data for that chapter. RATH: You found that, you know, people who might say that, no, I'm racist, but in the aggregate the numbers are showing something different. They're revealing clear racial biases. RUDDER: Oh yeah of course. When you ask anybody directly, I mean, you know, even if it's just a computer asking the question, you know, people are like, oh yeah, interracial marriage is great. I don't care what race my match is, you know all that stuff you'd expect a kind of decent forward thinking person to say. But when you actually are observing passively what they're doing, when they don't think you're keeping track, you see a totally different story. RATH: Well, this kind of brings us to the political culture. What do you find there - is the country as polarized as it looks on cable news? (Laughter)RUDDER: Well, in the book I do look at speech patterns and political speech in particular and found that certainly if you look at divisive speech that is increasing and that does correlate to kind of more gerrymandered political consciousness in the country. RATH: So, what does that mean? Like on your dating site are Republicans likely to date Democrats or does that not happen? RUDDER: (Laughter) Oh. Well, on OkCupid, I mean we have found that the thing that matters the most is whether you care about politics one way or the other. If you're ambivalent you will have a hard time relating to I assume someone who's passionate whether it's red or blue. RATH: With all this data from a dating site you write about attractiveness. When you break down the data, what have you learned about what men and women think about attractiveness when they're dating? RUDDER: Well, age is a huge variable in online dating. Women generally like a guy to be the same age as them - up until the guy's hit about 40. Then when you flip it around, when you look at how men perceive women, it is pretty much just straight ticket vote for 20, which is the lowest age that I looked at in my dataset. So, you know, even 45 year old guys will rate 20-year-old women the best. It's very pervasive opinion among - at least the people on OkCupid. RATH: So, the data confirmed men are in fact creepy. (Laughter)RUDDER: Yeah or dreamers. Either one, how ever you want to look at it. I mean what happens is - this is just measuring people's opinions not what they actually go out and do, what you see when you actually look at what people do, you see the realisms set end. So, what these 40-year-old guys who, yeah, you know, that they - 20-year-old girls are the 21-year-old girls. The people they actually have the courage to actually is a lot older. It's 30, 35-year-old women. RATH: So, Christian if I asked you to make a value judgment, because you clearly love diving into all this time, and we'll leave aside government intrusion, but just collecting all this data, tons and tons of info from various companies, is getting all this information about ourselves good or bad? RUDDER: Oh, I mean I definitely think it's good. I think to speak to your sort of complicate concern about privacy, for sure, I mean, you know all of this data, everything in the book and generally anything that you read online about people's behavior on sites is all aggregated and anonymous. Nobody's looking at your personal account, but when we put all this stuff together you're able to look at people in a way the people have never been able to look at people before. You know, like you have millions and millions of people living their lives through an interface that records what they're doing as they live. And, you know, look there's no way OkCupid, Facebook, Twitter, these sites even added altogether can stand in for the entirety of the human condition. People do all kinds of thing that don't do online. But they're doing fewer and fewer things that they don't do online and it's the beginning of I think a revolution in how social science and behavioral science are done. RATH: Christian Rudder is a co-founder of the online dating site OkCupid. His new book is, \"Dataclysm: Who We Are When We Think No One Is Watching. \" Christian Rudder, thank you.

They were longer, not only in Shakespearean English also in kind of long form journalism. It's much shorter obviously because there's only 140 characters but it is just as robust in a certain sense, that it's the kind of an unfettered writing environment. RATH: You spend a lot of time in the book on race. Some really fascinating stuff because your tracking what people are actually doing and saying as opposed to what they might think or profess in other ways. What were the biggest surprises that you found? RUDDER: All the data on race that I have is from dating, but on these sites black users especially, there's a bias against them. Every kind of way you can measure their success on a site. How people rate them, how often they reply to their messages, how many messages they get, it's all reduced and so I obviously race is always a topic in this country but especially now with Ferguson. It's such a emotional issue and it's rare that you can find data that speaks of how one person of whatever race treats another person of race and an aggregate and kind of measurable kind of way. And so online data is very good at that and specifically dating data because it's all just strangers mixing with each other. And the whole premise of a dating site is to judge people. And so you really are able to tease that out free of any sort of off-line social constraints. You know, your friends don't know what you do a dating site, like they do know what you do on Facebook. So, that's why I relied so heavily dating data for that chapter. RATH: You found that, you know, people who might say that, no, I'm racist, but in the aggregate the numbers are showing something different. They're revealing clear racial biases. RUDDER: Oh yeah of course. When you ask anybody directly, I mean, you know, even if it's just a computer asking the question, you know, people are like, oh yeah, interracial marriage is great. I don't care what race my match is, you know all that stuff you'd expect a kind of decent forward thinking person to say. But when you actually are observing passively what they're doing, when they don't think you're keeping track, you see a totally different story. RATH: Well, this kind of brings us to the political culture. What do you find there - is the country as polarized as it looks on cable news? (Laughter) RUDDER: Well, in the book I do look at speech patterns and political speech in particular and found that certainly if you look at divisive speech that is increasing and that does correlate to kind of more gerrymandered political consciousness in the country. RATH: So, what does that mean? Like on your dating site are Republicans likely to date Democrats or does that not happen? RUDDER: (Laughter) Oh. Well, on OkCupid, I mean we have found that the thing that matters the most is whether you care about politics one way or the other. If you're ambivalent you will have a hard time relating to I assume someone who's passionate whether it's red or blue. RATH: With all this data from a dating site you write about attractiveness. When you break down the data, what have you learned about what men and women think about attractiveness when they're dating? RUDDER: Well, age is a huge variable in online dating. Women generally like a guy to be the same age as them - up until the guy's hit about 40. Then when you flip it around, when you look at how men perceive women, it is pretty much just straight ticket vote for 20, which is the lowest age that I looked at in my dataset. So, you know, even 45 year old guys will rate 20-year-old women the best. It's very pervasive opinion among - at least the people on OkCupid. RATH: So, the data confirmed men are in fact creepy. (Laughter) RUDDER: Yeah or dreamers. Either one, how ever you want to look at it. I mean what happens is - this is just measuring people's opinions not what they actually go out and do, what you see when you actually look at what people do, you see the realisms set end. So, what these 40-year-old guys who, yeah, you know, that they - 20-year-old girls are the 21-year-old girls. The people they actually have the courage to actually is a lot older. It's 30, 35-year-old women. RATH: So, Christian if I asked you to make a value judgment, because you clearly love diving into all this time, and we'll leave aside government intrusion, but just collecting all this data, tons and tons of info from various companies, is getting all this information about ourselves good or bad? RUDDER: Oh, I mean I definitely think it's good. I think to speak to your sort of complicate concern about privacy, for sure, I mean, you know all of this data, everything in the book and generally anything that you read online about people's behavior on sites is all aggregated and anonymous. Nobody's looking at your personal account, but when we put all this stuff together you're able to look at people in a way the people have never been able to look at people before. You know, like you have millions and millions of people living their lives through an interface that records what they're doing as they live. And, you know, look there's no way OkCupid, Facebook, Twitter, these sites even added altogether can stand in for the entirety of the human condition. People do all kinds of thing that don't do online. But they're doing fewer and fewer things that they don't do online and it's the beginning of I think a revolution in how social science and behavioral science are done. RATH: Christian Rudder is a co-founder of the online dating site OkCupid. His new book is, \"Dataclysm: Who We Are When We Think No One Is Watching. \" Christian Rudder, thank you.

From notifications on the kind of communication side, through to the more health and fitness-based things. So activity trackers, heart monitors and so forth. SIMON: That you wear. ARTHUR: That you wear, exactly. So I mean, historically we've kind of seen, over the past couple of years, lots happening in the sports-based. And those largely have been wristbands. But it's become a lot more feminine in the last month or so. There's been a huge flurry of releases from the fashion industry. Things like necklaces, some rings, different pieces of jewelry, largely that all have these notification devices inserted in them. SIMON: And do they look geeky or chic? ARTHUR: Depends on your opinion. (Laughter). There is a mixture. I mean, there's definitely some new ones out there that are working their way - it's much further towards that chic look. I can give you an example. Opening Ceremony has just announced one that they're calling MICA, which is My Intelligent Communication Accessory. That's done with Intel. So they've got semiprecious gems in them and a kind of snakeskin pattern to them as well. But, there's still, you know, certainly a big geek element to them.

But they're moving in the right direction. SIMON: Have you seen a device there that you would actually pay money to buy and wear? ARTHUR: So I think the price tag of things makes it a very interesting discussion. I mean, Tory Burch did a collaboration with Fitbit. She has a bracelet that encases the device within it and there is also a necklace that does the same thing. Now, it's $195 for the bracelets and that's before you've got the Fitbit device, which is another 99 something dollars. So you know, we're talking about not small money here to be able to have this device. And technology does always start out a lot higher and prices do come down, inevitably.

I'm Lynn Neary. It's that time of year again. Kids are back to school, summer is coming to a close. The leaves are about to change color. And this week, Apple will release yet another new iPhone. Rumor has it there will be two models, but the biggest innovation will be bigger screens. And that's not exactly groundbreaking says New York Times tech writer Farhad Manjoo. FARHAD MANJOO: Yeah. I mean, this has been the criticism of Apple for several years now, essentially since Steve Jobs died. You know, the smartphone market basically has gotten mature. You know, every new feature you add to them, they're not going to be the main thing you do with your phone. It's going to be kind of an additional feature. The growth in the smartphone market, at the moment, is in Asian countries. That's kind of a huge new market in India. And Apple is really going after those areas. The other thing we're probably going to see this week from Apple is a completely new device, what has been rumored to be a smart watch. It's been long rumored, and, you know, it will be the first new kind of device they've released since they released the iPad pad in 2010. NEARY: Yeah. I wonder if the smart watch, though, can really get even close to just how exciting and special mobile technology seemed back in 2007 with the first iPhone. MANJOO: Yeah. It can't. So the iPhone was, in many ways, kind of a once-in-a-generation kind of technology. It was like the personal computer. The difference with the phones and with personal computers in the past is that we have phones with us all the time and we use them all the time. And the other thing is that every one of us has one. So they're individual devices. And that really expanded the market. I mean, the market for mobile phones is much, much larger than the market for personal computers. And Apple has a huge part of it. They have the most profitable segment of the smartphone market. And the watch market is not going to be the same. There's not going to be sort of another kind of devise that's like that. But the smart watch could be, you know, one of those devices that adds a nice chunk of extra money to Apple's bottom line every year. NEARY: Well, I think there's also rumors that this new phone might have mobile wallet technology where you could actually use the phone itself in lieu of a credit card or in lieu of cash. I mean, could that be a game changer if the phone does have that? MANJOO: People in the technology industry have long waited for this kind of technology. And there are many different companies that are doing this kind of electronic payment systems. And there have been so many attempts at that and so many failures that, you know, you can't really bet that Apple will be the one to change it. This industry has been one that many people have tried to conquer and then just haven't been able to. And the phenomenal problem here is that it's really easy to pay with a credit card. Like, it's not much of a hassle. So it's hard to improve upon that experience. NEARY: You've been covering smartphones for a long time. What would you like to see any company come up with in terms of the next big thing? MANJOO: Yeah. The problem that I have in my life at the moment is that I use a bunch of different devices - a computer, a phone, a tablet. And there's very little kind of coordination between them. I start one activity on my computer, and then I go to my phone. And it's hard to kind of find what I was doing. Apple has begun to work on something to do that, to kind of tie in what you're doing on your computer to what you're doing on your phone. Google is doing so as well. But I think that that is sort of the next major area of innovation that I would like to see. We all are going to be using more and more devices, but so far, there's no kind of great way to make moving between them kind of seamless. And I really hope that that's kind of the place that they focus their innovation on. NEARY: Farhad Manjoo writes about technology for The New York Times.

KERA's Lauren Silverman visited the new control center at Dallas headquarters. LAUREN SILVERMAN, BYLINE: In a glass-enclosed command center, nine Southwest employees are sitting in front of double monitors furiously tweeting and Facebooking. ASHLEY PETTIT: So on average, we're receiving about 3,100 mentions of our company every single day across the social web. SILVERMAN: Ashley Pettit is with Southwest.

That's what makes this social media command center stand out. It's directly connected to the real flight command center. PETTIT: So any cities or locations that have severe weather - if there are any significant flight delays, we're able to see those as they happen. That allows us to be more proactive in responding to customers. So before they turn to Twitter or Facebook to ask us what's going on, we have all that information. SILVERMAN: Social care representatives - yes, that's what they're called - say this technology makes it possible to solve problems without having to wait in line or on hold. Shannon Whitney says a few days ago someone called in a complaint the old-fashioned way only to find out. . . PETTIT: His 15-year-old son had already tweeted at us, and we had already filed a complaint, issued compensation, taken care of the whole thing.

SILVERMAN: Major international airlines like KLM have more than 130 people on their social media team dealing with complaints, comments and compliments within an hour. And that's in addition to their call center. Shashank Nigam, CEO of strategy firm SimpliFlying, says not every airline has to hire so many social media mavens. New technology and GPS tracking could help streamline by prioritizing comments. SHASHANK NIGAM: You know, if someone asks Southwest Airlines hey, when are you starting a new flight to Bali? You know, that's not as relevant a question to be replied in real time as someone who's at a gate and says, I'm about to miss my flight. Can you please help me out? SILVERMAN: And get this - social media can also help airlines identify who's an important, high net worth customer. Here's Ragy Thomas. THOMAS: And that's where the real magic happens because you can quickly find out this is a high net worth customer for us. We have had three issues in the last three weeks. And now maybe I should just get permission from my manager to give her an upgrade on the flight and communicate that to ground personnel so that when she checks in, you know, she's just being told that you've been upgraded.

Instead of reaching for a credit card, you would store your credit card information on your phone and wave your phone near the register when it's time to pay.

Swiping doesn't take that long, and Americans do it round-the-clock. But Apple's CEO Tim Cook says it's got to stop.

SHAHANI: Cook says it's time for a world without plastic, without 16 digits for all eyes to see and a magnetic stripe. COOK: Which, by the way, is five decades old. SHAHANI: A world without those security codes on the back. COOK: Which, all of us know, aren't so secure. SHAHANI: Cook unveiled a new product that he says will forever change the way we buy. It's not called iPay. It's Apple Pay, and starting next month, it'll let iPhone users tap just once to buy headphones online, a purse at the mall, or a Big Mac at the McDonald's drive-through. Apple is partnering with Visa, MasterCard and American Express as well as the biggest banks, which together cover more than 80 percent of credit card purchases in the US. And Apple is opening up a new revenue stream because it'll get a small cut from the transactions. BEN MILNE: It's actually kind of an entrance into a market earlier than Apple usually makes. Mobile payments is still a relatively new thing. SHAHANI: Ben Milne is CEO of the mobile payment company Dwolla. Lots of companies like his and Square and PayPal have tried to make online shopping easier. But Milne says the credit card giants have been really slow to adapt to the realities of the Internet. They keep expecting customers to type a lot, and customers end up abandoning their shopping carts. Apple could be big enough to jolt the payment networks into making it easier, maybe getting rid of physical credit cards altogether. MILNE: Apple's one of the few companies in the world that can do that, not only because they understand user behavior but because they have such a mass of existing customers that are not likely to jump ship and go to another platform. SHAHANI: The new payment system could also help fix a lingering security problem. Carl Livitt, a security researcher with the firm Bishop Fox, says if Apple does a solid job of implementing this new mobile wallet, which he believes they can, it'll block the kind of credit card hacking that's hit Target, Home Depot and other major retailers. CARL LIVITT: The existing type of hacks that we're seeing rely on breaking into the merchant, compromising the swipe card machines that take your credit card information. SHAHANI: Google has a mobile wallet that stores credit card information. But Apple does not do that. Apple Pay stores a unique ID that's scrambled up with encryption inside a locker in the phone. If the phone is stolen, you just suspend the service, and there's no need to replace your cards. When you want to make a purchase, the phone communicates with the bank to get a token. The phone gives that token to the merchant. LIVITT: And then the merchant would be able to send that token back to the bank as confirmation that you had said, yes, I honestly want to buy this item, thereby completing the circle. And nobody, at any point, actually gets to see your credit card data. SHAHANI: And even if the token gets stolen, it's just for one-time use. It's not good for your next purchase or for the black market. Aarti Shahani, NPR News, San Francisco. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Apple unveiled new products yesterday, including the latest-model iPhones. Apple also announced a shiny new watch. It said this watch can be used to read Twitter. It also tracks your heart rate. This watch is so amazing, it even tells time. Another Apple announcement is meant to change the way we pay for products when shopping. Instead of reaching for a credit card, you would store your credit card information on your phone and wave your phone near the register when it's time to pay. The technology is known as the mobile wallet. NPR's Aarti Shahani reports. AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: You might be very happy with your plastic credit card or happy enough with it. Swiping doesn't take that long, and Americans do it round-the-clock. But Apple's CEO Tim Cook says it's got to stop.

And, Adam, you are up next. Can you introduce yourself? ADAM SAVAGE: All right. My name is Adam Savage. I am currently cohost and executive producer of \"MythBusters\" on the Discovery Channel, and I'm a lifelong maker of things and curious person. RAZ: So, I mean, does curiosity, like, run in your family? SAVAGE: You know, my dad was definitely a polymath. He was a painter. He was an animator, a filmmaker, a wonderful writer. But I'm trying to think if there was a moment I had - you know, he did make me a race car. I had this teddy bear named Gus, and I wanted a racecar for it. And my dad spent weeks out in his studio making this thing out of hardware cloth, like wire mesh you'd make a hamster cage out of, and fiberglass - polyester fiberglass, which I still consider one of the worst material to have to work with. And just the act of, I'm interested in a toy, I can make that toy, that's what he said to me by giving that to me. He didn't know how to do it. He was just winging it. And that was completely formative for me. RAZ: And like his dad, Adam's a maker. He's designed models and props for big films. But you may know him best from the TV show \"MythBusters,\" where he and his cohost, Jamie Hyneman, test out questions like, if you drop a penny off the Empire State building, would it kill someone? SAVAGE: We realized that the strongest episodes were the ones driven by the narrative of our curiosity, you know. That is the nature of science. It's often that you - you know, the discovery is not the end of a line of looking for something. It's tangential to it because something happens you didn't expect. Someone said that the phrase that typifies real discovery isn't, eureka, but, huh, that's funny. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MYTHBUSTERS\")JAMIE HYNEMAN: OK, go ahead, Adam. RAZ: Has there been an episode where, like, the outcome was not at all what you expected? SAVAGE: Yeah, there's a really good example. There's a myth about a guy who got very drunk at a party and convinced a friend of his to drive him home, except the problem was his friend was legally blind. But they got home because he gave his blind friend directions from the back seat. RAZ: Yeah. SAVAGE: So Jamie and I actually got a real blind guy. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MYTHBUSTERS\")SAVAGE: Jerry's 100 percent blind. We put him in the front seat of a car while we sat in the back on a closed course, of course. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MYTHBUSTERS\")HYNEMAN: Start to brake. Now turn hard left. Perfect. SAVAGE: But to really tell the story, we needed to have a drunk person. So Jamie got drunk. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MYTHBUSTERS\")HYNEMAN: Floor it. (Laughter) He knows better than to listen to me. SAVAGE: And the most astonishing thing happened that we did not expect at all was that Jamie's directions. . . (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MYTHBUSTERS\")HYNEMAN: Straight now. Right, right, right, right, right, right. SAVAGE: . . . Immediately made the blind guy drive like a drunk person. RAZ: Wow. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MYTHBUSTERS\")SAVAGE: I swear, he is weaving a lot more around the road. It's like - oh. Behind the car, it was totally clear that there was a drunk person in charge of the car. (Laughter) That's one of my all-time favorite results. RAZ: OK, so nobody exactly won a prize for that experiment. But the point is Adam checked out a weird idea, and he discovered something kind of interesting. And nobody got hurt. Here's Adam on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SAVAGE: One of the funny things about owning a brain is that you have no control over the things that it gathers and holds onto, the facts and the stories. And as you get older, it only gets worse. Things stick around for years sometimes before you understand why you're interested in them, before you understand they're important to you. When Richard Feynman was a young boy in Queens, he went for a walk with his dad and his wagon and a ball. And he noticed that when he pulled the wagon, the ball went to the back of the wagon. And he asked his dad, why does the ball go to the back of the wagon? And his dad said, that's inertia. He said, what's inertia? And his dad said, ah, inertia is the name that scientists give to the phenomenon of the ball going to the back of the wagon. (LAUGHTER)SAVAGE: But in truth, nobody really knows. Feynman went on to earn degrees at MIT, Princeton. He saw the Challenger disaster, and he ended up winning the Nobel Prize in physics for his Feynman diagrams describing the movement of subatomic particles. And he credits that conversation with his father as giving him a sense that the simplest questions could carry you out to the edge of human knowledge and that that's where he wanted to play, and play he did. RAZ: I mean, I think about this story, and you think, like, if Feynman wasn't that kid, if he didn't have that sense of curiosity, could he have gone on to do what he did? Like, it's almost like he had to ask those questions. He had to be the kind of person. SAVAGE: Yeah, I mean, he had the brain. He had the brain that totally wanted to exercise itself. There's another story about Feynman of him cooking a spaghetti dinner with a friend. And his friend, as he's breaking the spaghetti to put it in the pot, he notices that the strands of dry spaghetti don't just break cleanly in half, that there's often a third piece that springs out between the other two. RAZ: Yeah. SAVAGE: And from a material science standpoint, that is a strange behavior. And as the story goes, they never got to eat it. They ended up breaking every piece of pasta they could find in the house to try and figure out why the molecular structure of pasta led it to do this weird thing where it broke a third piece off. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SAVAGE: This is what really gets me going about science. Whenever I'm having trouble understanding a concept, I go back, and I research the people that discovered that concept. I look at the story of how they came to understand it. And what happens when you look at what the discoverers were thinking about when they made their discoveries is you understand that they are not so different from us. We are all bags of meat and water. We all start with the same tools. I love the idea that different branches of science are called fields of study. Most people think of science as a closed, black box. And in fact, it is an open field. RAZ: Do you, like, see the process of discovery as almost like a journey rather than a place that you need to get to to figure it out? SAVAGE: Oh, that's 110 percent. There is no end. There is no point at which you think, well, I'm done. There is the chasing the moment of interest and turning it into a moment of understanding, however small. RAZ: I mean, I guess I'm always amazed, like, when you talk to a child - right? - they're full of questions about just the universe, about everything around them, about why cars move and how they move and how a telephone works. . . SAVAGE: Right. RAZ: . . . And all these questions that, at a certain point in our lives, they're not answered. But we just accept that there's unanswered questions, and we move on. But, like, that's sort of sad defeat on the part of us adults, don't you think? SAVAGE: Yes, and I was very lucky that in high school I had two science teachers that were really influential on me. One was my freshman earth science teacher who, he would say things in class that would rock my world. And I was a lonely kid. I didn't have much to do at lunch, so I would go back to his classroom which was right across the hall from the lunch room. And I would sit there and just ask him questions. And this is - I like to say, this is so long ago, he was sitting there in an off-period, grading papers and smoking in the classroom. RAZ: (Laughter). SAVAGE: But he would sit and answer questions. And then, you know, any line of questioning leads to the ultimate I-don't-know. . . . RAZ: Yeah. SAVAGE: . . . Because we don't know. . . RAZ: We don't know. SAVAGE: . . . The most fundmental. . . RAZ: Right. SAVAGE: . . . Parts of everything. RAZ: Or sometimes, when you do have the answer, and your 5-year-old says, that's not true, you just say, well, if you don't think it's true, stop asking me. SAVAGE: (Laughter) And this teacher would sit there, and when I got to the end of line of questioning, he'd say, I have no idea. I don't know why the flame - I don't know why a candle flame goes pop when you flick it with your finger. RAZ: Yeah. SAVAGE: And for a teacher to say that to a kid is really important. It's actually critical for kids to learn that the people in authority don't know everything - in fact, really don't know anything. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SAVAGE: We are all explorers. The people that made discoveries just thought a little bit harder about what they were looking at, and they were a little bit more curious. And their curiosity changed the way people thought about the world, and thus it changed the world. They changed the world, and so can you. Thank you. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: Adam Savage is a cohost of the show \"MythBusters. \" Check out his two talks at ted. npr. org. Oh, and in case you were wondering what does happen if you drop a penny off the Empire State building. . . (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MYTHBUSTERS\")HYNEMAN: Three, two, one. SAVAGE: Ow. (Laughter) That didn't actually hurt that much. RAZ: Our show today, From Curiosity To Discovery, how it begins, how we keep it alive in ourselves. Stay with us.

I'm Lynn Neary. Imagine a world 700 years into the future. Aliens are taking over the galaxy. You are on a mission to save the last city on earth. But. . . (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEOGAME, \"DESTINY\")UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: If you fail, everything you know, everything humans have ever known, will be gone forever. NEARY: That's a clip from \"Destiny,\" one of the most hyped video games of the year - some say of the decade. It sold more than $500 million worth of copies on the first day of release. Joining us now from KQED in San Francisco is Adam Sessler. He's a gaming expert and president of Theory-Head Inc. , a media and entertainment consulting company. Welcome to the program. ADAM SESSLER: Oh, it's my pleasure. NEARY: So first of all, describe this game for us. SESSLER: That should be an easy thing to do, but what they've attempted with \"Destiny\" is to kind of take different types of genres - the shooter genre that probably people are very familiar with from the science-fiction game \"Halo\" and from the \"Call Of Duty\" franchise. And another type of game is called an MMO - that means a massively multiplayer online game. And that's when thousands of people are playing on a server in real-time with one another. They brought the two together as a hybrid. So it's a shooter that you're playing with many people at the same time. NEARY: So is this something completely new? SESSLER: I wouldn't say it's completely new. Most people who are playing the game are already recognizing elements from other games. It's kind of the awkward hybridization that is trying to make it sort of fresh and innovative. NEARY: I know you've been playing the game for a few days now. Has it lived up to your expectations? SESSLER: To be honest, I would have to say it doesn't. And at the same time, those expectations - not just for myself, but I think for many people that follow the videogame industry - were very, very high. It's quite entertaining. It's very fun to shoot aliens. But at the same time, there's not much there. You see all these elements, but it doesn't have much of a story. The inclusion of Peter Dinklage, that I think most people know from \"Game Of Thrones\" - he's kind of your guide through the game. And he seems about as baffled by the dialogue he's reading as most people are when they're playing it. NEARY: Well, we have a clip from the game that includes Peter Dinklage's voice. Let's hear some of that. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEOGAME, \"DESTINY\")PETER DINKLAGE: Congratulations. Humans haven't been on the moon in hundreds of years. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Nice place to visit, but I wouldn't want to live here. DINKLAGE: Dying here is much more likely. NEARY: So he's only one of some very high profile people who were involved with this game. Paul McCartney helped with the score. Are big-name celebrities like that becoming increasingly involved in the creation of these games? SESSLER: You are seeing sort of more celebrities move into video games. In fact later this year, the new \"Call Of Duty\" game features Kevin Spacey. And in this case, the character really looks like Kevin Spacey. The inclusion of Paul McCartney is a curious one. He helped out with the music which is actually quite exceptional throughout the game.

I love Paul McCartney's music, but in this kind of machismo and science-fiction universe, the song that plays at the end seems more appropriate for something that has a dramatic flourish where maybe the two lovers find themselves, you know, and they go on for a happy existence, not in this world that's quite dire with the end of humanity at stake.

LYNN NEARY, HOST:  This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. I'm Lynn Neary. Imagine a world 700 years into the future. Aliens are taking over the galaxy. You are on a mission to save the last city on earth. But. . . (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEOGAME, \"DESTINY\") UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: If you fail, everything you know, everything humans have ever known, will be gone forever. NEARY: That's a clip from \"Destiny,\" one of the most hyped video games of the year - some say of the decade. It sold more than $500 million worth of copies on the first day of release. Joining us now from KQED in San Francisco is Adam Sessler. He's a gaming expert and president of Theory-Head Inc. , a media and entertainment consulting company. Welcome to the program. ADAM SESSLER: Oh, it's my pleasure. NEARY: So first of all, describe this game for us. SESSLER: That should be an easy thing to do, but what they've attempted with \"Destiny\" is to kind of take different types of genres - the shooter genre that probably people are very familiar with from the science-fiction game \"Halo\" and from the \"Call Of Duty\" franchise. And another type of game is called an MMO - that means a massively multiplayer online game. And that's when thousands of people are playing on a server in real-time with one another. They brought the two together as a hybrid. So it's a shooter that you're playing with many people at the same time. NEARY: So is this something completely new? SESSLER: I wouldn't say it's completely new. Most people who are playing the game are already recognizing elements from other games. It's kind of the awkward hybridization that is trying to make it sort of fresh and innovative. NEARY: I know you've been playing the game for a few days now. Has it lived up to your expectations? SESSLER: To be honest, I would have to say it doesn't. And at the same time, those expectations - not just for myself, but I think for many people that follow the videogame industry - were very, very high. It's quite entertaining. It's very fun to shoot aliens. But at the same time, there's not much there. You see all these elements, but it doesn't have much of a story. The inclusion of Peter Dinklage, that I think most people know from \"Game Of Thrones\" - he's kind of your guide through the game. And he seems about as baffled by the dialogue he's reading as most people are when they're playing it. NEARY: Well, we have a clip from the game that includes Peter Dinklage's voice. Let's hear some of that. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEOGAME, \"DESTINY\") PETER DINKLAGE: Congratulations. Humans haven't been on the moon in hundreds of years. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Nice place to visit, but I wouldn't want to live here. DINKLAGE: Dying here is much more likely. NEARY: So he's only one of some very high profile people who were involved with this game. Paul McCartney helped with the score. Are big-name celebrities like that becoming increasingly involved in the creation of these games? SESSLER: You are seeing sort of more celebrities move into video games. In fact later this year, the new \"Call Of Duty\" game features Kevin Spacey. And in this case, the character really looks like Kevin Spacey. The inclusion of Paul McCartney is a curious one. He helped out with the music which is actually quite exceptional throughout the game. And he has a song that runs over the final credits which really explicates this kind of strange unease the game seems to have with itself. I love Paul McCartney's music, but in this kind of machismo and science-fiction universe, the song that plays at the end seems more appropriate for something that has a dramatic flourish where maybe the two lovers find themselves, you know, and they go on for a happy existence, not in this world that's quite dire with the end of humanity at stake.

It's a game enjoyed by many age groups. And the purchase will give Microsoft a foothold outside of its Xbox hardware and Windows phones. As NPR's Laura Sydell reports, the move displays a shift in strategy under Microsoft's new CEO. LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE: Ask Marlene Saritzky how often her 10-year-old Jake likes to play Minecraft. . . MARLENE SARITZKY: How often does he play or how often would he like to play? SYDELL: The answer is that he'd like to play a lot more than he's allowed to play. Minecraft lets players make worlds and objects, cities, ships, animals, chimerical creatures from block-like objects. Instead of the sound of shooting, Minecraft sounds like this. . . (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO GAME, MINECRAFT)SYDELL: . . . Digging and building. SARITZKY: Because of its free-form structure, I really think kids learn thinking and reasoning and creativity and logic and even some collaboration. SYDELL: Saritzky says Jake's friends come over and they play the game together. The ability to unleash this kind of creativity in virtual space has garnered Minecraft a lot of praise. And it sold 50 million copies since it hit the market in 2009, says Chelsea Stark, a game critic for the online tech site Mashable. CHELSEA STARK: It's a game that can be many things to many people. And that's a good thing. It can be a game that's accessible to children and parents. They could play together. I've even heard of Minecraft being used for projects for developing countries to kind of allow people to build their own neighborhoods with these blocks. SYDELL: For Microsoft, this is the first big purchase under its new CEO, Satya Nadella. Nadella took the helm from Steve Ballmer in February. P. J. McNealy, an analyst and founder of Digital World Research, says with this purchase, Nadella is trying to reach a broader audience for Microsoft -beyond the people who own an Xbox, a Windows phone or a PC. P. J. MCNEALY: They have much broader vision about where consumers are, which is everywhere. They're no longer deadlocked to just one device and one location. And having access to consumers, no matter where they are, no matter what device they're on and over any network, is really the new Microsoft. SYDELL: Microsoft's other big game franchise is Halo, which is a first-person shooter and one of the top-selling military science-fiction game franchises. But the demographic of gamers is changing, too. While it used to be dominated by the hard-core who loved a game like Halo, much more of the general public is playing games. MCNEALY: You're seeing a lot of people who play games like Farmville, who would never consider themselves to be gamers. People who've played on Minecraft may not consider themselves to be gamers. But the definition is broadening. And I think this is a great example of it. SYDELL: With this purchase, Microsoft is not buying the games, 35-year-old creator Markus Persson, or its top executives. Persson has often been on social media, railing against big game companies. But he also said he hasn't really been involved with Minecraft since it got really big. And now he can walk away and have plenty of money to make a lot of other small games. Laura Sydell, NPR News.

The cost of solar panels is falling rapidly - a 60 percent drop in the last three years, according to industry analysts, and that means a lot. More solar is popping up on rooftops around the country. All this comes as the United States is trying to find better ways to protect our power system from blackouts. But as Dan Boyce from member station KUNC reports, more solar does not really mean fewer blackouts, at least not yet. DAN BOYCE, BYLINE: You look at the forest on the mountainous edges of southwestern Colorado's San Luis Valley, and he sees this dull, orange hue, broad swaths of dead trees, killed by the spruce beetle. When Larry Floyd started fighting fires here in the mid-1990s, conditions were different. LARRY FLOYD: We didn't have as severe a drought. We didn't have as much bug kill. BOYCE: So there is a lot more wildfire fuel out there - those dry, dead trees. That's a concern for the tiny town of Del Norte. The San Luis Valley itself is open and flat and pretty much a desert, and Del Norte's kind of plopped right in the middle of it, far from the forest. But the town's public works supervisor, Kevin Larimore, says there is a risk to the power supply. KEVIN LARIMORE: Most of the valley is actually served off of one line coming in the valley. BOYCE: One major line coming in through the mountains, through the forest. LARIMORE: If that line was to go down, then most of the valley, I think, would lose electrical power. BOYCE: Del Norte, though, it's covered in solar panels. LARIMORE: The town hall, town shop and at the police department. BOYCE: Great. Since they're generating all this power, Del Norte's ready for a wildfire, right? Well. . . BOYCE: If there is a wildfire that knocks out the power infrastructure, these solar panels won't power the town? LARIMORE: No, to my understanding they won't. BOYCE: Weird as it sounds, Del Norte's solar panels are actually dependent on the power grid, and that's how it is with the vast majority of solar panels, says James Newcomb. He's with a renewable energy think tank, the Rocky Mountain Institute in Boulder, Colorado. He gives as an example hurricane Sandy, thrashing the East Coast nearly two years ago. JAMES NEWCOMB: In New Jersey, there are hundreds of megawatts of solar power. BOYCE: During Sandy, there were widespread blackouts - sometimes for weeks, but all those solar panels - nothing. NEWCOMB: Because it's been connected to the grid in a way that it can't operate if the grid isn't up. BOYCE: And it's ticking off community planners to have to stare out at rooftop after rooftop of useless solar panels during these blackouts. James Newcomb says it has been set up this way on purpose for safety. NEWCOMB: So we typically have built the grid and operate it as one big system. BOYCE: And if you have a bunch of workers out fixing power lines after a blackout, the lines need to be dead. There can't be a bunch of solar energy running up the wires the wrong way, but Newcomb says it is possible to fix that. NEWCOMB: And the transition that we're now talking about is one that makes it possible to operate some smaller pieces of the grid independently. BOYCE: What he's talking about are. . . NEWCOMB: Micro-grids. BOYCE: Little, tiny grids, and these could allow you to power not only your town's water supply but maybe an emergency shelter or the hospital. To create a micro-grid, you need what are called smart inverters that sense when the larger grid has gone down and lock off the part that needs to be fixed. It could then use the local solar panels to power emergency services. LARIMORE: Yeah, if we can go back here, I'll show you the inverter. BOYCE: Del Norte, Colorado still has dumb inverters. So they have to rely on a diesel generator to back up at least the town's drinking water. But the technology to create micro-grids is advancing. Green Mountain Power, a utility in Vermont, is working on what it says is a first-of-its-kind micro-grid, powered entirely by solar panels. For NPR News, I'm Dan Boyce.

There was no physical exertion. They were training their brains to make sense of the world of data patterns and algorithms at the University of California, San Diego's data mining boot camp. Natasha Balac leads the program. And she says it's attracting all kinds of professionals. NATASHA BALAC: We have a variety of people taking these boot camps. We have people from IT and utilities to people from HR and computational science or casinos and anything in between really. RATH: Now, we'll try to skip past the technicalities of algorithms or how predictive analysis works. Can you just tell us what do people leave this boot camp being able to do with their skills? BALAC: They're able to take a data set that they might be doing in their professional or personal life and apply these algorithms to find patterns, rules, associations or some unexpected insight from the data. RATH: So if someone, say, comes in who's an HR specialist, what could they come out of this knowing how to do? BALAC: They might be able to look at their data and find how to make unhappy employees happier. Not everybody's interested in a higher salary. Some people really value an extra three days of vacation a year. And you can take the data you have of the behavior of the previous employees and the current employees and be able to find this kind of insight to take proactive actions before your employees or your customers get upset. And it really is everywhere. Looking for patterns in large amounts of data and then being able to find insight that you can take some action on really happens everywhere. If you check your Facebook page and you look at the news feed, there is predictive analytics behind it. Facebook uses these algorithms to try and find the news you personally would be most interested in. So they will look at your close group of friends and family. They will look at what kinds of news did you click on before. Most marketing companies will use them. All the pop-ups you have in your browsers when you're searching are based on your previous behavior. If you go to your local grocery store, the coupons that you get will be targeted specifically for you. RATH: Has it got to the point now that if you're running a business, you need to either have command of data mining and predictive analytics or have somebody on staff who's a specialist? BALAC: It's starting to be that way. I think the predictive analytics or data science will become a department of its own. And many organizations already are creating those. It is going to be something every organization is going to need as much as they need IT. RATH: And is that why you've started this school and are there other schools like yours? BALAC: Absolutely yes. I have actually been teaching a data mining certificate program for about 12 years. Twelve years ago, we had to cancel classes because we wouldn't have more than five students. We now have two sections of 60 plus. We're starting a Masters program at UCSD. Some people really don't want certificates or degrees. They really just want to learn practical, hands-on, how to apply these techniques. And that's really what prompted these two-day boot camps. RATH: A couple of years ago, the Harvard Business Review called the data scientist the sexiest job of the 21st century. Why is it so hot? BALAC: Because there are not enough people to do the job and because the job is really turning into a very interesting, creative and cool job. Data scientists need to have several different types of skills. You need to have those technical skills, machine learning and statistics, to be able to manipulate the data and find those patterns. But that's just not enough. In order to be a successful data scientist, you need to understand the business, ask the right questions, be able to be creative of how you treat your data in order to find those patterns. And this is why it's so difficult to find people who can do that job. RATH: Natasha Balac is the director of the Predictive Analytic Center of Excellence at the University of California, San Diego.

Google, Facebook, Twitter - many of the most popular services on the Internet are free of charge ,but we do pay for them. We pay with our personal data. These companies gather as much information as they can about us. And they sort it, dissect it and study it. And they use their knowledge about us to target us with advertising. In recent weeks on All Tech, we've heard differing opinions about this dominant internet business model. Some like Omri Ben Shahar, a law professor at the University of Chicago, defend it as a bargain. OMRI BEN SHAHAR: For many people the bargain is a great bargain. They don't really care that much about hypothetical dignitary effect of having their information stored by someone. And at the same time, they like very much that they don't have to pay. SIEGEL: And we've heard an apology from a tech guru had who had a hand in creating this business model - Ethan Zuckerman wrote the code for the original pop-up ad. ETHAN ZUCKERMAN: If you want to start a new advertising-based web business, you have to somehow demonstrate you're going to find out even more about your user than Facebook does. SIEGEL: Zuckerman who's now at MIT has some regrets. ZUCKERMAN: And we need some commendation of new business models and probably a certain amount of regulation to protect our online behavior and identities - to really get us out of what looks like an increasingly complicated trap. SIEGEL: Well, we're going to hear now about some new businesses that are trying to do things differently. They're trying to capitalize on privacy as a selling point. Steve Henn of NPR's Planet Money team joins us now. Hi, Steve. STEVE HENN, BYLINE: Hi. SIEGEL: Steve Henn, Ethan Zuckerman says free is hard to compete with, but I gather you say there are some alternatives to the pay with your data model out there. HENN: Well, we're beginning to see some crop up. One is called Open Whisper Systems. This is a nonprofit company started by a hacker who goes by the name Moxie Marlinspike, and its building opened source encryption tools for messaging and phone calls. What's interesting about what Open Whisper Systems is doing is that they're giving the code away to other companies for free, and they already have millions of adopters. There are also for-profit businesses that are betting that security and privacy will sell. Silent Circle offers a fee-based text messaging system. There's a company that makes something called the Blackphone which is a secure Android phone, and Wicker which offers more secure-base text messaging and the ability to delete and wipe old messages. All of these businesses have been able to raise money from large investors including someone prominent ones. SIEGEL: So there are investors, but does investment translate into consumers? HENN: Well, you know that's interesting and there hasn't been a big consumer market for privacy in the past. But that may be beginning to change, and what all of the businesses I just mentioned are doing - they're targeting people who handle lots of sensitive information - Wall Street bankers, executives. And I think that generally people who have very sensitive information are more receptive to the pitch that privacy and security are worth paying for. But what I think is really fascinating is how this attitude is beginning to trickle into the consumer market. Here's Tim Cook speaking on Charlie Rose a couple of weeks ago. Cook, of course, is Apple CEO. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TIM COOK: We try not to collect data. So we're not reading your e-mail. We're not reading your iMessage. If the government laid a subpoena on us to get your iMessages, we can't provide it. It's encrypted, and we don't have the key. SIEGEL: So the challenge to companies out there is to make the consumers value that security, that privacy so much that they'll be willing to pay for it. HENN: Right and this is actually a pitch to consumers that Apple is making aggressively right now. A week after Tim Cook spoke on Charlie Rose, Apple announced that its new operating system for iPhones and iPads would encrypt all the data on your phone or device at rest. So if police or someone else served Apple with a warrant to open a locked phone, they wouldn't be able anything off it. Now secure researchers I've spoken to have pointed out that Apple actually does have public keys for Imessages, and theoretically at least, it could decrypt those messages. Apple denies it does that, but others have found ways to get data off blocked iPhones. Still the thing is Apple systems are really getting better and the company is aggressively competing on privacy. And it's forcing other companies to compete as well. Just a few hours after Apple made its announcement about encrypting data on phones, Google's Android said it would do the same thing. So Google is apparently worried people will choose other products based on privacy which is interesting. When Google competes on privacy, you know something has changed. SIEGEL: Thank you, Steve.

This 10-day-period, ending on Yom Kippur, is a time when observant Jews reflect on the past year. And as Deena Prichep reports, some Jews are taking this reflection out of the temple and onto their tablets. DEENA PRICHEP, BYLINE: Judaism, like most religions, operates in the moral and ethical choices that happen every single day. But there are also times set aside for really digging deep, times like the Days of Awe, when the very gates of heaven are said to swing open. LAWRENCE SCHIFFMAN: Those days are open for two reasons. On the one hand, they're open because God on high wants us to go through this process. But on the other hand they're open because we've opened ourselves to them. PRICHEP: Lawrence Schiffman teaching Judaic studies at New York University. SCHIFFMAN: It's a kind of a spiritual taking of stock. Both regarding what we've done in the past and how we're going to precede in the future. PRICHEP: But for some modern Jews sitting in Temple isn't the best way into that future. BEN GREENMAN: I developed this idea for a project called 10Q, which would be 10 questions through an online interface, as a way of guided introspection. PRICHEP: Writer Ben Greenman is a member of Reboot, a group that works to create Jewish traditions to modern life. When you sign up for 10Q a question comes to your inbox during each of the Days of Awe, asking about major milestones, regrets, hopes for the future. GREENMAN: A lot of people as they answer them do really take it in an ethical direction and then some people say, oh I really got taken on interest rates and I should have waited two more months to buy the house. PRICHEP: However you answer the questions, after the 10 days end the online forum disappears and then, a year later, your answers are e-mailed back. LIBBY LENKINSKI: It means that I'm forced to look at the places where I've really grown away from where I was a year ago, when I chose to put this thing on paper and the places where I'm really, really consistent. PRICHEP: Libby Lenkinski is one of the more than 20,000 participants. LENKINSKI: It's about finding points of access that then people can expand on. And I think that's true for people who have no background or education in Judaism and for people like me who do and still haven't always found those particular inroads. SCHIFFMAN: Improve yourself and your life - this is great. But I still believe that needs to be talked about in moral and ethical ways. PRICHEP: Professors Lawrence Schiffman likes the online aspect of 10Q, but he thinks the questions like, describe an event in the world that has impacted you this year, are missing the full richness of Jewish thought. SCHIFFMAN: So much of it is oriented, not on ethical and religious and spiritual questions about ourselves, but on things that are either out of our control or things that are in our control and are very nice and very important but they don't have to do with the spiritual sense of the holidays. PRICHEP: But though not traditional, those sorts of questions can be paths into deeper places. Says 10Q founder Ben Greenman. GREENMAN: Asking people what you did wrong, I feel like I would get worse answers, more defensive answers or more pat answers. Rather than this kind of exploration were maybe it starts a little bit more open ended and simpler, but then gives people ownership of it. PRICHEP: And with that ownership 10Q participants can use the questions to really reflect on their lives and the paths they want to follow. During the Days of Awe and the whole New Year.

The shiny rollout of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus has been dulled, to say the least. And the company is feeling the heat. For more, we turn to NPR's Laura Sydell. And Laura, one of the issues has been with an update to Apple's new operating system iOS 8. What's going on? LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE: It's a routine update. And it was meant to fix a couple of bugs, such as some apps weren't able to access photos on your phone. But it turns out the fix caused bigger problems, including some people losing voice service. And then a study began circulating by a group called Crittercism, which claims that the new iOS has a higher crash rate. BLOCK: And what's Apple doing about that? SYDELL: They've pulled the update. And they're advising people to restore the older version. However, this is not always as easy as it sounds. BLOCK: Well, in addition to this problem with the operating system update, now there are also these complaints about the iPhone 6 bending in people's pockets. SYDELL: Yes, a video started circulating showing some people bending their iPhone 6 Plus. And that was after complaints from some customers that when they put the iPhone 6 Plus in their pockets, they discovered later that it had a slight bend towards the center. Now this is Apple's new larger version of the iPhone. It's what some people call a phablet, which is a mix of a phone and a tablet computer. The 6 Plus is thinner than the last phone. It has an aluminum body. But when you design something like that to make it thinner, it can become more fragile. And so anyway, this hashtag has started on Twitter called #bentgate. Some of it had people making jokes like - the ultimate hipster choice, my iPhone 6 Plus or my skinny jeans. And competitive brands have been having a field day. HTC had a tweet that said designed to withstand the most demanding environments like your pockets. Apple hasn't gotten back to me yet about what they're doing. But in a report in The Wall Street Journal, they called the problem extremely rare. BLOCK: And Laura, not just competitive brands getting in on the act - there's a whole Internet meme now of other products shown being bent - a Slim Jim being bent, a Whataburger being bent - all with the hasgtag #bentgate. Because after all, what is Twitter for but things like this? SYDELL: Right. (Laughter). BLOCK: What does all this mean for Apple in the end? SYDELL: Well, the stock price took a beating today in part because Apple is the company that always sold itself as user-friendly. The late Steve Jobs used to introduce products by saying it just works. He did face a controversy back in 2010 when Apple released its iPhone 4. That was antenna gate. BLOCK: Yes. SYDELL: And by force of personality, he quelled it. Now, Tim Cook, the current CEO, has to see if he can quiet this, because in many ways it's a perception problem. And he's not Steve Jobs. So everybody's looking what is Tim Cook going to do now? BLOCK: OK, NPR's Laura Sydell talking about the troubles with Apple's new iPhone models. Laura, thanks so much. SYDELL: You're welcome.

Even when raging bulls were sent reset behind the runners for extra incentive, they failed. The four-minute mile was finally cracked in 1954, but ordinary folks just cannot run that fast. And that's where a new jet pack comes in. (SOUNDBITE OF JET PACK)WERTHEIMER: That's the sound of a jet pack developed by researchers at Arizona State University. It's designed to give soldiers forward thrust, a thrust fast enough to run a four-minute mile. Engineering Master's student Jason Kerestes researched and designed the 11-pound prototype. JASON KERESTES: The jet pack is electrically powered, and it uses two high-speed, electric-ducted fans. And each of these fans pull in about a hundred amps at 25 volts. So that's 2,500 watts per motor. The benefit of the electric version is that we have instantaneous thrust. Our motors can go from zero to 60,000 RPM's in under a second, delivering full thrust almost instantaneously. WERTHEIMER: The thrusters mean the wearer's use less energy, saving their stamina. It also improves the agility. KERESTES: And if you were to envision a scenario where a Special Forces soldier did have to go in someplace quiet or, you know, even loud, if they can run faster and either get away from people that might be shooting at them, for example, it's much harder to hit a fast-moving target versus a slow-moving target. WERTHEIMER: And even though it never seemed to be an issue for the $6 million man, running at speeds that we are not designed for has its risks. KERESTES: Obviously, when you're running at speeds in excess of 15 miles an hour, which is a four-minute mile, if you trip and fall it's going to hurt. The only other risk that there potentially is, is that the batteries could heat up because there's quite a bit of current draw. But we haven't experienced any issues with that so far. WERTHEIMER: So if we can produce this kind of technology now, what is possible in the future? KERESTES: Today, we have a jet pack that you can run on the ground with. But I would like to hope to see that, you know, there's really no limit to the technology. And as the years pass, we might be, you know, seeing things like this on average, everyday people or even jet packs that make people fly.

As it turns out, not even Siri has your back. Videos have started popping up online of people using the built-in voice activation services on phones to get around pass codes - one shows an iPhone phone user summoning Siri without the pass code and accessing the phone's call history and contacts. These videos led one security expert to call on smart phone users to disable their - sorry - to disable their voice-activated personal assistants. Yuval Ben-Itzhak is the chief technology officer with the online security company AVG. YUVAL BEN-ITZHAK: You talk to the device, and the device is taking actions on your behalf. Either it's making a call, setting an appointment, writing an email. But what we found out - that although those technologies are exciting, they're not authenticating or not verifying the source of the voice. So who is talking to the device? Who is making the call? An app that sits on your phone can actually send an e-mail on your behalf or can make a call on your behalf. In some cases, like in the Google Now application on Android phones, we even managed to initiate a phone call and that can be even to a premium number that will charge you, you know, high dollars for every minute, even when your phone is locked. And that's a vulnerability we identified. BEN-ITZHAK: So someone who's not you can, without your passcode, get into your phone and send e-mails and do other things. BEN-ITZHAK: Exactly. Now, imagine this technology embedded in your car, and you stopping at a stop light and someone is making a voice - either synthesized or just another person. And what can happen to your car? Or if you are buying a device - a smart device at home that is voice-activated, and someone stands behind a door outside. We are calling just to make sure those technologies also include authentication of the source. RATH: And do we know that devices have been successfully hacked in this way? BEN-ITZHAK: No, we haven't seen a case in the wild. But that's exactly why we decided to increase the awareness that this exists. Our devices are very personal. It goes with us everywhere we go, and they are connected all the time. They are transmitting data out. Even the Wi-Fi when we're walking in the mall is constantly looking for hotspots to connect to and is doing that broadcasting information out of our devices. So the worst case scenario can be when someone is taking over this device, so - because it's so personal, all our pictures there, all our contacts are there, all our personal information on there. And also, this device is tracking us all the the time and knows where we're going. If someone takes control of that, that's going to be a very, very bad scenario. RATH: This is - this is pretty scary. Should people, you know - should we be frightened of our - of our phones? BEN-ITZHAK: I wouldn't suggest that. I think that awareness is the most important part here, and taking very simple actions is all you need to do. You can simply disable Siri or Google Now until the providers of this technology will include authentication, so - and authentication can be very simple. Very much like when you call to call today to a call center or to your bank, and they authenticate you through your voice, this type of authentication technology can be included on those products. RATH: Yuval Ben-Itzhak is the chief technology officer with AVG, an online security company. Thanks very much for explaining this. BEN-ITZHAK: Thank you very much for having me today.

It's called Ello, like the word hello pronounced by Eliza Doolittle. A big part of its appeal is that it's not Facebook. The site promises not to sell information about you or to bombard you with ads. If you go to the site, it looks like the Internet made with a typewriter and some Polaroids, just text and pictures. The CEO of Ello, Paul Budnitz, told NPR the company is getting 40,000 sign-ups and requests per hour. We wondered whether anyone really can dethrone Facebook or even compete as an alternative. We've called Howard Rheingold. He teaches virtual communities and social media at Stanford. He also coined the term virtual community. He's basically a Jedi master in this world. I asked him whether there is an appetite for social networks that won't sell your personal data or track your movements. HOWARD RHEINGOLD: We're noticing things, of course, you know, when you use Gmail, it's sometimes unnerving how relevant the ads are in the margin. And you might shop for something somewhere and decide not to buy it and then see an ad for it on Facebook. So I think that there's a growing awareness of the degree to which people are being tracked. So yes, there is a great appeal to something that promises not to sell your data and bombard you with ads. I wonder, though, about after a lot of people join it whether they're going to continue to participate. Because I know that there was something called Path. I don't know how many years ago, two, three, four, five years ago, that offered an alternative to Facebook. And I joined like a lot of other people. And like a lot of other people, I don't use it anymore. SHAPIRO: Have you joined Ello yet? RHEINGOLD: I have not joined Ello. I got an invite and I decided that I've got enough happening online. SHAPIRO: I made the exact same decision. I got an invite this week and I ignored it. RHEINGOLD: It's pretty noisy out there. SHAPIRO: And how much of a risk is that for anyone who tries to enter this already saturated online space? RHEINGOLD: You've got to do something to rise above the noise. And I think Ello has done what any social application that wants to succeed does, which is they seed it with people that they believe are going to influence others. SHAPIRO: And that's why it's membership by invitation-only, at least for now. RHEINGOLD: Instagram started by invitation only. There's something that chaos scientists called sensitive dependence on initial conditions. The first folks who start using it and the people they tell are sort of the DNA of a social network. Remember, Facebook started at Harvard, Princeton, and Stanford. So they had the cache of the elite colleges. And of course, students from other colleges wanted to join. SHAPIRO: You know, I actually remember a conversation from long ago when Friendster was dying. And I asked somebody, I need to create a profile on MySpace or Facebook but I don't know which one. What should I do? And he said, Facebook is for college graduates. MySpace is for other people. And if that's true, then who are the Ello people? RHEINGOLD: That's a very good question. I don't know that they're the super elite, the superrich. There was a social network for the superrich that was started years ago called ASMALLWORLD. Of course, ASMALLWORLD is for the one percent. Maybe the one-tenth of one percent have one that nobody but them ever hears about.

Twitter sued the U. S. government. Apple and the FBI got into a fight over encryption. And Snapchat appears to have been hacked. NPR's Steve Henn has been covering these stories this week. So Steve, you see a common theme here. STEVE HENN, BYLINE: You know, I do. I think the theme is that all of these stories touch on either encryption, security or free speech. They're tied together in kind of an interesting way. Right now, most big tech companies that are serious about making users' communication safe and private have embraced encryption - powerful encryption. And I don't think tech companies are doing this to make it impossible to comply with lawful requests and criminal investigations. I think the reason they want to do this is that when encryption is used properly it makes all of our communications more secure. I mean, you mentioned Snapchat. Now, it's unclear that Snapchat was really hacked or whether or not this was a hoax. But hackers on 4chan claimed to have obtained tens of thousands of photos - explicit photos - possibly of minors through attacking a so-called third-party app. You know, this is the kind of thing that just strikes terror into the heart of tech executives and frankly their customers. And it's the type of attack that strong, well-implemented encryption can make a lot harder to pull off. RATH: But you know, we've heard from law enforcement this week, from the FBI, that that kind of airtight encryption lets criminals - terrorists even - plot in secrecy. That there needs to be a backdoor for law enforcement to get around encryption in those cases. HENN: Yeah, law enforcement has argued aggressively for these kinds of backdoors for years. But most security experts I've spoken to respond that if you build a backdoor into a service, it's not just law enforcement that can walk through, that other people often can exploit the same technologies to get at communications illegally. It just fundamentally makes these systems more insecure. RATH: Well, how much are Apple, Twitter, any of these companies legally required to cooperate with law enforcement? HENN: You know, this is a really complicated and evolving area of the law. And right now, honestly, there could be legal precedence in the national security space that we don't know about because those cases are litigated in the FISA court - the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court - and are classified. But here are the basics. So obviously any company has to obey a valid court order and telephone services, you know. Remember voice calls? People in that business are required to install technology that makes it possible for law enforcement to intercept the calls and listen in. They also have to do something to make it possible for law enforcement to know who is connecting with whom. That's called track and trace in this community. And the U. S. Patriot Act extended that requirement to Internet service providers and companies like Twitter. But none of these laws require companies to decode any encrypted communications that are intercepted. And certainly, right now at least, these laws don't apply to mobile phones or personal devices that are sold directly to consumers. So if Apple and Google make this decision to encrypt everything on your phone, that's not illegal. And frankly, most legal experts I've talked to say really it's a matter of free speech. I mean, if you want to talk in code, you're legally allowed to talk in code. RATH: Speaking of rights and free speech, that brings us to the Twitter case. Could you explain their free speech argument and the case they brought against the Justice Department this week? HENN: So in the case of Twitter, the company's arguing it should be allowed to tell the public more about the kinds of legal requests for information it's receiving from the U. S. government. RATH: What kind of requests are they talking about? HENN: Well, they run the gamut - from routine subpoenas to national security letters and requests from this Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. And for years, technology companies were forbidden from disclosing that they had received NSLs or FISA court orders. This year, many tech companies reached a compromise with the Justice Department that allows them to talk about this in broad strokes. Twitter is arguing that's not good enough. They say that simply disclosing the number and type of court orders they receive won't compromise investigations and really is their First Amendment right. RATH: NPR's Steve Henn. Steve, thank you. HENN: Oh, my pleasure. ARUN RATH, HOST:  Some dramatic developments this week in technology news. Twitter sued the U. S. government. Apple and the FBI got into a fight over encryption.

I'm Ari Shapiro. The holiday season is approaching, a time for Santa and sales and fears of credit-card breaches. Cyber thieves have already stolen millions of card numbers this year. Kmart and Dairy Queen are among the latest victims. Charles Lane from member station WSHU explains that shoppers are heading into the heavy-spending season with no new safeguards in place. CHARLES LANE, BYLINE: When you hear about a data breach, Bryan Sartin is one of the guys who goes in to investigate. BRYAN SARTIN: I've seen my own personal information in those lots of stolen data many, many, many, many, many times. LANE: Sartin heads a team of forensic computer techs for Verizon - good-guy hackers, basically. For a while, he and his desk-mate had a running joke. SARTIN: How frequently in our cases we would find one of his credit cards. And I remember, back-to-back, it was like 2 out of 3 cases. And there was a third. We're like, it's not here, and he's kind of laughing. And then all of a sudden, we found his wife's. LANE: Sartin says data breaches happen all the time. In fact, only about a third of them are ever made public, which surprised many shoppers here in midtown Manhattan, like Alexandra Goodell. ALEXANDRA GOODELL: It's upsetting. It gets me angry. I work really hard, and I don't want to go out of my way to cancel my card and to nail down what happened. LANE: One of the main reasons why U. S. credit card numbers are stolen so often has to do with how we process them after the swipe. Again, Bryan Sartin. SARTIN: That transaction in a text format of some kind is sent to a server there at the store that all of the cash registers speak to. LANE: Your credit card number then flies through the Internet to the merchant's main national computer, then to the processor, then to the bank and then back again. SARTIN: It returns in . 06 seconds with a yes or no. LANE: And you walk out of the store while the transaction continues to ricochet across the country. And that's technology from the 1970s. JASON OXMAN: What we need to do in the U. S. is completely replace an architecture that has been deployed over the course of the last 40 years. That's how long mag-stripe cards have been in the market. LANE: Jason Oxman heads the Electronic Transactions Association. He says the magnetic stripe worked fine until the '90s. Then PCs came along that could counterfeit hundreds of credit cards. Because the U. S. had a really strong telecom network, retailers started verifying a card's authenticity online. In places where the internetwork wasn't so great, they adopted what are called chip cards or smart cards. OXMAN: So that's one reason that we haven't used the chip cards. We haven't needed to because our online system of authorization has been a replacement for that off-line chip. LANE: But by this time next year, you will likely be using the new chip cards. What slowed them down is the-chicken-or-the-egg conundrum. Banks didn't want to issue the chip cards if retailers didn't have the readers, and retailers weren't going to buy them if banks weren't issuing the cards. OXMAN: There are more than 10,000 financial institutions that issue credit cards and debit cards in the U. S. There are 8 million merchants that accept credit and debit cards in the U. S. LANE: But the new chip cards are only expected to cut about 60 percent of the fraud, which frustrates merchants. Mallory Duncan is general counsel at the National Retail Federation. He fears the credit card hacks will continue because at the core, the system's backbone is still the same - 16-digit account numbers flying across the Internet. MALLORY DUNCAN: Unfortunately, all we're going to get in the near future is the not-quite-so-smart card. The problem is that this product itself is fundamentally flawed. You cannot secure a house of straw. LANE: Duncan says retailers want something more. They're looking to what's called tokenization, where instead of your account number flying through the Internet, there's a one- time only randomly generated token of your account number. This is what Google Wallet and Apple Pay use. DUNCAN: All of those, potentially, are much more secure for consumers than would be partially secure chip cards. LANE: Tokenization is out there now, but not yet for credit cards. Because they require significant system upgrades for both retailers and the banks, it's that same chicken-and-the-egg problem - who spends the money first? For NPR News, I'm Charles Lane.

We're like, it's not here, and he's kind of laughing. And then all of a sudden, we found his wife's. LANE: Sartin says data breaches happen all the time. In fact, only about a third of them are ever made public, which surprised many shoppers here in midtown Manhattan, like Alexandra Goodell. ALEXANDRA GOODELL: It's upsetting. It gets me angry. I work really hard, and I don't want to go out of my way to cancel my card and to nail down what happened. LANE: One of the main reasons why U. S. credit card numbers are stolen so often has to do with how we process them after the swipe. Again, Bryan Sartin. SARTIN: That transaction in a text format of some kind is sent to a server there at the store that all of the cash registers speak to. LANE: Your credit card number then flies through the Internet to the merchant's main national computer, then to the processor, then to the bank and then back again. SARTIN: It returns in . 06 seconds with a yes or no. LANE: And you walk out of the store while the transaction continues to ricochet across the country. And that's technology from the 1970s. JASON OXMAN: What we need to do in the U. S. is completely replace an architecture that has been deployed over the course of the last 40 years. That's how long mag-stripe cards have been in the market. LANE: Jason Oxman heads the Electronic Transactions Association. He says the magnetic stripe worked fine until the '90s. Then PCs came along that could counterfeit hundreds of credit cards. Because the U. S. had a really strong telecom network, retailers started verifying a card's authenticity online. In places where the internetwork wasn't so great, they adopted what are called chip cards or smart cards. OXMAN: So that's one reason that we haven't used the chip cards. We haven't needed to because our online system of authorization has been a replacement for that off-line chip. LANE: But by this time next year, you will likely be using the new chip cards. What slowed them down is the-chicken-or-the-egg conundrum. Banks didn't want to issue the chip cards if retailers didn't have the readers, and retailers weren't going to buy them if banks weren't issuing the cards. OXMAN: There are more than 10,000 financial institutions that issue credit cards and debit cards in the U. S. There are 8 million merchants that accept credit and debit cards in the U. S. LANE: But the new chip cards are only expected to cut about 60 percent of the fraud, which frustrates merchants. Mallory Duncan is general counsel at the National Retail Federation. He fears the credit card hacks will continue because at the core, the system's backbone is still the same - 16-digit account numbers flying across the Internet. MALLORY DUNCAN: Unfortunately, all we're going to get in the near future is the not-quite-so-smart card. The problem is that this product itself is fundamentally flawed. You cannot secure a house of straw. LANE: Duncan says retailers want something more. They're looking to what's called tokenization, where instead of your account number flying through the Internet, there's a one- time only randomly generated token of your account number. This is what Google Wallet and Apple Pay use. DUNCAN: All of those, potentially, are much more secure for consumers than would be partially secure chip cards. LANE: Tokenization is out there now, but not yet for credit cards. Because they require significant system upgrades for both retailers and the banks, it's that same chicken-and-the-egg problem - who spends the money first?

And the state's Right-to-Carry law was back in the news this past week. Anita Sarkeesian is a feminist cultural critic. Ever since she started hosting a web series calling attention to women's portrayals in the videogame industry, she's received vicious threats. Sarkeesian was scheduled to speak at Utah State University on Wednesday. The University received anonymous death threats, massacre threats actually. That's never swayed Sarkeesian before. This time though, she canceled the event because police said they wouldn't stop people from bringing their guns, citing the state's concealed carry laws. Anita Sarkeesian found out about the threats when she landed in Salt Lake City. ANITA SARKEESIAN: I eventually got on the phone with the police at Utah State University and they informed me that they were going to check - not allow for backpacks and have additional security there. And when I asked them about Utah's concealed weapon laws, they informed me that they couldn't do any kind of screening for weapons, which was a little mind-boggling to me because the threat received was very reminiscent of sort of copycat killers of these - you know misogynist massacres that had been done previously. And so they said - you know, I was like well, can you at least have metal detectors or pat downs? And they refused to do that.  So I declined and cancelled the event because I felt like that was too high of a risk to put me and the students in. RATH: Now, this is not the first time you've been threatened. Can you talk about how you've been receiving threats recently? SARKEESIAN: Yeah. Well, since I announced that I was going to be doing a video series specifically looking at the representations of women in video games, I have been attacked and ultimately terrorized for two years because of this series. So everything from, you know, my social media accounts flooded with misogynist and racist slurs to trying to hack into my - you know, my social media and e-mail. RATH: And people can go online if they want to get a sense of this because these threats are really - I mean, they're vile. They're specific. They're the things - we couldn't read them on the radio - couldn't even come close. SARKEESIAN: Yes. Oftentimes, there are very specific rape threats, which are a highly illustrative that are also connected to like my home address or, you know, like attacks on my parents and my colleagues and their families, as well. And, you know, I am not the only woman being attacked right now in games. There have been a number of other women who are fearing for their lives and leaving their homes because they're receiving threats as well. So this is actually a larger problem within the gaming community right now. RATH: So what is it with the gaming community that, you know, gets to this level of nastiness and misogyny online? SARKEESIAN: Yeah, I get asked that a lot. RATH: I'm sure. SARKEESIAN: And it's a really good question that I think is pretty complicated. But, you know, one of the things is that in some ways, you know, there are some men who have gravitated towards gaming culture because they've been rejected by sort of this larger alpha-male culture.  But the problem with that is that gaming allows them to sort of fulfill that role of the alpha-male role, right - the macho testosterone kind of posturing that you get in a lot of these sort of big AAA games. And so they're actually kind of re-perpetuating that alpha-male culture by attacking people that they perceive to be weaker than them. So they're going after women. They're going after queer folks. They're are going after trans folks and especially anyone who speaks up and is critical in any way, you know, about gaming. RATH: Can you give us a little bit of your - the critique as you've made it of videogames? SARKEESIAN: Often women are framed as helpless. Or they're prizes to be won. Or they're highly sexualized sort of male fantasies. The other piece of this too, is that there is an enormous amount of violence against women that's used in these games, often times just a sort of set dressing, just like in the background. These women are hurt or beaten up just to make the world seem more gritty. These representations are really harmful to women. And so, you know, we're asking for better representations and better stories having more female protagonists that are like full and complete characters. RATH: Anita Sarkeesian created the media criticism site Feminist Frequency. She joined us from member station KQED in San Francisco. Anita, thanks so much. SARKEESIAN: Thank you. RATH: We also reached out to Tim Vitale. He's the Executive Director of PR and marketing at Utah State University. He explained the University's response. TIM VITALE: When we got the threat, we started adding extra security measures. We were going to sweep the rooms for explosive devices and any other weapons and enclose it. We added police officers who were going to come to the event. We were not going to allow backpacks or large packs that could carry the weaponry that the person alleged to have in the e-mail - large caliber rifles and pipe bombs and other explosive devices. We thought we had, and we still think we had, everything in place to ensure a safe environment. RATH: Would people have been allowed though to bring guns to the event? VITALE: Yes. Utah state law says that if a person has a legal concealed carry permit, they are allowed to attend public events. And we are not allowed to restrict the lawful possession or carrying of a firearm. RATH: Anita Sarkeesian was going to be giving a speech. There had been threats which you also considered serious. Can you understand her fear and not wanting to come to the event knowing that people would be allowed to bring firearms there? VITALE: Absolutely. There is some debate going on now and this is starting to get some air time in the state - what should our state laws say? But that's a debate to be had. Maybe this will spur that debate to happen more quickly. We're certainly looking at that. This is important to us, too. RATH: That's Tim Vitale from Utah State University. He says that local law enforcement and the FBI are still looking into the matter. ARUN RATH, HOST:  You can carry a gun just about anywhere in Utah if you have a permit.

Just last week, a business-focused Wisdom 2. 0 was held in New York. Gopi Kallayil is a top brand marketing executive at Google and a regular speaker at the conference.

It's called Rooms but really there's nothing new about it. MIKE ISAAC: Think of it as a sort of mobile throwback to the Internet of yesterday, when most of how we went online was AOL or chat rooms that you pick a username - so like football fan 1234 - and you just start chatting away. CORNISH: Mike Isaac is a tech reporter for The New York Times. The app allows you to choose from a variety of chat rooms. There's Photography Lovers Unite and Noms From Above - that's for food lovers by the way. There's even one for finding the best parkour spots. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  You connect with others about common interests but you remain anonymous. You can take on a different identity in every room. ISAAC: Say I want to know more about an illness or some world problem that I'm either too scared or embarrassed to talk about it in person. SIEGEL: Mike Isaac says this new spin on chat rooms also raises all of the previous concerns - with a truly open space come potential dangers, especially for younger users. CORNISH: Isaac says there are safety settings but there are still risks. ISAAC: It is a little more free-for-all than, say, going on traditional Facebook and talking to people on there. And that's sort of dangerous as far as how can I protect my child from the craziness that is the Internet these days? CORNISH: This concept of multiple anonymous identities is a shift for Facebook. The company has come under fire for deleting the Facebook accounts of people who did not provide their real names. ISAAC: They've realized there's much more room for who we are and it's hard to sort of pigeonhole ourselves into one person online. SIEGEL: Facebook has also realized that it needs to do more to compete for people's attention. The company is trying here to take on the likes of Twitter and Reddit but The Times' Mike Isaac says Rooms isn't much of a threat so far. ISAAC: I would say Reddit and, you know, other little micro communities aren't quite worried at this point. It's sort of like keeping a wary eye on what Facebook is doing. SIEGEL: Isaac says it's not clear whether the Rooms app will have the momentum to become the next well - the next Facebook.

He was left in a state known as locked-in syndrome - paralyzed physically, but mentally aware. He was only able to move his left eyelid and used it to dictate his memoir, \"The Diving Bell And The Butterfly. \"Now we turn to a story about a patient who was left in a similar state, but learned to communicate with brain waves. In 2009, Barry Beck, a geologist in his 60s, had a series of strokes. They caused extensive damage to his right occipital lobe and to the brainstem. ERIC SELLERS: According to the neurologist and the MRI scans, he had one of the worst cases of locked-in syndrome that they had seen. RATH: That's Eric Sellers, a professor at East Tennessee State University. He and his team started working with Beck 10 months after his stroke. SELLERS: When I first saw him, he had a little bit of eye movement, and that was really the only way that he could communicate. RATH: Beck's wife contacted Sellers when she heard about the research he was doing. Sellers runs the Brain-Computer Interface Laboratory, where he focuses on helping people with severe motor disabilities to communicate. He and his team were working on a system to connect brain waves and computers to make a virtual keyboard. SELLERS: It's basically instead of using your hands to press keys on the keyboard, you're using brain waves to press the keys. RATH: To use the system, you would wear a noninvasive electrode cap and sit in front of a monitor that has a picture of a keyboard. At random, groups of letters flash. SELLERS: And if you want to choose the A, you pay attention to the A. And then every time the A flashes, your brain produces this response. It's called a P300. And this P300 is like an aha response. So your brain kind of says, aha, that's the one I want to select. RATH: The technology has been used to help people with Lou Gehrig's Disease compose messages. It's also allowed people to control wheelchairs and prosthetic limbs just by thinking. But Barry Beck was one of the first patients with a severe brainstem injury to use it successfully. Eric Sellers and his team started slow, with just four letters - Y for yes, N for no, P for pass and E for end. SELLERS: The first major action we had was a 25-question dialogue that ended up in us determining that he wanted more information regarding his prognosis. RATH: Once they knew he was able to use it, they fine-tuned the settings and eventually presented him with a full alphabet so he could spell out words. Barry Beck could now communicate. SELLERS: One of the first messages that he spelled was to his wife. He spelled out thank you for all of your hard work. He, on a couple of occasions, also asked me to make the system go faster. (Laughter) And I, of course, told him that I was trying. I'm doing my best. (Laughter). RATH: That's because the system is slow - very slow. It took Beck 38 seconds to select each character. Much of Seller's research was focused on making the machine faster and more accurate. But for Beck the painstaking task was worth it. SELLERS: It was also something that gave his wife a lot of satisfaction - knowing that he was actually, you know, still in there and, for the most part, cognitively intact. His kids would visit while used the BCI, and so it had a really large effect on the family, as well. RATH: Sellers and his team worked with Beck for more than a year, conducting therapy sessions in the nursing home where he lived. In November of 2011, at the age of 67, Barry Beck died. But Sellers says that through his participation, Barry Beck played a part in making this technology more accessible to other locked-in patients. SELLERS: For the people that are participating in our research program, they understand they may not benefit from this technology, but they also realize how important it could be for people who are in similar situations. RATH: Sellers imagines a future where this technology is available in hospitals. SELLERS: If someone has some type of injury - automobile accident or something like that - and they have to be intubated and on a respirator, you could imagine that emergency rooms, trauma wards would actually have these. RATH: Eric Sellers has documented his work with Barry Beck in a research paper published earlier this month in the journal Science Translational Medicine.

Mobile devices are the thing now - smart phones, tablets, now wearable devices even. Yeah, that computer is going the way of the powdered wig. But apparently, consumers missed the memo. Apple recently announced it had sold more Macintosh computers than ever before this past quarter - five-and-a-half million. Omar Gallaga is the tech culture for the Austin American-Statesman. He says Apple's uptick comes as the dramatic decline in PC sales has dramatically slowed. OMAR GALLAGA: I mean, no one is saying that there's a gigantic rebound in the PC industry. It's definitely is a slowdown, but it's still a decline or, at least, flat. But there's definitely some movement away from tablets and maybe back to PCs. This quarter, Apple had a 13 percent decline in its iPad sales, down to 12. 3 million units, which Tim Cook calls a speed bump, but we shall see. RATH: Do you think that the changes in sales are reflecting a change in how people are using devices? Or is it just that people have enough tablets, and they're happy with their PCs? GALLAGA: I think so. It's a lot of screens in the house. You know, if you have a large phone - you know, if you bought the iPhone 6 Plus or you have a Samsung, you know, Galaxy Note, you've got a pretty big screen that's comparable to, say, an iPad mini. And if you have an iPad - if you have an iPad 2 or 3, maybe you don't feel the need to upgrade, which I think is what's really happening - is people are holding on to those tablets that they bought a couple of years ago longer than they would a cell phone or maybe a, you know, computer. So Apple is having a hard time convincing people, you know - hey, you know, why not upgrade? Why not spend $500 to $900 on a new iPad. People are finding that maybe they don't need that. RATH: So do you think the computer manufacturers, or maybe just Apple, can relax a little bit? Or do you think, you know, this is just a temporary break in the stormy weather when it comes to computer sales? GALLAGA: No, I think for Apple, they need to be as aggressive as possible right now and do what they can. I mean, they still - 5. 5 million Macs in one quarter sounds like a lot, but that's only one part of a 75 million PC, you know, shipping quarter. So Apple is still - you know, it's in the top five now, according to some of the analysts. But that's still, you know, probably not enough for Apple. They want to continue to push and push and take advantage of any weakness in the traditional PC market. And they're also fighting on the low end, as well, against Chromebooks. Chromebooks have become very popular, you know, on the sub-$300 market. So Apple is kind of fighting this battle on all fronts - on the low end, on the high end with iMac, even, you know, with the Mac Pro. So they are really gunning on all fronts. RATH: And on the consumer side of that, why are people still choosing Macs when, as more than one advertisement is telling me, you can get products that do the same thing for much less? GALLAGA: I think there's a couple of things. One is that Windows 8 from Microsoft was not a raging success. It had a bad reputation. It was something that people found they had problems with. It was a big adjustment from Windows 7. Microsoft had to kind of retreat in some areas and reintroduce things that it had eliminated in Windows 8. And the next, Windows 10, which - to me, the fact that they're skipping Windows 9 and going to Windows 10 shows how much they want to distance themselves. . . (LAUGHTER)GALLAGA: . . . From the debacle that has been Windows 8. I think that has helped Apple, for sure. And also, you know, Macs - the MacBook Airs and MacBook Pros are considered cool. I mean, if you look in pop culture, if you look in TV and movies and you see a silver laptop, you think, that's a MacBook Pro or a MacBook Air. You don't think, that's a Lenovo or a Dell. They've become associated with, you know, what professionals, what people in coffee shops are using and are kind of the cool kids on the block.

Now at the age of 83, he still does things his way. He takes on 3-D in his new film. It's called \"Goodbye To Language,\" and it shared the jury prize at the Cannes Film Festival this year. The movie opens in this country today, starting in New York and Los Angeles. Here's reporter Pat Dowell.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"GOODBYE TO LANGUAGE\")DOWELL: There's even a dog - the director's own. Roxy wanders the countryside conversing with the lake and the river that want to tell him what humans never hear. There are also things typical of movies by Jean-Luc Godard - quotes from philosophers, artists, novelists as part of the dialogue or recited by a narrator, music where you least expect it and not where you do, a story that's not stitched neatly together and an unusual approach to 3-D. Godard generally avoids interviews, but he did talk for Canon Cameras about what attracted him to 3-D in the first place. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JEAN-LUC GODARD: (Through translator) There aren't any rules. It's still a place where there aren't rules. Later, there are a ton of rules so that interests me less. You must do this. You must do that. Don't do this. Do this. DOWELL: 3-D uses two cameras to make an image appear to have depth, but \"Goodbye To Language\" goes beyond that says film historian and critic David Bordwell. DAVID BORDWELL: Normally they're interlocked to produce a smooth image - a 3-D illusion. But what Godard does in a couple of points in the film is pan one of the two cameras he uses but keep the other one fixed on the object. So in fact, you get a splitting of the image - two flat images superimposed on each other in depth. When that first instance of that in the film showed up at Cannes, audiences spontaneously applauded. They had never seen anything like it. DOWELL: And it's not just for the sake of rule breaking says Bordwell. BORDWELL: It's a very startling but kind of poetic effect actually, particularly in the context of a scene where it's about people separating from one another. DOWELL: Bordwell likens Godard to a modern painter, and so does one of the film's stars, Heloise Godet. She recalls asking the filmmaker about her character, a woman in an unhappy relationship. HELOISE GODET: He gave us a picture saying OK, that's what your character are representing for me. It was a piece of modern art, and it was really abstract. And he said OK, that's your character. It was weird but really inspiring. DOWELL: Weird but inspiring might describe how even Godard's producers see his projects. Vincent Maraval decided to pursue a career in film when he was 14 after seeing a Godard movie. He still finds Godard's work strangely puzzling and compelling - still the creations of a young innovator. VINCENT MARAVAL: For every project he's looking for the unknown. He looks for an experience. He doesn't know where he goes, and that's what motivates him, and that's what I call being very young. It's true that he's always ready for adventure. DOWELL: Godard himself steps into his film, at least through his voice, as an unseen teacher expounding on watercolor painting and questions of existence. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"GOODBYE TO LANGUAGE\")GODARD: (As teacher) (Through translator) Go back to the surface. What's difficult is to fit flatness into depth - the other world. DOWELL: And this may be just what \"Goodbye To Language\" is about says film historian David Bordwell. BORDWELL: I think what he's talking about - and this is one of the reasons the dog Roxy is very prominent in the film - is that he's trying to get people to look at the world in a kind of unspoiled way. There are hints throughout the film that animal consciousness is kind of closer to the world than we are - that language sets up a barrier or filter or screen between us and what's really there. And although the film is full of language - talk, printed text and so on - nevertheless, I think there's a sense that he wants the viewer to scrape away a lot of the ordinary conceptions we have about how we communicate and look at the world afresh. DOWELL: To make us see is one of the oldest goals of movies and one that has pushed Jean-Luc Godard to keep working for more than half a century. He's already at work on his next film. For NPR News, this is Pat Dowell. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:  The filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard made his name in the French New Wave of the 1960s by breaking cinematic rules. Now at the age of 83, he still does things his way. He takes on 3-D in his new film. It's called \"Goodbye To Language,\" and it shared the jury prize at the Cannes Film Festival this year. The movie opens in this country today, starting in New York and Los Angeles. Here's reporter Pat Dowell. PAT DOWELL, BYLINE: In \"Goodbye To Language,\" there are some things you might find in any Hollywood movie - a woman and a man arguing. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"GOODBYE TO LANGUAGE\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (Speaking French). UNIDENTIFIED ACTRESS: (Speaking French). UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (Speaking French). DOWELL: A shoot out. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"GOODBYE TO LANGUAGE\") DOWELL: There's even a dog - the director's own. Roxy wanders the countryside conversing with the lake and the river that want to tell him what humans never hear.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE SIMPSONS)DAN CASTELLANETA: (As Homer Simpson) Ever heard of a little thing called the Internet? JULIE KAVNER: (As Marge Simpson) Internet, aye? CASTELLANETA: (As Homer Simpson) Oh, yeah, everybody's making money off the Internet except us. INSKEEP: That was then. This is now. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: Now the Simpsons are making money off the Internet with a new website and an app featuring every episode of \"The Simpsons\" ever made. You, too, can watch the episode where Homer says, operator, get me the number for 9-1-1. INSKEEP: (Imitating Homer Simpson) The site is called Simpsons World. It's one of many sites transforming the TV rerun. Here's NPR TV critic Eric Deggans. ERIC DEGGANS, BYLINE: For fans of great TV comedy, it's been a call to action for more than 25 years. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"THE SIMPSONS THEME SONG\")DEGGANS: Even Homer Simpson had a tough time designing a great website. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE SIMPSONS)CASTELLANETA: (As Homer Simpson) Here it is, everybody. The world's greatest website. You'd think all the noises would be annoying, but they're not. DEGGANS: Fortunately, FX Networks did a bit better when they built a website and app designed to show off all 552 episodes of \"The Simpsons. \" Simpsons World allows viewers with a cable subscription to access every episode, watch special playlists, look up the popularity of each episode and more. Next year, more features are coming, including social media sharing and the ability to create your own playlist. Chuck Saftler is chief operating officer for FX. He says the company dreamed up Simpsons World as they were buying rights to the show for their new cable channel called FXX. CHUCK SAFTLER: We realized that we were in a very changing time in terms of how television is consumed and in terms of how entertainment as a whole is consumed. DEGGANS: Saftler says FX wanted to satisfy two kinds of viewers: old-fashioned TV fans watching the show on cable and people who watch shows on whatever device is available. SAFTLER: I do believe that there are going be a number of viewers that still want to have episodes, you know, served up live and have that leaned back, decompressed experience. But I also believe that there are viewers that want to have that lean forward, you know, where they curate their own experience. DEGGANS: But now that viewers can curate their own TV playlists online, why wouldn't most people watch exactly what they want exactly when they want to watch it? Saftler says there's a simple answer. SAFTLER: Choice is good, but too much choice is paralyzing. And if you go there not knowing what you're looking for, it can be paralyzing. It can be too many choices. If you go there knowing exactly what you're looking for, there's no better way to find content. DEGGANS: It's an interesting paradox. Even in today's on-demand media culture, viewers still sometimes want the option of watching what someone else has chosen for them. And \"The Simpsons\" isn't the only show giving viewers this kind of choice. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"SOUTH PARK THEME SONG\")PRIMUS: (Singing) I'm going down to South Park, going to have myself a time. DEGGANS: Earlier this year, the creators of \"South Park\" cut a deal with Hulu worth a reported $80 million. They sold streaming rights to all 240 plus episodes of the show for the Hulu Plus subscription site. Fans can also visit southparkstudios. com to see episodes, read a wiki and blogs and create an avatar themselves in the \"South Park\" animation style. Hulu also recently announced plans to add episodes of Viacom-owned series like \"Ren & Stimpy\" and \"The Daily Show. \" These shows will help build an audience for Hulu that's independent from cable TV or broadcasters or even television sets. This is quite a long way from where TV reruns started. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"LEAVE IT TO BEAVER\")UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Leave it to Beaver. DEGGANS: Years ago, reruns of shows like \"Leave It To Beaver\" were almost appointment viewing on TV stations. Then cable channels began using reruns to build their identity. (SOUNDBITE OF THEME SONG, \"LAW & ORDER\")DEGGANS: TNT aired \"Law & Order\" reruns to brand itself as a home for TV drama long before developing its original shows. Now reruns provide the same service for online platforms like Netflix, Hulu and Simpsons World. It's another interesting paradox as viewers' love for old shows and new technology come together to shape TV's future. I'm Eric Deggans.

That phrase has become a mantra in the Internet age. For some, it's a way of explaining why so much writing and music and video is available online free of cost to the consumer. The phrase actually predates the Internet and the original idea is a bit more complex. In 1984, futurist Stewart Brand was talking about the tension between the high value of information and the plummeting cost of distributing it. He said on the one hand information wants to be expensive, and on the other, information wants to be free. And it's that first part - the expensive part - that's often forgotten. Well, now along comes writer Cory Doctorow with a new book called \"Information Doesn't Want To Be Free. \" Doctorow wants artists to get their fair share. And he argues the problem these days is that tech platforms - devices and apps - have more control over content than the people who make. CORY DOCTOROW: I'm not really interested in whether the stuff that I get on the Internet is free or isn't. I certainly pay for a lot of stuff. For me the concern is whether or not the money that's spent when we buy things on the Internet goes mostly to creators and then to their investors and then to the platforms or whether, as it is today, the platforms have the whip hand and then the investors can extract monopoly rents from the creators and then the creators sort of sit at the bottom of the barrel. You know, people have always found ways to get stuff for free. And certainly copying is not going to get any harder from here on in. You know, your grandkids will marvel at how incredibly hard it was to copy in 2014. So the interesting thing for me as a creator is how do I make sure that my share of the money that people spend is as large as possible? CORNISH: And in the book you do talk about the audience. You talk about the creators, meaning the artists, writers, singers, authors, the publishers and studios and then also the platform, which I think most of us would recognize as the tech companies, whether it be an Amazon or an Apple or a Google. And you talk about this idea of copyright as protected by a digital lock. Can you give us a short summation of what you mean by digital lock? DOCTOROW: Sure. Well, if you've got an iPhone and you want to buy an app from someone other than Apple, you can't, not because your phone can't run software but because your phone has a lock on it that tries to stop you from loading software that Apple hasn't gone a 30 percent cut of the sale price of. And, you know, under normal circumstances, you would expect that to just sort of be taken care of by markets, right? If you bought a dishwasher where you could only use the manufacturer's dishes, you would expect another manufacturer to make compatible dishes. Like, if you have a K-cup machine - now the patents have expired. There's lots of people who are making pods for your K-cup coffeemaker. And. . . CORNISH: So the idea is consumers would say that's ridiculous. I'm going to go with another product. DOCTOROW: Sure. Yeah, I'm a grown-up. CORNISH: But you say here when it comes to tech and these platforms, the platforms have real control. What's the difference? What's going on there? DOCTOROW: Well, so what happened is in 1998, we passed this law called the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the DMCA. And what it says is that it's against the law to remove a lock even if you own the copyright to the work the lock is protecting. So, you know, one of the big publishers right now - Hachette - they've always insisted on digital locks on their e-books. And they're in a pricing dispute with Amazon, who wants to take more of the money that they're generating through their books. And under normal circumstances, if Amazon decided not to sell Hachette's books, you would expect Hachette to say to all of the people who want to read J. K. Rowling or Amanda Palmer's new book here's a tool that lets you convert your e-books to run on iBooks or on Google Play or on Kobo or on Nook. Go ahead and just switch to someone else's store and buy your books there. But because only Amazon is allowed to unlock Hachette's books, even though Hachette controls the copyright, Amazon controls the lock, Amazon now runs that negotiation. They have all the negotiating leverage. And what happens is the rightful share of the investor is expropriated by the platform. CORNISH: So talk to us about what kind of digital copyright do you think would be fair in this kind of environment that would make more sense at least to the creators, right? DOCTOROW: So we can easily see how you could make a digital locks rule that didn't do this crazy thing. What you would say is that it's against the law to break a digital lock if you're violating copyright. And if you're not violating copyright, it's not against the law to break a digital lock. And that would - that would solve the problem pretty handily because then we could make tools that let people do things that are illegal, but that the manufacturer doesn't want them to do, which is a time-honored tradition, you know, whether that's plugging things into your cigarette lighter in your car that the manufacturer never intended for you to do or using your blender to mix paint. You know, what we do with our stuff is our own business. And if we break the law, then maybe we get punished. But just using a product in an unintended way shouldn't be a felony. But I think the industry can and should sit down with its regulators and work out what the rules should be. The point is that if you have to care about copyright in order to just walk around in the world or use the Internet, then something is deeply wrong. CORNISH: Given all you've described, copyright is not dead. There's still some way to have kind of rules for the road. Can you talk about some ideas - what you think those will be or could be going forward? DOCTOROW: Yeah, of course. I mean, once we give up on the idea of applying copyright to normal people and we limit it to the industry, we know how to regulate the industry because we know where they all live. And historically, the way that we have managed contexts in which it no longer became possible to control individual uses was to just let people pay once to use everything and then use statistical analysis to figure out who the money went to. So if you're at a radio station, you drop the needle. You don't call the record label to find out how much it's going to cost you to play a song. You just pay a single fee, and then you figure out statistically at the end of the quarter whose music was played. And the money is dispersed that way. And the important thing is that as imperfect as this solution is, it's way more perfect than adding censorship and surveillance to the Internet in the name of making sure that people listen to music the right way. CORNISH: What role did we play in this as the audience? I mean, every time we all sort of shrugged at the fact that Apple said you can only use this software or, you know, we downloaded a music program and it was only in one format and couldn't be played elsewhere. It seems like we all sort of agreed collectively to that trade-off. DOCTOROW: Well, I think we agreed in the sense that when you click that I-agree button at the bottom of, you know 7,000 words of abusive legalese every time you try to do something on the Internet, you agreed. But I think that we shouldn't blame the public for having the intuition that if you buy something, it's yours and you will be allowed to use it in new ways. You know, when we bought CDs, we could only play them. And now we can rip them and we can use them as alarm tones and ring tones and we can stream them and back them up and do all kinds of other things with them. If you want to listen to a CD on your phone, you just rip it and load it onto your phone. You should be forgiven for not understanding that the DVD, which looks identical, is made in the same factory and is read in the same drive doesn't have that feature because removing the digital lock is illegal. And I don't think we can really blame the public for not understanding that Congress had passed this completely ridiculous law and understand what its consequences would end up being. CORNISH: Well, Cory Doctorow, thank you so much for speaking with us. DOCTOROW: Thank you.

So, you know, one of the big publishers right now - Hachette - they've always insisted on digital locks on their e-books. And they're in a pricing dispute with Amazon, who wants to take more of the money that they're generating through their books. And under normal circumstances, if Amazon decided not to sell Hachette's books, you would expect Hachette to say to all of the people who want to read J. K. Rowling or Amanda Palmer's new book here's a tool that lets you convert your e-books to run on iBooks or on Google Play or on Kobo or on Nook. Go ahead and just switch to someone else's store and buy your books there. But because only Amazon is allowed to unlock Hachette's books, even though Hachette controls the copyright, Amazon controls the lock, Amazon now runs that negotiation. They have all the negotiating leverage. And what happens is the rightful share of the investor is expropriated by the platform. CORNISH: So talk to us about what kind of digital copyright do you think would be fair in this kind of environment that would make more sense at least to the creators, right? DOCTOROW: So we can easily see how you could make a digital locks rule that didn't do this crazy thing. What you would say is that it's against the law to break a digital lock if you're violating copyright. And if you're not violating copyright, it's not against the law to break a digital lock. And that would - that would solve the problem pretty handily because then we could make tools that let people do things that are illegal, but that the manufacturer doesn't want them to do, which is a time-honored tradition, you know, whether that's plugging things into your cigarette lighter in your car that the manufacturer never intended for you to do or using your blender to mix paint. You know, what we do with our stuff is our own business. And if we break the law, then maybe we get punished. But just using a product in an unintended way shouldn't be a felony. But I think the industry can and should sit down with its regulators and work out what the rules should be. The point is that if you have to care about copyright in order to just walk around in the world or use the Internet, then something is deeply wrong. CORNISH: Given all you've described, copyright is not dead. There's still some way to have kind of rules for the road. Can you talk about some ideas - what you think those will be or could be going forward? DOCTOROW: Yeah, of course. I mean, once we give up on the idea of applying copyright to normal people and we limit it to the industry, we know how to regulate the industry because we know where they all live. And historically, the way that we have managed contexts in which it no longer became possible to control individual uses was to just let people pay once to use everything and then use statistical analysis to figure out who the money went to. So if you're at a radio station, you drop the needle. You don't call the record label to find out how much it's going to cost you to play a song. You just pay a single fee, and then you figure out statistically at the end of the quarter whose music was played. And the money is dispersed that way. And the important thing is that as imperfect as this solution is, it's way more perfect than adding censorship and surveillance to the Internet in the name of making sure that people listen to music the right way. CORNISH: What role did we play in this as the audience? I mean, every time we all sort of shrugged at the fact that Apple said you can only use this software or, you know, we downloaded a music program and it was only in one format and couldn't be played elsewhere. It seems like we all sort of agreed collectively to that trade-off. DOCTOROW: Well, I think we agreed in the sense that when you click that I-agree button at the bottom of, you know 7,000 words of abusive legalese every time you try to do something on the Internet, you agreed. But I think that we shouldn't blame the public for having the intuition that if you buy something, it's yours and you will be allowed to use it in new ways. You know, when we bought CDs, we could only play them. And now we can rip them and we can use them as alarm tones and ring tones and we can stream them and back them up and do all kinds of other things with them. If you want to listen to a CD on your phone, you just rip it and load it onto your phone. You should be forgiven for not understanding that the DVD, which looks identical, is made in the same factory and is read in the same drive doesn't have that feature because removing the digital lock is illegal. And I don't think we can really blame the public for not understanding that Congress had passed this completely ridiculous law and understand what its consequences would end up being.

Tom and his brother Ray became famous as \"Click and Clack, the Tappet Brothers\" on the weekly NPR show, \"Car Talk. \" They bantered, told jokes, laughed and sometimes, even gave pretty good advice to listeners who called in with their car troubles. Tom Magliozzi died this morning of complications from Alzheimer's. He was 77 years old. NPR's Lynn Neary has this remembrance. LYNN NEARY, BYLINE: If there was one thing that defined Tom Magliozzi more than anything, it was his laugh. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TOM MAGLOZZI: (Laughter). NEARY: It was loud. It was constant. It was infectious. DOUG BERMAN: His laugh is the working definition of infectious laughter. NEARY: Doug Berman has been the producer of \"Car Talk\" since 1987. He remembers the first time he ever encounter Tom Magliozzi. BERMAN: Before I ever met him, I heard him. And it wasn't on the air. It was - I'd be working in the station - I was the news director at the time, and I'd just hear this laughter. And then there'd be more of it, and people would sort of gather around him. He was just kind of a magnet. NEARY: The Magliozzi brothers grew up in a tough neighborhood of East Cambridge, in a close-knitted, Italian family. Tom was 12 years older - the beloved, older brother to Ray. They liked to act like they were just a couple of regular guys who happened to be mechanics, but both of them graduated from MIT. After getting out of college, Tom went to work as an engineer. One day, he had a kind of epiphany as he told graduates when he and Ray gave the 1999 commencement address their alma mater. He was on his way to work when he had a near fatal accident with a tractor-trailer. He pulled off the road and decided to do something different with his life. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MAGLOZZI: I quit my job. I became a bum. I spent two years sitting in Harvard Square drinking coffee. I invented the concept of the do-it-yourself, auto repair shop. And I met my lovely wife. NEARY: Well, he wasn't exactly a bum. He worked as a consultant and college professor - eventually getting his Ph. D. in marketing. And Tom and Ray did open that do-it-yourself, repair shop in the early '70's. They called it Hacker's Heaven. Later, they opened a more traditional, car repair shop called The Good News Garage. They got into radio by accident when someone from the local public radio station, WBUR, was putting together a panel of car mechanics for a talk show. BERMAN: You know, they called Ray, and Ray thought it was a dumb idea so he said I'll send my brother. And Tom thought, great, I'll get out of, you know, breaking my knuckles for a couple hours. And he went over, and he was the only one who showed up. NEARY: Doug Berman says the station liked what Tom did and asked him to come back the next week. This time he brought Ray. The rest, as they say, is history. In 1987, \"Car Talk\" went national on NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST, \"CAR TALK\")MAGLOZZI: Hello, and welcome to \"Car Talk\" on National Public Radio with us, \"Click and Clack, The Tappet Brothers,\" and we're broadcasting this week from the observation deck here at \"Car Talk\" plaza.

NEARY: When it came to cars, Berman says, the brothers really did know what they were talking about. But he says, that's not why people listened to the show. BERMAN: I think it has very little to do with cars. It's the guy's personalities. It's, you know - and Tom especially. He's really a genius with a great facile mind, and he's mischievous. He likes to prod people into honest. NEARY: Berman remembers the time a woman called in because she had failed to pay a toll on a bridge and was worried about getting caught. Tom had the idea of calling the person in charge of the bridge. The ensuing conversation is hilarious.

Your cell phone probably adjusted automatically, but maybe the clock in your car did not leading to brief panic. Am I late for work? In the first of an occasional exploration of time that we're calling Tick-Tock, NPR's Geoff Brumfiel reports that sort of momentary confusion is nothing compared to the confusion facing researchers who study time. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: Here's the first question - what is time? O'BRIAN: My own personal opinion is that time is a human construct. BRUMFIEL: Tom O'Brian's opinion matters. He keeps time at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. O'BRIAN: It's a way that we as humans have developed to try to understand and put some order in this very fascinating and complex universe around us. BRUMFIEL: We bring order using clocks. And O'Brian oversees America's master clock, one of the most accurate clocks on the planet. O'BRIAN: And it is accurate to the equivalent of about 0. 000000000000001. I think I said it right, but I might've miscounted (laughter). BRUMFIEL: Put another way, this clock could tick for 300 million years and stay accurate to within a second, but here's the crazy thing. . . O'BRIAN: We can measure time much better than the weight of something or an electrical current, but what time really is a question that I can't answer for you, and I'm embarrassed to say that as chief of the Time and Frequency Division. But I feel I'm in good company because even people like Albert Einstein would readily admit that he didn't really understand what time was. BRUMFIEL: Maybe it's because we don't understand it that we keep trying to measure it more accurately, and why at the nearby University of Colorado they're developing a clock to end all clocks. So I'm standing in the basement of the University of Colorado Boulder, and it's just chaos - wires hanging from the ceiling, wires on all the tables, wires held up with binder clips. I mean, I have never seen such a mess. And this is the home of the most accurate clock on the planet. (SOUNDBITE OF CLOCK TICKING)BRUMFIEL: Actually this tangle of wires and lasers is the clock. It's spread out on a giant table, parts of it wrapped in shiny foil. There's tinfoil, man. How can the most accurate clock on the planet depend on tinfoil? TRAVIS NICHOLSON: Well, first of all that's research-grade tinfoil, so. . . BRUMFIEL: Graduate students Travis Nicholson and Sara Campbell keep the clock running day-to-day. Do you guys really know where all these wires go? SARA CAMPBELL: I think half of them go nowhere. NICHOLSON: Yeah. We can trace them out if we need to. BRUMFIEL: At its heart, this new clock is actually just atoms of an element called strontium. Strontium vibrates at an incredibly fast frequency. It's a natural, atomic metronome ticking out teeny, teeny fractions of a second. Jun Ye is the scientist who built this clock. He says it could keep perfect time for 5 billion years. JUN YE: It's about the whole entire age of the Earth. BRUMFIEL: So if this clock were running since the start of the age of the Earth, it would have the time down to within a second? YE: Right. And our aim is that we'll have a clock that would - during the entire age of the universe, would not have lost a second. BRUMFIEL: But this perfect clock has run into a big problem because this thing we call time doesn't tick at the same rate everywhere in the universe or even on our planet. On top of Mount Everest, time is passing just a little bit faster than it does in Death Valley. That's because the speed at which to time passes depends on the strength of gravity. You don't need to take this to extremes either. If you take a clock off the floor and hang on the wall. . . YE: The time will speed up by about one part in 10 to the 16. BRUMFIEL: One part in 10 to the 16 is a sliver of a second, but this isn't some effect of gravity on the clock's machinery. Time itself is flowing more quickly on the wall than on the floor. These differences didn't really matter till now, but this clock is so sensitive little changes in height throw it way off. YE: So we're talking about lifting up a couple centimeters and you will start to see that difference. BRUMFIEL: This new clock can sense the pace of time speeding up as it moves inch by inch away from the earth's core, and that's a problem because to actually use time, you need different clocks to agree on the time. Think about it - if I say let's meet at 3:30, we use our watches, but imagine a world in which your watch starts to tick faster because you're working on the floor above me. Your 3:30 happens earlier than mine. This clock works like that. Tiny shifts in the Earth's crust can throw it off even when it's sitting still. And two of them will never agree. YE: At this level, maintaining absolute timescale on Earth is in fact turning into nightmare. BRUMFIEL: This nightmare clock they've built doesn't just look chaotic; it's turning our sense of time into chaos. But Chief Timekeeper Tom O'Brian isn't worried about all this because as confusing as these clocks are, they're going to be really useful. O'BRIAN: Scientists can make these clocks into exquisite devices for sensing a whole bunch of different things. BRUMFIEL: They're getting so sensitive to gravity. Maybe they can map the interior of the Earth or detect gravitational waves from black holes and exploding stars. They could change our view of the universe. They just might not be able to tells what time it is. Geoff Brumfiel, NPR News. DAVID GREENE, HOST:   The days after the end of Daylight Saving Time can be a bit confusing.

It's a natural, atomic metronome ticking out teeny, teeny fractions of a second. Jun Ye is the scientist who built this clock. He says it could keep perfect time for 5 billion years. JUN YE: It's about the whole entire age of the Earth. BRUMFIEL: So if this clock were running since the start of the age of the Earth, it would have the time down to within a second? YE: Right. And our aim is that we'll have a clock that would - during the entire age of the universe, would not have lost a second. BRUMFIEL: But this perfect clock has run into a big problem because this thing we call time doesn't tick at the same rate everywhere in the universe or even on our planet. On top of Mount Everest, time is passing just a little bit faster than it does in Death Valley. That's because the speed at which to time passes depends on the strength of gravity. You don't need to take this to extremes either. If you take a clock off the floor and hang on the wall. . . YE: The time will speed up by about one part in 10 to the 16. BRUMFIEL: One part in 10 to the 16 is a sliver of a second, but this isn't some effect of gravity on the clock's machinery. Time itself is flowing more quickly on the wall than on the floor. These differences didn't really matter till now, but this clock is so sensitive little changes in height throw it way off. YE: So we're talking about lifting up a couple centimeters and you will start to see that difference. BRUMFIEL: This new clock can sense the pace of time speeding up as it moves inch by inch away from the earth's core, and that's a problem because to actually use time, you need different clocks to agree on the time. Think about it - if I say let's meet at 3:30, we use our watches, but imagine a world in which your watch starts to tick faster because you're working on the floor above me. Your 3:30 happens earlier than mine. This clock works like that. Tiny shifts in the Earth's crust can throw it off even when it's sitting still. And two of them will never agree. YE: At this level, maintaining absolute timescale on Earth is in fact turning into nightmare. BRUMFIEL: This nightmare clock they've built doesn't just look chaotic; it's turning our sense of time into chaos. But Chief Timekeeper Tom O'Brian isn't worried about all this because as confusing as these clocks are, they're going to be really useful. O'BRIAN: Scientists can make these clocks into exquisite devices for sensing a whole bunch of different things. BRUMFIEL: They're getting so sensitive to gravity. Maybe they can map the interior of the Earth or detect gravitational waves from black holes and exploding stars. They could change our view of the universe. They just might not be able to tells what time it is. Geoff Brumfiel, NPR News.", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2014 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Judith Newman wrote in The New York Times that a talking phone made life easier for her 13-year-old son, Gus, who has autism. Now Judith Newman brings her story to us. JUDITH NEWMAN, BYLINE: The thing I've learned about people with autism over time is that many of them have a connection with machines that the rest of us don't. I recognized this when my son was quite young. He was 8 years old, and I got him an iPod. And if he knew I was going to the Apple Store, he would take his iPod with him. And one day I said, Gus, why is the iPod here? And he said so he could visit his friends. Like any mother of a child who's autistic, there are times in your life when you - your head is about to explode from answering questions, questions that are often very repetitive. I say this because one day I was sitting at home, and I had just read one of those BuzzFeed lists - 21 things you can do with your iPhone. If you asked Siri, what planes are above my head right now? SIRI: OK. Check it out. NEWMAN: Delta is above my head at 22,900 feet etc. , etc. I kind of thought, why would anybody need to know this? And my son, Gus, said, well, mommy, so you know you who you're waving at. So at that moment he came over, and he saw that he could do the same thing. He saw he could check these flights and that was kind of thrilling to him. And then you saw that he could have conversations with Siri. And it started very simply. He would sort of say, hi, Siri, how are you doing? SIRI: Very well. Thank you. NEWMAN: He might say, show me pictures of turtles. SIRI: Here are some images of turtles I found on the web. NEWMAN: And then he'd get very excited because he had all sorts of turtles in front of him. It was a good life. She is a way for him to practice all sorts of conversations safely. Now he may be corrected sometimes. You're not giving me the thing I want. SIRI: OK. If you insist. NEWMAN: You're not listening to me. SIRI: Unfortunately, I am as yet imperfect. NEWMAN: The thing about machines is that they are infinitely patient - human beings not so much, mom definitely not so much. And when you're talking about kids who don't understand human interaction perfectly, this is a wonderful way to learn it. One day I heard him say the following to her - you're a really nice computer. SIRI: Gus, you're sweet. NEWMAN: Siri, would you marry me? SIRI: You should know that you're not the only one who's asked. NEWMAN: I'm a kid now, but will you marry me some day?

That is no longer a mystery. New episodes don't arrive until the end of 2015, but today the BBC releases a new, deluxe box-set containing all three seasons of \"Sherlock\" with outtakes, interviews, even mini busts of the two leading men, so you can feel like you're talking to actor Benedict Cumberbatch. NPR TV critic Eric Deggans actually did. ERIC DEGGANS, BYLINE: When I sat down with Benedict Cumberbatch to talk about \"Sherlock,\" the first thing on his mind wasn't exactly the show. BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH: I'm really worried about those \"Sherlock\" fans because they have been here probably for a while. DEGGANS: A small but enthusiastic group had gathered outside the hotel where we were meeting, and Cumberbatch wanted to make sure his assistants reached out to them. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: You can see them. . . CUMBERBATCH: Are they still there? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: . . . They're still there. . . CUMBERBATCH: Do they know that I'm going to go say - all right. OK. All right. . . UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: They're still there. . . CUMBERBATCH: . . . OK. All right. DEGGANS: This attention to fans seems a natural reflex for Cumberbatch, but it's also a key to the show's success. Producers have earned a massive audience by shaping Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Holmes into a compelling character for modern viewers. \"Sherlock's\" last season gave hungry fans more information than ever about the mysterious detective's history - details Cumberbatch recites like of one of Sherlock's famous speeches filled with deductions. CUMBERBATCH: You find out about Sherlock's background. You find out that he comes truly stable home. It was a gesture in the first episode, but you see that in practice in the third. You see that, as a boy, he was deeply insecure, and that comes back to haunt him, and he feels like a child. DEGGANS: Cumberbatch suspected these storylines came from early conversations with one of the show's producers, Steven Moffat. CUMBERBATCH: I mean, immediately, as an actor, I wanted to understand who he was, what his parents were. I mean, these were questions I asked, and these were background questions that I wanted to understand. You know, he was just talking about, can't this guy just be good at what he does? And he's your age, and he looks like you, and he's doing his thing. And I'm like, no, no, no, there's a process I've got to go through here, Steven. I've got to understand how I became this person. DEGGANS: One other thing Cumberbatch insisted on was creating a weakness for Sherlock - his inability to connect with people - another idea Moffat resisted. CUMBERBATCH: And he said, but couldn't he just be really good? Couldn't he just - you know, just be good at it? Why does he have to have a flaw or Achilles' heel? 'Cause I said, you know, where is his weakness? I said, because no human being doesn't, and he is a human being. And however much he tries to convince himself that he's not, he is. DEGGANS: Cumberbatch says those early conversations flowered into the show's third season, featuring a look at Sherlock's parents, played by the star's real mother and father, and his unique personality, revealed in a climactic scene with the last episode's villain that ends with a gunshot. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"SHERLOCK\")CUMBERBATCH: (As Sherlock Holmes) Oh, do your research. I'm not a hero. I'm a high-functioning sociopath. Merry Christmas. (SOUNDBITE OF GUNSHOT)CUMBERBATCH: All he's resorting to at the end is violence. It's the weakest, weakest thing to do. So for me, I think that exposes more about Sherlock.

(SOUNDBITE OF INTERVIEW)STEVEN MOFFAT: He's got the one explainable superpower that's out there, and he deduces things. He actually goes to the trouble to explain it. Now, Superman never tells you how he flies, but Sherlock Holmes tells you how the trick is done.

We followed its journey from a Montana museum to the Smithsonian earlier this year. It's named after the Montana rancher who found it, and it is the first nearly complete T. rex skeleton at the Smithsonian. NPR's Christopher Joyce has this update. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: The Wankel is destined to be the centerpiece for the new dinosaur hall at the National Museum of Natural History. But when it arrived at the museum, it was in pieces in packing crates. Rebecca Kaczkowski was on the welcoming committee. REBECCA KACZKOWSKI: We went up one freight elevator, came over to the rex room, dropped off the crates, yes. JOYCE: And here they are, right here behind you. KACZKOWSKI: Yep. JOYCE: Please do not touch the crates, it says. The rex room, as you might expect, is a very large workshop. Museum goers can look in and watch the scientists working on the skeleton. The first task is rehabbing the bones. They need work because when they were first discovered, they were in fragments. Kaczkowski says they've been glued together and sculpted with fillers to re-create their original shape. KACZKOWSKI: Since they've come out of the ground, we have done various preparation techniques and added man-made materials to them. All of those things have a lifetime, and that lifetime is much less than 67 million years. JOYCE: Preparators have to be sure that the glued-together bones will stand up to the stress of being mounted again. They're also scanning each bone with a device that looks like the one that reads the barcode on your groceries. That's Jon Blundell's job. JON BLUNDELL: We've never had such a complete T. rex here. It's a total blast. JOYCE: And not at all like scanning groceries. BLUNDELL: You can actually see new teeth in the jaw that are coming out. JOYCE: Un-erupted teeth still in the jaw. T. rex used to lose a lot of teeth. You can understand why given its feeding habits. So it was always growing new ones. The scans will produce a digital skeleton of the dinosaur. Then preparators will re-construct the whole animal virtually and then once more in the flesh, or at least the bone. The digital version will also be available on the Web. Preparator Steve Jabo says there are still things to be learned from the fossil, even though T. rex has been known for over a century. STEVE JABO: Who would've known we were going to be doing CT scanning or surface scans and stuff like that - or even being able to find, you know, evidence of color in feather impressions and stuff like that. JOYCE: Take the giant skull, for example. Matt Carrano, the curator of dinosaurs at the museum, says most T. rex skulls are either fragmentary or whole. MATT CARRANO: This one's actually fallen apart. So you get a good view of all the different sides of all the different bones. And that's a really important aspect to understanding how it goes together - how it functions. JOYCE: The digital version is all the Smithsonian scientists have at the moment. The bones have just been shipped to Canada - to one of the world's leading teams of dinosaur builders. They are constructing a huge armature that will cradle the re-assembled bones in a standing position. That will take two years, and two more years, to set it up back in Washington, D. C. In the meantime, Carrano is putting together the written material that museum goers will read as the Wankel looms over them. He says, in the past, the gist of the message was, gee, isn't T. rex big and scary? Carrano wants to tell a more nuanced story. CARRANO: We talk more about what a T. rex really is. You know, it's a predator. It's an apex predator. That means it has a job to do in its ecosystem. It lives with all these other animals, right? It's not all by itself. So for us, we try to write things that provide a context for the things that they're seeing. JOYCE: A giant, meat-eating dinosaur just trying to fit in with the crowd. Christopher Joyce, NPR News.

Obama reiterated that the FCC is an independent agency, but now he is calling on the Commission to take a very specific action and as NPR's Joel Rose reports, that could be a very big deal. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: In the video, the president is clear that he wants the FCC to craft rules that will protect net neutrality - the idea that your Internet service provider has to treat all the traffic flowing to your phone or computer equally- and he's also very clear about how he wants the Commission to do it. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO MESSAGE)OBAMA: I'm asking the FCC to reclassify Internet service under title two of a law known as the Telecommunications Act. In plain English, I'm asking them to recognize that for most Americans the Internet has become an essential part of everyday communication and everyday life. ROSE: Titled two - pretty arcane stuff, but it's arcane stuff that's going to set off major fireworks in Washington because it gets at one of the most fundamental questions about the Internet. What is it? Is it a utility like your old-fashioned landline phone? (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE RINGING)ROSE: Or is it more like cable television? (SOUNDBITE OF TV AD)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: This is where we bring together the fastest Internet and the best in entertainment. ROSE: For roughly the past two decades the FCC has treated the Internet more like cable TV and imposed very little regulation. What the White House is proposing would be a major shift, giving the government more power to regulate broadband under the Telecommunications Act of 1934. ROBERT MCDOWELL: What they're doing here is saying America's high-tech policy for the future is going to be to retrofit an 80-year-old law onto it and that's going to produce a lot of unfortunate results. ROSE: Robert McDowell is a former FCC commissioner who's now a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute. He says cable and telecom companies and their Republican allies in the new Congress will certainly fight the Commission if it goes in the direction the president wants. MCDOWELL: The FCC and the president had an opportunity to find bipartisan compromise here and they've rejected it. ROSE: The agency has been trying for years to craft open Internet rules, but each time they've been struck down by the courts. Earlier this year, FFC chairman Tom Wheeler proposed allowing broadband providers to make special deals with content companies like Netflix or Amazon to deliver their data faster. RICHARD BENNETT: I think Chairman Wheeler's first attempt to craft a set of rules was the right approach. ROSE: Richard Bennett is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. He says heavy-handed regulation will hurt more than it helps. BENNETT: The fundamental difference between the Internet and public utilities is that we expect the Internet to improve. ROSE: In other words, to get faster. Wheeler's plan had some support from the industry, but public interest groups rejected it as net neutrality in name only. The FCC was flooded with nearly 4 million public comments, mostly against Wheeler's plan. Tim Wu is a law professor at Columbia University who says the FCC needs all the authority it can get to prevent broadband companies from prioritizing services they like and slowing down services they don't, including their competitors. TIM WU: No blocking Netflix, no trying to kill that company because you don't like them and it's ultimately the consumers continue to get what Internet's given them, which is better stuff for cheaper. ROSE: What had been a fairly wonky debate took a big step into the political spotlight today with President Obama's announcement. His Republican critics were quick to push back. Texas Senator Ted Cruz called net neutrality quote, \"Obamacare for the Internet,\" unquote. In a statement, the FFC chairman hinted that the Commission would take its time drafting new open Internet rules. A major fight in Congress and the courts is waiting. Joel Rose, NPR News, New York. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  President Obama says it's time for the Federal Communications Commission to regulate the Internet as a public utility to keep it free and open. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO MESSAGE) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: There are no gatekeepers deciding which sites you get to access. There are no toll roads on the information superhighway. This set of principles, the idea of net neutrality, has unleashed the power of the Internet and given innovators the chance to thrive. Abandoning these principles would threaten to end the Internet as we know it. SIEGEL: The White House posted that video message today.

At issue are the wireless microphones that those diverse entities use and the broadcast frequencies they share - frequencies the FCC wants to sell. Cellular and other wireless data carriers are eager to buy them. The planned sale is being challenged in federal court because, as Rick Karr reports, broadcasters and others are worried that they won't be able to use the little mics that they now depend on. RICK KARR, BYLINE: Rick Chinn remembers when wireless microphones were not reliable. In the mid-1970s, he was doing sound at a venue in Seattle for everything from Amway meetings to concerts by Henry Mancini, The Temptations and others. The venue owned a wireless mic. RICK CHINN: People wanted to use it 'cause it was wireless. And we'd go you really sure you want to do this? KARR: It used the same band of frequencies as FM radio stations so interference was an issue. It would also drift off of its frequency and cause the PA system to blast the audience with noise. Today's wireless mics are much more reliable, in part, because many of them use vacant UHF television channels with very little potential for interference. The Federal Communications Commission estimates that around 4 million wireless mics are in use nationwide at everything from kids' birthday parties to pro sports events. (SOUNDBITE OF FOOTBALL GAME)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Ruling on the field is that we did have a completed pass. KARR: The NFL can use dozens of wireless mics during a single game for officials, coaches and staff. The league is lobbying the FCC to let it keep its frequencies. It's part of a coalition that includes TV journalists, arts venues and the people behind Broadway shows. TOM FERRUGIA: You have backstage communications. You've got cue controls. You've got equipment that moves. KARR: Tom Ferrugia is in charge of government relations for the trade group the Broadway League. FERRUGIA: When a trapdoor opens, those cue controls are being transmitted wirelessly throughout the house. All of that is seamless and happens in the background and no one's really aware of how it's done. It just seems to be magic. KARR: That's why The Lion King, for example, uses more than a hundred wireless mics onstage and off for every performance. Broadway's worried that in order to sell off the frequencies wireless mics use now, the FCC will require users to invest in new receivers, transmitters and antennas that could cost thousands of dollars apiece and might be larger and harder to hide on performers. FERRUGIA: The equipment that's out there now is perfect. The spectrum that we're using now is perfect for that. KARR: Radio frequencies are not all created equal. Sound waves are similar. When I play some music. . . (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KARR: If you're listening near the speakers you can hear everything, but if I step away and outside my office and close the door behind me - only the lower frequencies come through. The frequencies that wireless mics use now are like those lower frequencies - they're good at penetrating buildings. That's one of the reasons why Broadway likes them, but it's also why cellular providers want to buy them, and why others use them. VINKO ERCEG: These frequencies are very, very important. KARR: Vinko Erceg is a senior technical director at Brodcom - it makes wireless semi-conductor chips for a new generation of Wi-Fi transmitters and receivers that can use the microphone's frequencies. Erceg says the new devices are better than older Wi-Fi equipment because they're signals travel at least twice as far. ERCEG: Then I can extend my range into my garden and sit there with my laptop and iPad and have this really nice range. At this point, I have very hard time receiving anything outside my home. KARR: Those new Wi-Fi transmitters and receivers can easily move to new frequencies, but most wireless mics can't. The last time the FCC auctioned off frequencies five years ago audio engineer Rick Chinn had just bought new mics. CHINN: Four channels, top of the pile, and it probably cost me, I don't know, two grand a channel. KARR: After the FCC sold the frequencies, that $8,000 worth of gear was illegal to operate and it wasn't built for other frequencies. Chinn could only afford to replace two, so the other two. . . CHINN: They're holding down a corner of the shelf in my shop. KARR: Chinn says the money he lost is nothing compared to what the treasury took in from that spectrum auction - nearly $20 billion. That helped convince Congress to order the FCC to sell more frequencies. Chinn knows a thing or two about broadcast frequencies because he has a ham radio license. He worries that if the government keeps selling off frequencies, the wireless mics of the future might be as unreliable as the one he remembers from the 1970s. CHINN: There's only so much space and we're getting crammed into it. It's kind of like living in Manhattan. KARR: The FCC is expected to decide about wireless mics early next year.

Few departments require officers to wear these cameras, but that's changing. Proponents argue that the cameras benefit police and public alike by documenting officers' interactions. And there's a third party that stands to benefit from this surge of interest - the companies that manufacture the cameras. Bram Sable-Smith of member station KBIA in Columbia reports. BRAM SABLE-SMITH, BYLINE: It's a gray afternoon in Columbia, Missouri, and Officer Cory Dawkins is escorting a man to jail who's charged with endangering a child. He pushes a button on his body camera to start recording, then exits his patrol car and walks him inside the jail house. He signs papers, talks shop with the guards and returns to his vehicle. While Dawkins and need his camera for this process, he's glad he has one especially after what happened in Ferguson about an hour and a half away. CORY DAWKINS: Unfortunately, that officer in Ferguson did not have a body camera, or we might not be having this conversation. We might not have had all the mayhem that's happened in Ferguson if he had been wearing a body camera. SABLE-SMITH: Sixteen days before the Ferguson shooting, Columbia's Police Department announced it was equipping all of its officers with body cameras made by Taser International. The cost was about $130,000 up front for hardware and software and then $40,000 every year after that for digital storage. As Assistant Chief John Gordon says, while that's a lot of money, with a smaller force it's feasible. JOHN GORDON: That's also for a hundred officers. Well, St. Louis County, St. Louis City - I don't know how many officers those - but I mean, that's huge - a huge investment. SABLE-SMITH: And Gordon worries that the attention generated by events in Ferguson may force other departments to make some difficult tradeoffs. GORDON: One of our fundamentals is to provide services to our taxpayers - our fundamentals is to protect our officers and our employees. Another one of our fundamentals is to make sure that we have a good, trained staff. And those things should never be sacrificed for technology. SABLE-SMITH: But more attention is a good thing for Dan Behrendt, chief financial officer at Taser International, the dominant player in the officer body camera market. DAN BEHRENDT: It's a really exciting time for Taser, and certainly, all the momentum we're seeing in our wearable camera business is fun to talk about. SABLE-SMITH: In its first earnings report since Ferguson, Taser said bookings for camera and digital evidence storage nearly tripled from the same period last year. And post-Ferguson, Behrendt says the number of agencies seeking out Taser cameras - something he calls inbound activity - is surging. BEHRENDT: The two weeks after Ferguson, we saw about a 10-X increase in inbound active duty, and that sort of sustained at about a 2-X what, you know, the previous level was. SABLE-SMITH: Steve Dyer has covered Taser for seven years as an analyst at Craig-Hallum Capital in Minneapolis. He says with about 1 million sworn police officers in the U. S. , there are lots of sales opportunities. STEVE DYER: It's a bit of a land grab. And by that I mean that I think a lot of these deals, you know, will happen - will be won in the next 12 to 18 months. SABLE-SMITH: Dyer says Taser is positioned well to expand quickly to match demand, in part because it already sells police departments the weapons that share its name. The new demand is also luring others into the market. Assistant chief Gordon says in just the past few months, he's seen new companies introducing competing technology. GORDON: We're in a three-year contract with Taser, but in two to two and a half years, we're going to start seeing what technology is out there. SABLE-SMITH: And when the time to comes to renew their contract, Gordon is hopeful that the new generation of cameras will be much cheaper. For NPR News, I'm Bram Sable-Smith in Columbia, Missouri.

These were pictures of women used to balance skin color when printing photographs. They were named for the original model who was an employee at Kodak. And for years, all the models were white. In the latest installment of our series on color in the arts, NPR's Mandalit Del Barco looks at the history of Shirley cards. MANDALIT DEL BARCO, BYLINE: Jersson Garcia works at Richard Photo Lab in Hollywood. He's 31 years old, and he's got a total crush on Shirley. JERSSON GARCIA: Beautiful skin tones, beautiful eyes, great hair. She's gorgeous. (Laughter). DEL BARCO: He's holding a 4-by-6 photo of an ivory-faced brunette wearing a lacy off-the-shoulders top, red lipstick, silver earrings. The photo appears to have been taken sometime in the 1970s or '80s. For many years, this card was used by photo labs to calibrate skin tones, shadows and light. GARCIA: She was a standard. So whenever we printed anything, we had to pull Shirley in. If Shirley looked good, everything else was OK. If Shirley didn't look so hot that day, we had to tweak something. Something was wrong. DEL BARCO: Shirley cards go back to the mid-1950s. At the time, Kodak sold almost all the color film used in the U. S. After a customer shot the film, they'd bring the roll to a Kodak store to be printed. In 1954, the federal government stepped in to break up Kodak's monopoly. Ray DeMoulin ran the company's photo tech division. RAY DEMOULIN: Kodak consented to take the price of processing and printing the film out, and that meant that we needed to develop a printer that was small enough to go into small finishing labs. DEL BARCO: Under DeMoulin's direction, Kodak came up with its S5 printer for independent photo labs. And to make sure the colors and densities of the prints were calibrated correctly, Kodak sent out a kit with color prints and original, unexposed negatives. DEMOULIN: So that when they processed their negative, they could match their print with our print. It was almost a foolproof operation. DEL BARCO: Each reference card was an original shot of Shirley Page, who worked as a studio model for Kodak's new products. DEMOULIN: They would take hundreds of pictures. And of course, she had to have her eyes open and be smiling. And it was days in the studio. And sometimes we'd have to take a day off to give the model an eye rest. (Laughter). DEL BARCO: He says the Shirley cards were used all over the world. DEMOULIN: It was just known as the Shirley. And it didn't make any difference which model came in later to do it. It was still called the Shirley. DEL BARCO: DeMoulin eventually became a vice president of Kodak. He says he lost track of the original Shirley after she got married and left the company. NPR tried for months to find her without success. But over the years, subsequent Shirleys have been equally as anonymous - sometimes wearing pearls, gloves, hats, even swimming suits for beach scenes. In the early days, all of them were white and often tagged with the word normal. LORNA ROTH: The people who were producing the cards had a particular image of beauty captured in the Shirley card. DEL BARCO: Lorna Roth is a media professor at Concordia University in Canada who has researched the history of Kodak's Shirley cards. ROTH: At the time in the '50s, the people who were buying cameras were mostly Caucasian people. And so I guess they didn't see the need for the market to expand to a broader range of skin tones. DEL BARCO: Roth says the dynamic range of the film, both still photo stock and motion picture, was biased towards white skin. In 1978, the filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard famously refused to use Kodak film to shoot in Mozambique because he declared the film was racist. People also complain that photos of blacks and whites in the same shot would turn out partially under- or overexposed.

RACHEL KUSHNER: (Reading) Some of the China girls smiled, most stared into the camera with a faint, taught bemusement just under the surface of their expressions. DEL BARCO: Kushner says the China girls were most certainly not Chinese, and like the early Shirleys, they had porcelain skin.

DEL BARCO: In the 1970s, photographer Jim Lyon joined Kodak's first photo tech division and research laboratories. He says the company recognized there was a problem with the all-white Shirley cards. JIM LYON: I started incorporating black models pretty heavily in our testing, and it caught on very quickly. It wasn't a big deal. It just seemed like this was the right thing to do. I wasn't attempting to be politically correct. I was just trying to give us a chance of making a better film, one that reproduced everybody's skin tone in an appropriate way. DEL BARCO: By then, other film companies had their own versions of Shirley cards. And Kodak started making multiracial norm-reference cards - black, Asian, Latina and white Shirleys. Then came digital photography. Kodak went bankrupt in 2012 and reemerged as a much smaller technology company. By then, Kodak had stopped making the Shirley cards.

DEL BARCO: Jersson Garcia says the lab can now custom-make color palettes for clients. GARCIA: Photographers submit their own images, and we create their own Shirley for them. So we get the skin tones they like. DEL BARCO: But Garcia's beloved Shirley from the 1980s still shows up in the Kodak software the lab uses from time to time to set the machines back to neutral. GARCIA: She's still here. We haven't really gotten away from her. She keeps coming back. PYNE: He's completely obsessed. GARCIA: My wife can't know about Shirley, though. (Laughter). DEL BARCO: Surely, he jests. Mandalit Del Barco, NPR News. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  In the heyday of print photography, a key tool for developing pictures in the darkroom was something called the Shirley cards. These were pictures of women used to balance skin color when printing photographs. They were named for the original model who was an employee at Kodak. And for years, all the models were white. In the latest installment of our series on color in the arts, NPR's Mandalit Del Barco looks at the history of Shirley cards. MANDALIT DEL BARCO, BYLINE: Jersson Garcia works at Richard Photo Lab in Hollywood. He's 31 years old, and he's got a total crush on Shirley. JERSSON GARCIA: Beautiful skin tones, beautiful eyes, great hair. She's gorgeous. (Laughter). DEL BARCO: He's holding a 4-by-6 photo of an ivory-faced brunette wearing a lacy off-the-shoulders top, red lipstick, silver earrings. The photo appears to have been taken sometime in the 1970s or '80s. For many years, this card was used by photo labs to calibrate skin tones, shadows and light. GARCIA: She was a standard. So whenever we printed anything, we had to pull Shirley in. If Shirley looked good, everything else was OK. If Shirley didn't look so hot that day, we had to tweak something. Something was wrong. DEL BARCO: Shirley cards go back to the mid-1950s. At the time, Kodak sold almost all the color film used in the U. S. After a customer shot the film, they'd bring the roll to a Kodak store to be printed. In 1954, the federal government stepped in to break up Kodak's monopoly. Ray DeMoulin ran the company's photo tech division. RAY DEMOULIN: Kodak consented to take the price of processing and printing the film out, and that meant that we needed to develop a printer that was small enough to go into small finishing labs. DEL BARCO: Under DeMoulin's direction, Kodak came up with its S5 printer for independent photo labs. And to make sure the colors and densities of the prints were calibrated correctly, Kodak sent out a kit with color prints and original, unexposed negatives. DEMOULIN: So that when they processed their negative, they could match their print with our print. It was almost a foolproof operation. DEL BARCO: Each reference card was an original shot of Shirley Page, who worked as a studio model for Kodak's new products. DEMOULIN: They would take hundreds of pictures. And of course, she had to have her eyes open and be smiling. And it was days in the studio. And sometimes we'd have to take a day off to give the model an eye rest. (Laughter). DEL BARCO: He says the Shirley cards were used all over the world. DEMOULIN: It was just known as the Shirley. And it didn't make any difference which model came in later to do it. It was still called the Shirley. DEL BARCO: DeMoulin eventually became a vice president of Kodak. He says he lost track of the original Shirley after she got married and left the company. NPR tried for months to find her without success. But over the years, subsequent Shirleys have been equally as anonymous - sometimes wearing pearls, gloves, hats, even swimming suits for beach scenes. In the early days, all of them were white and often tagged with the word normal. LORNA ROTH: The people who were producing the cards had a particular image of beauty captured in the Shirley card. DEL BARCO: Lorna Roth is a media professor at Concordia University in Canada who has researched the history of Kodak's Shirley cards. ROTH: At the time in the '50s, the people who were buying cameras were mostly Caucasian people. And so I guess they didn't see the need for the market to expand to a broader range of skin tones. DEL BARCO: Roth says the dynamic range of the film, both still photo stock and motion picture, was biased towards white skin. In 1978, the filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard famously refused to use Kodak film to shoot in Mozambique because he declared the film was racist. People also complain that photos of blacks and whites in the same shot would turn out partially under- or overexposed. In her 2013 novel \"The Flamethrowers,\" author Rachel Kushner writes about so-called China girls, models used in motion picture film like the Shirley cards. RACHEL KUSHNER: (Reading) Some of the China girls smiled, most stared into the camera with a faint, taught bemusement just under the surface of their expressions.

Across the Pacific Ocean, a small country - an American ally - has provoked a big adversary. We'll call them Red, but it's impossible not to think of Red as China. Red responds aggressively, and before long, they've crippled the small country's power grid, communications networks and other infrastructure through cyber warfare. And it launches a preemptive cyber attack against the small country's big ally, the United States. How does the U. S. military respond? That was the scenario faced by a group of high-ranking officers huddled together at an Air Force base in Colorado during a classified war game in May 2010. SHANE HARRIS: It was a really instructive and, I think, very scary war-gaming exercise for people in the military. This was something called the Schriever Wargame. RATH: That's Shane Harris. He wrote about the 2010 Schriever Wargame in his new book called \"@War: The Rise Of The Military- Internet Complex. \"HARRIS: And what happened was is the adversary in this game really got the advantage very quickly and won pretty decisively, because the American side really hadn't developed a playbook for how you would go to war between two large militaries in cyberspace. So because of that the military started becoming much more organized and sophisticated in how it organizes its cyber forces. And today what you see is each of the military services setting up their own sort of cyber-warrior components that will eventually be trained to fight alongside conventional forces so that a repeat of that war game, where we were caught really flat-footed and knocked back, isn't repeated. RATH: Your book traces the rise of this military-Internet complex over the course of both the George W. Bush presidency and President Obama. Imagine I'm President Obama being sworn in. Can you run through the litany of problems with cyber defense he's presented with right away? HARRIS: Sure. And in fact, he actually got a little bit of a taste of this on the campaign, because his campaign email system was hacked presumably by spies in China. When he comes in on the first day, what he's presented with is the knowledge that the computers that control portions of the electrical power grid in the United States have been probed by foreign intelligence agencies. He is told that espionage, particularly by China against American corporations, is rampant and that billions of dollars in intellectual property and in trade secrets are being lost every year, and that basically there is no really coherent organized system in the U. S. government for how we're going to defend the Internet - how we're going to defend the cyber space and all of the businesses and the people that depend on it. What he decides to do very early on in the administration is to, in his words, start treating cyberspace as a national asset - a strategic asset - and protecting it as such. RATH: Let's talk about China, because with this new U. S. cyber warfare command, that seems like that's the main imagined adversary. Can you run through what China's cyber-warfare capabilities are, or at least what we know of them and how they stack up against what the U. S. can do? HARRIS: The thing that China has going for it that we do not have is people. The number of people within the People's Liberation Army, within the sort of the intelligence apparatus of China - which is a very, you know, opaque system in it's own right - is believed to be thousands of people who are basically hired hackers who spend much of their day aggressively trying to penetrate the computer networks of U. S. corporations, especially. China's sort of gathering information that they can then pass on to Chinese businesses and corporations that give them a leg-up in negotiations and in the global marketplace. They're trying to advance their economy very quickly and stealing information to do it. Less clear is how sophisticated their sort of military offensive apparatus is compared to ours. For instance, if China ever went to war with us in the South China Sea, let's say, how sophisticated and how good would their hackers be trying to break into our naval systems and confuse our ships. We know less about that, but I think the conclusion we have to reach is that because they have so many more people doing this than we do - I mean we have a few thousand - that China is a really formidable force. And that makes a lot of sense that they would put so many resources in this. China will never be able to, at least in the near future, challenge us in a conventional military way. They can't go head-to-head with us on land or on the sea. Cyber is a place where they can gain an extraordinary advantage and do a lot of damage. RATH: In terms of intentions and actions, though, you know, going by what President Obama has said in terms about cyber attacks, it sounds like the U. S. is more of the victim here in terms of the government and corporations that are being targeted by these Chinese hackers. I'm just wondering from having studied both sides of this, is that the case or is this more of just part of the game? How much of this - does this go both ways? HARRIS: I think it goes both ways. And in fact, I say this in the book that, you know, the United States government loves to come out and talk about how relentlessly we're being hacked and how our intellectual property is being stolen from our businesses. And that's true. But what that covers up is that we are also one of the most aggressive countries going out there breaking into other countries' systems and spying on them. And we are one of the few countries that we know of that has launched offensive operations in cyberspace. We have used computer viruses to break infrastructure - physical things that are connected to computer networks. Very few countries are known to have done that. I think one of the reasons why U. S. officials have been so keen on showing how we're victimized is because they believe that U. S. businesses have not done enough to secure their own computer networks. From the government's perspective, they can't go in and necessarily force those companies, at least not yet, to improve their defenses. So it's been sort of more of a strategic kind of rhetorical calculation on the part of the government to come out and say we are victimized. It's terrible. Lots of information is being stolen. And the only way we can stop this is you corporations have to do better security and work with us and let us help you do that. So there's a reason why the U. S. has tried to play that victim card so repeatedly. It's because they want to get results from private businesses. RATH: That's Shane Harris. His new book is called \"@War\" and it's out now. Shane, thank you. HARRIS: You're welcome, Arun. Thanks for having me. ARUN RATH, HOST:  It's the year 2022.

Can you run through the litany of problems with cyber defense he's presented with right away? HARRIS: Sure. And in fact, he actually got a little bit of a taste of this on the campaign, because his campaign email system was hacked presumably by spies in China. When he comes in on the first day, what he's presented with is the knowledge that the computers that control portions of the electrical power grid in the United States have been probed by foreign intelligence agencies. He is told that espionage, particularly by China against American corporations, is rampant and that billions of dollars in intellectual property and in trade secrets are being lost every year, and that basically there is no really coherent organized system in the U. S. government for how we're going to defend the Internet - how we're going to defend the cyber space and all of the businesses and the people that depend on it. What he decides to do very early on in the administration is to, in his words, start treating cyberspace as a national asset - a strategic asset - and protecting it as such. RATH: Let's talk about China, because with this new U. S. cyber warfare command, that seems like that's the main imagined adversary. Can you run through what China's cyber-warfare capabilities are, or at least what we know of them and how they stack up against what the U. S. can do? HARRIS: The thing that China has going for it that we do not have is people. The number of people within the People's Liberation Army, within the sort of the intelligence apparatus of China - which is a very, you know, opaque system in it's own right - is believed to be thousands of people who are basically hired hackers who spend much of their day aggressively trying to penetrate the computer networks of U. S. corporations, especially. China's sort of gathering information that they can then pass on to Chinese businesses and corporations that give them a leg-up in negotiations and in the global marketplace. They're trying to advance their economy very quickly and stealing information to do it. Less clear is how sophisticated their sort of military offensive apparatus is compared to ours. For instance, if China ever went to war with us in the South China Sea, let's say, how sophisticated and how good would their hackers be trying to break into our naval systems and confuse our ships. We know less about that, but I think the conclusion we have to reach is that because they have so many more people doing this than we do - I mean we have a few thousand - that China is a really formidable force. And that makes a lot of sense that they would put so many resources in this. China will never be able to, at least in the near future, challenge us in a conventional military way. They can't go head-to-head with us on land or on the sea. Cyber is a place where they can gain an extraordinary advantage and do a lot of damage. RATH: In terms of intentions and actions, though, you know, going by what President Obama has said in terms about cyber attacks, it sounds like the U. S. is more of the victim here in terms of the government and corporations that are being targeted by these Chinese hackers. I'm just wondering from having studied both sides of this, is that the case or is this more of just part of the game? How much of this - does this go both ways? HARRIS: I think it goes both ways. And in fact, I say this in the book that, you know, the United States government loves to come out and talk about how relentlessly we're being hacked and how our intellectual property is being stolen from our businesses. And that's true. But what that covers up is that we are also one of the most aggressive countries going out there breaking into other countries' systems and spying on them. And we are one of the few countries that we know of that has launched offensive operations in cyberspace. We have used computer viruses to break infrastructure - physical things that are connected to computer networks. Very few countries are known to have done that. I think one of the reasons why U. S. officials have been so keen on showing how we're victimized is because they believe that U. S. businesses have not done enough to secure their own computer networks. From the government's perspective, they can't go in and necessarily force those companies, at least not yet, to improve their defenses. So it's been sort of more of a strategic kind of rhetorical calculation on the part of the government to come out and say we are victimized. It's terrible. Lots of information is being stolen. And the only way we can stop this is you corporations have to do better security and work with us and let us help you do that. So there's a reason why the U. S. has tried to play that victim card so repeatedly. It's because they want to get results from private businesses. RATH: That's Shane Harris. His new book is called \"@War\" and it's out now. Shane, thank you. HARRIS: You're welcome, Arun. Thanks for having me.", "section": "Author Interviews", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2014 NPR.  All rights reserved.

I'm Rachel Martin, and this is For The Record. When you live part of your life online through social media, you have to be prepared for everything that comes your way. The more visible someone is, the more likely a target of harassment. And on Twitter or Facebook, that harassment can sometimes be frightening. For The Record this week - the disturbing cost of a life online. And a warning - some of the descriptions in this story are violent. All you have to do is peruse the comment section on a news story to know it doesn't take much for some people to get nasty fast. Just last week, the Reuters news agency announced it is shutting down public comments on its news site. Even subjects that don't seem controversial can bring out the worst. After the comedian Robin Williams died, his daughter received all kinds of negative messages about her father's suicide. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Zelda Williams, who used Twitter to pay homage to her father after his death, was announced, has abandoned her Twitter and Instagram accounts. Her final tweet read. . . MARTIN: Last month, MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry decided to stop re-tweeting. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MELISSA HARRIS-PERRY: . . . Because I fear that I would send all of my harassment that comes to me over to some person who doesn't deserve it. MARTIN: According to a recent study by the Pew Research Center, 40 percent of Internet users have experienced some kind of harassment. Most of that is happening on social media. And the people who get the really bad stuff are women. Here are three of them. MIKKI KENDALL: Mikki Kendall from hoodfeminism. com. I am an occasional feminist, a cultural critic and sometimes an Internet loudmouth. BRIANNA WU: My name is Brianna Wu. I'm head of development at Giant Spacekat. I make sure our software is being engineered on a timetable. DR. DANIELLE LEE: I am Dr. Danielle N. Lee. I am a biologist at Cornell University. I examine both the basic behavior as well as individual differences in behavior of the African giant pouched rat. MARTIN: (Laughter) It's a very specific line of work. LEE: It is a very specific line of work. MARTIN: Each of these women work in very different industries - media, tech, biology. But they each have very active lives on social media where they engage on everything from issues specific to their field to the big news event of the moment. For Danielle Lee, a black scientist, she says the Internet helps her break down stereotypes. LEE: I really like being in public. I really like sharing science with people. That's why I'm online. MARTIN: For Mikki Kendall, it's just part of her job. KENDALL: I'm a writer. Financially, I can't afford to not have some kind of a life online because part of getting paid is people knowing who you are. MARTIN: And Brianna Wu - she skipped the description of how she uses the Internet and instead launched right into how it has brutalized her. How would you describe your online life? WU: A war. I mean, I wish there were a different way to say it, but the last month has just been - it's frankly been horrible. MARTIN: Wu is one of several women embroiled in an online saga called Gamergate. WU: Gamergate is basically a group of male videogame players that are - they're frustrated with the inroads women are making into the videogame industry. And so I posted this image that was making fun of them. And 24 hours later, I'm fleeing from my home because people had threatened to kill me. MARTIN: Mikki Kendall, the writer, got equally frightening threats. Three years ago she wrote a first-person story about getting an abortion - a story she knew would be controversial. Still she wasn't prepared for the backlash. KENDALL: People threatened to shoot me. People threatened to gut me. There was a guy who told me he would cut me open and make me sure I never got a chance to kill another baby. MARTIN: She dismissed most of it until the threats were no longer restricted to the digital world. KENDALL: I got an actual picture sent to me of me and my children walking across the parking lot of the apartment complex we lived in. And I don't know how close this guy was, but the message was very clear. MARTIN: The police intervened and eventually the man was apprehended for another crime. But you don't have to get death threats online to feel harassed. Danielle Lee, the biologist, starting getting attacked after writing about the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri this summer. LEE: So someone had found a picture of me next to an animal because there's a lot of pictures of me next to animals. And they took that picture and then they made comments about what do you do with, essentially, whining black people? You shoot them. And I shut my account down after that. MARTIN: Two weeks later, she was back online. She and the other women we spoke to all agreed that quitting the Internet isn't an option. For Mikki and Brianna, the abuse got so bad, they went to the police. But for most, the first line of defense is to block the user which is clearly Danielle's tool of choice. LEE: I will put the brakes on that in a minute. I will - my block hand is strong. I will block you in half a minute. I'm like wax on, wax off with this block hand. MARTIN: A lot of the harassment we've been talking about - most of it, in fact - happened on Twitter. The company recently partnered with a nonprofit to launch a new reporting tool to track bad online behavior. Twitter told us when they find out about content that's violating its rules, they shut the accounts down. Mikki Kendall said that's good, but harassers, also known as trolls, often use an easy workaround. KENDALL: Well, what trolls will do is then just make a new account. Right? And IP blocking, in theory, could work if you blocked an entire IP address, except the reality is that most of them are savvy enough to spoof their IP. And then your IP will look like you're from Croatia when you're really in Kentucky. MARTIN: All three of these women kept up their online profiles after the harassment. So have they decided this is just the price of a life online? WU: If you're a woman in the videogame industry, sadly, getting death threats and rape threats is part of your job. I've been getting these for quite a while now. MARTIN: Mikki Kendall says she doesn't expect the Internet to be a nice place. She even admits to stirring things up on purpose from time to time. KENDALL: You know, I am not everyone's favorite cup of tea. There are people who will tell you that I am a stinky, mean girl. I don't necessarily listen to them when I say it, but I am certainly happy to protect their right to continue to think I am a stinky, mean girl, as long as they stop at stinky, mean girl and don't start with I'm going to find where you live and rape you. MARTIN: Each of these women have made some life changes because of the abuse. Danielle simply shut down her Twitter account for a couple of weeks. For Brianna and Mikki, the threats were more severe. They both moved out of their homes. And Mikki thought about changing careers altogether. KENDALL: And we talked about it as a family. I made the offer to my family. I've been a secretary before. I could go be a secretary again - that kind of thing. And they said that that wouldn't be right, and that wouldn't be fair. But that they did want us to make some changes. And we made those changes. MARTIN: One big change - whenever she does public appearances now, she employs a real-life protection mechanism to those digital threats. KENDALL: Chances are good, if you look around the room, you'll see at least one 6 foot tall, really broad shouldered black guy standing there looking at you. That's my husband. He's at everything.

If you are really good at video games, that talent could be a way to help pay for college. Robert Morris University Illinois in Chicago has given scholarships to students they are calling e-athletes. Students have been recruited to play a specific game, \"League Of Legends. \" The school has put aside nearly half a million dollars to fund about 30 of these scholarships. Manoush Zomorodi host of WNYC's podcast \"New Tech City\" went to spend time with the team to get find out how things are going. Hi, Manoush. MANOUSH ZOMORODI: Hi, Robert. SIEGEL: First, this game \"League Of Legends,\" it is hugely popular in South Korea but it's also becoming big enough in the U. S. so that these scholarships were handed out. How do you play it and why is it so popular? ZOMORODI: Robert, even after spending the entire day with these kids, I am not sure I'm the right person to ask about how to play it but basically, the \"League Of Legends,\" it comes from a company in LA, they're called Riot. It is not an easy game. Each player chooses from over 130 different characters who have various magical powers and then teams of five take on other teams of five and basically try to destroy each other. And last year, Robert, more people watched the final \"League Of Legends\" championship match online than tuned in to watch the last game of the NBA finals - around 32 million people, worldwide. SIEGEL: Wow. So you went to Robert Morris University Illinois to check things out. Who are the students who've won the school's first scholarships for e-athletes? ZOMORODI: They are students like Daniel Apanco. He read about the program on the \"League Of Legends\" webpage and he was just one of thousands of kids who called and emailed the school and for Daniel, this new program was a chance to transfer from his local community college, where he was. And I talked to him about his parents' reaction when we were outside the school's practice arena last week. DANIEL APANCO: I told my mom about it. She didn't believe me. She's like, you're crazy and there's no way. I'm like, yeah, there is. So I applied, got in and. . . ZOMORODI: Why'd she think you were crazy? Because she was like, you can't get a scholarship for playing a video game? APANCO: She thought I was like, making it up 'cause she personally doesn't even like me playing the game, but when she realized I was going to get a scholarship for it, she accepted it, you know? She tells all of her friends. ZOMORODI: So Daniel's ranking was good enough for him to make the team and now Robert, half of his tuition is paid for and he's decided to major in graphic design. SIEGEL: What is Robert Morris University hoping to get from having a varsity video game team? ZOMORODI: That's a good question. So the university gets sponsorship from various tech companies who pay for all the equipment and it gets prize money from any tournaments that the team wins, but I talked to the coach, coach Kurt Melcher, he's the associate athletic director. He's the guy who came up with the idea and he says the program is also about diversifying the student body. KURT MELCHER: I think it does two things. Students that are engaged in something outside the classroom generally perform academically a little better, they graduate at a higher rate. And secondly, I think, you know, on a weekend they compete in whatever - whether it's \"League Of Legends\" or whether it was men's football or basketball, then they go back to the dorms and oh, what'd you guys do today? Oh, we had this great game. We did this and this. And they're exchanging ideas and what they did and when you add that sort of passion and that community response, you know, it just adds to the whole environment. ZOMORODI: And from what I saw, Robert, it really was just like the football team or the track team - a tight-knit group. SIEGEL: (Laughter) So what's it like to be a collegiate e-athlete? ZOMORODI: Man, from what I saw it is hard work, Robert. They practice five hours a day. They have tournaments on the weekends. There is a lot of pressure to win and there are potentially other big payoffs. One student has already dropped out to go professional. Some of the pros at \"League Of Legends\" can earn up to a million dollars a year. So these kids are trying to treat it like it's a job and they are focused on making it to the championships in the spring. SIEGEL: This is not an NCAA sport. Has there been any pushback from athletes on the campus who are in traditional sports? ZOMORODI: Yeah, some people don't think it's a real sport. One player told me that the football team likes to make fun of them, but he says he thinks it's funny because those football players have been playing football probably their whole lives, he's only been playing \"League Of Legends\" for two years and they have got the same exact scholarship, and this kid also predicts that in five years we're all going to be watching the game on ESPN. It's not happened yet, though. SIEGEL: Do you have a sense of whether other schools are watching what Robert Morris is doing and thinking of doing the same thing? ZOMORODI: No doubt. Other schools do have teams, they just aren't as official as Robert Morris. They don't offer scholarships but I think they are watching Robert Morris carefully to see how this all plays out. Oh - I'm sorry about the pun there, Robert. SIEGEL: (Laughter) OK thanks, Manoush. ZOMORODI: Thank you, Robert. SIEGEL: That's Manoush Zomorodi, host of the podcast \"New Tech City\" from our member station WNYC. You can download her whole show on varsity video game players this week, it comes out on Wednesday. Go to newtechcity. org. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  It's time now for All Tech Considered. If you are really good at video games, that talent could be a way to help pay for college. Robert Morris University Illinois in Chicago has given scholarships to students they are calling e-athletes. Students have been recruited to play a specific game, \"League Of Legends. \" The school has put aside nearly half a million dollars to fund about 30 of these scholarships. Manoush Zomorodi host of WNYC's podcast \"New Tech City\" went to spend time with the team to get find out how things are going. Hi, Manoush. MANOUSH ZOMORODI: Hi, Robert. SIEGEL: First, this game \"League Of Legends,\" it is hugely popular in South Korea but it's also becoming big enough in the U. S. so that these scholarships were handed out. How do you play it and why is it so popular? ZOMORODI: Robert, even after spending the entire day with these kids, I am not sure I'm the right person to ask about how to play it but basically, the \"League Of Legends,\" it comes from a company in LA, they're called Riot. It is not an easy game. Each player chooses from over 130 different characters who have various magical powers and then teams of five take on other teams of five and basically try to destroy each other. And last year, Robert, more people watched the final \"League Of Legends\" championship match online than tuned in to watch the last game of the NBA finals - around 32 million people, worldwide. SIEGEL: Wow. So you went to Robert Morris University Illinois to check things out. Who are the students who've won the school's first scholarships for e-athletes? ZOMORODI: They are students like Daniel Apanco. He read about the program on the \"League Of Legends\" webpage and he was just one of thousands of kids who called and emailed the school and for Daniel, this new program was a chance to transfer from his local community college, where he was. And I talked to him about his parents' reaction when we were outside the school's practice arena last week. DANIEL APANCO: I told my mom about it. She didn't believe me. She's like, you're crazy and there's no way. I'm like, yeah, there is. So I applied, got in and. . . ZOMORODI: Why'd she think you were crazy? Because she was like, you can't get a scholarship for playing a video game? APANCO: She thought I was like, making it up 'cause she personally doesn't even like me playing the game, but when she realized I was going to get a scholarship for it, she accepted it, you know? She tells all of her friends. ZOMORODI: So Daniel's ranking was good enough for him to make the team and now Robert, half of his tuition is paid for and he's decided to major in graphic design. SIEGEL: What is Robert Morris University hoping to get from having a varsity video game team? ZOMORODI: That's a good question. So the university gets sponsorship from various tech companies who pay for all the equipment and it gets prize money from any tournaments that the team wins, but I talked to the coach, coach Kurt Melcher, he's the associate athletic director. He's the guy who came up with the idea and he says the program is also about diversifying the student body. KURT MELCHER: I think it does two things. Students that are engaged in something outside the classroom generally perform academically a little better, they graduate at a higher rate. And secondly, I think, you know, on a weekend they compete in whatever - whether it's \"League Of Legends\" or whether it was men's football or basketball, then they go back to the dorms and oh, what'd you guys do today? Oh, we had this great game. We did this and this. And they're exchanging ideas and what they did and when you add that sort of passion and that community response, you know, it just adds to the whole environment. ZOMORODI: And from what I saw, Robert, it really was just like the football team or the track team - a tight-knit group. SIEGEL: (Laughter) So what's it like to be a collegiate e-athlete? ZOMORODI: Man, from what I saw it is hard work, Robert. They practice five hours a day. They have tournaments on the weekends. There is a lot of pressure to win and there are potentially other big payoffs. One student has already dropped out to go professional. Some of the pros at \"League Of Legends\" can earn up to a million dollars a year. So these kids are trying to treat it like it's a job and they are focused on making it to the championships in the spring. SIEGEL: This is not an NCAA sport. Has there been any pushback from athletes on the campus who are in traditional sports? ZOMORODI: Yeah, some people don't think it's a real sport. One player told me that the football team likes to make fun of them, but he says he thinks it's funny because those football players have been playing football probably their whole lives, he's only been playing \"League Of Legends\" for two years and they have got the same exact scholarship, and this kid also predicts that in five years we're all going to be watching the game on ESPN. It's not happened yet, though. SIEGEL: Do you have a sense of whether other schools are watching what Robert Morris is doing and thinking of doing the same thing? ZOMORODI: No doubt. Other schools do have teams, they just aren't as official as Robert Morris. They don't offer scholarships but I think they are watching Robert Morris carefully to see how this all plays out. Oh - I'm sorry about the pun there, Robert. SIEGEL: (Laughter) OK thanks, Manoush. ZOMORODI: Thank you, Robert.

Uber's Senior Vice President Emil Michael floated the idea at an informal dinner as a way to counter what he considers negative coverage of the ridesharing firm. Uber is a hit with customers, but it's clashed with competitors, regulators and some journalists. NPR's Laura Sydell joins us now to talk about this latest Uber flap. And, Laura, explain where Emil Michael made these comments and what he said. LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE: So he was at a dinner in New York last week for some very high-level people. And there were some invited journalists, including a reporter from BuzzFeed, which is an online news site that specializes in stories that have a kind of gossipy, viral edge. BuzzFeed reported that over dinner Michael said he wanted to hire a team to investigate journalists, and he reportedly said they would look into journalist's personal lives, their families and give the media a taste of its own medicine. BLOCK: And what are the critical stories that Uber, apparently, is so concerned about? SYDELL: So, Uber's been the target of a lot of negative publicity. Most recently, the founder and chief of an online site called pando. com, Sarah Lacy, called the company out and called them misogynist after some ads in France which basically said, hey, try Uber. We have hot chicks driving our cars, and it had some pictures of scantily clad female drivers of Uber cars. That ended. Also Uber's been fighting taxi regulators in cities across the country. It's been called out for its surge-pricing, which has raised ride fares sometimes to hundreds of dollars at a moment when people need it the most, say, in the middle of a big rainstorm. BLOCK: But it has become a very successful company, right? SYDELL: Very. People like it. They like the convenience, and it has a valuation now of about $18 billion. BLOCK: Uber wouldn't be the first company that would havbe been tempted to dig up dirt on journalists whose coverage they don't like. With tech companies, they've got ready access to a lot of personal information. SYDELL: Yes. There have been cases in the past, some relatively recently. Microsoft admitted that it had read journalists' Hotmail accounts in an attempt to find an internal leak on a story. HP was investigated because it hired private investigators to use false identities to access social security numbers and other information on HP board members, employees and journalists. But what's troubling in some ways, in the bigger picture, is that these companies have a lot of information about us. If you use Uber, it knows a lot about where you go and when. Google and Yahoo make no bones about the fact that they're reading your e-mails, ostensibly to give you more targeted ads, but it could be used for other things. You have GPS on your phone. You use Google Maps. It knows where you go. And I think, you know, this gets troubling in terms of what companies can do with it and also the revelations of Edward Snowden, which showed the government trying to tap into all this information. So it's important to remember these companies have a lot of information about us. BLOCK: Let's go back to Uber, Laura. How has the company responded to this latest flap? SYDELL: Uber says it will not spy on journalists and that this executive was just speculating and not speaking about real plans that the company has. BLOCK: OK. NPR's Laura Sydell.

That's also a question the CIA is trying to answer. It's come up with a plan to destroy the emails of nearly all of its employees and contractors within three years of them leaving the agency. Critics say the plan would result in the loss of important CIA records. NPR's David Welna says the plan was first discovered in some fine print. DAVID WELNA, BYLINE: It was a routine notice in a September issue of the Federal Register, a listing of federal agencies proposing new schedules to the National Archives for the destruction of email considered not worth saving. STEVEN AFTERGOOD: And when I looked at it closely, I realized it was actually pretty important. WELNA: That's Steven Aftergood. He directs the Federation of American Scientists' Project on Government Secrecy. What caught Aftergood's eye was one of the agencies listed - the CIA. Aftergood, whose long criticized the CIA's aversion to public scrutiny, then found that the National Archives in August had quietly given the agency a kind of thumbs up. AFTERGOOD: The Archive had done a preliminary assessment of the CIA proposal and they decided that it tentatively looked OK, and they were ready to move forward on it. WELNA: This is all part of the National Archives push to get every federal agency, by the end of 2016, to winnow out important email, store it electronically and discard the rest. Most agencies plan to hold onto everyone's email for seven years. The CIA has a different plan. It would destroy the email of virtually every employee and contractor within three years of them leaving the agency. The only exceptions would be the CIA's 22 top officials. That, Aftergood says, simply won't do. AFTERGOOD: The 22 senior officials, whose emails have been selected for preservation, are really at the top of a tall pyramid. And there are many second and third and fourth tier officials who are doing tremendously important and consequential work whose emails would, in many cases, just be destroyed. WELNA: Here's one example - Edward Snowden, who, before he leaked thousands of documents as an NSA contractor, had worked for the CIA years earlier. His old emails would have been destroyed under the CIA's proposed policy. Douglas Cox is a law professor at City University of New York. DOUGLAS COX: The whole purpose of requiring the retention of records for a more extended period of time is an acknowledgement that the significance of records aren't always immediately apparent, and the case of Snowden would be a perfect example of that. WELNA: Another example, says the Federation of American Scientists' Aftergood, is the CIA's secret destruction, nine years ago, of videotapes recording the waterboarding of suspected terrorists. AFTERGOOD: They didn't ask permission. They just went ahead and eliminated these records. They will never be retrieved. They will never be reconstructed. WELNA: The CIA, for its part, stands by its new plan for managing email. In a written statement, a CIA spokesperson asserted the agency would, quote, \"move to a standard of preservation that is greater than the National Archives's requirements, well above current CIA policy. \" To see if that's so, I went to the Archives to speak with the man who oversees records management for all federal agencies. PAUL WESTER: I am Paul Wester, the chief records officer for the U. S. government. WELNA: Wester says, by proposing to keep only the email of its top officials, the CIA is in fact following a system suggested by the National Archives for all federal agencies. But he concedes there may be better ways for the CIA to retain key records, which is why the Archives is open to public comments on the CIA's proposal through the end of this week. WESTER: The feedback that we're getting from the public interest process has been very illuminating on different positions that we think we need to maybe rethink, and ask more questions of the CIA. WELNA: This week, top members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which oversees the CIA, also weighed in. Chairwoman Diane Feinstein and ranking member Saxby Chambliss warned the National Archives the CIA's proposal could allow destruction of crucial documentary evidence and should not be approved.

CAPELOUTO: E-bike riding feels like a back wind pushing you up a hill as you pedal. On straight roads you can reach up to 20 miles an hour, depending on how hard your legs are working.

Maybe you should test-drive it. CAPELOUTO: OK. All right. Here we go. So I'm pedaling like a regular bike up a hill. And I'm going to hit one - ooh, hear that?

I came here when I was 15 years old. And I have a degree in accounting, and I'm the mother of two daughters and the CEO of my household (laughter). I say that with pride. TESS VIGELAND, HOST: That's Stella Mateo. She lives and works in New York and began hearing from her daughters about their late-night taxi ride experiences. MATEO: My daughters now that are young ladies, you know, will go to the city and will call me at night and say mom, stay on the phone with me because I don't feel comfortable the way, you know, riding - being in a closed space with a stranger, with a, you know, man. I don't feel comfortable. Please stay on the phone with me. So all these insecurities that, you know, sometimes we have, brought on the idea. VIGELAND: So in September, Mateo launched SheTaxis. It goes by the name SheRides if you're in New York City. It's an app where passengers can request and pay for rides using a smartphone and, in a twist, also choose the gender of their driver. MATEO: We would ask you would you like to ride with a woman or anyone? It gives you an option. VIGELAND: I know that you just launched recently. How is the business doing? MATEO: So far we have women that are signing up for licenses as we speak, over - close to 300 women, besides the women that we have on the road. So it's growing. It's growing fast. VIGELAND: But you do have male drivers as well as female, is that correct? MATEO: Well, fortunately men have been extremely supportive. And over 3,000 men are supplying the rides until we build ourselves. VIGELAND: Until you have enough women just to make that exclusive? MATEO: Yes, because we have the demand. We don't have the supply. And, you know, the industry is dominated over 97 percent by male drivers. And over 600,000 rides a day in New York City, and 60 percent of those riders are women. VIGELAND: So then what would make your service any different from others if the vast majority of your drivers are male? MATEO: Well, what would make the difference is women are going have a choice of, you know, requesting either a woman or anyone. And of course, if you request anyone, you have 97 percent chance of getting someone much quicker. But if you really need, you know, for you to be serviced by a woman, you would make that choice until we build ourselves. VIGELAND: If a driver can say yes or no based on gender, how is that not discriminatory? MATEO: It's a legal question that I, you know, I shouldn't answer. But it's not because we are not refusing anyone, we're referring. You know, when you choose female or anyone, it's just giving - allowing those women a choice. VIGELAND: But can the driver say no? If you have a female driver, could they say no to a male passenger? MATEO: Well, that's your choice. And again, it's a matter of choice. You can do that now in the street. If a woman is riding - you know, is driving a cab and she chooses not to pick up someone, that's her choice. We have no control over that. VIGELAND: Uber has been dealing with a lot of issues recently from assault complaints by female riders to this latest problem over comments made by an executive about orchestrating smear campaigns against reporters. I wonder is any of that affecting your business? MATEO: Yes. Yes, absolutely. More and more people are requesting and saying, you know, you guys need to bill yourselves because we need the service. I've been contacted, you know, by Yelp just from your town, LA, and, you know, different parts of the nation requesting when are we going there, because they're saying they're in desperate need of this service.

This week, the insult came from a seemingly more benign source, but one that set off a loud online cry of - are you kidding me? A book called \"Barbie: I Can Be A Computer Engineer\" was originally published in 2010. But this week, author and Disney screenwriter Pamela Ribon took to her website to excoriate some glaring stereotypes in the book which she only came across just recently. PAMELA RIBON: I was at my friend Helen Jane's house and I found this book on her table. I said oh, that's so exciting. \"Barbie: I Can Be A Computer Engineer,\" like, this is very exciting. And she said oh, now I'm really going to break your soul (laughter). VIGELAND: So Pamela Ribon started reading. RIBON: It starts so promising. Barbie's designing a game to show kids how computers work. This is for school. She's going to make a robot puppy do cute tricks by matching up colored blocks. Skipper asks if she can play the game and Barbie says, I'm only creating the design ideas, Barbie says, laughing. I'll need Steven and Brian's help to turn it into a real game. VIGELAND: Barbie gets a virus on the computer, which then infects another computer and - oh dear. RIBON: So then she asks some boys to fix it for her. And they say it'll go faster if Brian and I help, offers Steven (laughter). VIGELAND: At the end of the day, Barbie takes credit for the boys' work. Ribon was ticked off. She wrote about it on her blog on Monday. The tech blog Gizmodo picked it up, and by Tuesday, it had gone viral. RIBON: Everybody was just enraged with me, which was so nice (laughter). From the very beginning, it was I hear you. I support men and women across the board. People were upset for their daughters and their sons and schools. And, you know, whether or not Barbie wants to be a role model, she's in that position. VIGELAND: Midweek, Mattel issued an apology on the official Barbie Facebook page saying, quote, \"The portrayal of Barbie in this specific story does not reflect the brand's vision for what Barbie stands for. \" Writer Pamela Ribon thinks that's a good first step, but she's been more impressed by how people online have responded. RIBON: I mean, give the Internet a problem, it'll fix itself (laughter) with a lot of flair. People on the Internet have made hundreds of different versions of this book now because of Feminist Hacker Barbie's site. VIGELAND: That site, Feminist Hacker Barbie, was created by Kathleen Tuite, a computer scientist in Santa Cruz, California. KATHLEEN TUITE: So one of my friends posted this call-to-action on Facebook that was like hey, other lady programmer friends, can we crowdsource some feminist/hacker text to paste over the originals? And I was like hmm, I do a lot of crowdsourcing app design. Maybe I can make this up. VIGELAND: She put together a website that allows users to write their own text for the illustrations in the Barbie book. TUITE: One of the very first ones that came in was basically a role reversal. Instead of Barbie as the game designer, she was the game programmer. It says Barbie worked hard to implement Steven and Brian's gameplay designs. Although she enjoys writing the code to bring these designs to life, she also respects the knowledge of user experience that designers like Brian can bring to the table. VIGELAND: Kathleen Tuite says she's gotten more than 2000 submissions. TUITE: These improved revisions that we're seeing now actually give a better sense of what it's like to be an engineer. VIGELAND: Across the country, another woman in the computer science field was also getting fired up about the Barbie book. Casey Fiesler is a Ph. D. student at Georgia Tech. CASEY FIESLER: Well, originally when I saw this story I thought, you know what is great about this though is that obviously what's going to happen is someone's going to write a new book or it's going to become a meme or something like that. And I thought I should actually just do it myself. VIGELAND: Fiesler got to work in Photoshop and rewrote the entire book, so that instead of the computer virus being the big problem, Barbie is upset about something else. FIESLER: I thought well, maybe she's upset about sexism in computing. So she is making a game, and she's making a game in collaboration with the boys. And she says that when she posted about her game on Twitter, people assumed that she must be the designer but boys were doing the coding. VIGELAND: So in Fiesler's story, one of the boys is the designer and Barbie is the coder. Fiesler says the response has been overwhelmingly positive. FIESLER: And I've had people tweeting at me and leaving comments saying that they printed it out and read it to their kids, that their daughters were so excited and they want to be computer scientists. I've had people ask me if they can translate it into other languages. VIGELAND: One part of this story, though, has gotten ugly. The woman who wrote the original book for Mattel told ABC News that she's gotten hundreds of nasty emails and is scared to open many of them. She told ABC that she regrets that she may have let stereotypes slip into the book. Earlier this week, Mattel and publisher Random House pulled the book from Amazon and announced that the print and e-book publication will be discontinued.

President Obama is calling for stronger rules to protect what's known as net neutrality. That's the idea that broadband providers should treat all traffic on their networks equally. The president's critics accuse him of trying to regulate the Internet, which they say would hurt innovation and investment. That may be a catchy critique, but as NPR's Joel Rose reports, it also may be misleading. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: Texas Senator Ted Cruz has been leading the latest charge against net neutrality. At an event in Austin this month, Cruz brought an old black rotary phone up on stage to make his point. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SENATOR TED CRUZ: The Telecommunications Act of 1934 was adopted to regulate these. ROSE: Cruz is unhappy that President Obama wants to regulate broadband Internet access under Title II of the Telecommunications Act of 1934, a law that was written for the old phone monopoly. Cruz and other critics say it would be a mistake to apply that to broadband. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CRUZ: Don't mess with the Internet. The freedom that has enabled this to develop - the worst thing that could happen is letting a whole bunch of politicians come in and regulate every aspect of what you're doing. ROSE: But supporters of net neutrality say there's a crucial flaw in Cruz's argument. MARVIN AMMORI: We're not regulating the Internet. We're regulating access to the Internet. ROSE: Marvin Ammori is a fellow at the New America Foundation, and he says that's a big distinction. Ammori says no one is talking about regulating what websites you can visit or what you can say in your e-mail or what service you can use to send that e-mail. AMMORI: All we're making sure is that Comcast, Verizon, AT&T can't interfere with your access to your e-mail or anything else on the Internet. That's all we're talking about. ROSE: Net neutrality advocates want to ensure that broadband providers can't block competitors' access to their pipes or charge companies like Google or Netflix more to deliver their data to you faster. Here's how President Obama put it in a video message earlier this month. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Cable companies can't decide which online stores you can shop at or which streaming services you can use, and they can't let any company pay for priority over its competitors. ROSE: The Federal Communications Commission has tried before to create net neutrality rules, but they've been struck down in court. Supporters of moving to Title II say it would give the FCC broader power to enforce its rules. But the broadband industry and its allies worry it would give regulators too much power. Rob Atkinson is president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation in Washington. ROB ATKINSON: Moving to Title II is certainly a heavy-handed regulatory step. It's a very, very detailed top-down regulations of what you can do. There are over 200 separate provisions in there. ROSE: Including some that would allow the FCC to put a cap on how much your broadband provider can charge. Critics say Title II would give the FCC the power to regulate the broadband industry like a public utility. The Obama administration says it does not want the commission to do that. Obama is urging the FCC to exercise forbearance, which is basically bureaucrat speak for we'll skip the parts of the law we don't like. But Atkinson is skeptical. ATKINSON: It's just unclear what's going to happen. We don't know how Title II - if it were applied, how it would be applied. ROSE: The broadband industry would prefer rules that would allow it to create special fast lanes on the Internet for companies that can afford to pay more. That would probably include such big names as Netflix, Amazon and Google. Senator Ted Cruz describes this as a fight between big boys on both sides. And he says federal regulators should stay out of it. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CRUZ: I promise the regulations over and over and over again will favor the big guys that have armies of lobbyists in there and will end up putting more burdens on the startups and the entrepreneurs. JULIE SAMUELS: I have a hard time taking that seriously. Title II is what's going to maintain a level playing field so that all startups can get online. ROSE: Julie Samuels is the director of Engine Advocacy which represents about 500 startups and small companies, including Etsy and Kickstarter. She says the biggest Internet companies can afford to pay more for faster access to their customers. SAMUELS: They can afford to pay Verizon or Comcast or Time Warner more, even if it sucks for them. But let me tell who can't afford that. That's the small companies and the startups and the ones who are just trying to get out there and reach consumers and reach users. ROSE: Samuels says strong net neutrality rules won't just enrich those entrepreneurs; they'll benefit everyone who uses the next killer app that hasn't been developed yet.

The company developed what it's dubbed the music genome project, which uses algorithms to identify your listening patterns. So you can tell Pandora you like Jack White. It plays a song by him. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"FREEDOM AT 21\")JACK WHITE: (Singing) Cut off the bottoms of my feet. Make me walk on salt. Take me down to the police. Charge me with assault. SYDELL: Then Pandora's algorithms send you songs by artists it thinks you'll like if you like Jack White. In this case, The Black Keys come up next. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"I GOT MINE\")THE BLACK KEYS: (Singing) I was a moving man in my younger days. But I gone out of my rambling ways. SYDELL: Pandora asks you to help by giving a song a thumbs up or down, and so your taste will factor into future music suggestions. The music genome project has helped make Pandora very popular. The service has over 76 million registered users, and it's the number one station in 14 of the top 15 U. S. markets. That includes both broadcast and online radio. But a recent deal with a consortium of independent record labels is adding another factor to the algorithm -money. Pandora made a deal with a company called Merlin, which represents - among others - the labels of Jack White, Taylor Swift and Adele. Here's how it works. Performers get paid a small royalty each time one of their songs is played on Internet radio. It's a rate that's set by the Library of Congress. But Internet radio and labels can strike individual deals. That's what Pandora negotiated with Merlin. The Internet service will recommend Merlin artists over those not affiliated with the consortium in exchange for a lower royalty rate. Merlin artists get more spins, and Pandora winds up paying less in royalties than it would if it were giving the same spins to non-Merlin artists. And consortium labels will get to suggest favorite tracks. The deal has raised eyebrows with David Lowrey, a founder of the band Cracker. He also teaches in the music business program at the University of Georgia. DAVID LOWREY: They're giving a discount in exchange for airplay. So essentially, you're being advertised to without you knowing it. SYDELL: On old-fashioned radio, this kind of deal would get legal scrutiny says Jim Burger, a copyright lawyer and an adjunct professor at Georgetown University. JIM BURGER: If they were a terrestrial radio station, and they were getting a discount on certain music as long as they played it more than other music, that would be considered, under this statute, illegal, unless they announced it as paid for. SYDELL: The statute Burger's referring to was passed by Congress in 1960 after hearings in which members of Congress were outraged when they learned that DJs were being paid by record labels to play certain songs. BURGER: Congress was really rather upset at the radio stations and the DJs who they felt were fooling the American teenage public into buying music by pushing artists they got paid to push rather than using their own music genome in their head and saying this is great stuff, kids. Listen to it. SYDELL: The statute outlaws what came to be called payola. And it only applies to terrestrial radio. Pandora's CEO Brian McAndrews says there's no comparison between that and what his company is doing. BRIAN MCANDREWS: Payola is where record labels paid radio stations to get airplay. And the opposite is what happens today. As Pandora, we pay the record labels and the artists who allow airplay. So it's completely different. SYDELL: McAndrews says Pandora is open to developing this kind of relationship with other labels. And he insists that the company's famous algorithms are not going away. MCANDREWS: Every song will go through the music genome project, and our listeners still retain the ability to personalize their stations the way they always have. SYDELL: But musician David Lowrey worries that the Pandora-Merlin deal could shut out independent artists and labels that can't afford to cut deals for extra play. LOWREY: The public may not miss what it doesn't know it could have had. Do we want to make it harder for independent voices to be heard, and what will that do to the consumer choices? SYDELL: And in the world of the Internet, there are a lot of choices. The biggest challenge is finding them. Laura Sydell, NPR News. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:  The Internet radio service Pandora made its name and by creating personalized stations based on your likes and dislikes. But now a deal Pandora has made with a group of record labels is raising concerns. Critics say the songs Pandora plays for you may have less to do with your tastes and more to do with who is giving them a deal on royalties. NPR's Laura Sydell reports. LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE: When Pandora came onto the scene a decade ago, its biggest selling point over traditional radio was that it created a station just for you, as the company's Eric Bieschke told NPR last year.

At issue is the conviction of a Pennsylvania man for making threats against his estranged wife and an FBI agent. Here's NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg. NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: After Anthony Elonis' wife left him, he began posting grisly messages on Facebook promising not to rest until her body was, quote, \"soaked in blood and dying. \" She then got a court order barring him from threatening and harassing her, even indirectly. But he continued to post on Facebook, asking if the court order was, quote, \"thick enough to stop a bullet\" and musing about making a name for himself by shooting up a kindergarten. After a visit from a female FBI agent, he posted on Facebook saying it, quote, \"took all the strength I had not to slit her throat, leave her bleedin' from her jugular. \" He was convicted of making illegal threats and sentenced to 44 months in prison. But he contends that such comments were just his way of venting and expressing himself just as rappers do. His case has become a test of what the prosecution must prove to win a conviction in an Internet threat case. The government, backed by victims' rights groups, contends that the prosecution must show only that a reasonable person would interpret the Facebook posts as threats to commit bodily harm. But speaking on the steps of the Supreme Court today, Elonis' lawyer, John Elwood, said the prosecution should have to prove far more. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOHN ELWOOD: It should have to prove that he knew that the statements that he was saying put a listener in fear. TOTENBERG: Inside the court chamber, liberal and conservative justices were skeptical. Justice Ginsburg - how does one prove what is in somebody else's mind? Answer, you can examine a person's computer and cell phone records. Chief Justice Roberts - yeah, and you're going to find a lot of information that the guy is really angry at his ex-wife. And when he puts some of that online, you're going to say, well, that was just therapeutic venting. Justice Kagan - I'm trying to figure out what level of intent you want. The highest level would require proof that the purpose was to put a person in fear. A step down would be that I know that I'm going to place this person in fear, but I'm fulfilling my artistic fantasies. And a third level would be recklessness, meaning that you know there is a substantial probability that you'll place that person in fear, but you don't know it to a certainty. Elwood picked option two, knowledge that you would put someone in fear. Justice Kagan - what's wrong with a recklessness standard? It gets you up one level from what the government wants. Elwood replied that it would allow people, many of them teenagers who are just shooting off their mouths, to be thrown in jail. Justice Alito, however, replied that Elwood's standard would provide nothing short of a, quote, \"roadmap for threatening a spouse and getting away with it. \" All you'd have to say is just kidding at the end of a post or sign yourself an aspiring rap artist. Added Alito, when Elonis threatened to shoot up a kindergarten, would the jury have to get into the mind of this obsessed, somewhat disturbed individual to figure out whether he really knew this would cause a panic on the part of school officials and parents? Answer - yes. Justice Alito, incredulous - yes? That's your answer? Answer - yes, exactly. It's the same thing the juries do all the time. Arguing the contrary position, Deputy Solicitor General Michael Dreeben contended that people like Elonis should be held accountable for the ordinary and natural meaning of the words they use in context. Chief Justice Roberts, the father of teenagers, asked if the reasonable person standard would also mean a reasonable teenager. What about an older audience, he asked? Would the person posting on Facebook have to know how rap lyrics are interpreted? Answer - yes. Reading some explicit Eminem lyrics about what the rapper would like to do to his ex-wife, Roberts asked whether those words would justify prosecution. No, replied the government's Dreeben, because Eminem's lyrics are said at a concert where people are going to be entertained. The critical context here is that Eminem didn't voice his lyrics privately, nor did his wife get a protection from abuse order. Justice Kagan, however, seemed to suggest that the government's position is too broad. We typically require a kind of buffer zone in First Amendment cases, she said, to make sure that even stuff that's wrongful maybe is permitted because we don't want to chill the right to speak freely. Replied Dreeben, the proof is in the pudding here. The rule of law applied in this case is used in most of the country, and there's no evidence anyone's speech has been chilled. At the end of the argument, the justices seemed like Goldilocks, still to be looking for a standard that is just right. Nina Totenberg, NPR News, Washington.

No, replied the government's Dreeben, because Eminem's lyrics are said at a concert where people are going to be entertained. The critical context here is that Eminem didn't voice his lyrics privately, nor did his wife get a protection from abuse order. Justice Kagan, however, seemed to suggest that the government's position is too broad. We typically require a kind of buffer zone in First Amendment cases, she said, to make sure that even stuff that's wrongful maybe is permitted because we don't want to chill the right to speak freely. Replied Dreeben, the proof is in the pudding here. The rule of law applied in this case is used in most of the country, and there's no evidence anyone's speech has been chilled. At the end of the argument, the justices seemed like Goldilocks, still to be looking for a standard that is just right.

Anthony Elonis was convicted of making threats against his estranged wife and against an FBI agent. His language was explicit and grizzly and graphic. And so we must give you a warning, this report contains disturbing material. If you have children listening, you may want to turn down the radio for about seven minutes. Here's NPR's Nina Totenberg. NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: After Elonis's wife left him, taking with her their two children, her husband began posting about her on Facebook. The following is a reading of some of those posts. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: (Reading) There's one way to love you, but a thousand ways to kill you. And I'm not going to rest until your body is a mess, soaked in blood and dying from all the little cuts. Hurry up and die, [bleep]. TOTENBERG: In another post, Elonis wrote, revenge is a dish that's best served cold with a delicious side of psychological torture. Elonis's wife went to court, and after a three-hour hearing attended by both of them, she obtained a restraining order barring her estranged husband from threatening, harassing or contacting her, even indirectly. Elonis, however, was undeterred. Just three days after the court hearing, he posted this Facebook message publicly. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: (Reading) Did you know that it's illegal for me to say that I want to kill my wife? Now, it was OK for me to say it right then because I'm just letting you know that it's illegal for me to say that. TOTENBERG: The post included a link to a satirical sketch with nearly identical words, but about the president. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE WHITEST KIDS U' KNOW\")TREVOR MOORE: Did you know that it's illegal to say, I want to kill the president of the United States of America? TOTENBERG: Roughly a week later, Elonis posted this about his wife. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: (Reading) Fold up your protective order and put it in your pocket. Is it thick enough to stop a bullet? TOTENBERG: A day later, he said he was ready to, quote, \"make a name for himself\" with the most heinous school shooting ever imagined. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: (Reading) Hell hath no fury like a crazy man in a kindergarten class. The only question is, which one? TOTENBERG: The post got the attention of FBI Agent Denise Stevens, who visited Elonis at home. Afterwards, he posted this message. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: (Reading) Little agent lady stood so close. Took all the strength I had not to turn the [bleep] ghost, pull my knife, flick my wrist and slit her throat, leave her bleeding from her jugular in the arms of her partner. TOTENBERG: Elonis was indicted on five counts of interstate communication of illegal threats. At his trial, he acknowledged that his verse had some of the same violent themes as rap songs, but noted that he'd said explicitly that he was only exercising his First Amendment free speech rights. And he pointed out that he had linked to other similar artistic expressions - the comedy sketch or a rap artist like Eminem, whose songs have fantasized about killing his ex-wife. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"KIM\")EMINEM: (Singing) Ha, ha Got'cha. Ha. Go ahead, yell. Here, I'll scream with you. Ah, somebody help. TOTENBERG: At the end of the trial, the judge instructed the jury that, to convict, it must find that the Elonis Facebook posts constituted true threats, meaning that in context, a reasonable person would foresee that the statements would be interpreted by his targets as a serious expression of an intent to inflict bodily injury. Elonis was convicted and sentenced to 44 months in prison. He appealed all the way to the Supreme Court, contending that under the Constitution and the federal threats statute, a jury must find not just that a reasonable person would interpret the words as threatening but that Elonis actually intended his words to be threatening. JOHN ELWOOD: If the question had been, what did he intend, did he intend to place her in fear, I think it would have been an entirely different trial. TOTENBERG: John Elwood will argue Elonis's case in the Supreme Court today. ELWOOD: The jury wasn't instructed to look to the right thing. It was still asked about what a reasonable person would think, not what he would've thought. TOTENBERG: And indeed, Elwood points to evidence that, he contends, shows Elonis never intended to put his wife in fear of her life. ELWOOD: The disclaimers that he posted all around the page saying basically this is all for entertainment purposes only, or this is venting. You know, don't take this too seriously. And when you put that all in context, that is what we think is indicative that he did not have an intent to put anyone into fear. TOTENBERG: Elwood knows that lots of great songs have fantasies about revenge, like The Beatles's \"Run For Your Life. \"(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"RUN FOR YOUR LIFE\")THE BEATLES: (Singing) Well, I'd rather see you dead, little girl, than to be with another man. TOTENBERG: But longtime Federal Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald sees the context differently. He notes that most of the posts here occurred after Elonis's wife had gotten a protective order and were posted without restriction on his Facebook page. Thus, the jury concluded that the husband reasonably foresaw what the reaction would be. PATRICK FITZGERALD: That the wife would read this and think this is not an artistic statement. This is not a political statement about a larger cause. This is trying to get inside her head and make her think that there could be someone doing violence to her. TOTENBERG: Fitzgerald rejects the comparison to Eminem's rap fantasies. FITZGERALD: You can't sort of have this little out where you dress up a threat as being a rap lyric if a reasonable person perceives it as a threat. He shouldn't be allowed to do it and terrorize people. TOTENBERG: Fitzgerald, who served 24 years as a federal prosecutor, 11 of them as U. S. attorney for Chicago, sees threats as such a problem that he actually put a threat button on his prosecutor's computers in Chicago, requiring them to report any threat to a witness, prosecutor or judge. FITZGERALD: There is an epidemic of threats out there. And with the Internet, it's going to get worse. So in terms of the societal value in making sure that there's a safe zone where people aren't picking up the Internet and feeling like they're being singled out for violence, that's a very, very real issue. TOTENBERG: Cindy Southworth, vice president of the National Network to End Domestic Violence, underlines the point, contending that Facebook and other social media sites enable abusers to reach their victims with a click of the mouse or a touch of the screen. CINDY SOUTHWORTH: We have stalking statutes all over the country that are based on a reasonable person versus proving the intent of the stalker or abuser. So I'm quite concerned about what ripple impact this may have on other statutes and other prosecutions if we have to somehow get into the mind of an abuser. TOTENBERG: But most of the friend-of-the-court briefs filed in the case argue that if the court allows the Elonis conviction to stand, it could have enormous implications for free speech rights and artistic expression. Briefs full of references to the F-word and female sexual anatomy attempt to provide a crash course on rap storytelling for justices whose tastes, as one writer put it, run more to Wagner and Puccini than Eminem and Wu-Tang Clan. A decision in the case is expected by summer. Nina Totenberg, NPR News, Washington.

SIGNE BREWSTER: I think most people don't even realize what they are, and they just walk past them. CORNISH: That's Signe Brewster, staff writer at the technology blog Gigaom. We're talking about 3-D printers sometimes going for as much as three grand at your neighborhood Home Depot. We asked Signe Brewster, who's buying these things? BREWSTER: Since 3-D printers were invented in the 1980s, it was a very enterprise-focused field. An engineer might prototype an item for a car, and it used to be that, you know, you'd send it off to China to be made, and then it would be sent back two weeks later. But with the 3-D printer, you know, they can print it immediately. And it just really speeds up that design progress. So it's also of interest to artists and architects and just anyone who's designing something and needs to quickly iterate on it. Slowly, since the early 2000s now, it's been turning to consumers. And in the future that's going to be a lot more common. CORNISH: So what should we make of the choice of Home Depot specifically? BREWSTER: Home Depot is a place where people who are making things go - or fixing something. And 3-D printers really fall into that. So, you know, if you have something break at home, and it might be a part that's no longer made or it's very expensive, if you have a 3-D printer, you can make your own and print it at home. So it's those people who are ready, you know, very handy, they could be very interested in this. CORNISH: So you could, like, make your own drill bit, right? BREWSTER: Well, that might be a little bit difficult. You're printing in plastic, and it might not be the strongest drill bit. CORNISH: Ah. So there are limitations here? BREWSTER: Yes. There are plenty of limitations for 3-D printers. If you have a desktop machine, you're printing in plastic, and it's not going to look great all the time. It's water-soluble all the time. Like, you're not going to be making dinner plates and cups and - but yeah. I mean, if - for example, I - you know, I broke a toilet handle. And it was a time where it was like man, this part is really difficult to find. I would love to just print this at home. But that wasn't quite available to me yet. CORNISH: Give us a sense of the market in terms of whether it's actually growing. This seems like the kind of technology where every year they say this is the year people are going to start buying this thing. But does it feel like the year for 3-D printers? BREWSTER: The 3-D printer companies would definitely have you believe right now that everyone is buying them. But we've only just now passed 100,000 printers sold every year. And that is expected to continue to double. But I don't think that they're quite ready for everyone. I wouldn't recommend it to people who aren't tech savvy, people who aren't comfortable popping open a machine and fixing it when it breaks because 3-D printers do break. They're not quite at the place of a desktop 2-D printer, you know. They're not for everyone. So I think it's coming. There's a day where printers will be easy enough for everyone to use, but it's not this year. CORNISH: Well, Signe Brewster, thanks so much for talking with us and for making some recommendations.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)STEPHEN HAWKING: Where did we come from? How did the universe come into being? MARTIN: The theoretical physicist has ALS, which has made it impossible for him to speak. Hawking has used the same computerized voice system to communicate for more than 20 years. But recently, Hawking unveiled a brand-new communication system. The technology was created especially for him. Horst Haussecker is the director of Intel's Computational Imaging Lab. He worked closely with Stephen Hawking on this project. Mr. Haussecker joins us now. Thanks so much for being with us. HORST HAUSSECKER: Hi, how are you? It's a pleasure to be with here. MARTIN: Doing well, thanks. So the big question, I suppose, is Stephen Hawking's voice going to sound different? HAUSSECKER: No, absolutely not. In fact, this was one of the things he did not want to have changed because his voice has become so iconic that he considers that his own personal voice. And in fact, there is only one system in the world that can generate that voice, which is the very computer board that Professor Hawking is still using to date. It's based on, you know, slightly outdated technology, but it makes it very unique and you couldn't even copy it if you wanted to. MARTIN: So what was wrong with the old version of his voice? What wasn't working? HAUSSECKER: It was a very slow process for him to do anything on the computer. In the early days when he was still able to use his fingers, there was a hand-switch that he clicked. And then later as his disease progressed, he had to switch to a simple optical sensor that's mounted to his temple that he activates by twitching the cheek of his face. Over the years as his disease progressed, it got harder and harder for him to do this very precisely. And he had to, you know, eventually difficulty to type even one word per minute. And so what we did is we allowed him to switch over to a more modern technology by creating a system that handles, you know, typing really well - something that would even go as far as predicting words that he most likely will use. MARTIN: So the technology is so sophisticated that it could learn his language, his cadence so if he types the letter P, based on the context the computer system would be able to predict perhaps what word he wanted to write. HAUSSECKER: That is correct. And then also, once he has typed one word, it would predict the most likely, you know, consecutive word. And just to give you an example, for Stephen, it meant that if he types the word the, the most likely following word would be universe. MARTIN: (Laughter). HAUSSECKER: Which is of course, very unique to him and I doubt it would work for anyone else. MARTIN: (Laughter). He gave you and your team unprecedented access to his life when you were trying to put this program together. What was he like to work with? HAUSSECKER: He's a very funny person. And he was very easy to work with because he got excited working with us. We went in and we told him that we would like to treat him like a scientific experiment and observe him and study him and then build a working solution. And of course, being a scientist himself he really liked the idea. And he would get excited. MARTIN: He was OK with that? HAUSSECKER: Oh absolutely. You know, he found that very funny and actually interesting and he spent more time than we ever expected. MARTIN: A lot of time and effort and money was spent developing this system. Will it have broader applications, or is this something that just will work for Stephen Hawking? HAUSSECKER: Absolutely. So it will have broader application. We are going to open up the tool books we build and we are offering that as an open-source library. And that would allow others to build solutions for people who have similar disabilities and to help them to, you know, increase their independence and quality of life.

MARTIN: The theoretical physicist has ALS, which has made it impossible for him to speak. Hawking has used the same computerized voice system to communicate for more than 20 years. But recently, Hawking unveiled a brand-new communication system. The technology was created especially for him. Horst Haussecker is the director of Intel's Computational Imaging Lab. He worked closely with Stephen Hawking on this project. Mr. Haussecker joins us now. Thanks so much for being with us. HORST HAUSSECKER: Hi, how are you? It's a pleasure to be with here. MARTIN: Doing well, thanks. So the big question, I suppose, is Stephen Hawking's voice going to sound different? HAUSSECKER: No, absolutely not. In fact, this was one of the things he did not want to have changed because his voice has become so iconic that he considers that his own personal voice. And in fact, there is only one system in the world that can generate that voice, which is the very computer board that Professor Hawking is still using to date. It's based on, you know, slightly outdated technology, but it makes it very unique and you couldn't even copy it if you wanted to. MARTIN: So what was wrong with the old version of his voice? What wasn't working? HAUSSECKER: It was a very slow process for him to do anything on the computer. In the early days when he was still able to use his fingers, there was a hand-switch that he clicked. And then later as his disease progressed, he had to switch to a simple optical sensor that's mounted to his temple that he activates by twitching the cheek of his face. Over the years as his disease progressed, it got harder and harder for him to do this very precisely. And he had to, you know, eventually difficulty to type even one word per minute. And so what we did is we allowed him to switch over to a more modern technology by creating a system that handles, you know, typing really well - something that would even go as far as predicting words that he most likely will use. MARTIN: So the technology is so sophisticated that it could learn his language, his cadence so if he types the letter P, based on the context the computer system would be able to predict perhaps what word he wanted to write. HAUSSECKER: That is correct. And then also, once he has typed one word, it would predict the most likely, you know, consecutive word. And just to give you an example, for Stephen, it meant that if he types the word the, the most likely following word would be universe. MARTIN: (Laughter). HAUSSECKER: Which is of course, very unique to him and I doubt it would work for anyone else. MARTIN: (Laughter). He gave you and your team unprecedented access to his life when you were trying to put this program together. What was he like to work with? HAUSSECKER: He's a very funny person. And he was very easy to work with because he got excited working with us. We went in and we told him that we would like to treat him like a scientific experiment and observe him and study him and then build a working solution. And of course, being a scientist himself he really liked the idea. And he would get excited. MARTIN: He was OK with that? HAUSSECKER: Oh absolutely. You know, he found that very funny and actually interesting and he spent more time than we ever expected. MARTIN: A lot of time and effort and money was spent developing this system. Will it have broader applications, or is this something that just will work for Stephen Hawking? HAUSSECKER: Absolutely. So it will have broader application. We are going to open up the tool books we build and we are offering that as an open-source library. And that would allow others to build solutions for people who have similar disabilities and to help them to, you know, increase their independence and quality of life. MARTIN: Horst Haussecker is the director of Intel's Computational Imaging Lab. He worked with Stephen Hawking on his new voice technology. Thanks so much for talking with us about it.

Over the weekend a conservative blogger doxed her, in other words he published what he claims is her real name. His decision to put that information out there has been denounced, but doxing itself has become an increasingly common practice, and joining us now to talk about it is technology correspondent Steve Henn of NPR's Planet Money. Hey there, Steve. STEVE HENN, BYLINE: Hi. CORNISH: So explain what led to this latest doxing incident. HENN: Well, you know, when Rolling Stone identified this young woman as Jackie, I think most people assumed that the magazine was using a pseudonym. It wasn't. And later the author said that publicly. And at that point it became trivially easy to track Jackie down. So this guy, Charles C. Johnson - he's a conservative blogger - he says he did just that. Sunday night he tweeted, I'm giving Jackie until later tonight to tell the truth, and then I'm going to start revealing everything about her past. Just three minutes later, after other Twitter users sort of egged him on and asked him why he was waiting, he said, quote, \"because I'm merciful and I always give my opponents the opportunity to do the right thing. \" And then later that night, he published what he says is Jackie's full name and what he thought at least were pictures from social media profiles and other details about her life. CORNISH: Now, this blogger says what he's doing is journalism. Others call it doxing and they don't use that term in a flattering way. Where does it come from? HENN: So in the '80s you had a whole bunch of kids doing illegal things online using pseudonyms. So if you were a hacker and you got in a feud with another hacker, you could dox them - reveal their true identity - and that could get them arrested. CORNISH: Now, how is it used today? HENN: Well, basically the practice of doxing is like, publishing private or identifiable information about someone online. Typically in order to really shut them up or bully them or intimidate them or embarrass them. So, Anita Sarkeesian, a feminist who critiques video games was doxed. Her address was published and then she was barraged - and still is being barraged - with threats. In Ferguson, activists doxed people on social media who were making racist remarks in the aftermath of Michael Brown's shooting and then they organized campaigns to get those people fired. And we're seeing this a lot and it seems to happen around highly polarizing issues. You know, the ease of doing research online and then the speed that facts can travel through social media have made this a really potent weapon. And in extreme cases, doxing has become a tool basically to ruin people's lives, to publish enough information about them to force them into hiding, to push them off the Internet - basically to make their lives unbearable. CORNISH: But is it illegal? HENN: Well, you know, that depends on what information you get, how you get it, how you use it and whether or not it's true. In 2012, Spike Lee tweeted out the address of George Zimmerman, the man who shot Trayvon Martin. But Spike Lee got that address wrong. He ended up having to settle with the homeowners who lived at that location. Obviously, publishing accurate information about someone is legal, but if you get that information by hacking into someone's social media account or their bank account, you're very likely breaking the law. And even if you publish stuff that is part of the public record, like someone's address or phone number, you cross a legal line when you start using that information - even if it's accurate - to make threats. Obviously, you know, as Spike Lee found out, the targets of these actions can sue for invasion of privacy, or if you get something wrong, for libel. But, you know, if the person doing this, if the doxer is some loner who's living in a basement, taking them into civil court and suing them's not going to get you a lot. CORNISH: But it's not just bloggers and Internet trolls who've been accused of this, right? I mean, some very big mainstream media organizations have been accused of it as well. HENN: That's true. You know, The New York Times recently was criticized, some people said it was doxing former Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson when it published the name of the street where he lives. CORNISH: So how is doxing different from what journalists do all the time? HENN: Well, you know, that's a great question. Clearly, journalists use public records in many of the same ways, you know, to track down sources, do our work. And we publish some of what we find. But really, there's no mainstream news organization I know of that publishes the name of an alleged rape victim without their consent, or would ever use this kind of information to make a threat.

She has given us this number of the week. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: 52. MARTIN: That is the number of countries that the ride-share service Uber says it works in since the company launched in 2010. Mona Chalabi joins us from our studios in New York. Hi, Mona. MONA CHALABI: Hello, Rachel. MARTIN: So Huber has had a lot of high-profile fights. A lot of cities, even foreign countries, have argued that what it does, this ride-sharing service, stifles competition. But I understand just this past week was a particularly rough one for the company? CHALABI: Yeah. Judges in the Netherlands and Spain have banned the service, as well as two Indian cities, Delhi and Hyderabad. Here in the states, district attorneys in San Francisco and Los Angeles filed consumer protection suits against Uber. And the city of Portland, Oregon has filed a lawsuit to shut down the taxi service. And all of that happened just between Monday and Wednesday. MARTIN: So what does all this mean for the company's global ambitions? Are they scaling back as they meet all this resistance? CHALABI: Well, it's a bit hard to say because the company's expansion seems to be happening as fast as its backlash. According to Forbes, Uber is launching around 30 cities in the last 30 days. A couple of weeks ago it was Hanoi in Vietnam. On Monday it was set up in Sofia, and on Tuesday it launched in the Chinese city of Tianjin. MARTIN: So along with all this expansion, I understand that Uber is really aggressive when it comes to trying to track its data to figure out who uses its service and under what circumstances. And that has, in turn, raised some privacy concerns. CHALABI: Yeah. There's been a couple of scandals to be honest. Last month one of Uber's top executives in New York tracked the trips of a Buzzfeed journalist without her permission. Afterwards, two former Uber employees spoke out and described an internal company tool called God View. MARTIN: God View, what does that mean? CHALABI: It sounds weird, right? MARTIN: Yeah. CHALABI: It shows the location of Uber vehicles and customers who have requested a car. So basically it allows the company to accurately track all users. Then earlier this month, a Washington Post reporter described someone who had a job interview with Uber in 2013. Apparently the applicant was given access to Uber's database. In fact, they even had access several hours after the interview had ended. MARTIN: OK. So that raises some red flags about privacy. But is all of this bad? I mean, is there any silver lining, any good use of this kind of data? CHALABI: Yeah. So if Uber were to share some of its anonymized data about the trips that are made by its passengers, people like transport planners would be able to gather much more information about the way that the residents of a cite navigate it. At the moment, that's incredibly difficult and expensive to do which ultimately affects traffic and infrastructure in a city. MARTIN: But how likely is Uber to share that information with city planners? I mean, they must want to do so at a price, right? I mean, this is a corporation. CHALABI: That's true, but there's also a slight public information aspect here because at the moment most cities demand that taxis share that data to demonstrate that they're not discriminating against certain neighborhoods. MARTIN: Alright so let's say that I'm an Uber user, and I don't like the sounds of this data tracking program. Is there a way to opt out? CHALABI: Well, you can delete the Uber app from your phone, but that actually won't delete your user account. So to do that, you need to write to Uber. But here's the thing - reading Uber's U. S. privacy policy, it says, quote, even after your account is terminated, we will retain your personal information and usage information including geo-location, trip history, credit card information and transaction history as needed, unquote.

CHALABI: Well, you can delete the Uber app from your phone, but that actually won't delete your user account. So to do that, you need to write to Uber. But here's the thing - reading Uber's U. S. privacy policy, it says, quote, even after your account is terminated, we will retain your personal information and usage information including geo-location, trip history, credit card information and transaction history as needed, unquote. MARTIN: A lesson in reading the small print, for sure. CHALABI: Yeah. MARTIN: Mona Chalabi of fivethirtyeight. com. Thanks so much for talking with us.

Just listen to these headlines Invasion of The Taxi Snatchers, Uber Leads an Industry's Disruption, or The Uber Disruptor: What Rideshares Can Teach You About Disrupting The Market. And here's one more Let's All Stop Saying Disrupt Right This Instant. That headline is from Kevin Roose in New York Magazine. Now he's a senior editor at the TV and digital network Fusion and he feels the same way. And Kevin, why? What's the deal with the word disrupt? KEVIN ROOSE: Well, disrupt actually has a very specific meaning. It dates back to a book written by a Harvard Business School professor named Clayton Christensen in 1997, but these days it's used to sort of mean cool. It just means anything that's sort of vaguely new or interesting and so it's lost a lot of its specific context in the ways that people used to use it. CORNISH: What was the original definition? ROOSE: The original definition is something akin to a very specific business theory that states that there are some markets in which new entrants attack the low end of the market and move up the chain and eventually displace the old company that used to make stuff in that market. So a good example would be Kodak being disrupted by new digital photo startups, or the taxi industry being disrupted by Uber. CORNISH: So every industry has its jargon. I mean, why do we care what buzzwords tech companies are using to sell themselves? ROOSE: Well, often people in the tech industry will use disruption or disrupt as a way to divide people who are pro-tech from people who are anti-tech. If you object to Uber and its practices or any of the things that it's done, they will say well, you're on the side of the disrupted. You're not pro-disruption. And I think that really casts a sort of fig leaf over a lot of the other issues. There are reasons to be opposed to what these companies are doing that have nothing to do with opposing progress or new technology, but when you brand everything as disruption versus disrupted, you then get a sort of a free pass and all the rest of those issues. CORNISH: So the idea is that when someone throws this term around basically it forces the critics into a corner, right? Like, then they'd essentially be saying, I'm against innovation. ROOSE: Exactly, exactly. It makes those people who would object to some parts of Uber or Airbnb or any of these other companies that are supposedly disruptive - it makes them all sound like they're just Luddites who hate technology and progress and don't want anything to do with it. CORNISH: And true, disruptive technologies do come with lots of legal questions, right? ROOSE: Absolutely. I mean, what you're doing is challenging an incumbent in an industry that's pretty well-defined. So that is a part of disruption, but it's not the whole thing and usually now in Silicon Valley when someone says disruptive, all it means is that they're trying to sell you something.

Sony has hired a new prominent lawyer who's warning news organizations, including NPR, they must destroy copies of any of the emails and documents and that they may be breaking the law in publishing these stories. NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik is following all this and joins me now. And David, why don't you walk this back, talk a bit about the hack itself and some of the many salacious details that have been reported. DAVID FOLKENFLIK, BYLINE: Well, so this all started right around Thanksgiving week when some anonymous emailers came forth and warned Sony that they were going to post some pretty damaging stuff, and they proceeded to do so. There have been thoughts that these hackers have ties to North Koreans because one of the demands ultimately was that they not release this upcoming Seth Rogen caper film involving a harebrained CIA plot to kill the dictator of North Korea. But the North Koreans dispute this, and the FBI says there's no evidence to support that. Some of the stories that came out were pretty juicy and pretty embarrassing for Sony. There were advance copies of unreleased films put on sites for dissemination, clearly to damage the studio. There are questions of clear salary disparities between men and women at Sony pictures, as well as disparity for the pay of Jennifer Lawrence versus some of her costars. And additionally, the co-chairwoman of Sony Pictures, Amy Pascal, was shown an email chain kind of disparaging an Angelina Jolie project involving a movie to remake \"Cleopatra. \" So this was one series of embarrassments after another in recent days and weeks. BLOCK: Well, Sony has hired, as we mentioned, a high-profile attorney. It's David Boies. What's his warning been to news organizations and what's the foundation of his argument? FOLKENFLIK: Well, to be honest, Boies writes these letters to a lot of news organizations - as you said, including NPR - and he's offered a hodgepodge of reasons. He said there's an attorney-client privilege being violated, that Sony has intellectual property rights to the material that's being disseminated, that there's confidential corporate information that's been revealed and that everyone needs to destroy this material. Whether they have it directly or if they have access to it indirectly, they need to make sure this material does not get out. Sony Pictures has rights, he says. BLOCK: And you've been running that argument by some outside media lawyers. What do they say about it? FOLKENFLIK: Well, I talked to several today. One of them, a prominent lawyer for a top media company, said this fell under the legal doctrine of so sad, too bad, other than the question of releasing what are so far not-yet-released films, which I think the intellectual property law would tend to protect very much Sony's rights on. But you know, there was a Supreme Court case a little over a decade ago which expanded the rights of journalists. It was a case in which a radio station broadcast illegally-taped conversation between two local union officials, but the radio station wasn't involved in that taping and didn't solicit it or try to acquire it. It was given to the radio station. In that case the justices ruled in a majority that, journalistically, there was a public interest in it and that there was a right to know. And that trumped any sort of third-party involvement in that illegal act. BLOCK: And David, I gather that you think that the legal warning coming from Sony and its attorney is really more about atmospherics and damage-control than an actual legal threat. Why is that? FOLKENFLIK: Well, there are a couple of elements to it, one of which was that Boies initially sent the letter to a lot of big organizations in recent days, some of which, including NPR and The New York Times, have not been leading the pack or been particularly aggressive in reporting this story. Meanwhile, Gawker - which has been very interested and attuned to this story - only just received that legal note. And Fusion - based down in Miami, a joint enterprise of Univision and ABC News, which published some very embarrassing stories about the gender salary disparities at Sony - and Fusion tells me it has not yet received a copy of that letter. It seems to me that it's not simply about getting the material back. In addition, I think what you've really seen is Boies has successfully achieved at least a partial shift in the conversation. We're now talking about the legality and the morality of going after the material in those leaks, instead of about the stories themselves. BLOCK: OK. NPR's David Folkenflik - David, thanks.

Alas, it's also a prime season for con artists. Older adults are especially vulnerable to scammers posing as charities. More than a quarter of the victims of financial fraud are over 60. But now there are products on the market designed to protect seniors from fraudulent charities. NPR's Ina Jaffe covers aging and filed this report. INA JAFFE, BYLINE: Ruth Heimer usually donated about $50 a month to her favorite charities. But one day her family notice that her donations had gone from $50 a month to about $50 a day. KAI STINCHCOMBE: Because she just wasn't remembering that she donated yesterday. . . JAFFE: . . . Says her grandson, Kai Stinchcombe. She really went for those charity pitches with pictures of children and fonts that look like handwriting. STINCHCOMBE: And it says, Ruth, I'm hungry, and I need you to donate 20 cups of rice. You know, she thinks that kid is going to die if she doesn't donate 20 cups of rice. JAFFE: Stinchcombe figures his grandmother probably gave away tens of thousands of dollars to questionable causes. This was the reason he started a company called True Link. It issues prepaid Visa debit cards to older adults. Working with their families, they can customize each card to block specific kinds of payments. STINCHCOMBE: Wire transfers or sweepstakes entries or casinos - we're able to configure the card in such a way that it will decline payment for the type of transactions that are problematic. JAFFE: Older people who are victimized once tend to be victimized over and over again, says Doug Shadel, the fraud expert for the AARP. DOUG SHADEL: Because once you participate in one of these things, even if you only send in $3, you're really signaling to the con artist that you're someone who participates in this, compared to the majority of people who do not. JAFFE: But enough do. A recent study of older adults in Florida and Arizona found that about 60 percent of them had been targeted by scams, and about a quarter of those targeted had fallen for the pitches. (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE CONVERSATION)NICOLE: It's Nicole from Colonial. How are you? JAFFE: Nicole, selling gold coins at highly inflated prices. . . (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE CONVERSATION)NICOLE: I just wanted to know what card did you want to put this on? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: I don't recall placing this order. When did I place this order? NICOLE: It was about five weeks ago. JAFFE: This tape is from a law enforcement sting. Nicole is real. The victim is a plant. The audio was provided by the AARP. For Howard Tischler's mother, the problem wasn't gold coins. It started with an auto club policy for $80 a month. HOWARD TISCHLER: Despite the fact that she was legally blind, didn't own a car and didn't have a driver's license. JAFFE: One useless purchase led to many others and credit card bills of around $20,000. So Tischler founded Eversafe. The company scans all of the bank accounts, credit cards and investments of an older adult on a daily basis. If something looks fishy, the older adult and his or her designated family members are notified. TISCHLER: It enables them to continue to live independently, but to have an extra set of eyes. JAFFE: The AARP's come up with its own approach. They have a fraud watch network where hundreds of thousands of their members report new scams when they see them. Doug Shadel says they also have call centers where volunteers phone older people who are at high risk for being targeted by scam artists. SHADEL: We try and describe very specifically how the scans work, so you can say, ah, that - I've seen that before, and I'm not going to go for it. JAFFE: Research shows that counseling from someone their own age actually helps older adults resist scams and provides an alternative for those who prefer talking over technology.

STINCHCOMBE: Wire transfers or sweepstakes entries or casinos - we're able to configure the card in such a way that it will decline payment for the type of transactions that are problematic. JAFFE: Older people who are victimized once tend to be victimized over and over again, says Doug Shadel, the fraud expert for the AARP. DOUG SHADEL: Because once you participate in one of these things, even if you only send in $3, you're really signaling to the con artist that you're someone who participates in this, compared to the majority of people who do not. JAFFE: But enough do. A recent study of older adults in Florida and Arizona found that about 60 percent of them had been targeted by scams, and about a quarter of those targeted had fallen for the pitches. (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE CONVERSATION) NICOLE: It's Nicole from Colonial. How are you? JAFFE: Nicole, selling gold coins at highly inflated prices. . . (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE CONVERSATION) NICOLE: I just wanted to know what card did you want to put this on? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: I don't recall placing this order. When did I place this order? NICOLE: It was about five weeks ago. JAFFE: This tape is from a law enforcement sting. Nicole is real. The victim is a plant. The audio was provided by the AARP. For Howard Tischler's mother, the problem wasn't gold coins. It started with an auto club policy for $80 a month. HOWARD TISCHLER: Despite the fact that she was legally blind, didn't own a car and didn't have a driver's license. JAFFE: One useless purchase led to many others and credit card bills of around $20,000. So Tischler founded Eversafe. The company scans all of the bank accounts, credit cards and investments of an older adult on a daily basis. If something looks fishy, the older adult and his or her designated family members are notified. TISCHLER: It enables them to continue to live independently, but to have an extra set of eyes. JAFFE: The AARP's come up with its own approach. They have a fraud watch network where hundreds of thousands of their members report new scams when they see them. Doug Shadel says they also have call centers where volunteers phone older people who are at high risk for being targeted by scam artists. SHADEL: We try and describe very specifically how the scans work, so you can say, ah, that - I've seen that before, and I'm not going to go for it. JAFFE: Research shows that counseling from someone their own age actually helps older adults resist scams and provides an alternative for those who prefer talking over technology.

You might as well throw it away. Don't email. Don't text. Don't update. Don't send photos. That's the takeaway lesson for New York Times columnist Farhad Manjoo after the data hack at Sony Pictures. The attack exposed thousands of emails and led to the shelving of the film \"The Interview. \" But to Manjoo, it's a reminder that communications online are nearly impossible to keep private, and he's here to talk about the alternative. Welcome to the program. FARHAD MANJOO: Hi. Good to be here. CORNISH: So you're not actually calling on us to abandon online communications, right? MANJOO: No, I think I'm actually calling for people to be conscious of the fact that anything they say on these devices can be infiltrated, can be made public very easily. What we need is kind of a mindset change, at least until we make these devices more secure. CORNISH: One thing you do advocate for is the quote, \"erasable Internet. \" Define it and how would our communications be different? MANJOO: Yeah, this is really kind of a profound change in the way we think about the Internet. Right now everything we do on digital devices is recorded somewhere, either by the device or by a server somewhere and it's usually stored. That's what we saw on the Sony hack. That's pretty much how email and other technologies we use - that's how they work. What we saw a couple years ago is the introduction of this app called Snapchat and what was interesting about it was that you send a message through Snapchat and then after the recipient looks at it, the message is deleted. Now, there was some question about how securely it's been deleted and the FTC kind of went after Snapchat for making claims that the messages were kind of gone forever, but you could get at them in some way. But I think what Snapchat showed was this desire for people to communicate with devices in a way that wasn't, kind of, permanent. And I think that we may start to see that model of communication, you know, become maybe not the default, but something that people do in addition to communicating over things like email. CORNISH: One of the comments in the comment section of the story you wrote says (reading comment), the only way the disappearing picture thing works is if both sides abide by the rules, and that is exactly what can never be guaranteed. So, Farhad, I mean Snapchat has been hacked. If you Google Snapchat leaks, you can turn up all kinds of things. Can that really work? MANJOO: Yeah, I mean I think you still have to worry about it being, you know, not completely secure. But I think the difference is that there's a mindset change. If you're communicating with somebody over Snapchat, if you trust that person you're going to sort of expect that that message is going to be gone. And, you know, I think that would've happened in many of the emails we saw in the Sony hack. You know, people were discussing, kind of, delicate business matters. Neither party wanted what they were saying to get out there. If they were communicating over a system like Snapchat, you know, that message wouldn't have been found later on.

We brought her on to tell us about some tech gifts in this illustrated guide to gadgets and gizmos. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LET'S GET PHYSICAL\")OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN: (Singing) Let's get physical, physical. GREENE: I hope you're moving. So first up something for the athletes in your life - sweat-proof headphones. JACQUI CHENG: They're the Relays by Sol Republic. They sound great. They resist sweat. They're really durable. You can step on them or shove them in your bag. It sometimes might feel weird to give people exercise headphones as a gift, but people really love it. GREENE: Wow. Waterproof, and they travel well. OK. Here's another gift idea for sound lovers. (SOUNDBITE OF UNIDENTIFIED SONG)CHENG: One of our popular items right now is actually the turntable that we like by Audio Technica, and that one's about $250. If you look at the Nielsen charts, vinyl is actually kind of taking off a little bit. People are building up their collections again. And this one that we like, it's kind of cool because it has a USB port so you can connect it to your computer if you want to and digitize your collection.

And maybe you want to inspire your loved one to become a medium maker, not just a consumer. Well, Cheng proposes looking into drones. CHENG: A lot of modern drones let you attach a camera nowadays, which is really fun for a lot of people because you can sort of fly it around your property and around your house and neighborhood. People have been making really interesting videos and posting them to YouTube. (SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO)GREENE: Videos like this one - it was posted by the company GoPro, which makes the tiny cameras that are often fitted onto drones. In this video, you're hearing fireworks as a drone swoops in and out capturing these astonishing images and sounds from inside the explosions. Here are Cheng's recommendations for drones. CHENG: The expensive one that we like is the DJI Phantom 2 Vision, and it's about $1,100. So that's probably more, you know, for the big kids in your life. And then we also like a smaller drone - it's about $90 - called the Blade Nano QX. You're not going to lose too much if it crashes all the time and it gets broken.

It lasted for about half an hour. This followed a blackout that went on for some nine hours yesterday and raised a lot of questions about who or what could be behind the disruption. Dyn Research has been watching the outages. The firm studies internet performance around the world. And Doug Madory, Dyn's director of Internet analysis, was among the first people to flag what was happening. Welcome to the program, Doug. DOUG MADORY: Hello. CORNISH: So when did you first notice? What exactly did you see? MADORY: So we monitor - one of our data sources that we use is BGP - that's Border Gateway Protocol. And what that is is just the information that the Internet service providers around the world exchange with each other on how to direct traffic around the Internet from one place to another. And so the BGP routes for North Korea starting on Sunday started to become very unstable. We saw them go down, come right back up, go down, come right back up, and was having a lot of difficulty staying online. CORNISH: Help us understand in layman's terms, like, what happened. I don't know how common it is for North Korea to have outages. MADORY: Sure. In the last couple of years, there's been occasions that they have had outages. And because they are the only party that handles international connectivity for North Korea, when they have an outage then essentially they have a national outage on this very small Internet they have. So what we saw in the last couple of days was not something that I've observed before. Typically the outages are brief. They are also isolated events. And we don't see this 24 hours of routing instability where they are struggling to maintain a connection followed by nine and a half hours of blackout. CORNISH: How large is the network of North Korea? I mean, give us some comparison. MADORY: Absolutely. It's a little over a thousand IP addresses for the country. As comparison, the Internet - the United States is just under a billion, and so it is quite small. CORNISH: It's not unusual to see Internet outages in many places in the world, right? I mean, give us some examples of other instances where governments experience Internet outages. Why - you know, how does this compare? MADORY: OK. Sure. There have been a number of cases in the last couple of years, either by the direction of the government - that included Syria, Egypt and then last year was Sudan - and then even in cases of antigovernment protestors or forces in Thailand and Libya. North Korea, like Cuba and Uzbekistan and a handful of countries that rely on a single ISP for their international connectivity, they have an outage then that means they are shut off from the global Internet. CORNISH: What do you make of the speculation that the U. S. is somehow responsible for this outage? MADORY: I think this doesn't look like an outage as far as like a fiber cut or a power outage - some of the more catastrophic technological failures that cause Internet outages. Like I said, we saw these networks struggling to maintain connections for hours and hours until finally they dropped offline. And so that's more consistent with two possibilities - benign explanation would be that this is just extraordinarily poor timing for a software glitch on the router or this is also consistent with some sort of a denial of service attack directed at the network of North Korea. Given the sophistication was quite low, it does seem that if it were a cyber-attack that it would be surprising to find out a nation-state did this and it took them hours to take down this tiny network. CORNISH: Doug Madory - he's the director of Internet analysis for Dyn Research. He joined us to talk about the Internet blackouts North Korea has been experiencing over the last 24 hours.

Just ask the folks behind the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge. But there were many mini-movements that took root online as well, especially on Twitter. When a bunch of tweets are tagged with the same phrase and when the goal of those tweets is to bring about change, people sometimes call it hashtag activism, and it's not for everyone. BEVERLY GOODEN: I kind of got on Twitter and I would joke about whatever was going on in my day. If I had some, you know, good coffee, I would say coffee is great, you know, #coffeeisgreat. CORNISH: Bev Gooden was no hashtag activist. She was an HR manager in Charlotte, North Carolina. But on September 8, she, like many of us, saw the video footage of NFL player Ray Rice punching his then-fiancee, Janay Palmer. And suddenly, Bev Gooden found something else to tweet about - domestic abuse. GOODEN: I tried to leave the house once after an abusive episode, and he blocked me. He slept in front of the door that entire night - #WhyIStayed. CORNISH: And then she sent out this. GOODEN: I stayed because my pastor told me that God hates divorce. It didn't cross my mind that God might hate abuse, too. CORNISH: And a little later, this one. GOODEN: He said he would change. He promised it was the last time. I believed him. He lied. CORNISH: This is how Bev Gooden told her friends, family and all of Twitter she'd once been in an abusive marriage, abuse she never reported to police. Now divorced, she felt herself getting riled up over the way people online were talking about Janay Palmer. GOODEN: I was watching these tweets in real-time, and they were overwhelmingly pointed at Janay. And they were asking why she stayed with Ray after, you know, the full video came out. And so everyone was saying, you know, well, she must want his money or she is stupid. And so in that moment, I was so angry, I kind of felt that guilt and shame come back. And I just kind of shut off these tweets just to kind of drive the point home that I had a reason, you know, that Janay probably has a reason, and that it's the wrong question. CORNISH: Why is it the wrong question? GOODEN: You know, it's the wrong question because there are so many other questions that are pertinent, such as are you OK? You know, how can I help you? What do you need? CORNISH: Well, I want to hear some of those tweets as women found your hashtag and started adding their own versions, their own posts. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: @HToneTastic #WhyIStayed - Because his abuse was so gradual and manipulative, I didn't even realize what was happening to me. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: @BBZaftig #WhyIStayed - Because he told me that no one would love me after him, and I was insecure enough to believe him. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: @MonPetitTX - Because I had watched my mother stay and she had watched hers before that. GOODEN: You know, when the first tweets started to roll in, it was a much smaller conversation. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #4: Why I stayed. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #5: Why I stayed. GOODEN: But then hundreds started to come in. UNIDENTIFIED WOMEN: (In unison) Why I stayed. GOODEN: And thousands started to come in. And it was like it opened up a door. UNIDENTIFIED WOMEN: (In unison) Why I stayed. GOODEN: It was like we all just kind of greeted each other with this familiarity of violence, which is really sad, but also really hopeful. UNIDENTIFIED WOMEN: (In unison) Why I stayed. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #6: @TheRealistOG #WhyIStayed - I stayed because nobody believed such a respected man could be capable of such horrible things. GOODEN: @SassNotClass #WhyIStayed - Because I was so afraid to be alone. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #4: @Doughlicious (ph) Because 99 percent of the time it was perfect. CORNISH: Do you recognize some of those? GOODEN: Definitely, the afraid to be alone because sometimes you don't want to tell anyone what's going on. I didn't want to tell anyone what was going on. And so I related to a lot of that. One tweet that I saw, a woman said that #WhyIStayed because my word was my only evidence. And that is the story of a lot of us. A lot of - a lot of women don't report. CORNISH: Now, within hours of your first tweet, two new hashtags emerged as a kind of rebuttal. All right. Someone else decided to post their stories using the tag #WhenILeft and then also #WhyILeft. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: @Givemeahand (ph), #WhyILeft - when I saw my face after emergency surgery to realign my jaw, after six screws and six weeks on a liquid diet, I knew I deserved more. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #4: @DiamondGirl5 (ph) #WhyILeft - He almost killed me. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #5: @notokmaybeok, #WhyIStayed - I thought my baby boys needed their dad. #WhyILeft? I didn't want them to learn to hit any woman ever. CORNISH: Bev Gooden, one of the criticisms of your initial posts were that it kind of kept the focus on the victims. And similarly with these, that the idea is still kind of having the victims explain instead of focusing on maybe why the perpetrators are acting the way they do. How did you feel about the way the conversation evolved online? GOODEN: Well, I think the development of the additional hashtags #WhenILeft and #WhyILeft was kind of the natural progression of the conversation. I was afraid at first that it would detract from the women who may not have left and kind of isolate them again. But I think with all the criticisms, the key for me is that #WhyIStayed isn't an endorsement of staying in an abusive relationship. You know, rather it's simply providing an answer to society's question. They asked and we answered. There are many reasons why someone would stay. And domestic violence isn't cut and dry. It's not easy, you know, to just say well, he hit you, you'll leave. It's very complex. CORNISH: Did you ever regret doing this? I mean, now you're known as a woman who tweeted about why she stayed in an abusive marriage. You're no longer anonymous. You can't tweet about breakfast or. . . GOODEN: (Laughter). CORNISH: Anything superficial, right? I mean. . . GOODEN: Yeah. CORNISH: Did you have moments where you thought why did I do this? GOODEN: I didn't have moments where I thought why did I do this? What really helped me understand that it was important is that the hashtag helped people realize the commonalities in abuser statements. That was huge for me, you know, because they'll always say I do this because I love you or you're the only one that makes me this angry. And that statement is easy to believe when it's just the two of you. And so seeing women realize that they're being told the same line that others are being told lets me we know that it was worth it. CORNISH: But people can argue that this doesn't really change the lives of women who are still enduring domestic abuse. And what's your response to that? GOODEN: You know, I think the beauty of hashtag activism is that it creates an opportunity for sustained engagement, which is important for any cause. So you never know what a hashtag has inspired someone to do off-line. You know, the hope is that the hashtag will inspire action. There was a woman who - I think it was two weeks ago now - she tweeted to me that #WhyIStayed helped her get out and stay out. And if that's not direct action, I don't know what is. CORNISH: Well, Bev Gooden, thank you so much for sharing this story with us. GOODEN: Thank you. Thank you for having me. I appreciate it. (MUSIC)CORNISH: Beverly Gooden, activist. She created the social media hashtag #WhyIStayed to talk about the issue of domestic violence. (MUSIC)CORNISH: Tomorrow, more on this year's hashtag activism. We'll find out how the kidnapping of a group of Nigerian schoolgirls grew into an international campaign to #bringbackourgirls. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:   This past year was a big one for social media activism. Just ask the folks behind the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge. But there were many mini-movements that took root online as well, especially on Twitter. When a bunch of tweets are tagged with the same phrase and when the goal of those tweets is to bring about change, people sometimes call it hashtag activism, and it's not for everyone. BEVERLY GOODEN: I kind of got on Twitter and I would joke about whatever was going on in my day. If I had some, you know, good coffee, I would say coffee is great, you know, #coffeeisgreat. CORNISH: Bev Gooden was no hashtag activist. She was an HR manager in Charlotte, North Carolina. But on September 8, she, like many of us, saw the video footage of NFL player Ray Rice punching his then-fiancee, Janay Palmer. And suddenly, Bev Gooden found something else to tweet about - domestic abuse. GOODEN: I tried to leave the house once after an abusive episode, and he blocked me. He slept in front of the door that entire night - #WhyIStayed. CORNISH: And then she sent out this. GOODEN: I stayed because my pastor told me that God hates divorce. It didn't cross my mind that God might hate abuse, too. CORNISH: And a little later, this one. GOODEN: He said he would change. He promised it was the last time. I believed him. He lied. CORNISH: This is how Bev Gooden told her friends, family and all of Twitter she'd once been in an abusive marriage, abuse she never reported to police. Now divorced, she felt herself getting riled up over the way people online were talking about Janay Palmer. GOODEN: I was watching these tweets in real-time, and they were overwhelmingly pointed at Janay. And they were asking why she stayed with Ray after, you know, the full video came out. And so everyone was saying, you know, well, she must want his money or she is stupid. And so in that moment, I was so angry, I kind of felt that guilt and shame come back. And I just kind of shut off these tweets just to kind of drive the point home that I had a reason, you know, that Janay probably has a reason, and that it's the wrong question. CORNISH: Why is it the wrong question? GOODEN: You know, it's the wrong question because there are so many other questions that are pertinent, such as are you OK? You know, how can I help you? What do you need? CORNISH: Well, I want to hear some of those tweets as women found your hashtag and started adding their own versions, their own posts. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: @HToneTastic #WhyIStayed - Because his abuse was so gradual and manipulative, I didn't even realize what was happening to me. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: @BBZaftig #WhyIStayed - Because he told me that no one would love me after him, and I was insecure enough to believe him. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: @MonPetitTX - Because I had watched my mother stay and she had watched hers before that. GOODEN: You know, when the first tweets started to roll in, it was a much smaller conversation. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #4: Why I stayed. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #5: Why I stayed. GOODEN: But then hundreds started to come in. UNIDENTIFIED WOMEN: (In unison) Why I stayed. GOODEN: And thousands started to come in. And it was like it opened up a door. UNIDENTIFIED WOMEN: (In unison) Why I stayed. GOODEN: It was like we all just kind of greeted each other with this familiarity of violence, which is really sad, but also really hopeful. UNIDENTIFIED WOMEN: (In unison) Why I stayed. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #6: @TheRealistOG #WhyIStayed - I stayed because nobody believed such a respected man could be capable of such horrible things. GOODEN: @SassNotClass #WhyIStayed - Because I was so afraid to be alone. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #4: @Doughlicious (ph) Because 99 percent of the time it was perfect. CORNISH: Do you recognize some of those? GOODEN: Definitely, the afraid to be alone because sometimes you don't want to tell anyone what's going on. I didn't want to tell anyone what was going on. And so I related to a lot of that. One tweet that I saw, a woman said that #WhyIStayed because my word was my only evidence. And that is the story of a lot of us. A lot of - a lot of women don't report. CORNISH: Now, within hours of your first tweet, two new hashtags emerged as a kind of rebuttal. All right. Someone else decided to post their stories using the tag #WhenILeft and then also #WhyILeft. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: @Givemeahand (ph), #WhyILeft - when I saw my face after emergency surgery to realign my jaw, after six screws and six weeks on a liquid diet, I knew I deserved more. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #4: @DiamondGirl5 (ph) #WhyILeft - He almost killed me. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #5: @notokmaybeok, #WhyIStayed - I thought my baby boys needed their dad. #WhyILeft? I didn't want them to learn to hit any woman ever. CORNISH: Bev Gooden, one of the criticisms of your initial posts were that it kind of kept the focus on the victims. And similarly with these, that the idea is still kind of having the victims explain instead of focusing on maybe why the perpetrators are acting the way they do. How did you feel about the way the conversation evolved online? GOODEN: Well, I think the development of the additional hashtags #WhenILeft and #WhyILeft was kind of the natural progression of the conversation. I was afraid at first that it would detract from the women who may not have left and kind of isolate them again. But I think with all the criticisms, the key for me is that #WhyIStayed isn't an endorsement of staying in an abusive relationship.

That's why NASA is looking for cheaper ways to produce the next generation of space telescopes. And one place to save money is the telescope's mirror. As part of his series Joe's Big Idea, NPR's Joe Palca has this story of a scientist who's found a way to build mirrors using glitter. Here's Joe. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: Big telescopes use giant mirrors to capture starlight and focus it on a camera or some other kind of detector. The bigger the mirror, the finer the detail you can see out there. Astronomers like big mirrors. But in addition to the expense, Grover Swartzlander says there's another problem with building ever-larger telescopes. GROVER SWARTZLANDER: Well, there's a fundamental limit to the size of telescopes we can put in space. PALCA: Swartzlander's a physicist specializing in optics at Rochester Institute of Technology. He says they're just aren't rockets large enough to put really, really big telescopes into space. So instead of making mirrors the usual way out of glass, Swartzlander and his colleagues came up with the idea of making telescope mirrors that weigh practically nothing because they're made of what is essentially glitter, just like the stuff you buy in a crafts store. Tiny reflecting particles made of plastic with a metal coating. He says the idea is to take the shiny particles into space, spray a cloud of them outside the spacecraft and use lasers on the spacecraft to manipulate them into the shape of a mirror. SWARTZLANDER: By controlling all these little glittery objects in space and the sweeping laser beams across them, we are going to orient them and stabilize them enough so that we can form some kind of an image. PALCA: Now, there is a problem here. Yes, the mirror would be lightweight, but it wouldn't be a mirror with a smooth surface like you get with a glass mirror. SWARTZLANDER: The detector's going to see a bunch of speckles. It's going to be a very terrible image. But what the real progress is on this topic is that there's a new trend in imaging, which is called computational photography. And by taking a series of these images, we can unravel the actual - an image of - a good image of the object from all this speckley type of things that the detector will see. PALCA: Swartzlander says it'll take decades to perfect the technology for making giant glitter mirrors that can fly in space. But that doesn't mean this is just a pie-in-the-sky idea. SWARTZLANDER: We've already demonstrated this glitter concept in the laboratory. PALCA: Swartzlander says they went to their local Michaels - that's a craft store chain - bought a jar of glitter. . . SWARTZLANDER: And sprinkled it on to a concave surface. And one of my smart graduate students worked on some algorithms to actually achieve a perfect image. PALCA: And so this is just - down to the corner craft store and buy a jar of glitter and use that to create an image. SWARTZLANDER: That's correct. PALCA: Wow. Swartzlander is hoping to send a pint-size version of his glitter mirror into space in the next few years. Joe Palca, NPR News.

ELISE HU, BYLINE: On this bustling corner in New York's SoHo neighborhood, you'll find what was once the Bowery subway station. JOEL LAPADULA: And actually, right here we have the staircase going down to what was the subway. HU: Today, Joel LaPadula rents out this corner spot to a retail company selling pants at 40 percent off. Other days, this space serves as a test kitchen and bar or it hosts showrooms for press events. The one thing this place doesn't do is anything permanent. LAPADULA: Pop-ups, or this idea of selling something for a temporary period of time, has been around since human trade has been around. HU: So what happens when human trade is over the Internet? Boom times for more temporary physical spaces. And industry is springing up around pop-ups. LaPadula works for OpenHouse, a company that owns storefronts in the always fashion-forward SoHo and rents them out for retail, promotional events, exhibits - whatever clients need. LAPADULA: As long as they can change it back, they can do whatever they want. HU: Leases can last as short as a single day, or shorter. LAPADULA: Trojan condoms was the shortest, so it was about 20 minutes. HU: Los Angeles-based industry consultant Syama Meagher has been watching pop-up retailing develop for the last half decade. SYAMA MEAGHER: With food trucks becoming more and more open and available and kind of the migration bringing that, I actually think that pop-up shops kind of followed suit. HU: As consumers do more and more on our mobile devices, the short-term leases promised by pop-ups mean brands can be more mobile too, moving around to where their customers cluster. MEAGHER: Larger online brands are bridging together these empty spaces and starting to find ways to get in front of their customers. HU: The old retail world meant long-established brands existed first in brick-and-mortar stores, then they expanded online. Now LaPadula says the model is flipped. LAPADULA: And the business model is innovative in a way. And that's because you can now start a company on the Internet, and then there's this intermediary step between a brick-and-mortar where you can pop up and have tactile, real experience. HU: That clicks-to-bricks model, as the marketing folks call it, is exactly what happened with the eyewear brand Warby Parker. Dave Gilboa is one Warby Parker's co-founders. DAVE GILBOA: We're kind of learning as we go along. HU: They learned first by using their apartment as a showroom. They also experimented with a traveling bus full of frames, and they used pop-up stores as labs. GILBOA: It was just kind of a fun place for us to really experiment. What time's your appointment? HU: While you can easily buy Warby Parker frames without ever stepping foot into a store and many people do, the glasses brand found many of its customers still crave a physical experience.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: We will not succumb to threats. . . CORNISH: The debate we're listening in on today comes down to this - should ordinary Muslims make it a point to publicly condemn the actions of violent Islamic groups? In a speech in September, President Obama made his case. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)OBAMA: It is time for the world, especially Muslim communities, to explicitly, forcefully and consistently reject the ideology of organizations like al-Qaida and ISIL. CORNISH: Of course, some Muslim organizations are doing that. A recent example with the rise of the extremist group ISIS, one British organization started the campaign Not In My Name, with a Twitter hashtag and video. (SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO, \"NOT IN MY NAME - MUSLIMS AGAINST ISIS\")UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: We must all unite together and try to stop this group from damaging Islam and damaging Muslims. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Not in my name. CORNISH: But there are some Muslims who think these expectations are unfair. And some of them got behind a more cynical hashtag. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2 AND WOMAN #2: (In unison) #MuslimApologies. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: @mahmooha2013 - I'm sorry you tapped my phone and all you learned was that I was planning a potluck. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: @SmellTheWilayah - Sorry that covering my body out of modesty doesn't fit into your social stereotype of women. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: @FarhadAhajiAli (ph) - Sorry that our religion is just too cold to handle. #MuslimApologies. CORNISH: The person who helped launch this hashtag is Maha Hilal. MAHA HILAL: This hashtag illuminates a very divisive conversation in the Muslim community. CORNISH: Hilal is a recent PhD graduate from American University and says the hashtag grew partly out of anger, partly out of whimsy. HILAL: I created this fake shirt saying I'm Muslim and I'm sorry for everything. That was on one side of the shirt. And on the back it said in the past, present and future. So to me, it was a joke. It was saying, like, no matter what, this is just a blanket apology. And from this point on, like, I don't want to have to apologize for anything else. This should just cover everything, right? CORNISH: And, of course, she posted a picture of the fake T-shirt on Facebook. HILAL: And then someone who had commented said we should take this conversation to Twitter. And within hours, there were, you know, hundreds of tweets. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2 AND WOMAN #2: (In unison) #MuslimApologies. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: @Nahda Productions - I'm sorry that while Europe was in the Dark Ages, Islamic civilization thrived in technology and science. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: @__rose3 - I'm sorry that Mufasa had to die in \"The Lion King. \"UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: @Elkilanimaluna (ph) - As a Muslim, I apologize for World War I and World War II, even if it has nothing to do with the Muslims, but just in case. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: @CoolStoryLife - I'm sorry for existing. CORNISH: Some of them were quite pointed. There was one that said I'm sorry that Muslims keep getting in the way of your oil. Another one that said I'm sorry we didn't quietly accept the puppet dictators that the West loves imposing on us. What surprised you about the directions that these went in? HILAL: You know, they were kind of being sarcastic in terms of sorry we're getting in the way of whatever goals it is that you want to accomplish in the Muslim world. So for sure, there was a little bit of pushback in terms of what is the relationship between what's happening in many of these countries and the ways in which the U. S. is intervening? CORNISH: You know, for people hearing these and at the same time may be hearing news of extremist acts throughout the world, what is the problem with saying some horrendous act happening in the name of my religion is not something that I condone and I want to speak out about it? HILAL: Sure. I, for one, you know, when I see an act of terrorism on the news, I don't identify with the person. I feel nothing towards that individual using Islam as a rationale or justification. And I think that that's the way that other people from other minority groups or from other groups in general - you know, when crimes are committed by members of their group, how do they react? What, do white Christian Americans feel any sense of responsibility or any need to speak out against a crime if an act of violence was perpetrated in the name of Christianity? No. I think that that's extremely problematic. And I also think - and I think a lot of Muslim organizations are guilty of this as well - there's not enough analysis of what's being done in terms of why exactly are these individuals committing acts of violence? Obviously, there's a global war on terror; obviously, there's occupation. But then - it's always than just reduced to - especially in the case of Muslims - religion and that's it. CORNISH: There's also the argument that when people speak out, it's not necessarily intended to be an apology for all of Islam, that they're instead really expressing their own outrage. HILAL: I mean, I think honestly, I've heard this counterargument numerous times. And I just think there's a very fine line in terms of condemning and apologizing. And again, I think it comes back to what is expected of Muslims and Muslim Americans, and is this expected of other groups? And I think the answer is no, it's not expected of other groups. CORNISH: One thing you wrote in your essay in sort of explaining this is that you wanted to respond to this idea of kind of being held responsible for what extremists do using cynicism and sarcasm as a way of fighting back. One criticism is that it's just that - cynicism and sarcasm. What is the value of that? HILAL: In a way it's just catharsis, right? It's just a way of releasing all these pressures and stress. A way to say, like, it sucks but this is how we're going to deal with it. And also, I think through these kind of actions, you find like-minded individuals who are not just tweeting, but who are actually doing actions on the ground, who are doing research, who are trying to transform their communities. You know, for me, I assumed, you know, a handful of people would also agree with my perspective. But then the evolution of this hashtag demonstrated to me, for example, that it's more than just 10 people; it's thousands of Muslims who are sick and tired of being held collectively responsible. And we can potentially, you know, connect with one another and figure out ways to constructively address this issue beyond Twitter as a platform. CORNISH: Maha Hilal, a recent PhD graduate from American University. She helped launch the Twitter hashtag #MuslimApologies. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  And this week, I've been talking to people about online activism, using social media sites like Twitter to advance a cause, start a debate or keep one going. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: We will not succumb to threats. . . CORNISH: The debate we're listening in on today comes down to this - should ordinary Muslims make it a point to publicly condemn the actions of violent Islamic groups? In a speech in September, President Obama made his case. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) OBAMA: It is time for the world, especially Muslim communities, to explicitly, forcefully and consistently reject the ideology of organizations like al-Qaida and ISIL. CORNISH: Of course, some Muslim organizations are doing that. A recent example with the rise of the extremist group ISIS, one British organization started the campaign Not In My Name, with a Twitter hashtag and video. (SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO, \"NOT IN MY NAME - MUSLIMS AGAINST ISIS\") UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: We must all unite together and try to stop this group from damaging Islam and damaging Muslims. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Not in my name. CORNISH: But there are some Muslims who think these expectations are unfair. And some of them got behind a more cynical hashtag. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2 AND WOMAN #2: (In unison) #MuslimApologies. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: @mahmooha2013 - I'm sorry you tapped my phone and all you learned was that I was planning a potluck. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: @SmellTheWilayah - Sorry that covering my body out of modesty doesn't fit into your social stereotype of women. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: @FarhadAhajiAli (ph) - Sorry that our religion is just too cold to handle. #MuslimApologies. CORNISH: The person who helped launch this hashtag is Maha Hilal. MAHA HILAL: This hashtag illuminates a very divisive conversation in the Muslim community. CORNISH: Hilal is a recent PhD graduate from American University and says the hashtag grew partly out of anger, partly out of whimsy. HILAL: I created this fake shirt saying I'm Muslim and I'm sorry for everything. That was on one side of the shirt. And on the back it said in the past, present and future. So to me, it was a joke. It was saying, like, no matter what, this is just a blanket apology. And from this point on, like, I don't want to have to apologize for anything else. This should just cover everything, right? CORNISH: And, of course, she posted a picture of the fake T-shirt on Facebook. HILAL: And then someone who had commented said we should take this conversation to Twitter. And within hours, there were, you know, hundreds of tweets. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2 AND WOMAN #2: (In unison) #MuslimApologies. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: @Nahda Productions - I'm sorry that while Europe was in the Dark Ages, Islamic civilization thrived in technology and science. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: @__rose3 - I'm sorry that Mufasa had to die in \"The Lion King. \" UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: @Elkilanimaluna (ph) - As a Muslim, I apologize for World War I and World War II, even if it has nothing to do with the Muslims, but just in case. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: @CoolStoryLife - I'm sorry for existing. CORNISH: Some of them were quite pointed. There was one that said I'm sorry that Muslims keep getting in the way of your oil. Another one that said I'm sorry we didn't quietly accept the puppet dictators that the West loves imposing on us. What surprised you about the directions that these went in? HILAL: You know, they were kind of being sarcastic in terms of sorry we're getting in the way of whatever goals it is that you want to accomplish in the Muslim world. So for sure, there was a little bit of pushback in terms of what is the relationship between what's happening in many of these countries and the ways in which the U. S. is intervening? CORNISH: You know, for people hearing these and at the same time may be hearing news of extremist acts throughout the world, what is the problem with saying some horrendous act happening in the name of my religion is not something that I condone and I want to speak out about it? HILAL: Sure. I, for one, you know, when I see an act of terrorism on the news, I don't identify with the person. I feel nothing towards that individual using Islam as a rationale or justification. And I think that that's the way that other people from other minority groups or from other groups in general - you know, when crimes are committed by members of their group, how do they react? What, do white Christian Americans feel any sense of responsibility or any need to speak out against a crime if an act of violence was perpetrated in the name of Christianity? No. I think that that's extremely problematic. And I also think - and I think a lot of Muslim organizations are guilty of this as well - there's not enough analysis of what's being done in terms of why exactly are these individuals committing acts of violence? Obviously, there's a global war on terror; obviously, there's occupation. But then - it's always than just reduced to - especially in the case of Muslims - religion and that's it.

In the last installment of our series on early literacy, NPR's Lynn Neary visits the Sesame Workshop. LYNN NEARY, BYLINE: When early viewers of \"Sesame Street\" first tuned in to the show, they met a new universe of characters, from real-life grown-ups like Gordon, to an oversized yellow bird who would soon become famous. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"SESAME STREET\")MATT ROBINSON: (As Gordon) Hello, Big Bird. CAROLL SPINNEY: (As Big Bird) Oh, hi, Gordon. ROBINSON: (As Gordon) How are you? NEARY: These days, a toddler is as likely to meet up with Big Bird for the first time on a tablet or smartphone as on a TV screen, says Michael Levine. He's executive director of the Joan Ganz Cooney Center at Sesame Workshop. MICHAEL LEVINE: Kids tend to consume across platforms and across settings. They're on the couch. They're in the living room. They're outside even, or they're on the go. So these mobile media and these interactive platforms allow for anytime-anywhere learning. NEARY: Sesame Workshop is building on the popularity of characters like Big Bird, as well as 45 years of educational research to create new digital products for young children. Testing is a key step in the development of these products. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Thank you so much for coming in today. We really appreciate your help. NEARY: A number of young children and their parents troop into Sesame Workshop's corporate headquarters in New York City to try out a new game. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Find all of the beans with polka dots. KEVIN CLASH: (As Elmo) Yeah. MAN #1: You did it. NEARY: As the children play the game quietly on a tablet, researchers sit in a small room nearby, watching them on a computer. Michelle Caplin of the workshop's digital content department says they're observing how each child interacts with the mechanics of the game. MICHELLE CAPLIN: We are seeing how he is choosing to help Elmo jump up the beanstalk. Is he swiping? Is he tapping? Is he piloting Elmo with his finger? And the more kids that we put in front of this game, the better we'll understand the intuitive way in which kids interact with it. NEARY: Whether the workshop is creating a new app or a new video, Sesame Workshop Vice President Rose Marie Trulio says the most important thing is the content. ROSE MARIE TRULIO: People believe just because it's interactive it must be a better educational tool. And you could put pretty crappy content on a digital device. NEARY: Trulio says her team asked educators what was most needed to help children develop literacy skills. The answer was vocabulary. TRULIO: We're trying to teach children words in order to build their core knowledge skills. Children know bus, and they know car, and they know boat. But do they know the superordinate word called transportation? NEARY: The workshop created a game called \"Big Bird's Words\" that's aimed at showing kids how words are related. Vice President Jennifer Perry demonstrates. JENNIFER PERRY: This is the introduction to the app \"Big Bird's Words. \"NEARY: It starts off as a fairly straightforward word recognition game. (SOUNDBITE OF APP, \"BIG BIRD'S WORDS\")SPINNEY: (As Big Bird) Here's how to play. I'll say a clue, then you tap that thing in the picture. NEARY: The game has been designed for a smartphone because at a certain point, the app turns into a wordascope. Perry says that's a made-up term for a camera-like device that children can use to track down words wherever they might be. Kids put a word, like milk, into a viewfinder and search for an object, like a milk carton on the kitchen counter, that has that word on it. (SOUNDBITE OF APP, \"BIG BIRD'S WORDS\")SPINNEY: (As Big Bird) Ta-da. You found it. Milk. NEARY: And then that brings you to a page where milk is in the middle, and there's a whole lot of things around - other words around milk, like dairy, teeth, farmer, cow, farm, goat. What's that? PERRY: This is our word tree. Our word tree is to show the interconnectedness of the words themselves to grow a child's vocabulary as well as to show a child how these concepts, in the real world, relate to each other so that they will learn where milk comes from - from a cow, on a farm, where there are also goats. It's a dairy product. Milk is good for your teeth, and the farmer takes care of everybody. NEARY: (Laughter). Not only does this game introduce kids to large concepts, it also requires an adult to help the child, a decision aimed at getting parents to interact with their children instead of using the device as a babysitter. Ian Rowe, the CEO of Public Prep, a New York City charter school, says getting parents involved in their kids' education is crucial. IAN ROWE: It's part of the reason we actually launched a pre-K partnership with Sesame Workshop because so many of our kids were coming in not having enough exposure to language, which then translates into background knowledge, which is the foundation for all future learning. NEARY: Public prep just added the first pre-K program to its existing network of elementary and middle schools. Sesame Workshop is developing materials for the school. On this day, a small group of children gathered around an iPad to watch a video about families. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: (Singing) A family, a family. What, what, what, is a family? NEARY: Afterwards, teacher Jesse Marks leads the children in a discussion. JESSE MARKS: Wow. So what did you think of that? UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #2: A family together. MARKS: It's a family together, right? NEARY: The videos are just one part of the lesson plan on families. They are used together with books, arts and crafts, and writing projects. Sesame Workshop's Akimi Gibson works closely with the school. AKIMI GIBSON: Our videos for children act as sparks, and so we think of it as view-and-do. NEARY: Gibson says the videos are just one tool the teacher can use in the classroom. GIBSON: So our vision for this year isn't to give iPads to children. Our vision is always put the technology in the hands of the adult, right? So it's the adult's decision to say, let's come over and let's talk about something, right? Let's delve into this big concept, right? NEARY: Technology, says the pre-K's managing director, Haifa Bautista, is incorporated into the classroom because it will always be part of life for these children, just as books are. HAIFA BAUTISTA: I mean, we don't hide the books in the classroom. They're right there on the wall. They're on the bookshelf - same time the little screen is available, so that kids can relate to both. And, for us, technology is part of the same journey towards getting them ready for kindergarten. NEARY: Once these kids are in elementary school, says Bautista, they'll have their own laptops and iPads, so it's never too soon to teach them that technology can be more than just entertainment.
