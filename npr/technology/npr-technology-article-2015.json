(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"THE FOX\")YLVIS: What does the Fox say? GARCIA-NAVARRO: Remember those? I'd like to forget \"What Did The Fox Say? \" in particular. So we're here to bring you the best of this past year's Internet with the help from Sean Rameswaram. He's a producer at Studio 360 and hosts the pop-culture podcast Sideshow. Thanks for being with us. SEAN RAMESWARAM: Wonderful to be here. Thank you. GARCIA-NAVARRO: You recently did an episode on Sideshow where you asked different people to come up with their favorite video, song, website from the last year. Let's tick through a few of these, starting with. . . RAMESWARAM: Sure. GARCIA-NAVARRO: . . . A music video by Sia. I love this, by the way. The song is called \"Chandelier. \"(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"CHANDELIER\")SIA: (Singing) I'm going to swing from the chandelier. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So tell us a little bit about this. What caught people's imagination about this video? RAMESWARAM: If this eight-year-old, nine-year-old looking girl in this blonde wig just dancing frenetically all over this sort of, like, shoddy-looking apartment. It's simple, and yet, the dance is incredible and so powerful, and it perfectly matches this song. And it's well on its way to half a billion views. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Incredible. RAMESWARAM: And rightfully so. The music video is alive and well and arguably doing better than it ever has before, thanks to YouTube. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"CHANDELIER\")SIA: (Singing) Over tonight, over tonight. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Also on this list, there is a site called See Hear Party. So I am bringing this up now. RAMESWARAM: Yes. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Tell me how this works. RAMESWARAM: Yeah, so I'll explain it, but it's something that you truly need to experience to fully understand. But basically, you go to the site. It asks you to enter tags of anything. So my favorite things that I would put in are pizza. . . GARCIA-NAVARRO: Here we go. RAMESWARAM: . . . You know, puppies and maybe \"The Simpsons,\" for example. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Pizza, puppies and \"The Simpsons\". . . RAMESWARAM: Yeah. GARCIA-NAVARRO: I'm typing that in right now. OK. RAMESWARAM: So you punch in those tags, and then you click next, and then you're asked to select a song. And, of course, for me, I would just punch in Drake and take any one of his many hits. And it asks you if you want to party. GARCIA-NAVARRO: And we want to party. RAMESWARAM: You definitely want to party. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GARCIA-NAVARRO: OK, so what I'm seeing now is, like, these unbelievably crazy gifs of just, like, \"The Simpsons\" and puppies under a tree in various extremely strange outfits. This really feels like a very hallucinogenic. . . RAMESWARAM: (Laughter). GARCIA-NAVARRO: A lot of fun. I like it. I like it. RAMESWARAM: It's like instead of, like, back in the day, if you went to a really great party where there was, like, this really interesting video collage being projected on some wall. Now you can just make it yourself in three seconds, thanks to this site. It's truly a gift. GARCIA-NAVARRO: There's also the 11-minute TV sitcom parody \"Too Many Cooks. \"(SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO, \"TOO MANY COOKS\")UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Singing) It takes a lot to make a stew. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Singing) A pinch of salt and laughter, too. RAMESWARAM: Yeah, right. This was probably the most viral video of the year - at least, one that was satirical and really, really smart. It's this 11-minute take on the opening credit sequences and the TV cheese from, like, basically the '80s onward. It debuted on Adult Swim in late October, but was randomly uploaded by the guy who made it to YouTube and then, like, went just bananas. And what sets it apart from the competition is its density. Like, most viral videos have a few notes and, you know, they're like two minutes long. And then you watch it once, and you get the point.  But \"Too Many Cooks\" dares to achieve more, and it really rewards repeat viewings. It's amazing. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Sean Rameswaram - he is the host of the pop-culture podcast Sideshow. Thank you so much. RAMESWARAM: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO, \"TOO MANY COOKS\")UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Singing) So much love. . .

You can't compost it, so it's got to go somewhere, often in violation of the law - that means a dump in the developing world, like the region of Agbogbloshie in the West African nation of Ghana. Not so long ago, Agbogbloshie was a lush mangrove swamp. In the current Atlantic, reporter Yepoka Yeebo describes what Agbogbloshie looks like today. YEPOKA YEEBO: It looks like hell. It's this massive blackened field. And the first thing you notice is this pool of thick black smoke that burns. It's this choking smoke. And I sort of coughed and splattered my way through my first few minutes like right in the middle of the dump. And it's dotted with these little hills of old electronics and scrap bites or piles of CPUs, heaps of car doors, stacks of old televisions, and hundreds of people work there. RATH: And you describe this awful type of smoke that you're walking through there. What's burning? YEEBO: It's mostly the boys, the sort of people who process the scrap, burning huge bundles of copper wire to strip the plastic off. And so they sort of - they get the bundle of copper wire or whatever else they're melting - sometimes they melt down old air-conditioners. They throw on a tire or the old insulation foam from old refrigerators, and they set that alight. So what's really burning is the tire and the fires get big and hot and sometimes they change color. When it's copper they turn green. And it lets off all this smoke. And this melts down whatever's in the bundle. And so you see pools of aluminum. You see pools of like bits of melted plastic. And then they're left with these bundles. It's an incredibly inefficient way to process anything. And it's incredibly dangerous, too. RATH: Tell us more about these trash pickers that you spent time with. You used the word boys. How old are these kids? YEEBO: The boys I hung out with were 13 and 14. Kwesi was the older, slightly more experienced kid who knew everything about the way the scrap business worked in Agbogbloshie. And Inusa was sort of younger and slightly more naive. And during the week, these kids were both, like, regular school kids in spotless uniforms out of school down the road. And they came down to this place on evenings and weekends to just earn little bits of money to help pay their school fees or buy shoes. RATH: Why are kids that young having to pay school fees? YEEBO: Education is supposed to be free, but beyond the basic level, beyond primary school, it's not. And they don't have to pay school fees, they have to pay for lunches. They have to pay for exams. They have to pay for books. All these little sums of money add up. And Kwesi wanted to join the army and Inusa wanted to join the air force. And in Ghana, the armed forces are incredibly prestigious, so there's a lot of competition to get in. And the only way they can get in is to finish school. And without paying their fees, that will never happen. RATH: There's a lot of toxic stuff in electronic waste. And you also mention that the fires from things like plastic and other things - that can't be good. Can you talk about the health risks these kids face? YEEBO: So there's the choking smoke. It's burning tires. It's thick and it's black and it's visible from, like, the main road, which is a good long walk away. There's also the fact that these are just open fires of bundles of metal. So at one point in the story, I talk about sort of this explosion and this burning aerosol can flying through the air and landing on the ground near us. That could quite easily have hit someone. I hung out at the sort of shed where both Kwesi and Inusa sell most of the scrap they pick up. And I watched as this tiny kid basically sliced his toe in half stepping on a piece of glass from what looked like a smashed TV screen. There are hazards all over the place. And there are also environmental campaigners who say that the boys who've been there for a while are starting to die really young. So people tend to have respiratory problems, and they also say that some of the older boys are dying of cancer. RATH: And how does this stuff, the electronic waste from the developed world, end up in this digital graveyard there? YEEBO: A great deal of it is foreign. A great deal of it is stuff that was supposed to be formally recycled that sort of falls into a shady world of recycling companies that export the stuff to the Third World. And there've been a couple of prosecutions in the UK. And so most of it, at least in the past, turned up in shipping containers at the port either disguised as secondhand electronics or hidden behind functional electronics or just sort of illegally shipped in. And it gets trucked into a place like this. And a lot of it is also from the market district where there are sort of auto repair shops and places that sell motors and air conditioners. And when the stuff doesn't sell or it gets too old, it gets dumped back there where people can process it into metal. RATH: Yepoka Yeebo is a reporter and photographer based in West Africa. Her feature about Ghana's urban mine ran in The Atlantic this week. Yepoka, thank you very much. YEEBO: Thank you so much for having me. RATH: And if you want to see some amazing photos Yepoka took in Agbogbloshie, check out our website, npr. org.

When the FBI first accused North Korea last month, many technology experts were skeptical. NPR's Dina Temple-Reston reports on the FBI's latest effort to prove its case. DINA TEMPLE-RASTON, BYLINE: The FBI director revealed newly declassified information that explained the link between North Korea and the Guardians of Peace, the group that claimed responsibility for the attack. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JAMES COMEY: The Guardians of Peace would send emails threatening Sony employees and would post online various statements explaining their work. In nearly every case they used proxy servers to disguise where they were coming from, but several times they got sloppy. TEMPLE-RASTON: Comey said that the hackers sometimes either forgot to disguise themselves or had a technical problem, so U. S. authorities could see them. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)COMEY: And we could see that IP addresses that were being used to post and to send the emails were coming from IPs that were exclusively used by the North Koreans. It was a mistake by them that we haven't told you about before that was a very clear indication of who was doing this. TEMPLE-RASTON: Comey said the hackers would disconnect very quickly once they realized their mistake, but they were visible long enough for the U. S. to identify them. MARK ROGERS: But there's certainly interesting information there that does support the fact that it could have been North Korea. TEMPLE-RASTON: That's Mark Rogers, the principle security researcher at CloudFlare, an Internet security company. ROGERS: But the problem is none of it conclusively says that it was North Korea and none if it conclusively rules out any other actors either. TEMPLE-RASTON: And he says the FBI needs to be even more transparent. ROGERS: Give us a little bit more to go on because right now it's just raising more questions than it is answering. TEMPLE-RASTON: The FBI director hinted that there would be more details to come. In particular, details on how the hackers got into the Sony servers in the first place.

And that's been clear at the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. When Federal Trade Commission Chairwoman Edith Ramirez addressed the conference this week, she called on companies that make Internet connected devices to build in protections for consumers from the outset. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)EDITH RAMIREZ: Companies should conduct privacy or security risk assessment as part of the design process. They should test security measures before products launch. They should use smart defaults, such as requiring consumers to change default passwords in the setup process. BLOCK: Privacy and security are also focal points on the CES floor for the first time this year. More than 80 vendors are showcasing related products. Lindsey Turrentine, editor-in-chief of CNET. com, has been talking with those vendors. She joins us from the Las Vegas Convention Center. Lindsey, welcome. LINDSEY TURRENTINE: Thank you. BLOCK: And you've been checking out the products on the floor since Tuesday. What are some of the things you've seen in what's called the Personal Privacy Marketplace there? TURRENTINE: Well, we've seen a lot of products that are dealing with payments, especially since Apple Pay came onto the market recently. We've seen some interesting products that make payments easier for people who might not own the newest smartphone. One I saw was called Hypr-3 from a young company that creates a small device that's essentially a little - it's like a key fob. You can stick it to the back of your phone or you can carry it near a phone and it works with your phone to act as a digital wallet. So it securely stores your credit card information. You use your fingerprint to use it to pay anywhere that accepts digital payments. BLOCK: And the question - if it's part of the Personal Privacy Marketplace, the assumption is that this will be more secure than other ways of payment? TURRENTINE: Yes, because it uses multiple factors for authentication and that's basically a fancy way of saying that it uses something you are - your fingerprint in this case - something you have, which is the device it's paired with, like your phone, and something you know, which is the password you use to get into your phone. And so it creates a unique identifier for each session when you use it so there's really no single password that gets stored. BLOCK: Let's listen to a bit of a keynote address that was given by the CEO of Intel, Brian Krzanich. He was trying to demonstrate using facial recognition as part of home security and here's what happened. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)BRIAN KRZANICH: So you can see she walks up, her phone is authenticated. She shows her face, the face is authenticated. The alarm is disabled. And the next step, the door is unlocked. The door is unlocked. (LAUGHTER)KRZANICH: The door is unlocked. Oh, there it goes. (APPLAUSE)BLOCK: So a few hiccups along the way, but I gather the door did eventually work. Does this point to some hurdles for tech companies like this? Not everything is going to work the way it's supposed and with the question of security, that's a really big deal. TURRENTINE: It is a really big deal, but I think we are getting a lot closer to using all kinds of information from your body to create a more secure environment. And so what Intel is working on is using its true sense cameras. These are new cameras that Intel is just introducing at CES to, they say, get rid of passwords altogether and use these biometric security points for you to login, so that you can actually use your face - just sitting in front of the camera on your computer or in front of your cellphone - to act as your password. BLOCK: Lindsey, anything else on the floor there in Las Vegas that's really caught your eye in this field of privacy and security? TURRENTINE: I think that I am really very bullish on the biometric security. I think that if we can get to a point where we can use our face or fingerprint or our retina - there's a retina scanner here - to login, that creates such a great alternative to remembering 15 different passwords that you, essentially, always forget and then have to create over and over and over again. BLOCK: I know that feeling. TURRENTINE: Oh, yes, it can become incredibly irritating. BLOCK: Lindsey Turrentine, thanks for talking with us. TURRENTINE: Thank you for having me. BLOCK: Lindsay Turrentine is editor-in-chief of CNET. com. She joined us from this year's International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:  Two of the hottest topics in the tech world over the past year have been cybersecurity and personal privacy. And that's been clear at the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. When Federal Trade Commission Chairwoman Edith Ramirez addressed the conference this week, she called on companies that make Internet connected devices to build in protections for consumers from the outset. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) EDITH RAMIREZ: Companies should conduct privacy or security risk assessment as part of the design process. They should test security measures before products launch. They should use smart defaults, such as requiring consumers to change default passwords in the setup process. BLOCK: Privacy and security are also focal points on the CES floor for the first time this year. More than 80 vendors are showcasing related products. Lindsey Turrentine, editor-in-chief of CNET. com, has been talking with those vendors. She joins us from the Las Vegas Convention Center. Lindsey, welcome. LINDSEY TURRENTINE: Thank you. BLOCK: And you've been checking out the products on the floor since Tuesday. What are some of the things you've seen in what's called the Personal Privacy Marketplace there? TURRENTINE: Well, we've seen a lot of products that are dealing with payments, especially since Apple Pay came onto the market recently. We've seen some interesting products that make payments easier for people who might not own the newest smartphone. One I saw was called Hypr-3 from a young company that creates a small device that's essentially a little - it's like a key fob. You can stick it to the back of your phone or you can carry it near a phone and it works with your phone to act as a digital wallet. So it securely stores your credit card information. You use your fingerprint to use it to pay anywhere that accepts digital payments. BLOCK: And the question - if it's part of the Personal Privacy Marketplace, the assumption is that this will be more secure than other ways of payment? TURRENTINE: Yes, because it uses multiple factors for authentication and that's basically a fancy way of saying that it uses something you are - your fingerprint in this case - something you have, which is the device it's paired with, like your phone, and something you know, which is the password you use to get into your phone. And so it creates a unique identifier for each session when you use it so there's really no single password that gets stored. BLOCK: Let's listen to a bit of a keynote address that was given by the CEO of Intel, Brian Krzanich. He was trying to demonstrate using facial recognition as part of home security and here's what happened. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) BRIAN KRZANICH: So you can see she walks up, her phone is authenticated. She shows her face, the face is authenticated. The alarm is disabled. And the next step, the door is unlocked. The door is unlocked. (LAUGHTER) KRZANICH: The door is unlocked. Oh, there it goes. (APPLAUSE) BLOCK: So a few hiccups along the way, but I gather the door did eventually work. Does this point to some hurdles for tech companies like this? Not everything is going to work the way it's supposed and with the question of security, that's a really big deal. TURRENTINE: It is a really big deal, but I think we are getting a lot closer to using all kinds of information from your body to create a more secure environment. And so what Intel is working on is using its true sense cameras. These are new cameras that Intel is just introducing at CES to, they say, get rid of passwords altogether and use these biometric security points for you to login, so that you can actually use your face - just sitting in front of the camera on your computer or in front of your cellphone - to act as your password.

Among them was Norse Corporation, who are now working with the U. S. government on the Sony investigation. On the Norse website, there's a virtual war room map. You can see multiple attacks launched every second, hitting their targets halfway around the globe. Kurt Stammberger is the senior vice president at Norse. He says Norse uses a global network of eight million sensors disguised to look like attractive targets. KURT STAMMBERGER: They pretend to be a point-of-sale machine - a credit card swiper, an ATM terminal. They pretend to be a piece of industrial equipment on a plant floor. And based on the intelligence that we get back from this network, we can tell who's attacking what types of devices. And we can also profile the types of actors that are unleashing these attacks. RATH: The attack on Sony - was that different just in terms of the scale of the attack, or were the attackers using a different approach - a different way in - than these daily attacks that we're talking about? STAMMBERGER: Well, we really can't comment in any depth about the Sony hack because all of the data that we've generated and the investigations that we've done have been turned over to the FBI. That being said, the attacks that we saw on Sony did not seem to be fundamentally unusual from a mechanical standpoint. They used pieces of malware that had been seen in the wild in the past. They used techniques that are well understood. Some of the interesting things about the Sony attack was how targeted it was. A lot of malware is a little bit like a Roomba. You know, it's a little robot that runs around the carpet and bumps into furniture and then turns right and then bumps into something else and turns left. And when it runs across a piece of dirt, it picks it up. This malware that was deployed against Sony was a lot less like a Roomba and a lot more like a cruise missile. It had credentials, server addresses, digital certificates - all these things that were built into the malware that allowed this malware to target that organization and extract information and be very destructive. RATH: Kurt, finally, I think I want you to talk me down a bit because looking at that map - all these attacks happening every second of every day - it is scary. Should I feel so frightened? STAMMBERGER: Frankly, yes. RATH: Oh no. (LAUGHTER)STAMMBERGER: It should disturb you. RATH: Now, we should say, in fairness, it serves your corporate interest to say it, right? (LAUGHTER)STAMMBERGER: Right. Exactly. 2014 was, by far, the worst year ever for cyber attacks. It grew by an amazing amount, both in terms of the dollars lost and the sheer destructiveness of the attacks. This is a war that the hackers are winning right now. So it behooves listeners and everyday citizens to take some basic steps to protect themselves - change their passwords, use different passwords at different sites. Keep basic security software on your machine up to date. Use a firewall. Ask a friend if this all intimidates you, and you're not quite sure how your machine is set up. And ask for help from professionals because this is real. It is growing very quickly. And it is impacting the flow of commerce on the Internet.

For most folks who own an iPhone, the App Store is the only place to buy software for their device. In other words, Apple has created a monopoly. It takes 30 percent of every dollar spent, and it can do this because Apple locks every iPhone when it sells them. But it's possible to break out of Apple's jail. Steve Henn from NPR's Planet Money team brings us the story of three groups of hackers in a high-stakes race to do just that. STEVE HENN, BYLINE: Every time Apple comes out with a new phone, hackers around the world go to work. The first one to find a way into the phone can sell that information - that hack - for a lot of money, especially if they can keep the deal secret. JONATHAN STEWART: I don't want to be known as somebody who talks, but I'm just saying, you know, you came to me and asked if there's a market for this stuff. Absolutely there is. HENN: This is Jonathan Stewart. Online he goes by the name Johnny Mnemonic. And I went to him because he was part of what became a legendary race to crack the iPhone back in 2013. To hear him tell the story, the actual caper was kind of dull. Johnny was sitting with a friend in an apartment in Redmond, Washington, on his couch pouring through computer code, and he found a bug. STEWART: Register struck CD3_SoftC *SoftC=Get soft C (ph). HENN: That bit of code opened a back door into the iPhone. In the past, when Johnny found a bug like this, he'd tell the company about it, help them fix it. But Johnny had gotten frustrated. STEWART: These are major companies employing the best developers in the world. And for years we got paid zilch - nothing - for finding these vulnerabilities and writing exploits for them. So you know what? It's kind of time to, like, get paid for your work. HENN: And there is a worldwide market for bugs. Criminals, foreign governments, spies - they're all willing to pay for this stuff. Often, it's legal to sell it, so Johnny was thinking about selling. But there was this other team of hackers doing the same thing, already planning how they could make a fortune from breaking into that same door. The tape I'm about to play is from a phone call made around this time. There are two voices on the tape. One is a hacker. The other is kind of a broker - a guy who puts these deals together. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GEORGE HOTZ: Let's make clear what the contract is. TY MANICA: You want 350,000. HENN: The hacker is George Hotz. He goes by geohot, and he's famous in this world. The broker is a guy named Ty Manica, and Ty recorded the call. He had heard about that door Johnny had, and he knew some people who really wanted to hack the iPhone - huge tech companies in China that were gearing up to launch their own app stores. But for these stores to get off the ground, millions of Chinese iPhone users would have to break their phone out of Apple's jail. So here was the plan - take that back door Johnny had, sell it to the Chinese businessmen, cut Johnny out of the deal and split the profit. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MANICA: Listen, bro. It'll be cool. We'll set it up. As a matter of fact, I'll shoot over to China, you shoot over there, let them meet you. . . HENN: It's amazing to listen to this tape because it opens this window into the market for hacks. If a hacker finds a flaw, it could be incredibly valuable. But if word gets out, if he talks too much, it could be worth nothing. Someone else could use it. And the end of this whole story illustrates this perfectly because, as Johnny Mnemonic is trying to figure out what to do and these two guys on the phone planning are planning their trip to China, word spreads. And a third team beats everyone to the punch. DAVID WANG: My name is David Wang. I go by planetbeing on the Internet, and I am a member of the evad3rs. HENN: The evad3rs - a team of four guys spread across three continents who were offered a million dollars for the same hack, and they delivered. WANG: You know, I was really shocked. I was flabbergasted. HENN: It was an incredible, life-changing amount of money. They bragged about it online, and that's when Johnny Mnemonic found out that flaw in the iPhone he'd found was worth a million dollars to someone else. STEWART: I put it together, and, like, I was just kind of, like - I felt used, you know? HENN: And that is the thing about markets like this - no rules, no intellectual property protections. Even David Wang and the evad3rs ended up losing out. They got into a disagreement with their Chinese business partner about piracy and never collected a dime. Steve Henn, NPR news.

Cedar Falls is a small city - just 39,000 people - but the president says its speedy Internet traffic puts the city on a par with some of the most connected capitals in the world. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: There's Hong Kong, Tokyo, Paris, Cedar Falls. (LAUGHTER)OBAMA: Right? (APPLAUSE)OBAMA: That's - that's the company you're keeping. BLOCK: The president outlined several initiatives designed to help other communities follow Cedar Falls's lead. And that's something he'll talk more about in next week's State of the Union address. NPR's Scott Horsley joins us now to talk about this. And, Scott, the vast majority of Americans already have access to the Internet, right? Why is this an issue for the president? SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Well, Melissa, this is no longer a question of whether you're on or off the information superhighway, but how fast your lane is moving and what kind of toll you have to pay. You're right. Most of us have basic broadband now, even my mom. She's one of 45 million Americans who signed up for broadband since President Obama came into office. BLOCK: Go mom (laughter). HORSLEY: But there are still big differences in connection speeds. And even for people who have very fast connections, 3 out of 4 have only one provider to choose from, so there's not very much competition. And, oftentimes, that means the prices are quite high. BLOCK: And according to the president, what is Cedar Falls, Iowa, doing right? HORSLEY: Well, Cedar Falls is Iowa's first gigabit city, meaning customers there can get download speeds of up to a gigabit per second. That's nearly a hundred times faster than the national average. And Obama says that's about much more than just faster streaming on Netflix. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)OBAMA: It's about giving the entrepreneur, the small-business person on Main Street, a chance to compete with the folks out in Silicon Valley or across the globe. HORSLEY: And what's interesting is Cedar Falls built this high-speed network itself through a city-owned utility. Now, Obama sees that kind of public option as one possible remedy for the lack of competition. Of course, the idea of a public option is controversial in this industry, just as it was during the health care debate. Some commercial broadband companies don't want to compete against the government. And in fact, 19 states have laws on the books limiting the ability of local governments to get into the broadband business. BLOCK: So, given those obstacles, how does President Obama propose getting around them? HORSLEY: He's asking the FCC to override those state laws using its powers of preemption. Now, Obama can't force the commission to do that. It's an independent agency. But his hand-picked chairman, Tom Wheeler, has suggested he would be in favor of getting rid of state laws that limit broadband competition. Wheeler is getting some pushback on that, though, from some Republican senators, and some free-market economists have questioned whether high-speed Internet is really something that gives much of a return for taxpayers. Iowa's Republican governor thinks it does, though. Terry Branstad has been pushing a program to connect every acre in his state. So this is another case where President Obama is taking an idea that a Republican governor has promoted, trying to replicate it nationwide and, in some cases, meeting stiff opposition from Republicans here in Washington. BLOCK: And, again, this is something the president will be taking up in his State of the Union address next week. HORSLEY: That's right. BLOCK: NPR's Scott Horsley, thanks so much.

And after being virtually absent from auto shows for the last few years, concept cars are back with a vengeance. NPR's Sonari Glinton has this report from the big auto show in Detroit. SONARI GLINTON, BYLINE: Car executives, techno music and crazy, new concept cars - it must be January in Detroit. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Ladies and gentlemen, introducing the Chevrolet Bolt EV concept. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Its codename is HCD-15, but we call it Hyundai Santa Cruz. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: If you can use innovation to build the ultimate Ford performance vehicle, what would it be? Well, here's an idea. GLINTON: Ah, Detroit, the birthplace of techno music. Anyway, concept cars tell us much more about the current state of the auto industry than the future. All these cars at the show are pretty normal. Bill Visnic from edmunds. com says it wasn't that long ago that concept cars were just plain wack. BILL VISNIC: But some of the really wildest of the wild that I remember back then was Chrysler was very big on plastic cars. They were going to make all-plastic cars. GLINTON: I got just one word for you - plastics. Visnic says car companies can be really insular. They can convince themselves that the future is in, say, plastics. But concept cars allow automakers to do test runs before they sink an average of $1 billion into a new car. VISNIC: And that way, if it falls flat on its face, you can just sort of open the closet and put it in there and never show it again, and there's really no harm, no foul other than the money that you've spent up to that point to develop it. It's really expensive now to bring a vehicle to production - any kind of vehicle - and then have it fall flat on its face in the market,GLINTON: Now, car companies have abandoned the really crazy ideas for designs that are much closer to reality. The new concept cars are ones you're more likely to see on the road. ANGIE NUCCI: So what we're looking at right now, this is Honda's FCV concepts. And it showcases the styling evolution of Honda. . . GLINTON: Angie Nucci is with Honda. She says the companies don't just learn about whether consumers will accept the whole car but also about the parts that go into them. NUCCI: I think for a lot of manufacturers, and for Honda too, it's an exercise in figuring out how is everything going to fit together? And also we can gauge some early consumer reactions to the vehicle. GLINTON: From Honda now to Buick. I'm standing in front of a Buick concept, the Avenir, that car geeks here are raving about. It's supposed to show the public what direction Buick is going in. It's a long, low car with a swoop back, and it kind of screams luxury. Michelle Krebs, an analyst with autotrader. com, says there is a dollars and cents reason for the reemergence of these prototypes and passion project. MICHELLE KREBS: More concept cars and more performance cars and more sexy cars are representative of the booming economy. GLINTON: Building and moving concept cars from show to show isn't cheap, so when the economy is bad, they're the first thing that gets cut. But Krebs says they can be really vital. KREBS: There's ego in it. But the other thing it does is it allows people to be creative. They don't have the constraints of a production car. Designers need to be thinking way out there, and some of it's not ever going to see the light of day. But you want to keep creative forces going.

You'll find a lot of criminal activity - films like \"Heat,\" \"The Insider\" and \"Public Enemies,\" TV shows like \"Crime Story\" and of course, \"Miami Vice. \" With his new movie, \"Blackhat,\" he's taking on cybercrime. MICHAEL MANN: This is basically a detective story. It's a detective story, but it's happening in the brave new world that we live in. RATH: Chris Hemsworth with plays Nicholas Hathaway, a brilliant criminal hacker in a maximum-security prison. When a cyberattack triggers a nuclear accident in China, Hathaway gets furloughed so he can help solve the crime. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"BLACKHAT\")UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As character) Is he political? CHRIS HEMSWORTH: (As Nicholas Hathaway) Terrorist attack, maybe declaration. VIOLA DAVIS: (As Carol Barrett) The guy we're working will drop the big hammer and not think twice about it. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: (As character) He's on the move again.

RATH: Hathaway teams up with a Chinese army officer, played by Asian-American pop star Leehom Wang. There's plenty of space for gun battles and explosions, but the heroes are fighting an invisible villain. MANN: Hathaway has to find and stop an adversary who resides, for the most part, in a virtual world. RATH: We have to talk about the weird timing on this because I imagine that by November, you've pretty much wrapped up everything on this film. Then the Sony cyberattack happens. What goes through your mind when you're watching the news about that? MANN: We started researching this two and a half years ago. And the extent of intrusions and the awareness of vulnerabilities to hacking because of the interconnectedness of absolutely everything - we've been tracking it all along, so this was kind of one in a sequence. And since this is our subject, we were kind of familiar with it. What did hit home was that some of these people are my friends that got attacked, so that became very personal. RATH: So what was it that initially got you excited about this topic? MANN: Stuxnet happened, and I was very interested in that because it was more than a hack. It's not kind of impersonal, un-dramatic, just ones and zeros doing things. RATH: Stuxnet was the worm virus that was sent to attack the Iranian nuclear infrastructure. MANN: Exactly. And when I read about how the malware was built, it was a scenario but a very dramatic scenario, kind of a multi-act play. You know, who's conceiving this? Who's writing it? What kind of people are they? And then in the private sector, who are black-hat hackers? What is the - what's the high? What's, you know, the elevated experience? And we wanted to do a large-scale kind of crime story, something epic in size, and this was it. RATH: You know, a lot of Asian-Americans have complained about wanting to have more Asian male leads that. . . MANN: Right. RATH: . . . Aren't stereotypes. And the officer - the Chinese officer in this film, played by Leehom Wang, definitely seems to deliver on that. Can you tell us about him? I understand he's a pop star in China? MANN: Oh, he's not just a pop star in China, he is the biggest pop star in Asia. He's Justin Timberlake of Asia. I had trouble shooting in some locations in Hong Kong because if I'd pan the camera to the right a little bit, there'd be some block-long, two-story-high, you know, billboard of Leehom Wang selling Seiko watches. We'd have 1,500 screaming teenagers at 3 o'clock in the morning waiting to see Leehom Wang. And Chris Hemsworth laughs about it, and told this anecdote - they're basically pushing Chris Hemsworth out of the way to get to Leehom Wang. RATH: (Laughter). MANN: He grew up in Rochester, New York, until he was 17. He's tremendously, tremendously bright. I love him. He's just a great guy. RATH: Looking over your body of work, I mean, going back to \"Crime Story\" and \"Miami Vice,\" you know, \"The Insider,\" it seems safe to say you have a fascination with illegal activity. MANN: Yeah, well, I like dramatic conflict. I like things in high relief. I like people who are faced with important questions that - you know, they have to make critical decisions. RATH: Is there something about that that just opens up human experience for you somehow? What is it about it? MANN: Well, it's kind of an opportune dramatic structure. Most of us live our lives within the confines of the judicial system we were born into, the political economy we were born into. A criminal, by self-definition, is outside social mores and values, so that puts him into conflict - conflicts that he has a struggle to manage to maintain his existence. And if I can bring an audience into some empathetic relationship where we're invested in them, then we see them in an internalized kind of a way. RATH: I wanted, finally, to take you very far back because I came across a line in a piece about you, where it said that you, as a young man, you moved to London after discovering Stanley Kubrick, the great director of \"2001,\" \"Dr. Strangelove,\" \"A Clockwork Orange,\" you know, many great, great films. I was just curious about that. What was it about Kubrick that caught your imagination? MANN: You know, I saw \"Dr. Strangelove\" in 1963, when I was in Madison, Wisconsin, where I was an undergraduate. And it was a revelation. What struck me is that it was possible to make a film, as a real auteur, for a mass audience. RATH: For people who haven't seen it, I should say that you are so inspired by a dark, dark, dark comedy about nuclear holocaust. MANN: Right, it's something that I quite still haven't figured out, which is why that film passed the test of time. I don't know matter how many times I've seen \"Strangelove,\" but it's as fresh and exciting today as it was, you know, in 1963. RATH: Could you see yourself making something in that vein? MANN: I. . . RATH: What would be the black comedy that Michael Mann would make? MANN: Oh boy, OK. (LAUGHTER)MANN: I don't know. I would really have to - that's a very good question. RATH: Michael Mann's latest film is \"Blackhat. \" It's out right now. Michael Mann, thanks very much. It was a pleasure speaking with you. MANN: Pleasure being here. ARUN RATH, HOST:  Look over the output of writer, producer, director Michael Mann.

But wearable tech is not dead. In fact, there's an amazing new vest that has GPS, can call 911 and talk back like Siri. Only it's not for people. It's for service dogs. It's the brainchild of a group called the FIDO Project, headed up by Dr. Melody Jackson. She's director of the Center for BioInterface Research at Georgia Tech. Jackson and her colleagues want to dramatically expand what service dogs can currently do. MELODY JACKSON: I have a colleague who is blind and has a guide dog. And he was on the Georgia Tech campus one day when his dog stopped, as they're trained to do if there's something in their path. Well, he knew that there was nothing that should be in their path, so he pulled out his collapsible cane and he felt around to see if there - something was on the sidewalk. He didn't feel anything. And so he said, come on, buddy, let's go. And the dog refused. So he thought, well, maybe he's just being a dog. He gave him a little correction, saying let's go. And the dog said all right, and they both stepped into wet cement. So if the dog could have said we need to go around something that you can't feel with your cane, it could've saved them a very dangerous and certainly inconvenient situation. RATH: So tell me about the FIDO vest that you've designed. Describe it first. JACKSON: Well, the FIDO vest - FIDO stands for Facilitating Interactions for Dogs with Occupations - and essentially we're putting technology to wearable clothing for dogs. So we have sensors that dogs can activate with natural dog abilities such as holding in the mouth, biting, tugging or just touching with their nose. RATH: And you have the vest with you in the studio, right? JACKSON: Absolutely, I do. And I have a little scenario if you don't mind. RATH: Please. JACKSON: Medical alert dogs perform vital functions. For example, an epilepsy alert dog will detect, before the person even knows it, that they're about to have a seizure. And what they're trained to do is to push the person up against a wall so that they don't just fall down, that they might slide down the wall. And then once the person is having the seizure and they might be unconscious, the dog licks their face to arouse them. But what if the dog could activate a tug sensor to dial 911 and summon help that might sound like this. . . ? COMPUTER-GENERATED SPEECH: Excuse me, my owner needs your attention. RATH: Well, could you talk about some of the other applications of this because situations like search and rescue - there are dogs at work with the police and the military. I've got to assume there are a lot of other applications beyond the medical service dogs. JACKSON: Absolutely, and we keep finding more just about on a daily basis. A scenario that happened about three months ago in Georgia - we had a young man, a teenager, that was lost in the North Georgia mountains who was on the autism spectrum. And every time the dogs would find him, he would run away. So what happens with the search and rescue dog typically is they'll find the target. Then they have to re-find their handler, and then they have to re-find the target again. Well, every time the dogs got close, the young man would run away because he was afraid. But what if the dog could stay with the person that they found, activate a sensor on their vest that would geolocate and send a message to the search and rescue handler that says, hey, I found the person, and I'm going to stay with them? Bomb-sniffing dogs have the ability to tell what explosive they have found, so is it C4, which is relatively stable and not going to explode if you bump it, or is it a very volatile substance such as TATP, which, pretty much, you can breathe on it and it'll explode? The bomb squad probably would like to know that. The dog does know it. And so we're working right now with the Georgia Tech police to implement some systems that will allow the dogs to tell us exactly what explosive they've found.

Could these machines, created by man to think faster than man, one day outthink our species and decide that they can do without us? After all, humans can be so slow and sentimental. This is not just a storyline for science-fictions writer. Last week, a host of experts in the field signed the letter urging research to make sure that artificial intelligence has a positive, not destructive, impact on humanity. Elon Musk, the billionaire tech investor, pledged $10 million to the organization behind that letter - the Future of Life Institute. Philosopher Nick Bostrom is among those who signed that letter, and he joins us from the studios of the BBC in Oxford. Thanks so much for being with us. NICK BOSTROM: Thanks for inviting me. SIMON: How could machines that we've invented, that we program, that we can turn on and off, potentially undo us? BOSTROM: Well, right now, you'll be happy to hear I don't think there is any danger. I think the concern is that as we continue to make progress then eventually there might come a point when they are as smart as we are or even smarter. And intelligence in general is a very powerful thing. It's what makes us very powerful relative to other animals here on this planet. It's not because we are stronger muscles or sharper claws that the fate of the gorillas is now in our hands rather than in the gorilla's hands. And so similarly, if we create machines that exceed human intelligence then those machines also could be very powerful relative to us. SIMON: Well, I was flabbergasted when I began to do some reading. Although you say it's not about to happen; it's a while away; it is possible that children listening to this broadcast in the back seat of their parents' automobile might have to confront this? BOSTROM: Yeah, so that's why I think it's very positive that Elon Musk and some other people are not saying it's time to actually start work out the technology that we would need to keep machines safe, even if they eventually reach human level intelligence. SIMON: I mean, what's to solve? What do you do? BOSTROM: Well, one form of this problem is if you have a superintelligent agent, how could you construct it in such a way that it would be safe and beneficial? Ideally, we would like to align its goals with human values. Right now, what we could do with a machine - we might be able to give it a goal, such as calculate as many digits in the decimal expansion of pi as possible, or some very simple goal like that. We could program that. What we couldn't do today is to give a computer the goal of maximize beauty or justice or pleasure or love or compassion or any humanly meaningful value. So one research challenge is how could we find ways to transfer human values into machines, such as to create a goal system that would want the same kind of things that we want? SIMON: Mr. Bostrom, if a computer gets too cheeky, can't we just pull the plug out or, you know, smash his hard drive into smithereens? BOSTROM: Well, today, certainly that's a possibility. Although, when we become very dependent on a system, like the Internet, it's not so clear any longer, like where is the off switch to the Internet? But when you have something that eventually becomes as smart as a human being, then it will be capable of strategizing and anticipating our actions and taking countermeasures. So our great advantage is, I think, that we get to make the first move. We get to create the AI. But it's important, particularly with superintelligence, that we would get it right on the first try. SIMON: All my life I've heard about how subtle and intricate and powerful the human brain is - so much so that we haven't begun to understand it. I'd like to think that's still true. Can't we learn as fast as the machines? BOSTROM: Well, the human brain is as complicated as it's ever been, and nobody knows today how to actually create machines with the same type of general learning ability that humans have. But there is no reason to think that biological information, processing systems like the human brain are anywhere near the limits of what is possible. The laws of physics, it looked like they would enable much more powerful forms of information processing. Much in the way that, say, a steam shovel or a tractor outperforms human muscles, I think intelligence would also be surpassed. SIMON: Mr. Bostrom, as I understand it, you have spent a lot of your working life dealing with nuclear war and asteroid strikes and now the prospect of superintelligent machines. How you doing? (LAUGHTER)BOSTROM: Well, I actually also spend some time thinking about the upside of things, like, if things go well, if humanity makes it through this century intact, I think the future for Earth originating intelligent life could be very long and very large and very bright, indeed. We might reach technological maturity in this century, and with that would come the possibility to colonize the universe and to cure cancer and to accomplish many other things that we can only vaguely dream about today. It's worth being really careful and making sure that we don't screw up along the path. SIMON: Nick Bostrom is the founder and director of the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University and the author of \"Superintelligence. \" Thanks for speaking with us, Mr. Bostrom, and I don't mind saying good luck.

Many of the items in the British Library's vast collection of recorded sound are in danger of disappearing. Some just physically won't last much longer. Others are on long-dead formats. Here's one they have saved. It's one of the very few recordings of Florence Nightingale. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE: I hope my voice may perpetuate the great work of my life. RATH: OK. It's hard to understand but pretty good for 1890. That's taken from an Edison wax cylinder. The British Library is currently asking for donations to help raise the $60 million it'll take to digitally preserve their collection. Will Prentice is one of the people tasked with saving these recordings. WILL PRENTICE: We only have a finite window of opportunity in which to preserve them. That's actually about 15 years, which seems like a long time, but we have over six million sound recordings in the British Library. We know that to work at our current rate, it'll take us 48 years to digitize everything. RATH: And there's a ton of what people have called dead media - you know, abandoned formats like, more recently, the eight-track or the laser disk. Can you talk about the range of dead media you're dealing with? PRENTICE: Yeah, we have over 40 different audio formats alone. So everything from tin foils and wax cylinders in the early days and postwar dictation formats like the Dictabelts and those kinds of strange, obscure things. RATH: I want to hear an example of the kind of thing that is in the archives. This is the voice of Alfred, Lord Tennyson. This is a recording of him reading \"The Charge Of The Light Brigade. \" It's pretty scratchy, so I'll remind listeners - the beginning of the poem is half a league, half a league, half a league onward. All in the valley of death rode the 600. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ALFRED TENNYSON: Half a league, half a league, half a league onward. All in the valley of death rode the 600. RATH: Amazing to hear his voice - although honestly, I felt a little bit let down by his reading. (LAUGHTER)PRENTICE: Well, it's a fascinating story. Your listeners may know about the Crimean war in the 1850s - the battles of Balaclava and so on, which \"The Charge Of The Light Brigade\" poem was written about. In about 1890 in London, there was a scandal that the veteran soldiers of that battle had been left destitute and were, in many cases, living homeless on the street. This is before anyone knew of posttraumatic stress disorder, I guess. A campaign was launched to raise money for these guys. And Colonel Gouraud, who was Edison's ambassador, if you like, in the UK, spotted this is as an opportunity to publicize the phonogram. So what he did was he went to find eminent celebrities of the day who could somehow support this campaign. And he chose Florence Nightingale - the Lady with the Lamp - and he chose Lord Tennyson, who'd written this poem. He visited Tennyson's home on the Isle of Wight, and persuaded him to record this poem. RATH: There's so much fantastic stuff. We heard Florence Nightingale, Tennyson. You can hear James Joyce reading from Ulysses. But my favorite is actually - this is the great George Bernard Shaw speaking directly to us to make sure we get the speed of the turntable right. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GEORGE BERNARD SHAW: If what you hear is very disappointing, and you feel, instinctively, that must be a horrid man, you may be quite sure the speed is wrong. Slow it down until you feel that you are listening to an amiable old gentleman of '71 with a rather pleasant Irish voice, saying, that is me. (LAUGHTER)PRENTICE: That's lovely. RATH: Isn't that great? What's it like to discover something like that? PRENTICE: It can be really exciting. It's very much like pulling up treasure from the ocean bed or something. You can often stick on a disk with nothing written on the label or very little information and digitize it and find that there's something absolutely incredible on the other end of it. RATH: So what've been your favorites? What would've been your most thrilling moments going through these recordings? PRENTICE: Well it's - I've been here 15 years, and I've been finding new things at every turn, really. So in the last few weeks alone, I can tell you we've found some plays of Noel Coward. We found a recording of the opening night of one of his plays - Peace in our Time - where he, at the audience's behest, goes up onto stage and gives a little speech to the actors. And that's a lovely little flavor of what a night at the theater was like in London after the Second World War. RATH: Wow. So let's go out with that Noel Coward recording. But before we do, Will Prentice, audio conversation specialist for the British Library, thanks so much. This was great. PRENTICE: My pleasure. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)NOEL COWARD: It is a convention of the theater that the author always thanks the cast. But my feelings at the moment about this cast are far from conventional. I would like to say that, in my opinion, that this company have given a performance in the highest tradition of English acting.

She runs a consulting business called Aging in Place Technology Watch. And Orlov says that by 2020 it will amount to some $20 billion a year. And she joins us now. Welcome to the program. LAURIE ORLOV: Thanks a lot. SIEGEL: And first of all, what are you measuring here - twenty billion dollars a year spent on what? ORLOV: Well, I've divided the market into four categories of technology - communication and engagement technologies, home safety and security technologies, health and wellness, and learning and contribution technologies. And I overlay that with the category of technologies for family and professional caregivers. And when you assemble all of that together, that is how I projected it to be a $20 billion market by 2020. SIEGEL: But you're talking about higher tech than at-home elevators or motorized wheelchairs or bathtubs that you can sit down in and the like. ORLOV: Oh, yes. I'm talking about internet-enabled technologies, camera-based technologies, wearables, personal emergency response technologies which have historically included the pendant you wear around your neck - you know, what's euphemistically called I've-fallen-and-I-can't-get-up buttons. But they have become fairly sophisticated in recent years and allowed for quite a bit more functionality than just that. SIEGEL: You were at the Consumer Electronics Show this month keeping an eye out for technologies for older folks. Newest offerings - what did you see? ORLOV: Well, I saw some interesting things. I saw yet another tablet for older adults called the grandPad. The grandPad has been intentionally locked down to restrict the number of capabilities it offers to a very limited and secure set. SIEGEL: You know, I read your description of some of the most interesting technologies you saw at the Consumer Electronics Show, and a couple of them involve robots. How is that? ORLOV: Well, there are robots emerging in this market space and I think - not yet, but at some point they're going to get to an appropriate consumer price point that we will be able to buy them. One of them is being piloted in hotels to bring - instead of having a person show up at your door with whatever it is you need, this robot shows up. I don't really see why that couldn't also work, for example, in an assisted living or independent living community. SIEGEL: But do you think it's possible that by the time the youngest of the baby boomers are deep in their 80s that you could have at-home robots to help you age in place? ORLOV: Oh, I totally think it's possible, and I think they could be voice activated, and I think they could remember our preferences. And so I believe there will be the same level of disruption or disconnection between the boomers who are - you know, become 85 at some point. There will be a disruption in terms of the technology that's introduced and comfort level. SIEGEL: There's something to look forward to right there. ORLOV: Oh, there you go. (Laughter).

I'm Scott Simon. Earlier this month, Pluto passed directly behind Jupiter, which counteracted the Earth's gravity. And for a brief moment, everybody on Planet Earth was weightless. Well, actually, that didn't happen. But maybe you read on Facebook that it was going to. This week, Facebook made sharing news stories like that a little more difficult. The company is making changes that will allow users to report fake news. NPR's digital culture correspondent Laura Sydell joins us in our studios. Laura, thanks very much for being with us. LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE: You're welcome. SIMON: What's Facebook done? What will we see? SYDELL: OK, so when you're on Facebook and say your Auntie posts something about a 28-foot alligator, and you actually believe it for a moment, and then you start to dig and realize, OK, it's not possible for there to be a 28-foot alligator, there's a little drop-down menu up on the corner of the post. You bring down the drop-down menu and it allows you to report something as being spam or to report something that is a photo of yourself you don't like, and now they're adding fake news. So you can now report something as being fake news. If enough people do that, what will happen is that Facebook will start to not show that post anymore. You still want to see what your Auntie posts, so if your Auntie is somebody who is close to you, you'll see her post, but you'll also see something that says this has been labeled fake news. So that's how it works. SIMON: And Facebook is doing this because? SYDELL: Because they've gotten complaints from their users. So Facebook says they don't want people to go away. They want them to stay and feel happy with their newsfeed. And if this is upsetting people, that's why they've added this. SIMON: Well, let me understand this. Facebook is not making any effort to investigate the veracity of the stories. They're just throwing it open for a vote. SYDELL: That's right. So if enough people keep saying this is a fake news story, this is a fake news story, the algorithms - so this is totally done by computer - will then just start to not post it on people's feeds. SIMON: But people can also be wrong, can't they? SYDELL: Yes, they can. SIMON: People have pointed out a lot of major news stories in 2014 began as a report on the web. SYDELL: That's true. People can be very wrong. For example, Twitter had an issue on this where, all of a sudden, a story by The New York Times that had to do with Florida State University's football team started to disappear off Twitter. Now, it's not exactly clear what happened. But it may have been that there were huge fans of Florida State University who started to label this negative story about how police were going easy on investigating FSU football players, and they may have just tried to keep saying, oh, this is, you know, there's something wrong with this, and it began to disappear from Twitter. The Times actually called Twitter and said, what's going on? And Twitter fixed it. But you could see how a whole group of people could decide and have a little conspiracy. SIMON: Get organized and spike a story that might be true. SYDELL: Yeah, that's right. And that's one problem with only having computer algorithms. But that's how companies like Facebook function. They don't have human beings checking this out. SIMON: But people in journalism will tell you it's journalism to determine the truth of a story. You don't do it with algorithms. SYDELL: Well, you and I may think that's the case (Laughter). SIMON: How quaint. SYDELL: But out in the, you know, Silicon Valley, they think that computers can do a better job. You know, I mean, you know, eventually, Scott, you and I will be replaced by robots. SIMON: It's funny you should mention that because you didn't recognize that I am a robot, did you? (LAUGHTER)SIMON: You're thinking, why would they spend all that money to make a robot that looks like that? Can't they do better? Yeah, this is just - I'm just a prototype. NPR's Laura Sydell. Thanks very much. SYDELL: You're welcome. SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. I'm Scott Simon. Earlier this month, Pluto passed directly behind Jupiter, which counteracted the Earth's gravity. And for a brief moment, everybody on Planet Earth was weightless. Well, actually, that didn't happen. But maybe you read on Facebook that it was going to. This week, Facebook made sharing news stories like that a little more difficult. The company is making changes that will allow users to report fake news. NPR's digital culture correspondent Laura Sydell joins us in our studios. Laura, thanks very much for being with us. LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE: You're welcome. SIMON: What's Facebook done? What will we see? SYDELL: OK, so when you're on Facebook and say your Auntie posts something about a 28-foot alligator, and you actually believe it for a moment, and then you start to dig and realize, OK, it's not possible for there to be a 28-foot alligator, there's a little drop-down menu up on the corner of the post. You bring down the drop-down menu and it allows you to report something as being spam or to report something that is a photo of yourself you don't like, and now they're adding fake news. So you can now report something as being fake news. If enough people do that, what will happen is that Facebook will start to not show that post anymore. You still want to see what your Auntie posts, so if your Auntie is somebody who is close to you, you'll see her post, but you'll also see something that says this has been labeled fake news. So that's how it works. SIMON: And Facebook is doing this because? SYDELL: Because they've gotten complaints from their users. So Facebook says they don't want people to go away.

I'm Rachel Martin. And this is For The Record. It wasn't the first time President Obama has talked about this issue, but mentioning cyber security in the recent State of the Union address underlines this problem in America in a new way. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: So we're making sure our government integrates intelligence to combat cyber threats just as we have done to combat terrorism. And tonight I urge this Congress to finally pass the legislation we need to better meet the evolving threat of cyber attacks, combat identity theft and protect our children's information. MARTIN: Cyber threats have evolved over time from basic identity theft to a computer virus that holds your digital life for ransom. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Seven is on your side tonight with a warning about a fast-moving computer virus that isn't just locking up your computer, but it could also scam you out of your hard-earned money. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Now experts call it ransomware. MARTIN: For The Record today - the fight for cyber security. We're going to introduce you to three people who had very different experiences but carry some of the same scars - first up, Jim Higgs. JIM HIGGS: I'm the owner and general manager of WAKV in Plainwell, Michigan. MARTIN: It's an AM radio station in Southwest Michigan that he and his wife run out of the basement of their house. HIGGS: We're known as the memory station. It's everything from Frank Sinatra to Bob Seger. How's that for a variety? MARTIN: Jim remembers the day of the crime very clearly. HIGGS: It was a Friday afternoon. I had pretty much finished my work for the day and had gone upstairs and fixed myself a cocktail, sat down on my lazy boy and put my feet up. MARTIN: About an hour later, he went back downstairs. He noticed something, and it wasn't good. HIGGS: There was silence which is about the worst thing you can hear on a radio station. And that's when I noticed on the screen of my office computer were these two icons - large ones - which said we have locked your files, and you have to pay us $500 to get them back. All of the music files were gone, all of the station jingles, all of the commercials - all of that was locked and encrypted. KATIE: My name is Katie. MARTIN: That's a nickname. Katie doesn't want her full name broadcast. KATIE: I live in Madison, Wisconsin. And I'm 45 years old. And in 2013 my identity was stolen. MARTIN: Katie came home one Saturday after running some errands and checked her voicemail. Kohl's department store had called. KATIE: The Kohl's fraud department had left a message at home saying please call us regarding some recent activity on your newly opened account. And I froze because I didn't have a newly opened account. MARTIN: But someone posing as Katie did. They had a fake ID with all her information on it, including her Social Security number. KATIE: They got $18,000 in total in a matter of - it was two days. They were at an outlet mall. And you could tell on a map. Literally you could watch. They went from store to store - Macy's, Kohl's, Best Buy, Bass Pro Shop, Sears, OfficeMax. MARTIN: Our third voice today comes from Jonathan Agin from Virginia. JONATHAN AGIN: I'm an attorney childhood cancer advocate lobbyist. MARTIN: Jonathan and his family were the victims of an especially hurtful kind of identity theft. In 2011 Jonathan's 4-year-old daughter Alexis passed away. She had suffered from an inoperable brain tumor. AGIN: Prognosis is generally the child passes away between 9 to 12 months after diagnosis. Alexis was diagnosed at 27 months and she actually survived and battled valiantly for 33 months. MARTIN: He and his wife were still in the middle of grieving the death of their child when they got a call from their accountant. He was doing their taxes, and he had disturbing news. AGIN: He said that somebody had used to set Alexis's Social Security number to file a return. So we couldn't file electronically. We were going to have to file by paper. We were going to be late, and ultimately we were going to have to prove that Alexis was in fact our child. MARTIN: That same day, Jonathan went online looking for answers. AGIN: I put her name in Google, and I put Social Security number. And immediately a genealogical website popped up. And on that website was her date of birth, her date of death, her full address and her full Social Security number. It was right there for anybody and everybody to see. MARTIN: Those are the types of crimes that can get wrapped into discussions about cyber security. And they are each very different - a ransom hack, credit card fraud and the theft of a Social Security number. But the emotional reaction to this kind of crime can be similar. When Jim Higgs realized his computer was being held ransom by hackers, he didn't overreact. HIGGS: I went upstairs and poured another drink and decided I'd deal with it in the morning. MARTIN: You sound like you are taking all of this in stride. HIGGS: What can you do? I mean, really, Rachel, what can you do about it? You get hit. There's nothing the police can do. MARTIN: Did you feel angry? HIGGS: Absolutely I felt angry. I felt invaded. KATIE: Having someone pose as you is just - I can't explain. It's very violating. MARTIN: For Katie, the credit card fraud was also insulting. KATIE: I wanted to throw up to be honest with you because you work so hard to - that's just not who I am. I pay my bills on time. I save money. And someone out there was pretending to be me and just frivolously going through and spending money willy-nilly. MARTIN: Jonathan Agin says he and his wife each reacted differently. AGIN: My wife was more emotional, and I was angry at the fact that somebody would obviously prey upon my daughter who passed away from cancer and utilize her for their own financial gain. MARTIN: When the shock wears off, then there's the sometimes long and complicated process of assessing the damage and, if possible, righting the wrong. Jim Higgs was lucky. He had backed up his entire audio collection on another computer. But there were losses he never recovered. HIGGS: Among the audio files that I lost was one of my grandkids singing a Christmas song or my granddaughter recording a commercial as a class project in high school. You know, those are gone. MARTIN: And the hackers who attacked him were never caught. Katie isn't sure how her personal information was stolen. It could've been a clerk at a store or it could've been a cybercrime. Regardless, the whole thing has made her anxious, so afraid, she didn't want to use her full name. And Jonathan Agin, he has spent the last few years working hard with state and federal lawmakers to make Social Security numbers harder to access online. But he too reconsidered how much personal information he puts out into the world. He and his wife continue their work as advocates for families caring for children with cancer. It is a close-knit community, and a lot of the counseling he does is online. AGIN: I can't imagine not being available and not trying to help people. And so you put yourself out there because the benefits outweigh the risks. MARTIN: The Obama administration is pushing legislation that would tighten up punishments for cybercrime and improve information sharing between the private and public sectors to prevent cyber attacks. But there's only so much the government can do when it comes to protecting American citizens on this front. ADAM LEVIN: You have to assume that breaches and hacking and the identity theft that flows from it - this is the new certainty in life. MARTIN: This is Adam Levin. He's the chairman and cofounder of an online security company called IDT911. His first practical bit of advice. . . [POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: Adam Levin is referred to as chairman and co-founder of IDT911. In fact, he is the chairman and founder of the company. ]LEVIN: Never use your email address as your user id because if somebody gets your email address, all of a sudden they have one half of your login process for many sites. MARTIN: Next, he says, sign up with your bank or credit card company for something called transactional monitoring. LEVIN: That's where they notify you anytime there's activity in your accounts. No one is in a better position to know what you're doing or what you have done than you. You will see things the bank won't see. MARTIN: Finally, if you are the victim of some kind of online theft or sabotage, there are some easily accessible places to go for help. LEVIN: Many organizations, as a perk of your relationship with them - it could be your insurance company, your bank, your credit union or the HR department where you work - offer plans that will help you get through a problem - identity related problem, a fraud related problem. You won't know unless you ask. And it could be free. MARTIN: Levin says minimizing your risk is important, and sometimes it's really just not that hard. You've heard it a million times. Change your passwords. Make them more complicated. And while Levin says all these steps aren't a failsafe, if you don't take responsibility for your own online security, it will be far easier for someone else to compromise it.

Murakami told readers they could ask about any subject, but he did note he was especially interested in cats and Japanese baseball.

Murakami is notoriously shy and rarely makes public appearances, but. . . CADDEAU: This is a format that allows him to really engage in a way that plays to his strengths.

The goal, says Chairman Tom Wheeler, is to ensure network neutrality. That's the idea that all traffic on the Internet, whether it's from Netflix or from Joe's Pizza, is treated equally. NPR's Laura Sydell spoke to supporters and opponents of the plan. LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE: Network neutrality is a pretty dull term. Even the guy who coined it agrees. TIM WU: Oh, God. I know. I know. SYDELL: Tim Wu, a law professor at Columbia University, came up with this eye-glazing concept over a decade ago. I'll let him explain it. WU: Net neutrality is a rule that says that the companies that carry the Internet have to carry stuff more or less equally. They can't block. Kickstarter is a much smaller company than, let's say Google, but Kickstarter feels pretty good. And that has been the power of net neutrality. It's an equalizing force between small and big business. SYDELL: Wu says broadband providers like Comcast and AT&T want to be able to make deals with companies like Google-YouTube where those companies would pay providers extra to get to consumers faster than their competitors - say, Vimeo. The FCC's been trying to prevent broadband companies from doing this and from slowing traffic from their competitors. But the commission's efforts have been blocked in court. That's why the FCC has turned to an equally dull term, Title II. WU: Title II is impossible - impossible. SYDELL: Title II is the statute that's been used to regulate utilities, specifically telephone service. That would give the FCC a lot more power to enforce network neutrality and ensure everyone from small companies to everyday users enjoys equal access. But critics say this is too much power. Robert Litan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, says, for example, under Title II, the Commission can cap how much you can be charged for phone service. ROBERT LITAN: And when you're a company having to operate under the threat that your service is going to be regulated, you are going to have much less incentive to invest in upgrading of broadband. SYDELL: The new proposal from FCC Chairman Wheeler specifically states that the commission will not use Title II to regulate prices for Internet service. But Litan says providers worry that could change. LITAN: They are potentially living under the threat that a future FCC could regulate their prices, just like we did for AT&T when it was a monopoly. SYDELL: Other critics of the chairman's proposal say that it might not actually assure a truly open playing field for some companies. Doug Brake is a policy analyst with the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. He points to private networks that Wall Street traders have built to ensure super high speeds to do split-second trading. Even some big video game companies, like Riot Games, are planning their own private networks to ensure consumers can play without any lag time. Brake says small companies can't afford to do that. DOUG BRAKE: If you're a small gaming company and you only have so much of a user base, you'd much rather be paying to scale up that privatization to get quality of service assurances for your gaming packets - right? - rather than having to build your own fiber network. SYDELL: One thing that Brake, Litan, and Wu all agree on is that after Chairman Wheeler formally presents his proposal to the full FCC tomorrow, and even if the commission approves it later this month, the battle around network neutrality isn't over. A new round of lawsuits will almost certainly begin. Laura Sydell, NPR News.

Let me just take a selfie first. Sound familiar? You hear that phrase all the time from people addicted to posting pictures of themselves on social media. But while a digital self-portrait might be fine at home or on a night out with friends, it is not OK in the cockpit of a plane. In fact, the Federal Aviation Administration bans commercial airline pilots from using laptops, cell phones and other electronic devices while they're on duty, but that hasn't stopped hundreds of dreamy cloud photos from popping up on Instagram and other networks. David Yanofsky from the online publication Quartz has written about this and speaks to us now. Welcome to the program, David. DAVID YANOFSKY: Hi. CORNISH: So we mentioned selfies, but that's not the only kind of photo you're seeing, right? I mean, how prevalent is this? YANOFSKY: Well, you know, a couple months ago I was on Instagram and I was noticing photos of all types. You'd see photos from pilots that are of sunsets, that are of mountains, that are of cityscapes - beautiful, beautiful photographs. And up until yesterday, there was no NTSB report that ever cited photographs being taken in the cockpit as a reason for a crash. CORNISH: So give us more on the specifics of the rules governing personal devices in the cockpit, right, the goal is what's called a quote-unquote \"sterile cockpit. \"YANOFSKY: Sure. So sterile cockpit is what applies during taxi take-off and landing. And during those times pilots aren't allowed to do any activity that is not directly related to the safe operation of the aircraft. That includes drinking a cup of coffee, that includes talking about the baseball game, that includes pointing out landmarks to the passengers in the back of the plane. But outside of critical phases of flight where a sterile cockpit is supposed to be observed, the FAA has a regulation that was enacted in April 2014 that prevents all commercial airline pilots from using any electronic device that has wireless capabilities during flight. CORNISH: And do you get the sense that they took this action in response to this practice? YANOFSKY: It was taken in direct action, in fact, to a couple incidents and accidents caused by pilots either texting or using - in this specific example - a laptop computer. This was a flight that missed its destination by like, 150 miles - just kept on flying. CORNISH: And there are more serious consequences to distraction, right? Recently there was a fatal plane crash in Denver where they found a GoPro video camera among the wreckage and also talked about cell phone use by the pilot. Any sense that these rules might apply to non-commercial pilots soon? YANOFSKY: It's hard to say. There's been no administrative action taken against any pilot for taking photographs in the cockpit, according to the FAA. I asked the FAA if they were going to publish any advisories and they said, nope, we're going to take no extra action. CORNISH: What's been the response from pilots? Either ones you've contacted for this story, or just in response to the story itself, right, I mean they probably say they know best? YANOFSKY: They definitely say they know best. They all say that they take the pictures, you know, when they're allowed to. There are certain exceptions to the FAA rules, one of which being if the camera is a film camera or doesn't have wireless capabilities. And many pilots have contacted me in a very angry fashion for pointing out the possibly illegal activity. CORNISH: David, this idea came to you, as you said, because you saw these photos online and at first you thought they were pretty cool, but what do you think now when you step on a plane? YANOFSKY: You know, I'm pretty comfortable stepping on a plane. I fly a lot. But the real concern with any industry is a culture of rule-breaking. And you don't want to have any profession looking at the laws that govern them and saying, oh, this set of them doesn't have to apply to me.

The change in regulations that would make that happen has got big phone and cable companies up in arms. NPR's Joel Rose reports. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: Not many issues before the FCC generate as much passion as this one. TOM WHEELER: Did I pay attention to the fact that there were 4 million comments filed? Of course, that's a record. ROSE: Tom Wheeler is the chairman of the FCC, and he is doing what approximately 3 million people who wrote to the commission hoped he would - proposing strong rules to protect net neutrality. That's the idea that big phone and cable companies shouldn't be allowed to block or slow data from their competitors or charge more for faster access to consumers. WHEELER: What we're saying is if it harms consumers, if it harms competition, if it harms innovation, that won't be allowed. ROSE: The FCC has tried to impose such rules twice before, but they've been struck down. A little more than a year ago, a court said the commission did not have the legal authority to enforce its net neutrality rules because of the way it was defining the Internet. For years, the commission has classified the Internet as an information service, which is lightly regulated. So Wheeler is proposing to reclassify the Internet as a telecommunication service, like the old-fashioned telephone, and regulate it under a section of the Communications Act known as Title II. WHEELER: One of the things that the opponents of net neutrality keep pointing to is saying, oh, Title II was developed in the 1930s for a monopoly environment. And that's a great soundbite. But it's totally misleading as to what we're doing here. We are modernizing the basic vehicle of Title II to deal with the realities in the 21st century. ROSE: In the last century, the FCC used to Title II to cap what phone companies could charge you. Wheeler says that will not happen when Title II is applied to broadband. He says the FCC won't try to impose any taxes on the Internet either. WHEELER: There's, like, 38 different sections of Title II. And what we're doing is forbearing, which means we are not using the vast majority of those - approximately 30 of those. We're just going to focus on the things that are relevant. ROSE: The proposed rules were hailed as a victory by public interest groups. Companies that depend on the Internet to reach their customers sound optimistic as well. Michael Beckerman is CEO of the Internet Association, whose members include Google, Amazon and Netflix. MICHAEL BECKERMAN: The broad strokes look good. We want to make sure that the end experience for users and the protections for Internet companies, large and small, are protected. And it looks like they're hitting the key points in a very light-touch way. And I think that's really positive. ROSE: The reaction from the big phone and cable companies was not so positive. They argue that utility-style regulation will hurt investment. Berin Szoka is the president of TechFreedom, a pro-market think tank in Washington. He says the FCC is overstepping its authority by trying to rewrite Title II. BERIN SZOKA: If you really care about net neutrality and you want to see the FCC on sound, legal footing, you need legislation. The FCC is simply heading for a third loss in court. And Congress is just going to have to decide this issue in two or three years' time instead of now. ROSE: Cable and phone companies seemed a lot happier with the rules Chairman Wheeler initially proposed last year, which were much more modest and, critics argued, much more open to abuse by broadband providers. Then Wheeler got an earful from the public, and even the president voiced his support for Title II. But Wheeler insists he came to the final decision on his own and that it came down in part to practical concerns. WHEELER: The big dogs have told us that they're going to sue. We're writing this in the anticipation that we know we're going to be seeing this in court. ROSE: Wheeler is expected to share the proposal with his fellow commissioners today.

KEN JENNINGS: The kind of pride that really bothers me is just smug superiority, you know, people eager to show you what they know and not caring about the feelings of anyone around them. That really gets to me. RAZ: This is a man who is well-acquainted with both humility and that deadly sin - pride. JENNINGS: I'm Ken Jennings. I'm a former \"Jeopardy! \" champion. RAZ: OK. Ken is being modest because he is the \"Jeopardy! \" champion. He won 74 times in a row - more than anyone else ever. (SOUNDBITE OF \"JEOPARDY! \" MONTAGE)ALEX TREBEK: Ken? JENNINGS: Who's Aristophanes? TREBEK: Ken? JENNINGS: What's the Trojan Horse? TREBEK: Ken? JENNINGS: Who's Jean Lafitte? TREBEK: Ken? JENNINGS: What's the dodo? TREBEK: Ken? JENNINGS: What is stellar? (APPLAUSE)TREBEK: Ladies and gentlemen, Ken Jennings,JENNINGS: As a game-show-obsessed kid, if you had told me that I was one day going to be marginally famous for being a \"Jeopardy! \" contestant, like, to me that would've been better than winning the Cy Young or something. That was my dream. RAZ: So Ken had accomplished his dream. But a few years later - this is in 2009 - he got a call from \"Jeopardy! \" again. The show was partnering with IBM, which was working on a supercomputer that could play \"Jeopardy! \" They were calling it Watson. And they wanted Ken to compete against Watson, which is where pride entered the picture. Ken picks up the story in his TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)JENNINGS: I was pretty confident that I was going to win. I had taken some artificial intelligence classes. I knew there were no computers that could do what you need to do to win on \"Jeopardy! \" People don't realize how tough it is to write that kind of program that can read a \"Jeopardy! \" clue in a natural language like English and understand all the double meanings, the puns, the red herrings - you know, unpack just the meaning of the clue, the kind of thing that a 3- or 4-year-old human, a little kid, could do - very hard for a computer. And I thought, well, this is just, you know, this is going to be child's play. Yes, I will come destroy the computer and defend my species. (LAUGHTER)RAZ: So you're thinking good thoughts. It's probably going to be a chance to say OK, well, maybe you guys ought to go back to the drawing board and keep working at it. JENNINGS: Yeah, I mean, how great would that be to have IBM pour millions of dollars into this new technology and then just to, like, humiliate it on national TV in prime time? That sounds great. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"JEOPARDY! \")JOHNNY GILBERT: This is \"Jeopardy! The IBM Challenge. \"(APPLAUSE)RAZ: OK. So I hope this is not a spoiler but Ken. . . (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"JEOPARDY! \")TREBEK: Let's play \"Jeopardy! \" Here we go. RAZ: . . . Got creamed. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"JEOPARDY! \")TREBEK: Watson? WATSON: What is violin? >>TREBEK Good. Watson? WATSON: What is leprosy? TREBEK: You are right. Watson? Watson? Watson? WATSON: What is. . . Who is. . . TREBEK: You are right. You got it. Dengue fever, correct. (SOUNDBITE OF DAILY DOUBLE)TREBEK: Daily Double. (APPLAUSE)TREBEK: Go again, Watson. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)JENNINGS: I remember trying to buzz in. . . (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"JEOPARDY! \")TREBEK: This from the Latin for despise. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)JENNINGS: . . . And Watson just beating me every time. . . (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"JEOPARDY! \")TREBEK: Watson? WATSON: What is contempt? TREBEK: Correct. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)JENNINGS: . . . With its evil, little, calculating robotic thumb. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"JEOPARDY! \")TREBEK: Watson retains control of the board. Watson again. Now to our leader, Watson. (SOUNDBITE OF DAILY DOUBLE)TREBEK: Another Daily Double. (APPLAUSE)TREBEK: Ken? JENNINGS: What is A? TREBEK: No. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)JENNINGS: So it was really just a crushingly lopsided score. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"JEOPARDY! \")TREBEK: A two-day total of 77,147. And that means, ladies and gentleman, that world. . . . (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)JENNINGS: And I remember standing there behind that podium and I remember thinking, you know, this is it. I felt obsolete. I felt like a Detroit factory worker of the '80s seeing a robot that could now do his job on the assembly line. I felt like quiz show contestant was now the first job that had become obsolete under this new regime of thinking computers. And it was freaking demoralizing. (LAUGHTER)JENNINGS: It was terrible. Here's the one thing that I was ever good at, and all it took was IBM pouring tens of millions of dollars and its smartest people and thousands of processors working in parallel and they could do same thing. They could do it a little bit faster and a little better on national TV, and I'm sorry, Ken. We don't need you anymore. And I was just thinking this is how everyone else felt playing me, you know? This is a taste of my own medicine. This is instant karma, and I totally deserve every second of this. There's your literary story of hubris brought low. RAZ: Yeah. Why do you think it's fun to watch that happen? JENNINGS: I think it's because it's so satisfying to see the idea of these proud people get their comeuppance, you know? RAZ: Yeah. JENNINGS: And then the audience is like yeah, this is so cathartic. Like, if only this would happen to my boss. So I'm sure it's just millennia-old - this idea that we love to see smug people get what's coming to them. RAZ: So at the end of the day, I mean, do you feel like pride should be considered one of the deadly sins? JENNINGS: You know, I do feel like pride leads to a lot of problems. You know, pride leads to a lot of crap - at least to the wrong people seeking public office or getting rich or whatever it is. But on the other hand, you know, there's things you should legitimately feel proud about, you know? Like when my - I went to see my kid's Christmas concert and he played really well, and I was very proud of him, you know? I can't apologize for that. RAZ: Like when you won \"Jeopardy! \" 74 times in a row? JENNINGS: It's a lifelong dream, you know? How can I say, yeah, I guess I'm sort of proud of having been on \"Jeopardy! \" for six months. I mean, without pride, would we ever have, like, gone to the moon, you know? RAZ: Exactly. JENNINGS: That's JFK being, like, you know, we choose to go to the moon and do other things, you know, because they are hard. You know, that's him saying think how awesome America is going to be after we've walked on the mother-effing (ph) moon, you know? RAZ: Yeah. JENNINGS: Man's reach must exceed his grasp or what is heaven for? You know, that's where the great human achievements come from - somebody thinking big. RAZ: Ken Jennings, \"Jeopardy! \" champion and humble man. You can see his entire talk at ted. com. So at the beginning of the show, we mentioned this conspiracy theory that a lot of popular TV and film characters are based on the seven deadly sins, including the ones from \"Gilligan's Island. \" Well, here's a scene from the 1978 made-for-TV movie called \"Rescue From Gilligan's Island. \" You be the judge. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"RESCUE FROM GILLIGAN'S ISLAND\")NATALIE SCHAFER: (As Lovey Wentworth Howell) Ever since we've been back, I've learned a lot about civilization. And I've learned a lot about who our friends really are. RUSSELL JOHNSON: (As Professor Roy Hinkley Jr. ) Yes, judging by our various experiences, we've had lessons in lust, greed, envy, sloth, anger, gluttony and pride - the same seven deadly sins that have always plagued mankind. JUDITH BALDWIN: (As Ginger Grant) You know, it's funny, Professor. We never had those problems back on the island. ALAN HALE: (As Jonas The Skipper Grumby) Well, that's because we learned how to live with each other. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"SING, YOU SINNERS\")TONY BENNETT: (Singing) You sinners drop everything, let that harmony ring up to heaven and sing, sing, you sinners. RAZ: Hey, thanks for listening to our show on the seven deadly sins this week. Our production staff at NPR includes Jeff Rogers, Brent Baughman, Meghan Keane, Neva Grant and Chris Benderev with help from Daniel Shukin. Barton Girdwood is our intern. In the front office - Eric Nuzum and Portia Robertson Migas. Our partners at TED are Chris Anderson, June Cohen, Deron Tiff and Janet Lee. I'm Guy Raz and you've been listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. GUY RAZ, HOST:  OK so we've arrived to our final sin - pride. KEN JENNINGS: The kind of pride that really bothers me is just smug superiority, you know, people eager to show you what they know and not caring about the feelings of anyone around them. That really gets to me. RAZ: This is a man who is well-acquainted with both humility and that deadly sin - pride. JENNINGS: I'm Ken Jennings. I'm a former \"Jeopardy! \" champion. RAZ: OK. Ken is being modest because he is the \"Jeopardy! \" champion. He won 74 times in a row - more than anyone else ever. (SOUNDBITE OF \"JEOPARDY! \" MONTAGE) ALEX TREBEK: Ken? JENNINGS: Who's Aristophanes? TREBEK: Ken? JENNINGS: What's the Trojan Horse? TREBEK: Ken? JENNINGS: Who's Jean Lafitte? TREBEK: Ken? JENNINGS: What's the dodo? TREBEK: Ken? JENNINGS: What is stellar? (APPLAUSE) TREBEK: Ladies and gentlemen, Ken Jennings, JENNINGS: As a game-show-obsessed kid, if you had told me that I was one day going to be marginally famous for being a \"Jeopardy! \" contestant, like, to me that would've been better than winning the Cy Young or something. That was my dream. RAZ: So Ken had accomplished his dream. But a few years later - this is in 2009 - he got a call from \"Jeopardy! \" again. The show was partnering with IBM, which was working on a supercomputer that could play \"Jeopardy! \" They were calling it Watson. And they wanted Ken to compete against Watson, which is where pride entered the picture. Ken picks up the story in his TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) JENNINGS: I was pretty confident that I was going to win. I had taken some artificial intelligence classes. I knew there were no computers that could do what you need to do to win on \"Jeopardy! \" People don't realize how tough it is to write that kind of program that can read a \"Jeopardy! \" clue in a natural language like English and understand all the double meanings, the puns, the red herrings - you know, unpack just the meaning of the clue, the kind of thing that a 3- or 4-year-old human, a little kid, could do - very hard for a computer. And I thought, well, this is just, you know, this is going to be child's play. Yes, I will come destroy the computer and defend my species. (LAUGHTER) RAZ: So you're thinking good thoughts. It's probably going to be a chance to say OK, well, maybe you guys ought to go back to the drawing board and keep working at it. JENNINGS: Yeah, I mean, how great would that be to have IBM pour millions of dollars into this new technology and then just to, like, humiliate it on national TV in prime time? That sounds great. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"JEOPARDY! \") JOHNNY GILBERT: This is \"Jeopardy! The IBM Challenge. \" (APPLAUSE) RAZ: OK. So I hope this is not a spoiler but Ken. . . (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"JEOPARDY! \") TREBEK: Let's play \"Jeopardy! \" Here we go. RAZ: . . . Got creamed. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"JEOPARDY! \") TREBEK: Watson? WATSON: What is violin? >>TREBEK Good. Watson? WATSON: What is leprosy? TREBEK: You are right. Watson? Watson? Watson? WATSON: What is. . . Who is. . . TREBEK: You are right. You got it. Dengue fever, correct. (SOUNDBITE OF DAILY DOUBLE) TREBEK: Daily Double. (APPLAUSE) TREBEK: Go again, Watson. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) JENNINGS: I remember trying to buzz in. . . (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"JEOPARDY! \") TREBEK: This from the Latin for despise. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) JENNINGS: . . . And Watson just beating me every time. . . (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"JEOPARDY! \") TREBEK: Watson? WATSON: What is contempt? TREBEK: Correct. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) JENNINGS: . . . With its evil, little, calculating robotic thumb. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"JEOPARDY! \") TREBEK: Watson retains control of the board. Watson again. Now to our leader, Watson. (SOUNDBITE OF DAILY DOUBLE) TREBEK: Another Daily Double. (APPLAUSE) TREBEK: Ken? JENNINGS: What is A? TREBEK: No. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) JENNINGS: So it was really just a crushingly lopsided score. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"JEOPARDY! \") TREBEK: A two-day total of 77,147. And that means, ladies and gentleman, that world. . . . (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) JENNINGS: And I remember standing there behind that podium and I remember thinking, you know, this is it. I felt obsolete. I felt like a Detroit factory worker of the '80s seeing a robot that could now do his job on the assembly line. I felt like quiz show contestant was now the first job that had become obsolete under this new regime of thinking computers. And it was freaking demoralizing. (LAUGHTER) JENNINGS: It was terrible. Here's the one thing that I was ever good at, and all it took was IBM pouring tens of millions of dollars and its smartest people and thousands of processors working in parallel and they could do same thing. They could do it a little bit faster and a little better on national TV, and I'm sorry, Ken. We don't need you anymore. And I was just thinking this is how everyone else felt playing me, you know? This is a taste of my own medicine. This is instant karma, and I totally deserve every second of this. There's your literary story of hubris brought low. RAZ: Yeah. Why do you think it's fun to watch that happen? JENNINGS: I think it's because it's so satisfying to see the idea of these proud people get their comeuppance, you know? RAZ: Yeah. JENNINGS: And then the audience is like yeah, this is so cathartic. Like, if only this would happen to my boss. So I'm sure it's just millennia-old - this idea that we love to see smug people get what's coming to them. RAZ: So at the end of the day, I mean, do you feel like pride should be considered one of the deadly sins? JENNINGS: You know, I do feel like pride leads to a lot of problems. You know, pride leads to a lot of crap - at least to the wrong people seeking public office or getting rich or whatever it is. But on the other hand, you know, there's things you should legitimately feel proud about, you know? Like when my - I went to see my kid's Christmas concert and he played really well, and I was very proud of him, you know? I can't apologize for that.

It's called Not My Job. Simon Doonan, unlike a lot of people, does windows. He first rose to fame designing the famous display windows at the Barney's clothing boutique in New York. He's gone on to be their Creative Ambassador-at-Large. He's written many books about his life in fashion, his latest, \"The Asylum,\" is out now. Simon Doonan, welcome to WAIT WAIT . . . DON'T TELL ME. SIMON DOONAN: Oh, thank you. (APPLAUSE)SAGAL: Now Simon, a lot of people are very nostalgic about their youth and their hometowns. You are not. DOONAN: I am and I'm not. I mean, I celebrate like a lot of British people, I celebrate the misery of everything, you know? Like I celebrate the sort of - the grimness. SAGAL: Yes. And you were born in Reading? Is that it? DOONAN: Yes, Reading, which has now become stupendously major town - Reading. But when I was a kid, it was kind of postwar. It was gritty. We lived in a rooming house. You know, the kind of thing. SAGAL: Oh yeah, I grew up just that way. (LAUGHTER)SAGAL: And did - at what age did you discover your flair for fashion and design, if in fact you had one at that age? DOONAN: Well, I think I came out of the womb like with a bolt of chiffon in one hand and a pair of pinking shears in the other, you know. It was pretty early. PAULA POUNDSTONE: Must of been very painful for your mother. (LAUGHTER)SAGAL: So what I know of postwar England, I know from sort of very dreary black-and-white films. Did you, shall we say, stand out a little bit because of your enthusiasms? DOONAN: I think so. I mean, I do remember skipping around the backyard in the style of the Russian ballet, and nobody else was doing that. (LAUGHTER)SAGAL: What did your family have to say about you when they saw you doing that? DOONAN: Well, fortunately they were so bizarre - we were like the Munsters, I think, in our street. So they had their own stuff to worry about. So I actually got a free pass 'cause everyone in the house was more crazy than I was. SAGAL: Really? You were relatively sane? You were just dancing about like a ballerina. DOONAN: Yeah, exactly, with a bolt of chiffon in one hand and pinking shears in the other. SAGAL: He's still holding onto that. It's been years now. Now I remember, actually, I might've even been living in New York at the time when you first started to get attention. You were the designer of these remarkable windows at Barneys that were an art event when they put up a new series of windows. Now we all have walked by department stores and seen manikins wearing the clothes on sale, but you were doing something more. Could you describe it for those who don't know what this was all about? DOONAN: Well, at that went to Barneys in the mid '80s, my boss told me, make the windows a talked about thing. So, you know, it was around about the period where they were calling Margaret Thatcher the iron lady. So I put her in an S&M outfit, made a caricature of her, put her in the window ironing and listening to Metallica - you know, in a dungeon. SAGAL: Were you able to - I mean, how do they sell clothes though? Do people see the S&M Margaret Thatcher, then walk into Barneys and say, I'd like one of those please? DOONAN: Over and over again. And that was just the men. SAGAL: Really? (LAUGHTER)DOONAN: Well, actually, you know, the windows are sort of a secondary form of marketing. You know, they're like a fun thing. And they're very democratic, like homeless people can enjoy them, anyone can enjoy them. So they're like free entertainment. SAGAL: I mean, do the homeless guys like jockey for the good places on the block when you put up a new display? DOONAN: Oh my God, totally. And I've - we've actually had dogs barking at our windows and licking the windows. And, you know, like it really is something for everyone. (LAUGHTER)SAGAL: You are now Barneys Creative Ambassador-At-Large. What does that mean? DOONAN: It means that I get to wear a sash. SAGAL: Oh, there you are. (LAUGHTER)DOONAN: I'm wearing my sash right now. I ironed it specially for this broadcast. SAGAL: Does it have like medals on it and ribbons in the manner of the classic ambassador? DOONAN: It does. But I think to be a proper ambassador, you have to be terribly fat, don't you? Like the sash looks much better on a corpulent physique. (LAUGHTER)SAGAL: How - when people ask you for fashion advice, as I'm sure they must do, what do you tell them? DOONAN: Well, I actually give terrible advice. SAGAL: Yes. DOONAN: I'm very reckless. Like I'm not one of those helpful gays. You know? (LAUGHTER)DOONAN: You know, like \"Queer Eye For The Straight Guy. \" I actually auditioned for that show and they rejected me 'cause they said you're just not helpful enough. (LAUGHTER)DOONAN: They showed me a picture of some guy with a mullet and a Metallica T-shirt, and I said he looks great. What's wrong? Like, I don't have that - I see clothes as being nonverbal communication. They're anthropology, they're not something you - I want to change, which makes me completely useless at giving advice. So in the absence of having any useful advice, I usually tell people, you know, go out and buy a blue stripper wig, you know. Or go home and take all your sensible work clothes and give them to the Goodwill and just wear party clothes for the rest of your life. If you can establish a signature look at is recognizable, that is yours - bingo. You've made it, darling. MAZ JOBRANI: What if your wife doesn't let you leave the house with your signature look? (LAUGHTER)DOONAN: Have you been wearing that leopard jumpsuit again? (LAUGHTER)SAGAL: Well Simon Doonan, we have asked you here to play a game that this time we're calling. . . BILL KURTIS, BYLINE: Fatal System Error. Please Reboot. SAGAL: Since you got your start designing beautiful, strange and useful windows, we thought we'd ask you about clumsy, awful and annoying Windows - namely, Microsoft Windows. Answer two of these three questions correctly and you'll win our prize for one of our listeners, Carl Kasell's voice on their voicemail. Bill, who is Simon Doonan playing for? KURTIS: Hannah Shulman of San Francisco, California. SAGAL: All right. Ready to do this, Simon? DOONAN: Yes I'm completely technologically idiotic, so this is going to be interesting. SAGAL: It shall be. Here we go. Now like many famous brands, people have tried to take advantage of Windows' popularity. Which of these was a Windows branded product you could once buy in Japan? A, a Windows 7 Whopper at Burger King with seven - count them - seven all-beef patties; B, Windows brand lingerie; or C, Windows windows for your house? DOONAN: I'm going to go with B because I love lingerie, braziers, negligees, anything like that. So let's go with B. SAGAL: I'm fond of them too, but before I give you the answer, how do you think Windows lingerie would work? Would there be little windows you'd open up? I mean. . . DOONAN: You know, a good piece of lingerie screams for a little aperture, doesn't it? SAGAL: It does. (LAUGHTER)SAGAL: So you're choosing Windows lingerie. Oh would that it were. It was really the Windows 7 Whopper with seven all-beef patties. POUNDSTONE: Ew. JOBRANI: Ew. SAGAL: I know, but it was a thing. Second question, you still have two more chances here, Simon. If you have trouble with Microsoft Windows and you call their help line somewhere in the world, you might be helped by which of these? A, a 5-year-old boy; B, a computer running Microsoft Windows; C, Bill Gates himself, but only on Tuesdays and alternate Fridays? DOONAN: C is so preposterous that I'm going to go with C because that would be kind of great, wouldn't it? (LAUGHTER)SAGAL: It would be great, perhaps - and I don't think you need to do this, but some people like to choose which one is actually likely to be true. (LAUGHTER)SAGAL: And that's just an option, you don't have to do that. DOONAN: Well, you know that fashion people are completely idiotic. SAGAL: Right. DOONAN: I want to stay on message. SAGAL: I feel - I understand that instinct. (LAUGHTER)SAGAL: You're going to choose Bill Gates? DOONAN: Yes, Bill. SAGAL: I'm not going to talk you out of it, but it was a 5-year-old boy. POUNDSTONE: Wow. DOONAN: You're kidding? SAGAL: Five-year-old Ayan Qureshi of Coventry, England passed a Microsoft exam and is now an accredited Windows IT expert who's qualified to give out help. Last question, back in 2009, to get the word out about Windows 7, Microsoft encouraged people to do which of these things that no one we assume actually did? A, throw a Windows 7-themed house party; B, get a Windows 7 face tattoo; or C, hold a neighbor hostage until he or she downloaded and installed it? DOONAN: I'm going to go with A because it sort of Tupperware, doesn't it? SAGAL: It does. And you're right. (SOUNDBITE OF BELL)POUNDSTONE: There we go. (APPLAUSE)SAGAL: There's actually a hilarious video demonstrating how such a house party would go that we cannot recommend highly enough. It is amazing to watch Microsoft's version of what they think actual human beings might speak to each other. Bill, how did Simon Doonan do on our quiz? KURTIS: You know, Simon is a great window preparer. Simon, you're doing really well. Thank you. (LAUGHTER)SAGAL: That was very diplomatic. JOBRANI: That's the nicest way of saying you lost. SAGAL: Yeah, I know. We're just going to skip the whole topic. That was hilarious. KURTIS: You tried so well. SAGAL: Simon Doonan's latest book is in paperback now. It's called \"The Asylum: True Tails Of Madness From A Life In Fashion. \" Simon, thank you so much for joining us. POUNDSTONE: Thanks Simon. SAGAL: Really fun to talk to you. Bye-bye. (APPLAUSE)DOONAN: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"SHE CAME IN THROUGH THE BATHROOM WINDOW\")ABBEY ROAD: (Singing) She came in through the bathroom window, protected by a silver spoon. But now she sucks her thumb and wanders. . . SAGAL: In just a minute, a teddy bear wearing a teddy. Is that redundant? It's our Listener Limerick Challenge. Call 1-888-WAIT-WAIT to join us on air. We will be back in a minute with more WAIT WAIT . . . DON'T TELL ME from NPR. PETER SAGAL, HOST:  And now the game where we ask somebody who knows a lot about something about something else entirely.

(LAUGHTER) SAGAL: And that's just an option, you don't have to do that. DOONAN: Well, you know that fashion people are completely idiotic. SAGAL: Right. DOONAN: I want to stay on message. SAGAL: I feel - I understand that instinct. (LAUGHTER) SAGAL: You're going to choose Bill Gates? DOONAN: Yes, Bill. SAGAL: I'm not going to talk you out of it, but it was a 5-year-old boy. POUNDSTONE: Wow. DOONAN: You're kidding? SAGAL: Five-year-old Ayan Qureshi of Coventry, England passed a Microsoft exam and is now an accredited Windows IT expert who's qualified to give out help. Last question, back in 2009, to get the word out about Windows 7, Microsoft encouraged people to do which of these things that no one we assume actually did? A, throw a Windows 7-themed house party; B, get a Windows 7 face tattoo; or C, hold a neighbor hostage until he or she downloaded and installed it? DOONAN: I'm going to go with A because it sort of Tupperware, doesn't it? SAGAL: It does. And you're right. (SOUNDBITE OF BELL) POUNDSTONE: There we go. (APPLAUSE) SAGAL: There's actually a hilarious video demonstrating how such a house party would go that we cannot recommend highly enough. It is amazing to watch Microsoft's version of what they think actual human beings might speak to each other. Bill, how did Simon Doonan do on our quiz? KURTIS: You know, Simon is a great window preparer. Simon, you're doing really well. Thank you. (LAUGHTER) SAGAL: That was very diplomatic. JOBRANI: That's the nicest way of saying you lost. SAGAL: Yeah, I know. We're just going to skip the whole topic. That was hilarious. KURTIS: You tried so well. SAGAL: Simon Doonan's latest book is in paperback now.

First, the medical insurance giant Anthem was hacked, exposing the names, contact information and social security numbers of as many as 80 million people. Then, on Thursday, Inuit, the company that makes popular tax-preparation software TurboTax, had to halt transmitting state tax returns after reports of fraud in 18 different states. For advice on what to do, I consulted security expert Brian Krebs. We started with Anthem. BRIAN KREBS: The number one thing that people should be watching out for is scammers who take advantage of this, and they're already starting doing this. So they're putting up fake websites that pretend to be Anthem offering free credit-monitoring services and, you know, trying to get you to click on things or give up information that you shouldn't give up. So - and this is happening not just via traditional phishing attacks, but also, according to Anthem, they're cold-calling people and asking for this information, pretending to be the company or a company that is working with Anthem to help people secure their identities. So just be very careful about those types of scams? We've already seen them, and we're going to see them ramp up even more, I think, in the weeks ahead. RATH: Now, about TurboTax - they suspended state e-filing this past week. They've restarted it now, but if you're a person who files this way, what should you do? KREBS: Well, first of all, you should find out if your taxes have already been filed for you. One way you can do is just log into your account and see if there's been any recent activity. If so, it might be a good idea to reach out to the state tax folks. Report that as quickly as possible. My advice to people is a lot of the tax fraud that's happening is happening because, number one, people wait till the last minute to file their taxes. So file your taxes as early as possible. And if you've become a victim - if somebody's already filed your taxes, make sure that you reach out to your state treasury department and to the federal folks. And the IRS has some great resources on their homepage for that. RATH: Now, Brian, you don't write about this with total detachment. You've actually been the victim of this kind of fraud. KREBS: (Laughter) Yes, same thing happened to me. I filed for an extension. We paid what we owed to the government. And then October came around, and we actually got around to filing our taxes, and they said, nope, somebody's done it for you. What the IRS does when you have this happen to you is they give you a filing pin. It's a special pin so that the next time you file, the return won't go through unless the filer has that pin. Consumers actually can proactively request this special filing pin by filling out a special form on the IRS's site. I think they make you sign a thing that says you think you're a victim of identity theft, or you're likely to be a victim of identity theft. But frankly, with how much of our data is being hacked and stolen, anybody could make that claim, I think, honestly these days. RATH: That's Brian Krebs. He writes extensively about cyber security and crime at his website krebsonsecurity. com. Brian, thanks very much. KREBS: Hey, thanks for having me.

She is the assistant director of Harvard Law School's Cyber Law Clinic. Thanks so much for talking with us. DALIA TOPELSON RITVO: My pleasure. MARTIN: So, Dalia, can you walk us through one of these recent examples, when and how emojis were entered as evidence? TOPELSON RITVO: Yes, probably the most recent and high-profile case is a federal case against the person who ran an online market for drug trafficking called Silk Road. And essentially, I think the prosecution started reading emoticon at the end. So it didn't say something like smiley face or frowny face. And the defense pretty much said this was not an accurate record of the evidence that was being presented. So the judge actually found that the emojis should be read into the testimony and the jurors should have the ability to read the texts or online messages themselves so that they could see the emojis in context. MARTIN: But some of these things are just random, just strange images that seem completely unrelated to the text. How do you deal with those in a courtroom situation because you don't want the lawyers to be telling a jury what a certain emoticon means because they would be then kind of swaying their opinion of that? TOPELSON RITVO: I think that's correct. And I think potentially or the ideal situation would be that if I wrote a text, and my text was admitted as evidence in trial, then the attorneys could ask me what I meant by that. This is also the same thing that happens, you know, for instance, when slang is introduced into evidence. Not everybody uses the same words in the same way. And it's up to the attorneys in presenting their cases to be able to clarify that in a way that gets to the actual meaning intended by the speaker. And, of course, if it's a little alien head, you know, I can't out of context say what that would mean with respect to a certain portion of text. MARTIN: But I do hear you saying that this is not trivial, that these things matter. TOPELSON RITVO: I would say it would. I think as these types of communications become more ubiquitous and potentially a richer source of evidence in disputes, I think these types of mechanisms to indicate tone or intent couldn really come to play at trial, especially in criminal cases where the intention of a person may really be at issue.

With that information, cyber criminals could do a lot of damage, as NPR's Brian Naylor reports. BRIAN NAYLOR, BYLINE: Having your identity stolen is a frustrating, panic inducing prospect. Just ask Brandy Freeman, an adult care provider in Jacksonville, Fla. She found out one day when she got a phone call from her boss. BRANDY FREEMAN: He was kind of shocked and he was like have you filed for unemployment from the unemployment office? And I was like, you know, no. What are you talking about? And he's like, well, you have a big problem because a Florida unemployment office contacted me wondering why you're employed and filing for unemployment. NAYLOR: It turns out someone obtained her Social Security number and address - she still doesn't know how - and tried to use them to file a fraudulent claim. Or talk to Linda Stevenson, who owns a dental lab also in Florida. Someone used her name and Social Security number to try to get an income tax refund. Stevenson doesn't know how her information was obtained either. LINDA STEVENSON: Absolutely no idea. I mean, you're asked for your Social Security number under many circumstances - every time you to the doctor or anything else. Everybody asks you for your Social Security number, so I guess it could be just about anywhere. NAYLOR: The Anthem breach is just the latest in a series of incidents in which big corporations have been hacked. Retailers, like Target and Home Depot, even entertainment companies, like Sony, have reported thefts. For people who have had their information stolen, there are all kinds of worries. Julie Fergerson is chairman of the Identity Theft Resource Center. JULIE FERGERSON: Undocumented workers might use the Social Security number for jobs, which makes your taxes a little bit more complex and difficult. We've seen thieves use this information for medical, to get treatment. We've seen criminals actually use stolen Social Security numbers to impersonate somebody so that it doesn't go against them. NAYLOR: The Anthem breach did not appear to expose the medical records of policyholders, according to the company. But the other information that was stolen is plenty useful for the bad guys. Robert Ellis Smith is publisher of Privacy Journal. ROBERT ELLIS SMITH: This information is very, very helpful. It would show not only the Social Security number of an innocent person, but the fact that you have Anthem coverage. So I would think that the biggest danger is that the malefactors will use this to get medical care in the name of somebody else. NAYLOR: Another worry - Smith says criminals could use the information over the phone to convince banks or stores to open new accounts or to make purchases. Anthem is offering its policyholders free access to a credit monitoring service. If you're really worried, you can take the step of putting a freeze on your credit record to prevent anyone from opening a new account. Another recommendation - avoid giving out your Social Security number at all if possible. Getting a new Social Security number requires a lot of paperwork, including evidence of problems caused by misuse. Even then, Julie Fergerson, of the Identity Theft Resource Center, says a new number is not always helpful. FERGERSON: The credit bureaus and banks are able to link the new number very quickly to the old number. And so all of that old bad information quickly is inherited in the new Social Security number, so even when you go through the painful effort of doing it, it really doesn't help the victim of identity theft.

We're not talking about your next car, but your next solar panel. The number of U. S. homes with solar panels has risen dramatically in just a few years, and one big reason for that is many leasing programs require little or no money up front. Here's NPR's Jeff Brady. JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: In northern New Jersey, two neighbors followed different paths to get their solar panels. ELIZABETH EBINGER: I'm Elizabeth Ebinger. I live in Maplewood, N. J. , and I bought the solar panels on my roof. TIM ROEBUCK: And I'm Elizabeth's neighbor, and we leased the panels on our roof. BRADY: And your name? ROEBUCK: Is Tim Roebuck. BRADY: Elizabeth Ebinger chose to buy partly because she enjoys the nitty-gritty of owning solar panels, everything from figuring out her eligibility for government incentives to crunching the numbers. EBINGER: I have to confess that I do maintain a spreadsheet that analyzes the details of our expenses and our paybackBRADY: Her system cost $35,000. A mix of federal and state subsidies helped reduce that price tag. And then there's the savings on her utility bill each month. Ebinger has calculated how long it will take to recoup her investment. EBINGER: We're currently looking at a less-than-10-year payback on the system. And we're hoping that the panels will last through their warranty, which is 25 years. BRADY: If all works out as planned, Ebinger will have 15 years of free electricity. Next door, Tim Roebuck took a less hands-on approach to installing solar panels. He signed a 20-year lease. ROEBUCK: I pay $69. 25 per month for those panels. BRADY: That payment replaces his monthly electricity bill. Roebuck says the lease payment will go up, but he's betting his power bill would've gone up even more. So he expects to save money too, just not as much as his neighbor. ROEBUCK: And I didn't have to do anything and battle with the tax credits and that sort of thing. BRADY: The company that installed his panels gets to keep the government incentives, but it also maintains his panels. Roebuck says if paying up front for solar were the only option, he probably wouldn't do it. And down the road, if he wants to buy the panels, he can at a discounted price. ROEBUCK: It was a very simple, easy thing for me to do. It was a low-risk thing because I didn't have to pay anything, so that's it; that's why we did it. BRADY: So Ebinger bought her panels because she could save more money over the long term, and she enjoys navigating the details. Roebuck chose to lease because it was simpler and didn't require cash up front. Those are pretty much the reasons most people choose to buy or lease, says John Farrell. He's with the Institute for Local Self Reliance in Minneapolis. JOHN FARRELL: But I think I, in general, would say I favor ownership, simply because it means keeping more of the dollars over the lifetime of that solar panel in the pocket of the owner. BRADY: Farrell's group has a calculator on its website to help you figure out the cost of owning versus leasing solar panels. FARRELL: For example, in Chicago, Ill. , not particularly the sunniest city around, but you could save over the 30-year life of a solar panel about $6,200 where you'd own that system outright. BRADY: A lease still saves that Chicago resident about $4,000FARRELL: So both are good deals from the standpoint of saving money, but ownership is about a 50 percent better deal. BRADY: If you don't have the cash, Farrell says you can borrow money for solar panels. He plans to take out a home equity loan for panels on his house in Minnesota. He also points out that leases aren't available everywhere. They're mostly in sunny states that have generous subsidies. Now back to our original question - is buying or leasing solar panels better? Farrell's advice - consider buying first. But if that's a barrier, then leasing is a good alternative. Jeff Brady, NPR News.

BRADY: A lease still saves that Chicago resident about $4,000 FARRELL: So both are good deals from the standpoint of saving money, but ownership is about a 50 percent better deal. BRADY: If you don't have the cash, Farrell says you can borrow money for solar panels. He plans to take out a home equity loan for panels on his house in Minnesota. He also points out that leases aren't available everywhere. They're mostly in sunny states that have generous subsidies. Now back to our original question - is buying or leasing solar panels better? Farrell's advice - consider buying first. But if that's a barrier, then leasing is a good alternative. Jeff Brady, NPR News.", "section": "Your Money", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2015 NPR.

LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE: When Kelly Scarborough's (ph) grandfather was ill, he set up a Facebook account. KELLY SCARBOROUGH: He wasn't on it a lot, but we wrote on his wall and, you know, added pictures. SYDELL: When Scarborough's grandfather finally passed away. . . SCARBOROUGH: My grandma went through his computers. She tried every password she knew he had, and she couldn't get on it. SYDELL: This meant that they couldn't put some kind of official family announcement on the page when Scarborough's grandfather finally passed. She says the whole family found it distressing. SCARBOROUGH: I think it would be nice to sort of freeze his page, I guess, and maybe just leave, like, a space somewhere on there for people to write, like, a memorial or whatever, and I love you and I miss you. SYDELL: Kelly Scarborough, Facebook says it hears you. VANESSA CALLISON-BURCH: Talking to people helped us understand that there's more that we can do to support people who are grieving. SYDELL: Vanessa Callison-Burch is the project manager overseeing a new legacy feature on Facebook. While you're alive you can appoint someone to be your legacy contact. That person can make certain changes to the account. CALLISON-BURCH: They'll be able to write a post that's pinned to the top of your timeline, for example, to share memorial service information or perhaps a special message.

He is part of an industry group called the Cyber Threat Alliance, which has signed on to the president's cybersecurity plan. Thanks so much for being with us. DEREK MANKY: Yeah, no problem. It was my pleasure. MARTIN: Let's start off by talking through some high-profile examples of security breaches and how the president's executive order might have helped in these scenarios. If we look at the Sony hacking, for example, email from the company's servers was made public, hackers were digging up details of the company's internal operations and employees' personal information. How could more cooperation with other companies and the federal government - how could that kind of collaboration have made a difference in that situation? MANKY: Sure, you know, really, really good question. So there's a lot of information to be shared. So, you know, as an example, these attackers, when they're going into a network like Sony, they leave a digital fingerprint or a trail behind them. And often that fingerprint can be observed somewhere else in the world. They're usually not just going after one target, right? They can go after a different target maybe two days before. So bits of that digital fingerprint, again, can be shared in advance, and the corporation can get it. By the time they go after their next target, that corporation's already going to have that intelligence and be able to stop the attack as well. MARTIN: What about the target hacking, which was a case of credit card numbers that were stolen and then put on the black market for sale, what kind of cooperation would have helped there? MANKY: You know, in all cases, it's not always possible to stop an attack. You can never say 100 percent, you know, guarantee that there's a silver bullet to stop these things. So in a case like Target and - you know, even myself thinking back to I think it was 2007, 2008 - TJX, they got hit by a massive breach back then. MARTIN: We should say TJX is T. J. Maxx. MANKY: Yeah, right. That's correct. These attacks sit on the network undetected for a long period of time. So the incident response - the quicker you can detect these things the less credit cards are stolen, the less damage that there is and the quicker that you can respond to them as well. So I mean, you know, in a case like Target, sharing this information, being able to actually just detect that threat in the first place goes a very long way and to understanding the threat and responding to it. MARTIN: We have seen some big tech firms stay away from the president's meetings today, protesting over the amount of information the government has gathered in the past about their customers, which goes back to revelations about the NSA practices. Is this still a big concern? I mean, what indication do you have about the kind of companies that might agree to these kinds of proposals? MANKY: There's a big difference between, you know, what's alleged in, you know, in Snowden and NSA and all of this, you know, the information that would be shared in a case like that compared to what's proposed in this framework. You have to understand that this framework, they're not going to be saying here's all the consumer records that were stolen, and, you know, it - relate it to person A. Here's person A's address. Like, that's personally identifiable information. What we're talking about is saying there are a whole bunch of, you know, maybe 100,000 people that were affected by this. Here's the details on the attack. Here's what the attackers were looking for. Be aware of these attackers. MARTIN: What does this mean for the average consumer who is largely just concerned about protecting their own information? Do these proposals make consumers safer? MANKY: Yes, absolutely. Whether it's a credit card breach or it may be someone going after health care records, again, when the attacker's on that system, the longer that they're allowed on that system, the more consumer records they can get. So, you know, if these attacks can be reduced, if the time of infection can be reduced, you know, the less consumer records are going to be impacted, and so there is a positive benefit to consumers there. MARTIN: Derek Manky. He is part of an industry group called the Cyber Threat Alliance. Thanks so much for talking with us. MANKY: No problem. It was my pleasure.

He was the headliner at a summit about the issue today at Stanford University. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: The very technologies that empower us to do great good can also be used to undermine us and inflict great harm. MARTIN: CEOs from some of the largest U. S. companies were there, so was NPR tech reporter Aarti Shahani. Hi, Aarti. AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: Hi. MARTIN: So the news out of this today is that the President issued another executive order. It's supposed to get private companies and the government sharing more information with each other. How is this going to work in practice? SHAHANI: Yeah, the president gave this really spirited yes-we-can to kick off his speech. And it's kind of strange because cybersecurity used to be a back-burner issue. But after all the hacks - Target, Sony, now Anthem - it's a challenge of the day, and our economy depends on it. The president's executive order is supposed to break down silos. Right now, more or less, a company gets attacked, maybe they know, and if they do, maybe they tell others in their sector, like a bank tells other banks, health care tells health care, but that's where it stops. Under the order, Homeland Security would fund the creation of a new entity that would create voluntary standards - and it is voluntary - for companies to talk across industries and with the government and share attack information proactively. The White House is emphasizing that information sharing does not just mean, hey, companies, tell us what you know. It's supposed to be a two-way street, presumably with agencies like the NSA telling the private sector what security threats they're seeing. MARTIN: So, you know, a year or so ago, we were hearing about the NSA surveillance and asking whether the government knows too much about us. So now the government is saying that more information sharing between the government and the private sector is in our mutual best interest. Aren't there some real privacy concerns here, though? SHAHANI: Oh, yeah. There are clear privacy concerns. I mean, one critic has said that this could be a Patriot Act two, as an illegal architecture that makes it easier to target individuals. Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, struck this very passionate tone talking about privacy on stage right before the president. But still, behind the scenes, the tech companies are fighting with the administration about consumer data. The CEOs of Facebook, Google and Yahoo did not attend the summit. And of course companies are concerned about their reputations and blowback to their businesses after the NSA revelations about information sharing. Though there is one other perspective I want to highlight. Some business leaders I spoke to, they're hoping President Obama's order signals that the government shares more information with them. Cybercriminals use the same lines of malicious code, the same types of attacks against different sectors. Often law enforcement agencies, they know it, they see it, but the criticism goes, they don't warn potential victims. MARTIN: The president wasn't alone. There were all these business leaders - the heads of Visa, MasterCard, Apple. Why such a big lineup? SHAHANI: They're trying to orchestrate a culture change. The summit's like a big coming-out ceremony. The opening plenary had American Express sitting by Pacific Gas and Electric, along with Kaiser Permanente, the hospital network - all talking about how hard it is and with plenty of companies making public commitments to improve cybersecurity.

But we wondered, in this digital age, can you still buy a simple, cheap radio - a radio that's, well, just a radio? We sent MORNING EDITION producers Barry Gordemer and Jessica Pupovac off on a radio scavenger hunt. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"DO YOU REMEMBER ROCK AND ROLL RADIO? \")RAMONES: (Singing) Rockin' rock and roll radio, let's go. JESSICA PUPOVAC, BYLINE: Here's our criteria. We want a radio that's inexpensive and portable, small enough to fit in your pocket. BARRY GORDEMER, BYLINE: And you don't have to plug it into something or connect to anything, so no Internet, no Wi-Fi, no Bluetooth. PUPOVAC: And finally, it's got to be radio only, no smartphones, no satellite radios, just standard AM/FM. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"THIS IS RADIO CLASH\")THE CLASH: (Singing) This is radio clash from pirate satellite. PUPOVAC: We started at a Target in Washington, D. C. Team leader Michael Yost took us to a lonely corner of the electronics department and showed us some boomboxes. MICHAEL YOST: This is essentially the most basic, generic radio that you're going to get, pretty portable. PUPOVAC: And cheap, about 20 bucks. But it had a CD player. Remember, we just wanted a radio. YOST: So if you come right over here, for about $9, you get an alarm clock radio. PUPOVAC: Can you put batteries in it? YOST: No. You have to have them plugged into the wall, so you can't really take it on the go. GORDEMER: Nope, sorry. Remember, our radio has to be portable. Now, here's what Michael Yost really wanted to show us. YOST: This is a Bose SoundTouch. (SOUNDBITE OF BOSE SOUNDTOUCH RADIO AD)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Bose SoundTouch. YOST: It's $399. 99, and it's almost like being front row at anything you would imagine, a concert. GORDEMER: Wow, $400 for a radio that's not a radio? You know, we were looking for something a little more retro. BRIAN BELANGER: This is a 1938 Zenith. It's called a shutter dial because as you flip the switch here, it switches from one shortwave band to the broadcast band. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GORDEMER: That Brian Belanger. He's curator of the National Capital Radio and Television Museum in Bowie, Maryland. The radio he showed us - gorgeous, yes - portable, no. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)PUPOVAC: Our search for a basic pocket radio took us next to Best Buy, where we met radio technician, Azikiwe Seace. AZIKIWE SEACE: Everybody here calls me Queezy. PUPOVAC: Queezy showed us some boomboxes the size of my old Lincoln Town Car. SEACE: So when we get to our smaller radios, they kind of put them over here to the side. Let me see - huh, Georgie? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Yes. SEACE: Where are, like, the smaller radios? They move those things around a lot. They might be over here as well. Oh, here we go, right here. PUPOVAC: Queezy found some sporty little AM-FM radios meant for joggers, close to what we wanted, but there was no speaker. You had to plug in headphones. GORDEMER: But we found exactly what we were looking for across the street at RadioShack, a $14 gray plastic transistor radio. It looks like it came right out of the disco era. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"ON THE RADIO\")DONNA SUMMER: (Singing) On the radio, whoa, oh, oh, on the radio. PUPOVAC: Now, we were happy to find our radio, but just a little worried that it came from RadioShack, a company that just declared bankruptcy. But it's actually pretty easy to find pocket radios, just not in stores. They're all over the Internet, and people are buying them. BRIAN MARKWALTER: In the U. S. , we're spending about $200 million just on traditional radios. Many businesses would love to be turning that kind of revenue year over year very steadily. PUPOVAC: That's Brian Markwalter of the Consumer Electronics Association. He says about 98 percent of U. S. households have a radio, and that's held steady since the '70s. MARKWALTER: That means it's, from my perspective, nearly a permanent part of our lives. GORDEMER: Which is very good news on this World Radio Day for our little plastic transistorized friend. I'm Barry Gordemer. PUPOVAC: And I'm Jessica Pupovac, NPR News.

PUPOVAC: Queezy found some sporty little AM-FM radios meant for joggers, close to what we wanted, but there was no speaker. You had to plug in headphones. GORDEMER: But we found exactly what we were looking for across the street at RadioShack, a $14 gray plastic transistor radio. It looks like it came right out of the disco era. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"ON THE RADIO\") DONNA SUMMER: (Singing) On the radio, whoa, oh, oh, on the radio. PUPOVAC: Now, we were happy to find our radio, but just a little worried that it came from RadioShack, a company that just declared bankruptcy. But it's actually pretty easy to find pocket radios, just not in stores. They're all over the Internet, and people are buying them. BRIAN MARKWALTER: In the U. S. , we're spending about $200 million just on traditional radios. Many businesses would love to be turning that kind of revenue year over year very steadily. PUPOVAC: That's Brian Markwalter of the Consumer Electronics Association. He says about 98 percent of U. S. households have a radio, and that's held steady since the '70s. MARKWALTER: That means it's, from my perspective, nearly a permanent part of our lives. GORDEMER: Which is very good news on this World Radio Day for our little plastic transistorized friend. I'm Barry Gordemer. PUPOVAC: And I'm Jessica Pupovac, NPR News.

He's the comedian you might know as Tobias on \"Arrested Development. \" He was also the co-founder of \"Mr. Show\" with Bob Odenkirk. \"Hits\" is a dark comedy about our collective obsession with one thing.

This takes place in a small town in upstate New York - Liberty. CROSS: So it centers around a father and a daughter. The father is a simple municipal worker who wants his pothole fixed on his street. And his daughter wants to be famous and just feels that she deserves fame 'cause she's an interesting person. And one of the videos of the dad ranting at town hall about his pothole ends up going viral. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"HITS\")MATT WALSH: (As Dave) . . . Because this town is a farce. AMY CARLSON: (As Christina Casserta) Time Mr. Steuben. WALSH: (As Dave) I can speak if I want to. CARLSON: (As Christina Casserta) You just did. WALSH: (As Dave) Oh, and where in the Constitution does it say that a man only has three minutes to speak? Show me, Ms. Casserta. CROSS: And meanwhile, this is all frustrating this girl. She wants to be famous and desires fame, and her dad, who wants nothing to do with it, is getting increasingly famous. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"HITS\")HAGNER: (As Katelyn) Dad? UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: Don't be scared, we're here to help. HAGNER: (As Katelyn) Dad. WALSH: (As Dave) Hey, honey. HAGNER: (As Katelyn) Dad, what the [expletive] is going on? WALSH: (As Dave) Oh, these boys - they're going to help me get justice with the town council. HAGNER: (As Katelyn) What? WALSH: (As Dave) Yeah, they're from New York City. Apparently, there's a video online from the council meeting the other night, and all sorts of people are starting to rally behind my cause. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #3: Yeah, your dad is about to be the most famous man in town. RATH: The obsession with fame is something which runs deep through this film. And I'm wondering, as somebody - I mean, you got on TV 20 years ago now. How is getting famous or being famous different now? CROSS: Being is probably not that much different. Getting to be a celebrity - that's changed dramatically. And that's what the movie's about - is that you don't have to show any discernible talent to be famous. And you - you know, we've all heard the phrase, you know, famous for being famous. I mean, look at Bravo now. Look at TLC. Bravo used to be like a legitimate network, I believe, like 15 years ago. RATH: It was, like, arts and - yeah. CROSS: Yeah, yeah, and now it's just [expletive], and the people that are - for the most part - that are on shows on Bravo are anywhere from bad to despicable. They're shallow people with terrible morals, terrible ethics. And then the people that watch those shows mostly watch it with detached irony, or supposedly - that's in air quotes - you know, but actually really do perpetuate the existence of that very show that they claim to hate and make fun of just by them watching it and writing, you know, snarky blogs about it. RATH: Do you detest those characters in your film who are kind of from that world? CROSS: You know, I don't like any of them. I feel - the thing with Katelyn is, I understand her. I mean, she's a product of her environment, and that's an environment that you and I gave her. I don't know how old you are, but I'm assuming we're somewhat in the same generational age. And this is the world we gave them. And as much as I feel like it's shallow and valueless, I don't fault her. I mean, that's where we are now. RATH: And that's what, you know, people always say about the younger generation, right? CROSS: Always - I'm very aware of that. I'm totally aware that every generation makes fun of the generation that comes after it. But still, I think we can all agree, no matter how old you are, whether you're 15 or 105, that the baby boomers were literally the worst generation in history. RATH: (Laughter). CROSS: Let's all agree on that, at least. RATH: So tell us about this distribution model that you've come up with and how it's going to work. CROSS: Well, there's two different things that are happening concurrently. One is, the movie's available on BitTorrent as a pay-what-you-want package. Also, we started a Kickstarter campaign to get it into theaters, which we were successful with. And we were in 50 different theaters, and those are also pay-what-you-want. RATH: So Thom Yorke from Radiohead released his solo album through BitTorrent last year. CROSS: That was the direct inspiration. RATH: Yeah? CROSS: Really. RATH: What do people pay when you tell them pay what you want? CROSS: I don't know. We'll find out. RATH: (Laughter) You know, as somebody who's worked in public broadcasting for a long time, I think that maybe we're the founders of the pay-what-you-want model. (LAUGHTER)CROSS: Yeah, I concur with that, yeah - the pledge drives. RATH: That's David Cross. His directorial debut was just released yesterday through BitTorrent Bundle.

NPR's Aarti Shahani reports. AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: At the daylong event, cabinet members, CEOs of top companies and President Obama himself rammed home the same message, which goes like this. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: So this summit's an example of what we need more of - all of us working together to do what none of us can achieve alone. SHAHANI: To stop hackers. It's a big goal, a heavy lift and one that will take law enforcement and companies working smart, not just hard, together. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)OBAMA: The cyber world is sort of the wild, wild West. And to some degree, we're asked to be the sheriff. When something like Sony happens, people want to know what can government do about this? SHAHANI: The president is referring, of course, to the wholesale theft of emails, Social Security numbers, unreleased films from Sony Pictures, though by now, we've had megabreaches coming from all directions. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)OBAMA: If information is being shared by terrorists in the cyber world, an attack happens, people want to know are there ways of stopping that from happening? SHAHANI: One way to stop it is to let potential victims know they're at risk. U. S. intelligence agencies are a treasure trove of information about organized hacker rings and the newest attacks that aim to steal everything from American intellectual property to consumer data. In the physical world, a police precinct might put out an alert when there's a string of burglaries on a block. In the cyber world, experts say, federal authorities don't give a heads up nearly enough. ALEX STAMOS: A lot of companies will report information from the government to allow for investigations and to hopefully go after cybercriminals. SHAHANI: Alex Stamos is chief information security officer at Yahoo! . STAMOS: It is very rare for the government to bring information back into industry that we can then use to preemptively stop these attackers. SHAHANI: Stamos hopes that the new executive order prompts a change in attitude, gets law enforcement to open up and help companies like his keep an eye out for attackers trying to break into their networks. Interestingly enough, he says, there's a lot of information sharing in the criminal networks. They use the same brute force attacks, the same malware. STAMOS: And so part of the goal of information sharing is to make sure that these folks can't build this infrastructure once and then use it over and over again. SHAHANI: Rod Beckstrom is a former Department of Homeland Security official. He says while individual investigators often want to help preempt attacks, it's hard for whole agencies to change their ways. ROD BECKSTROM: We'll see what comes out of that. That's a difficult thing for them to do. SHAHANI: Do you anticipate that government agencies will begin to share more? BECKSTROM: They're going to share something. I mean, we had a great announcement here, and the president of the United States stands behind this. And I think the department and agencies will line up and you'll see a little bit more sharing and - hopefully a lot more, but we'll see. SHAHANI: The president's order gives Homeland Security a new power. It'll get added to the list of federal agencies that can share classified threat information with potential victims.

MCEVERS: That got us thinking - for this day on which we remember the birthday of the nation's first president - about some other presidential technology firsts. You can play along. We'll do this in the form of a quiz. CORNISH: OK, so let's reach back. And, Kelly, who was the first president to broadcast an address from the White House by television? The first presidential White House address on TV. It was Harry Truman in 1947 to a pretty small audience, though FDR had been seen on TV in 1939 at the World's Fair. MCEVERS: OK. How about the first president in color? CORNISH: Eisenhower, 1958? MCEVERS: OK. Now how about radio? Audie, all of us at NPR should know. First presidential inaugural address over the radio - Calvin Coolidge, 1925. And Warren Harding before him was the first president to have a radio installed in the White House. That was February, 1922, according to the Library of Congress. CORNISH: OK, Kelly, lightning round. Who was the first to have electricity at the White House? It was Benjamin Harrison, 1891. MCEVERS: OK. CORNISH: What about the telephone? First president to have one installed? Rutherford B. Hayes. MCEVERS: All right. Two more. The first photograph of a sitting U. S. president - William Henry Harrison, 1841. And a hard one to finish, Audie, first president to hold a patent. Ready for it? Abraham Lincoln. It was well before he was president. It was 1849. It was a device for boats for buoying vessels over shoals. CORNISH: That's All Tech for this week. Thanks to all for playing presidential technology firsts.

MCEVERS: That got us thinking - for this day on which we remember the birthday of the nation's first president - about some other presidential technology firsts. You can play along. We'll do this in the form of a quiz. CORNISH: OK, so let's reach back. And, Kelly, who was the first president to broadcast an address from the White House by television? The first presidential White House address on TV. It was Harry Truman in 1947 to a pretty small audience, though FDR had been seen on TV in 1939 at the World's Fair. MCEVERS: OK. How about the first president in color? CORNISH: Eisenhower, 1958? MCEVERS: OK. Now how about radio? Audie, all of us at NPR should know. First presidential inaugural address over the radio - Calvin Coolidge, 1925. And Warren Harding before him was the first president to have a radio installed in the White House. That was February, 1922, according to the Library of Congress. CORNISH: OK, Kelly, lightning round. Who was the first to have electricity at the White House? It was Benjamin Harrison, 1891. MCEVERS: OK. CORNISH: What about the telephone? First president to have one installed? Rutherford B. Hayes. MCEVERS: All right. Two more. The first photograph of a sitting U. S. president - William Henry Harrison, 1841. And a hard one to finish, Audie, first president to hold a patent. Ready for it? Abraham Lincoln. It was well before he was president. It was 1849. It was a device for boats for buoying vessels over shoals. CORNISH: That's All Tech for this week. Thanks to all for playing presidential technology firsts.", "section": "Technology", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2015 NPR.  All rights reserved.

S. Drone operators have greeted the proposed rules with enormous relief. They were worried about restrictions after the accidental crash of a small drone on the White House lawn last month. NPR's John Burnett on the new rules. JOHN BURNETT, BYLINE: Robert Youens is a commercial drone operator in Austin. His company is called Camera Wings Aerial Photography. His workhorse is a 10-pound quadcopter, smaller than a sombrero. ROBERT YOUENS: I will let you know that we're flying in a pretty heavy wind, so I am going to be a little extra careful taking off here. (SOUNDBITE OF ENGINE STARTING)YOUENS: OK, now that I've got it off, we're just going to check all the flight characteristics of the aircraft. It looks really good. BURNETT: This is the kind of aircraft for which the FAA released draft regulations yesterday. In a nutshell, commercial drones like this one would have to weigh less than 55 pounds, fly under 500 feet, fly slower than a hundred miles per hour, fly only in daylight and stay within the sight of the pilot. Robert Youens is OK with what he's heard so far. YOUENS: I think most of what they laid out - the weight limitations are a bit high, but I can go with that. Flying limited to daylight hours I think is a good idea. Flying line-of-sight so we can get out of the way of aircraft - and I like the fact that people have to pass a test and have an understanding of controlled airspace. BURNETT: The rule allowing only line-of-sight flying would restrict the kind of delivery drones being explored by Amazon. com. But industry watchers say the technology is just not there yet for drones to avoid obstacles on their own. The suggested regulations would not affect recreational drone operators, who merely have to obey safe flying guidelines. But commercial operators would have to go through a three-step certification process. First, the aircraft must be registered with the FAA. Second, the operator has to be cleared by the Transportation Security Administration, and then they have to pass a written FAA test. Andrew Amato is editor of dronelife. com. ANDREW AMATO: My biggest concern is, between getting a registration number and getting vetted by TSA - you know, how long is that going to take? How long is this process of becoming a certified pilot going to take? BURNETT: Amato is relieved the FAA did not propose treating unmanned aerial vehicles like airplanes. So operators will not have to get a private pilot's license, and the aircraft won't have to obtain an FAA airworthiness certificate. Amato says he's also relieved the FAA rules don't restrict their burgeoning industry. Drones are being used to inspect towers, bridges and levees - to look at farmers' fields and to photograph real estate from the air. AMATO: If they had said, you know, you need to report every flight you do, schedule flying ahead of time for every house you want to take pictures of, for every time a farmer wants to survey their fields - to have to go and report that every time would be a hassle, if not a nightmare. BURNETT: The proposed rules would also prohibit commercial drones from flying near airports and over people who don't know there's an unmanned vehicle filming them. The FAA will now open a sixty-day period for public comments before the final rules on drones are hammered out. John Burnett, NPR News, Austin.

That is partly because of just a rumor that Apple wants to build a car by 2020. While Wall Street and Silicon Valley seem excited, Detroit remains skeptical. NPR's Sonari Rhodes Glinton reports. SONARI RHODES GLINTON, BYLINE: When you hear that Apple wants to get into the car business, you might think - oh, wow, sweet, an iCar or Car MacPro. But people in the car business are like yeah, not so much. BILL VISNIC: Why in the world would any sane company want to get into the car business right now when the risks essentially are huge? GLINTON: Bill Visnic is with edmunds. com, the auto sales website. He says recalls, labor problems, all the safety regulations, fuel economy standards and the multiple bankruptcies - those are just the first risks that come to mind. VISNIC: And the rewards in the meantime historically - and are well known to everyone in the financial industry - the margins in the car business are remarkably thin. GLINTON: Visnic points out that Apple makes a couple hundred dollars on an iPhone. A car company is happy to make not much more than that on a sedan. MATT ANDERSON: My name is Matt Anderson, curator of transportation at the Henry Ford. GLINTON: That's the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Mich. ANDERSON: Yeah, some people would argue that the door kind of closed to new entrants in the automobile industry in the 1920s when Walter Chrysler got in. GLINTON: Anderson says Apple is certainly not the first big company to get into the car business after it was successful someplace else. ANDERSON: Sears for several years produced an automobile from about 1908 to 1912. GLINTON: Remember, Sears was the innovator, the disruptor, the Apple of the time. ANDERSON: They certainly had a built-in name recognition and customer base, so maybe it didn't seem so far a leap for them. It was only when they realized they were selling the cars for less than what they could make them for that they decided it was time to get out of this. The industry was just changing too fast for them. GLINTON: Anderson says all kinds of companies over the last century got into the car business because it seemed like a natural fit - watch companies, bike companies, carriage companies - almost all of them failed. Bob Lutz is the former chairman of General Motors and the former chairman of Ford Europe and the former vice chairman of Chrysler. He says every few years, a reformer comes along who thinks they're going to change the business - people like Preston Tucker or John DeLorean or Nicholas Hayek, who founded the Swatch watch company. BOB LUTZ: He decided that we in the car business were all dummies and we're all a bunch of dinosaurs. And so he was going to do what he called the Swatch car. And he invested a great deal of his own money and lost it all. GLINTON: Lutz is on the board of a bunch of tech startups. He says lead times in the tech world are weeks or months, as opposed to years and years in the car business. He says the stakes are just lower in the tech world. Remember the first BlackBerry? LUTZ: Like BlackBerry back in the old days, they'd crash once a day, you'd have to do a battery flip and then wait two minutes for it to reinitialize. And in the world of consumer electronics, that's OK, well, it is not OK in the world of the automobile. And this always comes as a huge surprise to them. GLINTON: OK, so is Apple actually going to build actual cars and factories with all those headaches? Bob Lutz says no. LUTZ: They'll make their money off of the hardware and software that they will offer to the automobile companies when they do the autonomous cars of the future. GLINTON: Because trying to build a car - that would be kind of stupid. LUTZ: Well, why would you want to do that? I mean, I know they have a ton of money, but the shareholders don't like it when you waste money. And spending the $10 to $14 or $15 billion that it would take to get into the automobile business would be a total waste of money. GLINTON: Then again, many people said the same thing when Apple got into the computer business or the music business or the phone business. I mean, you can see how that worked out for them.

What would you do if you saw a tweet from somebody threatening to shoot schoolchildren? You'd call the police, right? But what if the tweet was from an anonymous person in an unknown location? NPR's Martin Kaste has the story of how one man reacted to this scenario. MARTIN KASTE, BYLINE: On Valentine's Day weekend, Jonathan Hutson found himself exchanging tweets with somebody unpleasant, a Holocaust-denying anti-Semite by the look of things. Then Hutson looked up the person's earlier tweets. JONATHAN HUTSON: This guy was tweeting about shooting up a school. He said that he wanted to execute 30-plus grade school kids. KASTE: So Hutson decided to draw the person out to see if the threats were real. HUTSON: Then he tweeted to me after that and said, where do your kids go to school? And that made my blood run cold and, as a dad, made me want to stay up all night long and do everything possible to help law enforcement catch him. KASTE: He called the FBI, but the agent on duty didn't really get Twitter. So Hutson kept at it himself, trying to figure out the tweeter's location. At this point, you should know that Hutson is a former reporter who now works as a spokesman for the Brady Campaign, the anti-gun violence group based in Washington. So he knows something about digging, and he knows what it takes to get people's attention. HUTSON: I has assembled a tick-tock timeline of what he had tweeted, when he had tweeted, along with, you know, a profile of his pattern of life. KASTE: Hutson guessed that the tweeter lived in Linn County, Ore. , and he called the Sheriff's office there. Paul Timm is the captain of detectives. PAUL TIMM: We started looking at it and said it doesn't sound like a guy we know or that is even in our County. KASTE: It turns out Hutson guessed wrong on the location, but the Sheriff's office in Oregon was still willing to subpoena Twitter for the account's IP address, and that led, eventually, to Kalispell, Mont. , and a 28-year-old snowboarder named David Lenio. Police there arrested him about two days after Hutson first started tracking him. The police chief in Kalispell is Roger Nasset. ROGER NASSET: We got two search warrants. One of the search warrants retrieved two rifles, and another search located a handgun. KASTE: Back in Washington, Jonathan Hutson was pleased with his decision to engage with the anonymous tweeter. But was it really the right thing to do? JAMES FOX: Well, in this case, things look like they turned out well from having engaged this man. But there is a risk. KASTE: James Fox is a criminologist at Northeastern University in Boston. FOX: There is a risk of reinforcing someone's point of view. If they're spouting out threats and someone else is listening, it can actually embolden them. KASTE: There's also the problem of judging a threat from afar. Brian Van Brunt is the president of the National Behavioral Intervention Team Association. It's an organization that teaches campuses and workplaces how to head off violence such as mass shootings. He trains people to look for the signs that a threat is serious. One sign is specificity. BRIAN VAN BRUNT: First off, if there's a fixation and focus on target. We also pay attention to action and time imperative. We're very interested in understanding, is there a time or an event that's occurring. KASTE: Specifics like that were absent to the Lenio case, but Van Brunt still thinks Hutson was right when he tracked the threat down. People may think that there's some government entity like the NSA or FBI scanning social media for domestic threats like this, but Van Brunt says he hasn't seen any sign of that. VAN BRUNT: It's much more of a fishing net with multiple holes. We are lucky when we discover something in my opinion.

You're out with your friends one night and you lose your phone. You go home, you cross your fingers and hope that some kind soul will find it and return it to you. And then when that doesn't happen, you buy a new phone. For most of us, that's where the story ends, but not for Buzzfeed writer Matt Stopera. Stopera joins us now from our studios in New York. Welcome, Matt. MATT STOPERA: Thank you. MCEVERS: OK, Matt, so tell us how this all started. You're out with your friends one night. What happened? STOPERA: I lost my phone, and it was nowhere to be found. It wasn't anywhere in the bar, and whenever I was calling the phone it went straight to voicemail, so I was like, this phone - it's probably stolen. MCEVERS: Right. STOPERA: So then I buy a new phone, and everything's fine for a year. And then a year passes, and these pictures start showing up on my phone, and I didn't take any of these pictures. It's kind of some man in an orange tree, pictures of fireworks, pictures of people riding, like, motorcycles. And it looks like China. MCEVERS: OK, and so, how was this happening? I mean, what was going on? STOPERA: My cloud was still connected on my own old stolen phone. So whenever this man took pictures on my phone, it showed up on my new phone. And it's crazy. I mean, just even the idea of my phone being lost in an East Village bar and ending up on the other side of the world is just mind-blowing to me. So then I wrote the story on Buzzfeed about kind of everything that was happening and someone in China translated it and put it on Weibo, which is Chinese Twitter basically. MCEVERS: Right. STOPERA: It went insane from there. MCEVERS: So it's on Chinese Twitter. Like, how many people were talking about this story, and what were they saying? STOPERA: As of right now, 45 million people have read the story, and they thought it was hysterical. They named the man Brother Orange. MCEVERS: Because he was standing next to orange trees in the pictures. STOPERA: Exactly. (LAUGHTER)MCEVERS: Of course. STOPERA: So I kind of essentially became a meme on Chinese Twitter, and they're kind of expecting me and Brother Orange to reunite. And they think that it's a very romantic story. MCEVERS: Wait. OK, so people in China basically try to find the guy, right? Can you tell us about that? STOPERA: They all were messaging me saying, Matt, we're trying to help you, we found out where he lived already, but we're still trying to find him. So then they found the man and his nephew got him to make an account on the site, and basically it's because of the nephew that now Brother Orange is on, you know, Chinese Twitter and we're connecting. And basically right now it's like the Chinese New Year holiday, so I'm also getting a lot of messages on Weibo and on Twitter from Chinese people saying that it's a miracle and it's such a nice feel-good story for the spring festival. But also we're trying to coordinate now this meet-up. MCEVERS: Woah. So wait - you're going to go there? STOPERA: I am going to China. It's official. MCEVERS: Well, Matt Stopera, writer for Buzzfeed, thank you so much for sharing your story with us. STOPERA: Thank you. KELLY MCEVERS, HOST:  Here's a story that might sound familiar.

Welcome, Matt. MATT STOPERA: Thank you. MCEVERS: OK, Matt, so tell us how this all started. You're out with your friends one night. What happened? STOPERA: I lost my phone, and it was nowhere to be found. It wasn't anywhere in the bar, and whenever I was calling the phone it went straight to voicemail, so I was like, this phone - it's probably stolen. MCEVERS: Right. STOPERA: So then I buy a new phone, and everything's fine for a year. And then a year passes, and these pictures start showing up on my phone, and I didn't take any of these pictures. It's kind of some man in an orange tree, pictures of fireworks, pictures of people riding, like, motorcycles. And it looks like China. MCEVERS: OK, and so, how was this happening? I mean, what was going on? STOPERA: My cloud was still connected on my own old stolen phone. So whenever this man took pictures on my phone, it showed up on my new phone. And it's crazy. I mean, just even the idea of my phone being lost in an East Village bar and ending up on the other side of the world is just mind-blowing to me. So then I wrote the story on Buzzfeed about kind of everything that was happening and someone in China translated it and put it on Weibo, which is Chinese Twitter basically. MCEVERS: Right. STOPERA: It went insane from there. MCEVERS: So it's on Chinese Twitter. Like, how many people were talking about this story, and what were they saying? STOPERA: As of right now, 45 million people have read the story, and they thought it was hysterical. They named the man Brother Orange. MCEVERS: Because he was standing next to orange trees in the pictures. STOPERA: Exactly. (LAUGHTER) MCEVERS: Of course. STOPERA: So I kind of essentially became a meme on Chinese Twitter, and they're kind of expecting me and Brother Orange to reunite. And they think that it's a very romantic story. MCEVERS: Wait. OK, so people in China basically try to find the guy, right? Can you tell us about that? STOPERA: They all were messaging me saying, Matt, we're trying to help you, we found out where he lived already, but we're still trying to find him. So then they found the man and his nephew got him to make an account on the site, and basically it's because of the nephew that now Brother Orange is on, you know, Chinese Twitter and we're connecting. And basically right now it's like the Chinese New Year holiday, so I'm also getting a lot of messages on Weibo and on Twitter from Chinese people saying that it's a miracle and it's such a nice feel-good story for the spring festival. But also we're trying to coordinate now this meet-up. MCEVERS: Woah. So wait - you're going to go there? STOPERA: I am going to China. It's official. MCEVERS: Well, Matt Stopera, writer for Buzzfeed, thank you so much for sharing your story with us. STOPERA: Thank you.", "section": "Technology", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2015 NPR.

A government minister says they were most likely being flown by enthusiasts rather than criminals or terrorists. But the mysterious flights have unnerved a city still on high alert after last month's attacks in the French capital. NPR's Eleanor Beardsley reports from Paris. ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: There are said to be up to 500,000 recreational drones in Europe. The hobby is so popular there are shops popping up all over the place, including the center of Paris. (SOUNDBITE OF DRONE)BEARDSLEY: This tiny shop is full, and the phone rings incessantly. (SOUNDBITE OF TELEPHONE RINGING)BEARDSLEY: Model airplanes hang from the ceiling, and on the shelves and countertops sit all sizes of drones. They look like multi-armed robots with tiny propellers. Forty-year-old William Thermes says he hasn't been flying drones for long, but he's already passionate about his new hobby. WILLIAM THERMES: You have a inboard camera with a return on glasses or on a screen, and so you can be like a pilot in a plane or a copter. BEARDSLEY: Thermes says you see the footage from the drone and it feels like you're in it. THERMES: You can access to unbelievable place that you will never see elsewhere. BEARDSLEY: The problem is the drones of the past few nights have buzzed the Eiffel Tower and high-security sites, such as the presidential residence and the American embassy. While officials are playing down the security threat, they're clearly uneasy. Today, police arrested three journalists who were flying and filming a drone in the Bois de Boulogne park. There is so far no link between the journalists and the recent nocturnal flights. Operating a drone illegally in France carries a maximum sentence of a year in prison and a $90,000 fine. French law requires drone operators who fly in public spaces to have a license and authorization. Nighttime flights are banned outright. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)BEARDSLEY: But there are the rules and reality. Over the past year, drone enthusiasts have posted spectacular aerial views of the city of lights set to music. Thermes thinks the recent drone flights were also harmless. THERMES: Some people just want to fly and fly by night - a kind of game. People just want to try their new toy in the city. BEARDSLEY: But others, like retired schoolteacher Sim Rouviere, are worried by the drones. SIM ROUVIERE: (Speaking French). BEARDSLEY: \"I don't feel safe at all,\" she says. \"I think there's something very bad behind this. Someone is trying to destabilize us. I'm afraid it's terrorists. \"Pascal Scarcetto, the manager of the drone shop, says so far authorities have no real way to catch the drones or those flying them. PASCAL SCARCETTO: (Speaking French) (Through translator) What they need is a system to be able to intercept these machines and apprehend the people flying them so people know they can be detected. BEARDSLEY: Yeah, it's kind of heavy. Scarcetto shows me the larger drones that can carry up to eight pounds. He says drones are a cinch to fly, and there are no restrictions on who can buy one.

As NPR's Joel Rose reports, the vote reflects deep divisions over the future of the Internet. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler called it an historic vote. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TOM WHEELER: The action that we take today is an irrefutable reflection of the principle that no one, whether government or corporate, should control free and open access to the Internet. ROSE: The rules approved today prevent phone and cable companies from blocking or slowing any traffic on their networks, even that of their competitors. The rules also banned special Internet fast lanes for companies that can afford to pay extra to reach consumers more quickly, according to Commissioner Mignon Clyburn. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MIGNON CLYBURN: We are here to ensure that there is only one Internet where applications, new products, ideas and points of view have an equal chance of being seen and heard. ROSE: Today's vote was a resounding defeat for big broadband and it was nearly impossible to imagine a year ago an appeals court had just struck down the FCC's last set of net neutrality rules, and the Commission seemed poised to adopt more limited regulations. Then, the agency was flooded with public comments, said Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JESSICA ROSENWORCEL: Four million Americans wrote this agency, they lit up our phone lines, clogged our email inboxes and jammed our online comment system. ROSE: Many of those commenters expressed support for reclassifying Internet access under Title II of the Communications Act, in effect, regulating it more like telephone service and other public utilities. That idea got a major boost in November, when President Obama publicly expressed his support. But Republicans in Congress and on the FCC call that political interference from the White House. AJIT PAI: President Obama's plan to regulate the Internet is not the solution to a problem. His plan is the problem. ROSE: Commissioner Ajit Pai says it's a mistake for the FCC to move away from decades of lightly regulating Internet service providers. PAI: The Commission's decision to adopt President Obama's plan marks a monumental shift toward government control of the Internet. It gives the FCC the power to micromanage virtually every aspect of how the Internet works. WHEELER: Nonsense. ROSE: Chairman Tom Wheeler, a Democrat, insisted the Commission will take a light touch approach by not enforcing many parts of Title II and that there is no secret plan to, quote, \"regulate the Internet. \"WHEELER: This is no more a plan to regulate the Internet than the First Amendment is a plan to regulate free speech. ROSE: Still, Republican dissenters warned that the new rules could lead a future FCC to set caps on what broadband providers can charge. Commissioner Michael O'Reilly says that will make it harder for those companies to raise money on Wall Street. MICHAEL O'REILLY: I see no need for net neutrality rules. I am far more troubled by the dangerous course that the Commission is now charting on Title II and the consequences it will have for future broadband investment. ROSE: Big phone and cable companies seem to agree. Verizon released its statement in Morse code to poke fun at what it called antiquated regulations that were originally designed for the telephone monopoly. There is little dispute about what happens next. These rules are likely headed for a lengthy legal challenge, one that could play out during the next presidential election season, and maybe beyond.

That's because Netflix is out with its third season of \"House Of Cards. \" People who thought Underwood's road to the presidency was too easy will love this new batch of episodes, so says our TV critic Eric Deggans. ERIC DEGGANS, BYLINE: When \"House Of Cards'\" third season opens, Frank Underwood is fooling the world again, like in this scene, where he's pretending to honor his father's grave for the press. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"HOUSE OF CARDS\")KEVIN SPACEY: (As Frank Underwood) Nobody showed up for his funeral except me, not even my mother. But I'll tell you this, though, Pop, when they bury me, it won't be in my backyard. And when they come to pay their respects, they'll have to wait in line. DEGGANS: He relieves himself on his father's grave when the media's not looking, and that's when we see the real Underwood - manipulative, arrogant and ruthlessly focused on his own legacy. We also see a man used to winning hit a few roadblocks as president. One of the first signs of trouble is Underwood's struggle to explain a new jobs program on \"The Colbert Report,\" which Stephen Colbert is still hosting in the \"House Of Cards\" universe. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"HOUSE OF CARDS\")SPACEY: (As Frank Underwood) This is a fundamentally different look at how to solve the problem of unemployment. It has the size and the scope of the New Deal. STEPHEN COLBERT: (As himself) Oh, so it's a socialist redistribution of wealth wherein the baby boomers will latch onto the millennials like a lamp ray and just keep sucking until they're as dry as a crouton. (LAUGHTER)DEGGANS: There's even trouble with Underwood's Lady Macbeth of a wife, Claire Underwood, who reacts to a crisis of conscious by publicly undercutting her husband. That enrages President Underwood. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"HOUSE OF CARDS\")SPACEY: (As Frank Underwood) But do you want to know what takes real courage? Keeping your mouth shut no matter what you might be feeling, holding it all together when the stakes are this high. ROBIN WRIGHT: (As Claire Underwood) We're murderers, Francis. SPACEY: (As Frank Underwood) No we're not, we're survivors. DEGGANS: These setbacks actually solve a problem critics uncovered in \"House Of Cards\" first two seasons - everything worked too well. At a time of real-life congressional paralysis, Frank Underwood got a historic education bill passed. He also killed a political patsy and an investigative journalist looking into his crime. But as Colbert notes, President Underwood's got a different track record and a dismal approval rating. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"HOUSE OF CARDS\")COLBERT: (As himself) You've been president for six months. Unemployment has gone up, our trade deficit with China has increased. I'm not entirely sure that you'll be able to eradicate unemployment the same way you've been able to eradicate your approval polls. DEGGANS: Sometimes these setbacks can be as frustrating for the viewer as they are for Underwood. It turns him from a devilish antihero with all the answers into an impotent villain. Still, the new season's first six episodes are a binge-watcher's delight. Now, binging on such shows is a little dangerous. It's easy to miss important details in the rush to uncover the next plot point. But binging on \"House Of Cards\" keeps you from noticing how much of a political soap opera it really is.

I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, we're solving for X, the hidden numbers that shape everything around us like, say, for example, when you flip through the radio dial. (SOUNDBITE OF RADIO)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: (Singing) Taking over from one to 10. KEVIN SLAVIN: When I hear music these days, I wonder. . . (SOUNDBITE OF RADIO)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: (Singing) Number one. SLAVIN: . . . Why I'm hearing this particular song. . . (SOUNDBITE OF RADIO)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Singing) One, two, three, four - get it. RAZ: This is Kevin Slavin. SLAVIN: . . . What it is in my behavior or the behavior of others or whatever produced this particular track at this particular time. RAZ: Kevin runs a research group at MIT that's obsessed with algorithms, and he thinks that we're now living in a sort of age of algorithms. SLAVIN: Our lives are made up of a series of decisions. What time does the train arrive? And what's on the radio? And what's happening to my retirement stock? And more and more, those decisions are made automatically by machines, increasingly without human supervision. RAZ: So here's an example from Kevin's life. SLAVIN: So yesterday, I had to make my way from New York to Boston, so I needed to take a flight. And so I went online to one of the sites that just sort of lists, you know, what all the prices are and what's the price of that ticket. RAZ: A chain of complex calculations figured out. . . SLAVIN: Routing and where the fuel depots are, projected seat fill, weather patterns, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. RAZ: And once Kevin arrived in Boston, he decided. . . SLAVIN: I'm going to call for a car, and so I use Uber. RAZ: But then, an algorithm decided. . . SLAVIN: What's that going to cost? Is it going to cost whatever it costs? Or is it going to cost 1. 2 times that? Is it going to cost 3. 9 times that, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. RAZ: Then, once he got home. . . SLAVIN: My wife and I are expecting a child. . . RAZ: Oh, wow. SLAVIN: . . . So we were ordering. . . RAZ: Is this your first child? SLAVIN: It is, yeah. RAZ: Congratulations. SLAVIN: Thank you. So we're sort of looking to see, OK, which crib? RAZ: And if you shop on Amazon like Kevin does. . . SLAVIN: A lot of sellers on Amazon aren't actually setting the prices themselves, they're actually just using small algorithms that are looking at the prices of other cribs on there. RAZ: And that changes - and that changes all the time. SLAVIN: Yeah, it changes many times in a second. So the price that we paid may never have been actually approved or even considered by human at any point. RAZ: In fact, Kevin says, you can find these kinds of things wherever you look. Here he is on the TED stage back in 2011. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SLAVIN: And so Netflix has gone through several different algorithms over the years. They started with Cinematch, and they've tried a bunch of others. There's Dinosaur Planet. There's Gravity. They're using Pragmatic Chaos now. Pragmatic Chaos is, like all of Netflix's algorithms, trying to do the same thing. It's trying to get a grasp on you, on the firmware inside the human skull, so that it can recommend what movie you might want to watch next, which is a very, very difficult problem. But the difficulty of the problem and the fact that we don't really quite have it down, it doesn't take away from the effects that Pragmatic Chaos has. Pragmatic Chaos, like all Netflix algorithms, determines, in the end, 60 percent of what movies end up being rented, right? So one piece of code with one idea about you is responsible for 60 percent of those movies. So if you need to have some image of what's happening in the stock market right now, what you can picture is a bunch of algorithms, and that's 70 percent of the United States stock market, 70 percent of the operating system formerly known as your pension. . . (LAUGHTER)SLAVIN: . . . Your mortgage. And what could go wrong? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: A stunning and dramatic crash on Wall Street yesterday appears to be the result. . . (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SLAVIN: What could go wrong is, is that a year ago, 9 percent of the entire market just disappears. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: In a matter of minutes. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: Nearly 1,000-point drop. . . (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SLAVIN: And they called it The Flash Crash. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: Flash Crash, which many people. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #4: Flash Crash, as it was described. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SLAVIN: Flash Crash of 2:45. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #5: Stocks go do-oop - boink (ph). (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SLAVIN: All of a sudden, 9 percent just goes away. (CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #6: It's a fast market. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #7: The market was down 900 points, we're now down 688. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SLAVIN: And nobody to this day can even agree on what happened. And that's the thing - right? - is that we're writing things, we're writing these things that we can no longer read. And it's - we've rendered something kind of illegible, and we've lost the sense of what's actually happening in this world that we've made. RAZ: That's - but - that's crazy. SLAVIN: It is crazy, right? And so one of the questions is, when we create mathematical models of such complexity - and let's remember that any given algorithm within the stock market is impossibly complex and then it is the interaction of all of these complex algorithms with one another. This is far beyond what any human could ever, ever hope to understand. And it doesn't leave a forensic trail that provides an explanation; it just provides a bunch of data. RAZ: But you're saying that, actually, increasingly we're solving problems in a way that we don't really even understand? SLAVIN: That's exactly the point. I think that's one of the most important aspects of what's happening, and I think that characterizes our time. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SLAVIN: So let me take it back to Wall Street, OK, because the algorithms of Wall Street are dependent on one quality above all else, which is speed. And they operate on milliseconds and microseconds. And just to give you a sense of what microseconds are, it takes you 500,000 microseconds just to click a mouse. But if you're a Wall Street algorithm and you're 5 microseconds behind, you're a loser. (LAUGHTER)SLAVIN: So if you were an algorithm, you'd look for an architect like the one that I met in Frankfurt who was hollowing out a skyscraper - throwing out all the furniture, all the infrastructure for human use and just running steel on the floors to get ready for the stacks of servers to go in - all so that an algorithm could get close to the Internet. And you think of the Internet as this kind of distributed system - and of course it is - but it's distributed from places, right? In New York, this is where it's distributed from - the Carrier Hotel, located on Hudson Street. And this is really where the wires come right up into the city. And the reality is that the further away you are from that, you're a few microseconds behind. But if you zoom out, you would see an 825-mile trench between New York City and Chicago. It's been built over the last few years by a company called Spread Networks. This is a fiber-optic cable that was laid between those two cities to just be able to traffic one signal 37 times faster than you can click a mouse - just for these algorithms. And when you think about this, that we're running through the United States with dynamite and rock saws so that an algorithm can close the deal 3 microseconds faster, all for communications framework that no human will ever know, that's a kind of manifest destiny. And we'll always look for a new frontier. RAZ: So - I mean, so basically, you could argue that our lives are controlled by algorithms. SLAVIN: I think it's more - the word that I use is shaped. The rough edges of what determines our sense of the day are, in fact, sort of hinted by these mathematical models that are all around us. You know, there's still an awful lot of things that happen in the world that can't nobody predict and probably won't ever be able to. And I think that's great and that's fine. I just think that those unpredictable elements are - have this weird kind of frisson with an increasingly predictable set of models that are sort of at every level of our lives. RAZ: So there's a limit to all this? SLAVIN: Yeah, and it may be - so there is a limit, but I think it's also - it's not just that there's a humility in being reminded that there's a limit, there's also a value in realizing that there's a limit. I think that it's a reasonable dream to have that we can take a fundamentally mathematic model to everything in the world and then just solve all the problems in it, but it's also fundamentally impossible. And I think that there's a great value in recognizing the idea of striving toward something impossible but also the impossibility of the task. RAZ: Kevin Slavin runs the Playful Systems group at the MIT Media Lab. Check out his talk at ted. npr. org. GUY RAZ, HOST:  It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, we're solving for X, the hidden numbers that shape everything around us like, say, for example, when you flip through the radio dial. (SOUNDBITE OF RADIO) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: (Singing) Taking over from one to 10. KEVIN SLAVIN: When I hear music these days, I wonder. . . (SOUNDBITE OF RADIO) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: (Singing) Number one. SLAVIN: . . . Why I'm hearing this particular song. . . (SOUNDBITE OF RADIO) UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Singing) One, two, three, four - get it. RAZ: This is Kevin Slavin. SLAVIN: . . . What it is in my behavior or the behavior of others or whatever produced this particular track at this particular time. RAZ: Kevin runs a research group at MIT that's obsessed with algorithms, and he thinks that we're now living in a sort of age of algorithms. SLAVIN: Our lives are made up of a series of decisions. What time does the train arrive? And what's on the radio? And what's happening to my retirement stock? And more and more, those decisions are made automatically by machines, increasingly without human supervision. RAZ: So here's an example from Kevin's life. SLAVIN: So yesterday, I had to make my way from New York to Boston, so I needed to take a flight. And so I went online to one of the sites that just sort of lists, you know, what all the prices are and what's the price of that ticket. RAZ: A chain of complex calculations figured out. . . SLAVIN: Routing and where the fuel depots are, projected seat fill, weather patterns, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. RAZ: And once Kevin arrived in Boston, he decided. . . SLAVIN: I'm going to call for a car, and so I use Uber. RAZ: But then, an algorithm decided. . . SLAVIN: What's that going to cost? Is it going to cost whatever it costs? Or is it going to cost 1. 2 times that? Is it going to cost 3. 9 times that, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. RAZ: Then, once he got home. . . SLAVIN: My wife and I are expecting a child. . . RAZ: Oh, wow. SLAVIN: . . . So we were ordering. . . RAZ: Is this your first child? SLAVIN: It is, yeah. RAZ: Congratulations. SLAVIN: Thank you. So we're sort of looking to see, OK, which crib? RAZ: And if you shop on Amazon like Kevin does. . . SLAVIN: A lot of sellers on Amazon aren't actually setting the prices themselves, they're actually just using small algorithms that are looking at the prices of other cribs on there. RAZ: And that changes - and that changes all the time. SLAVIN: Yeah, it changes many times in a second. So the price that we paid may never have been actually approved or even considered by human at any point. RAZ: In fact, Kevin says, you can find these kinds of things wherever you look. Here he is on the TED stage back in 2011. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SLAVIN: And so Netflix has gone through several different algorithms over the years. They started with Cinematch, and they've tried a bunch of others. There's Dinosaur Planet. There's Gravity. They're using Pragmatic Chaos now. Pragmatic Chaos is, like all of Netflix's algorithms, trying to do the same thing. It's trying to get a grasp on you, on the firmware inside the human skull, so that it can recommend what movie you might want to watch next, which is a very, very difficult problem. But the difficulty of the problem and the fact that we don't really quite have it down, it doesn't take away from the effects that Pragmatic Chaos has. Pragmatic Chaos, like all Netflix algorithms, determines, in the end, 60 percent of what movies end up being rented, right? So one piece of code with one idea about you is responsible for 60 percent of those movies. So if you need to have some image of what's happening in the stock market right now, what you can picture is a bunch of algorithms, and that's 70 percent of the United States stock market, 70 percent of the operating system formerly known as your pension. . . (LAUGHTER) SLAVIN: . . . Your mortgage. And what could go wrong? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: A stunning and dramatic crash on Wall Street yesterday appears to be the result. . . (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SLAVIN: What could go wrong is, is that a year ago, 9 percent of the entire market just disappears. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: In a matter of minutes. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: Nearly 1,000-point drop. . . (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SLAVIN: And they called it The Flash Crash. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: Flash Crash, which many people. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #4: Flash Crash, as it was described. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SLAVIN: Flash Crash of 2:45. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #5: Stocks go do-oop - boink (ph). (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SLAVIN: All of a sudden, 9 percent just goes away. (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #6: It's a fast market. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #7: The market was down 900 points, we're now down 688. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SLAVIN: And nobody to this day can even agree on what happened. And that's the thing - right? - is that we're writing things, we're writing these things that we can no longer read. And it's - we've rendered something kind of illegible, and we've lost the sense of what's actually happening in this world that we've made. RAZ: That's - but - that's crazy. SLAVIN: It is crazy, right? And so one of the questions is, when we create mathematical models of such complexity - and let's remember that any given algorithm within the stock market is impossibly complex and then it is the interaction of all of these complex algorithms with one another.

He has a physics background, but he now mainly writes and illustrates a really popular web comic. It's called \"What If? \" And the way it works is every week people write in questions for Randall to answer in the form of a comic. So for example, what if you were playing baseball - right? - and you were the batter? What would happen if the pitcher threw the baseball impossibly fast, like 90 percent the speed of light? (SOUNDBITE OF CHARGE ANTHEM)RAZ: Here's Randall's answer. . . (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)RANDALL MUNROE: So I did some calculations. RAZ: . . . From the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MUNROE: Now, normally when an object flies through the air, the air will flow around the object. But in this case, the ball would be going so fast that the air molecules wouldn't have time to move out of the way. The ball would smash right into and through them. And the collisions with these air molecules would knock away the nitrogen, carbon and hydrogen from the ball, fragmenting it off into tiny particles, triggering waves of thermonuclear fusion in the air around it. This would result in a flood of x-rays that would spread out in a bubble along with exotic particles centered on the pitcher's mound. Now at this point, about 30 nanoseconds in, the home plate is far enough away that light hasn't had time to reach it, which means the batter still sees the pitcher about to throw and has no idea that anything is wrong. (LAUGHTER)MUNROE: Now after 70 nanoseconds, the ball will reach home plate, or at least the cloud of expanding plasma that used to be the ball. And it will engulf the bat and the batter and the plate and the catcher and the umpire and start disintegrating them all. . . (LAUGHTER)MUNROE: . . . Followed by a blast wave spreading out, shredding trees and houses as it moves away from the stadium and then eventually a mushroom cloud rising up over the ruined city. (LAUGHTER)MUNROE: So the Major League Baseball rules are little bit hazy, but. . . (LAUGHTER)MUNROE: . . . Under rules 6. 02 and 5. 09, I think that in this situation, the batter would be considered hit by pitch and would be eligible to take first base if it still existed. RAZ: This is the kind of question Randall answers every week in his web comic \"What If? \" Questions like, how fast could you visit all 50 states, or how long would a staircase to space take to climb, or what would happen if all the rain in a thunderstorm dropped at once in the form of a single raindrop? Short answer there - nothing good. MUNROE: In the case of the raindrop that's this big and falling this fast, when the bottom hits, there's so much more water coming and it's coming so quickly that there isn't enough time for the first part of the splash to get out of the way before the next part of the raindrop is already there. And this causes a thin jet to shoot outward along the ground, away from the point of contact. And - in sort of all directions you'll get these jets of water moving at, you know, much higher than the speed of sound. Yeah, you would want to watch this from a safe distance away. Yeah. . . RAZ: Like from a mountaintop. MUNROE: Yeah, make sure to have a mountaintop. And even if you've got a mountain between you and the raindrop, you'd want to make sure you are not downstream of that raindrop. RAZ: How do you think - how do you think you approach something unknown differently than other people do? MUNROE: Well, I have always had a little bit of trouble managing my time and just clicking random Wikipedia links or reading random papers. And then before I know it, I've spent like three hours trying to solve a question that I'm not even going to write an article about. And I once drew a comic about how you could sort of use this maliciously, this tendency science people have where - I had a comic about someone who sat outside an engineering building by the side of the road. And when the physics professor was halfway across the road, they would hold up a sign with an interesting problem on it. And the physics professor would stop immediately to like - and start thinking about OK, how do I solve this? Take the square root of - and then wham, they get hit by a car. And so I invented this sport that I called nerd sniping. But part of what I did with my idea with \"What If? \" is that I'm nerd sniping myself. I'm getting all of these questions sent to me that then I will have no choice but to try to answer. RAZ: Like a couple of years ago, when he got the following question - say all of the world's known data were stored on punch cards - you know, those paper cards with holes that used to be fed into giant computers? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: A card punch translates words and numbers into the same information in the form of holes in cards. A typist with very little extra training can operate the card punch. RAZ: Anyway, the question was if we still stored data that way, how much physical space would Google need to store all the data that Google has? Google, of course, wasn't going to tell Randall how much data they do have, so Randall came up with an answer he thought was plausible. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MUNROE: I came up with my estimate, which I felt pretty good about, that was about - about 10 exabytes of data across of all Google's operations. And then another maybe five exabytes or so of offline storage in, like, tape drives, which it turns out Google is about the world's largest consumer of. So I came up with this estimate, and this is a staggering amount of data. It's quite a bit more than any other organization in the world has as far as we know. There's a couple of other contenders, especially - everyone always thinks of the NSA. Adding all of this up, I came up with the other thing that we can answer, which is how many punch cards would this take? And so a punch card can hold about 80 characters and you can fit about, you know, 2,000 or so cards into a box. And you put them in, say, my home region of New England, it would cover the entire region up to a depth of a little less than five kilometers, which is about three times deeper than the glaciers during the last ice age about 20,000 years ago. So this is impractical, but I didn't expect to get an answer from Google because of course they've been so secretive. They didn't answer any of my questions. And so I just put it up and said, well, I guess we'll never know. But then a little while later, I got a message a couple of weeks later from Google saying, hey, someone here has an envelope for you. So I go and get it, open it up, and it's punch cards. . . (LAUGHTER)MUNROE: . . . Google-branded punch cards. And on these punch cards, there are a bunch of holes, you know? And I said thank you, thank you. And I was - OK, so what's on here? So I get some software and start reading it and scan them. And it turns out it's a puzzle. There's a bunch of code. And I get some friends to help and we cracked the code. And then inside that is another code. And there are some equations. And then we solve those equations and then finally - and out pops a message from Google, which is their official answer to my article. And it said no comment. (LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)MUNROE: So - and I love calculating these kind of things. I just - and it's not that I love doing the math. I do a lot of math, but I don't really like math for its own sake. What I love is that it lets you take some things that you know and just by doing these, you know, moving symbols around on a piece of paper, find out something that you didn't know that's very surprising. You know, and I have a lot of stupid questions and I love that math gives the power to answer them sometimes - and sometimes not. This is a question I got from a reader - an anonymous reader - and the subject line just said urgent. And this was the entire email. If people had wheels and could fly, how would we differentiate them from airplanes? Urgent. (LAUGHTER)MUNROE: And I think there are some questions that math just cannot answer. Thank you.

From member station WHYY, Todd Bookman reports. TODD BOOKMAN, BYLINE: If you're blind, the Web probably has a familiar sound. (SOUNDBITE OF SCREEN READER)ANGEL AYALA: We're on the Department of Justice website under accessibility under Internet accessibility. BOOKMAN: We're inside the computer lab at Overbrook School for the Blind in Philadelphia, where senior Angel Ayala is showing off how screen reading software works. He's using the keyboard to tab through all the various links on this government webpage. Angel is so used to hearing the Internet, he's got the speed turned way up. (SOUNDBITE OF SCREEN READER)BOOKMAN: Sitting to Angel's right is sophomore Marvin Pearson, also blind since birth. Even checking email or Facebook can be tricky. MARVIN PEARSON: Where's login at? I don't know why this ain't working. Oh, there we go. BOOKMAN: This is how it goes for these kids. PEARSON: I can't - oh, my goodness. BOOKMAN: For lots of people with disabilities, everything on the Web is a little slower, a little more frustrating. Angel and Marvin say some sites work well with screen readers and some just don't. AYALA: That's a huge problem with people who can't see the screen and have to deal with these graphics and PDFs and other things that aren't presented to us the same way it's presented to you. BOOKMAN: To make a website accessible, it doesn't need to be all text or cluttered with captions or stripped of graphics. Most of the time, the changes are relatively minor fixes Web developers make to the back end code, where the screen reader picks up its instructions. Sighted people wouldn't see any difference. And when the coding is done right, it's the digital equivalent of a wheelchair ramp. The type of accommodation the Americans with Disabilities Act helped make widespread. Advocates say the Web now needs that same treatment. CHRIS DANIELSON: This is beyond just mere conveniences like shopping online. BOOKMAN: Chris Danielson is director of public relations for the National Federation of the Blind. DANIELSON: This deals with education and, you know, employment, being able to do so many things that I just don't think it's realistic to say in the 21st century that websites don't have to be ADA compliant. BOOKMAN: On this point, the United States Department of Justice appears to be on Danielson's side. The DOJ is scheduled to release regulations this month spelling out exactly what an ADA-compliant site is and to clarify which websites would have to meet those standards. In the absence of clear laws, lawsuits have been the go-to strategy. Companies including Target, Netflix and H&R Block have all reached settlement agreements. Others made site improvements after customer requests. (SOUNDBITE OF BASEBALL GAME)UNIDENTIFIED COMMENTATOR: The Giants win the pennant. MATTHEW GOULD: It was really a great grassroots initiative of baseball fans - visually impaired baseball fans who wanted that level of access, you know, to their games, particularly live games. BOOKMAN: This is Matthew Gould with MLB Advanced Media. He says the group just didn't know the site wasn't working well for everyone. So when it was brought to their attention, coders made the improvements. Lainey Feingold, a disabilities rights lawyer in California, says federal action could spur sites to be more proactive. LAINEY FEINGOLD: I think that it's going to be very big when they issue their regulations because it is going to be a wake-up call, and it is going to bring heightened attention to the issue. BOOKMAN: And the issue, according to Feingold, isn't about special treatment, it's about making sure the Web works for everyone. For NPR News, I'm Todd Bookman.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"CSI: CYBER\")PATRICIA ARQUETTE: (As Special Agent Avery Ryan) I'm special agent Avery Ryan. I'm here to get your son back. RATH: \"CSI: Cyber\" premiered this week. That's recent Oscar winner Patricia Arquette. The unit Agent Ryan leads is called in on cyber stalking, identity theft, even cases involving hacked baby cams. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"CSI: CYBER\")ARQUETTE: (As Special Agent Avery Ryan) Detective Cho, please treat all hardware, including the baby cam, like a dead body. Don't touch it. Don't move it until we get there. RATH: That character is based on real-life cyberpsychologist Mary Aiken. MARY AIKEN: My job as a cyberpsychologist is to deliver insight at that intersection between humans and technology, or sometimes, as law enforcement says, where humans and technology collide. RATH: So given us an example of a type of crime that you would get pulled into and how you would work on it. AIKEN: So in terms of cyberbehavioral analysis, I'm looking at the overall picture. Say for online sex offending, how do they operate in that space? For cyberstalking, the difference between real-world stalking and cyberstalking. It would be very hard to commit a crime in this day and age that didn't have some cyber element. And effectively, in terms of crime analysis, we're looking at the digital fingerprint. If you come back to the basic premise of forensic science, I've been sitting here, I've touched the table I've left a fingerprint. There's the evidence. Nowhere is this more true than online. Every contact leaves a trace. RATH: So with the new TV show, the pilot of the show opens with a kidnapping that involves a baby monitor. Can you explain the scenario? AIKEN: The premise of the episode is about a baby cam that is hacked and an online auction of infants where babies are kidnapped to order. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"CSI: CYBER\")UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: They were casing the baby remotely and learned its habits - when he sleeps, what time the parents come in to feed - and at the most vulnerable hour - snatch. AIKEN: Kidnap gangs have them and they're transporting them to the buyers, and we intercept at that stage. But it all ends well. RATH: Right. AIKEN: The babies are rescued. It's actually based on a real crime where a father was walking by his daughter's bedroom, and he heard horrible conversation coming from the room. And he rushed in and a predator had hacked into the infant's baby cam and was verbally abusing her as she lay asleep. We wrote the episode. We filmed it. It was finished. And then about eight weeks later, there was a huge hacking episode where a couple of hundred thousand web cams were hacked and live footage were hosted up on Russian websites. They had footage of people's driveways, footage of people's kitchens. And they also showed footage of babies asleep in their cribs. RATH: I was going to ask you how realistic is that kidnapping scenario? AIKEN: It's the next extension. Look, this is entertainment, but our intention is not to induce paranoia in terms of the use of baby cams. The intention is to say look, consider the logic and think about security and think about safety. RATH: Do you worry though about the fear factor that - you know, there's another episode that involves a ridesharing service. And do you worry that, you know, you're going to scare people away from Uber or Lyft or things like that or make them more scared than they need to be? AIKEN: I think that our show takes quite a moderate approach in terms of it's not very gory, it's not very horrific. But people like to be scared. If you went on a roller coaster and it went from A to - what do you say - Z, not zed. It went from A to Z. And it was flat. Well, you wouldn't enjoy the ride. So good programming is about a roller coaster ride. It's up and it's down and we want a happy ending. But we've worked very, very hard to ground our show in reality - the reality of cyber. RATH: You're an academic. AIKEN: Yes. RATH: What has it been like going through this whole, wild, like Hollywood, TV experience? AIKEN: It's been quite surreal. I mean, nobody was more surprised than me to actually get a phone call. I'm a professor of cyberanalytics. I have a background in cyberpsychology, in network science, and a fellowship in criminology. So I'm out and out academic. When they approached me, I thought it was interesting. I listened to what they had to say. And then I took a step back and had to really think about it because my focus is my discipline. For cyberpsychology, it can help deliver insight, it can help people understand the dynamics of this environment.

But what if you could get rid of all the passwords altogether? That is what the Department of Defense is looking into, and it has tasked DARPA, or the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency with finding a better way for computers to ID the humans using them. Angelos Keromytis is heading up the project which is known in the business as active authentication. He joins us now. Welcome to the program. ANGELOS KEROMYTIS: Thank you. MARTIN: So we know passwords are hacked or stolen all the time. But what about other mechanisms like fingerprints or iris scans? Aren't those supposed to be more secure? KEROMYTIS: They generally can be, although people have been able to impersonate some of these biometrics, in particular fingerprints. The other problem is that many of the ways in which these biometrics are collected from the users are particularly invasive. MARTIN: OK. So what is active authentication? KEROMYTIS: Active authentication is a program that we started to look at the biometrics in a different way - that is instead of looking purely at the physical characteristics of a human being, try to, instead, look at some other inherent property of how we work, how we operate biomechanically. MARTIN: Give me an example. KEROMYTIS: Imagine how you type, how you put your thoughts into a keyboard. MARTIN: You mean, like the pattern of the letters or the quickness with which I strike the keys? KEROMYTIS: Certainly that is a part of it, but also you can consider how these vary as you type different parts of a phrase. For some things that you are very familiar with, you may be typing faster. For things that you are not as familiar with, you may be typing slower. And these are all highly dependent on your educational background, your exposure to language as a child - parameters that we, frankly, don't understand very well, but we can measure in very precise ways. MARTIN: So you're saying that the way someone uses a keyboard could serve as a kind of password? KEROMYTIS: Yes. That is correct. There are also the ways we walk. You can imagine something like one of those fitness trackers that captures the steps, the gait but with a lot more detail. MARTIN: Although you're presuming that a person walks the same way no matter what mood they're in or what kind of day they're having. KEROMYTIS: Very good question, so no. In all of these biometrics there is a certain degree of variation that you can have. That's why we're combining a number of different techniques and a number of different biometrics so that we can build the composite picture. MARTIN: You're talking about collecting a lot of data about individuals, very personal data, which leads to privacy concerns. Right? KEROMYTIS: You are right. And so this goes back to the heart of the point that we're not doing identification per se, we are doing authentication. For that, although we need to collect the information at the device that the user is using, we don't actually need to keep it. All we need to do is compute a single score by combining the technologies that will give us confidence as to how close or how far they are from their normal profile. MARTIN: So you think this is possible? You can imagine a time where we don't have to remember a whole list of passwords anymore? KEROMYTIS: Well, since I have used some of these prototypes, I can certainly imagine the day when this will be true. And I'm hoping that it will be sooner rather than later.

And right now that talent is trained on one product - the new Apple watch. It's the company's first entry into a new product category in a few years. CEO Tim Cook calls the watch Apple's most personal device ever, and you'll need a personal investment of anywhere from $349 to more than $10,000, if 18-karat gold is your thing. NPR's Laura Sydell was at Apple's watch unveiling in San Francisco. And, Laura, I am confused. I thought Apple had already unveiled its watch, so what happened today? LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE: Well, they give us a peek at it, but they didn't let us touch it and they didn't give a release date. Today, they gave us a release date of April 24, and we got to try it. BLOCK: You got to try it. OK. Well, what does it look like, and what does it do? SYDELL: Well, there's three categories of watch. There's the sports watch and there's the regular watch and the addition that's the 18-karat gold one you mentioned. You can switch out bands with the watch. So this is a - clearly a fashion play. I will say that it's a little bigger than most women are used to in a watch. I did notice that - a little heftier. The watch face is square and the display can change from, like, a traditional watch front to a screen where you can tap on apps, and there are a whole lot of apps you can choose. I should add, NPR is one of many organizations that are partnering with Apple on this to develop an app for the watch. BLOCK: Well, Laura, it's interesting because other companies have had smartwatches out for a few years. They haven't sold very well. Why does Apple think that theirs will be any different? SYDELL: Well, first there's the fashion part. I mean, Apple - it's Apple. It's elegant and they're good at that. There are a lot of apps they have that you might not find on other phones. You can look at Instagram photos on it. You could make phone calls and talk into your watch. You can pay with your watch. You can check in at the airport with it and you can do things like use it as a key for a hotel room. So I guess they are betting that it's going to be very convenient for those things. BLOCK: You do need to have an iPhone, right, to use the Apple watch. SYDELL: You do, and that's part of what may indeed make many people wonder why do I want one? Apple is betting that it's going to be a lot more convenient to just use the watch than to reach into the pocket and grab your phone. And they are thinking this matters enough to people that they're willing to throw some money at it. There are a couple of things it does without a phone nearby. There's health tracking, so if you're running it still keeps track of your mileage, calories. And it does keep time no matter whether you're near your phone or not. It is a watch (laughter). BLOCK: As you might want a watch to do, yeah. And battery life - this is something that's been a problem for Apple before. SYDELL: It's 18 hours, so you can use it all day, but you'll be charging it a lot every day. BLOCK: And, you know, it's a watch, Laura. I mean, as big as the face might be, it's a pretty small thing. I mean, what about visibility and actual usability of something that's this small? SYDELL: Well, I think in this case, you know, it - I tried it and I did find it was fairly easy to just tap on it and use it and swipe. And the little tiny button on the side they're using to scroll with, so the normal way you would use a watch, they've made that even more convenient. So it was surprisingly convenient to me. BLOCK: OK, NPR's Laura Sydell on today's launch of the Apple Watch. Laura, thanks. SYDELL: You're welcome.

BLOCK: Well, Laura, it's interesting because other companies have had smartwatches out for a few years. They haven't sold very well. Why does Apple think that theirs will be any different? SYDELL: Well, first there's the fashion part. I mean, Apple - it's Apple. It's elegant and they're good at that. There are a lot of apps they have that you might not find on other phones. You can look at Instagram photos on it. You could make phone calls and talk into your watch. You can pay with your watch. You can check in at the airport with it and you can do things like use it as a key for a hotel room. So I guess they are betting that it's going to be very convenient for those things. BLOCK: You do need to have an iPhone, right, to use the Apple watch. SYDELL: You do, and that's part of what may indeed make many people wonder why do I want one? Apple is betting that it's going to be a lot more convenient to just use the watch than to reach into the pocket and grab your phone. And they are thinking this matters enough to people that they're willing to throw some money at it. There are a couple of things it does without a phone nearby. There's health tracking, so if you're running it still keeps track of your mileage, calories. And it does keep time no matter whether you're near your phone or not. It is a watch (laughter). BLOCK: As you might want a watch to do, yeah. And battery life - this is something that's been a problem for Apple before. SYDELL: It's 18 hours, so you can use it all day, but you'll be charging it a lot every day. BLOCK: And, you know, it's a watch, Laura. I mean, as big as the face might be, it's a pretty small thing. I mean, what about visibility and actual usability of something that's this small? SYDELL: Well, I think in this case, you know, it - I tried it and I did find it was fairly easy to just tap on it and use it and swipe. And the little tiny button on the side they're using to scroll with, so the normal way you would use a watch, they've made that even more convenient. So it was surprisingly convenient to me. BLOCK: OK, NPR's Laura Sydell on today's launch of the Apple Watch. Laura, thanks. SYDELL: You're welcome.", "section": "Technology", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2015 NPR.  All rights reserved.

E-books have been plowing their way through the publishing industry like a big, noisy steam engine, but audiobooks have been chugging along in the background like The Little Engine That Could. NPR's Lynn Neary reports this overlooked part of the business is growing at a rapid pace. LYNN NEARY, BYLINE: Robin Whitten, editor and founder of Audiophile magazine, began writing about audiobooks in 1992. Back then, few had ever heard of them. Now it's a billion-dollar industry with more than 35,000 titles published in 2013. Whitten says audiobooks really took off once it became possible to listen to them on a variety of devices. ROBIN WHITTEN: You suddenly have a complete recorded file from the first words of a book to the end, and you're not fumbling around looking for disc four in the middle of some really important scene. And that made a big difference. It made audiobooks much more user-friendly. NEARY: But it's not just technology that's luring more listeners to audiobooks. The industry has always drawn on a large pool of professional actors as narrators, but these days, producers are signing on more and more celebrities. That's because the narrator is key to the success of an audiobook. DON KATZ: There's this almost seductive intimacy of this private performance and the power of it. NEARY: Don Katz is the CEO and founder of Audible, the largest producer and seller of audiobooks. KATZ: So many of the customers become aficionados of the narration itself. Many of them buy based on the narrator. They'll literally listen to anything a specific actor reads simply because they like their styles. NEARY: Audible has hired such well-known actors as Colin Firth, Anne Hathaway and Nicole Kidman to narrate its books. Katz acknowledges they can be expensive, but he believes they're worth the investment. Jake Gyllenhaal's version of \"The Great Gatsby\" was a huge bestseller for Audible. (SOUNDBITE OF AUDIOBOOK, \"THE GREAT GATBSY\")JAKE GYLLENHAL: (Reading) He stretched out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way. And far as I was from him, I could've sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily, I glanced seaward and distinguished nothing except a single green light - minute and far away. NEARY: Now Audible, which is owned by Amazon, is starting to ask well-known writers to create original audio works - Don Katz. KATZ: While performances are being elevated and attuned to this advanced listening experience, why not write to the form in an original way? So it's not just book authors. TV writers, movie writers, others are kind of flocking in to help us get to the next stage, which is, really, what is the from-the-ground-up creativity that is right for this emergent private listening aesthetic? NEARY: One writer who heeded the call to audio storytelling is Philip Pullman. PHILIP PULLMAN: I love this - the fact that we're taking part in a little ritual or habit that goes back thousands and thousands and thousands of years, before the first mark was ever made on a stone or a clay tablet. Long before writing, people were telling each other stories, and the audiobook goes all the way back to that, and I love it. NEARY: Pullman is best known for the trilogy, \"His Dark Matrials,\" and the short story he created for Audible is drawn from that world. \"The Collectors,\" narrated by actor Bill Nighy, begins with two men discussing a woman who is depicted in a newly-discovered painting. (SOUNDBITE OF AUDIOBOOK, \"THE COLLECTORS\")BILL NIGHY: (Reading) One moment she looks cold, disdainful, contemptuous even, and then the next, on fire with a sort of lost and hopeless and yet somehow very sexy yearning - a very strong picture. NEARY: Pullman says it wasn't any different writing for audio than print, because he always writes for the ear. PULLMAN: I'm thinking very hard about the rhythm of each sentence as I write it. I do speak the words aloud, so I hear that they fit together in a kind of rhythmic, musical sense - that sort of thing. So I suppose I am thinking in terms of reading aloud, even though I'm not - not at that point intending to make it specifically an audiobook. NEARY: Audible now has about 30 original audio works in the pipeline. One which has already been released is \"The Starling Project,\" starring Alfred Molina. It was written by best-selling author Jeffrey Deaver, and it's more like a radio drama than a book. (SOUNDBITE OF AUDIOBOOK, \"THE STARLING PROJECT\")ALFRED MOLINA: Knocked vehicles off the highway heading up the side drive. They're not sightseeing. There's nothing here. Except us. Ready weapons. Mustafa, any chatter? Negative. Get on the glasses, Devin. What do you see? Two - jeep in lead and truck behind. Oh, man, boss. What? Federales. NEARY: Radio drama, original stories, even podcasts are now all part of the audio scene, says Michele Cobb, president of the Audio Publishers Association. She says it's still a small part of the industry, but she's excited to see where it's headed. MICHELE COBB: Because it can interest people who might not listen to a book but might be interested in a different type of program. So I think there - there becomes just a wider range of opportunities when we we're recording more and when more people are listening to be a little bit more experimental. NEARY: One of the advantages of audiobooks is that you can listen anywhere, anytime - while driving, exercising, cooking. But if you just want to sit still and listen to someone tell you a story, you can do that too. Lynn Neary, NPR News, Washington.

The Inspector General's report says of the one billion emails sent in 2011, just over 61,000 were saved. Meanwhile, NPR's Brian Naylor says a number of Clinton's assertions during her news conference are raising eyebrows. BRIAN NAYLOR, BYLINE: Hillary Clinton admitted her decision to carry one smart phone device rather than two during her tenure as Secretary of State might have been a mistake. Apart from that though, Clinton maintained her conduct regarding her email was by the book. Others aren't so sure. Take this statement. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)HILLARY CLINTON: The laws and regulations in effect when I was Secretary of State allowed me to use my email for work. That is undisputed. TOM BLANTON: No. NAYLOR: Tom Blanton is director of the National Security Archive at George Washington University in Washington. BLANTON: The laws and regulations in effect discouraged the use of personal email for official business. NAYLOR: Blanton says the law in question is the Federal Records Act of 2009. Clinton became Secretary of State earlier that year. The records act did not prohibit use of personal email accounts, he says, but its language is clear. BLANTON: It says the head of every federal agency - and that's who she was as secretary of state - is responsible for making sure that records of that agency's business are saved in agency records systems. NAYLOR: Blanton says that does not include a server in Clinton's Chappaqua, N. Y. home. Here's another assertion Clinton made. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CLINTON: For any government employee, it is that government employee's responsibility to determine what's personal and what's work-related. NAYLOR: Blanton says Clinton did indeed have the right to separate out her personal emails from official records. But he said had those emails been in a government server, it would have been a more transparent process. BLANTON: If those emails were in the State Department system, that separation of personal or non-record material from the official stuff would be done by a professional records manager or a professional archivist - a civil servant, not an aspiring politician and her lawyers. NAYLOR: Republicans in Congress agree and have called for Clinton to turn over the servers or allow a third-party to review their contents. Clinton also said she did facilitate backup of her emails. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CLINTON: And it was my practice to communicate with State Department and other government officials on their . gov accounts so those emails would be automatically saved in the State Department system to meet recordkeeping requirements and that indeed is what happened. NAYLOR: But Blanton says that's really not enough to ensure a complete record of Clinton's official government communications. BLANTON: Just because she sent it to people at state . gov addresses is not at all a guarantee that it's been preserved. And I understand at the State Department particularly when an official leaves office and most of her direct aids, in fact, have left the State Department, within 90 days, the IT folks at State wipeout their account unless there's a special intervention. NAYLOR: In fact, the State Department Inspector General's report today says employees have not received adequate training or guidance in preserving official emails - resulting in just a fraction of them being preserved. Blanton says the kerfuffle over Clinton's emails is less a scandal than a wake-up call. Because Clinton and other top government officials have used private email accounts, he says a whole generation of official records has been lost. Brian Naylor, NPR News, Washington.

Americans send more than 6 billion texts every day, so it's no wonder that incidents of text regret are on the rise. A number of smartphone apps are helping us cover our tracks. But as Rebecca Sheir of member station WAMU reports, the most effective tool in warding off text regret might be ourselves. REBECCA SHEIR, BYLINE: Shuo Song was visiting Chicago for one night for work and had plans to meet up with a friend. He was exhausted when he got to town, so he canceled. But then he took himself out for ramen. SHUO SONG: And then the next day she texts me and she says, oh, hey, how was your night? And without even thinking, I said, oh, hey it was great. I had a great bowl of ramen at this restaurant. And that was definitely a text that I would like back. SHEIR: Liz Odar knows that feeling well. She lives in Arlington, Va. , where the winter has been particularly brutal. So when her mom texted from Florida, with a photo of seagulls flocking on a sunny sandy beach, Liz snapped. LIZ ODAR: I walked to my front door, and I flipped off the snow and the cold air, and took a picture of it. SHEIR: She texted her mom the picture along with the words here's a bird of my own. ODAR: Almost immediately, like, after I hit send I thought, oh, no. Is my mom going to think that I'm flipping her off? Like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. SHEIR: Speaking of moms, here's what happened to Antoine Lovelace, in Atlanta, Ga. ANTOINE LOVELACE: I was talking about my mother in a text message and actually sent the text message to my mom. SHEIR: But here's the thing - Antoine was able to take his text back. He uses an app called On Second Thought, which gives you up to 60 seconds to un-send a message. That's different from apps like TigerText or Strings, where you can erase a message once it goes out. Strings creators claim once you delete a text, it's truly gone, not stored on a cloud server somewhere. But with On Second Thought, your message never even leaves your phone, which may sound great, but. . . ALLISON DRUIN: It is a crutch. SHEIR: That's Allison Druin of the University of Maryland's College of Information Studies. She worries we'll become too reliant on apps like On Second Thought. DRUIN: Instead of stopping people from doing the wrong thing, how can we help people learn to communicate in more appropriate ways? SHEIR: One way is by thinking more carefully about what we put out there and how quickly we do it. DRUIN: We have tools that let us instantly send things, tell things, we never could in the past. So as I get older, I don't get wiser. I get more cautious. SHEIR: That means resisting the urge to over-share, which she believes more and more of us are falling victim to. DRUIN: It's just like being a kid and knowing that I drew this, but it's really not real until I put it on the refrigerator. And when mom puts it on the refrigerator, it's real. SHEIR: Shuo Song, our ramen-loving text regretter, agrees, not that he doesn't think an app like On Second Thought could be helpful. SONG: But I think a better exercise might be to just force yourself to think twice before hitting send. Having those moments where you are confronted with something that you don't feel proud of can be healthy in small doses. SHEIR: And he should know.

A lot of us have pet peeves about language, but we usually just grumble about them. Our linguist Geoff Nunberg tells us about one Wikipedia editor who has decided to do something about his. He spent the last eight years eliminating the phrase, comprised of, from thousands of Wikipedia entries. GEOFF NUNBERG, BYLINE: I think of English usage as one of those subjects like cocktails or the British royal family. A lot of people take a passing interest in it, but you never know who's going to turn out to be a true believer, the kind of person who complains about the grammar errors on restaurant menus. Waiter, there's a split infinitive in my soup. For single-minded devotion to grammatical rectitude, you'd be hard-pressed to match a Wikipedia editor named Bryan Henderson, who goes by the username of Giraffedata. He was the subject of a piece by Andrew McMillan in the long-form site Medium that provoked a lot of debate. Giraffedata has a single bee in his bonnet - the phrase comprised of. He has written a 6,000-word essay on his Wikipedia user page explaining why he thinks it's an egregious error. And to drive home his point, he's made 47,000 edits over the last eight years, most of them aimed at purging the phrase wherever it occurs on the Wikipedia site. And to drive home his point he has made 47,000 edits over the last eight years most of them aimed at hurting the phrase wherever it occurs on the Wikipedia site. He doesn't show it any mercy even when it appears in a quotation - in his view, it's a kindness to writers not to quote their mistakes. Now, if you're like me and don't see anything wrong with the sentence the book is comprised of three chapters, you can rest assured that we're in good company. The phrase comprised of goes back 300 years. It turns up in Anthony Trollope, in Christopher Hitchens and Norman Mailer, in the essays of Lionel Trilling and Harold Bloom. Merriam-Webster's OK with it, and so are more than two-thirds of the eminent writers and editors on the American Heritage usage panel, who aren't generally a very loosey-goosey crowd. But that respectable pedigree hasn't deterred some modern usage commentators who have decided that comprised of is illogical. That's the argument Giraffedata has picked up on. As the theory goes, the book is comprised of three chapters can't mean the same thing as the book comprises three chapters. Comprised of is a passive form of the verb, they say, which reverses the role of the subject and object. On their view, saying the book is comprised of three chapters is like saying it's contained of three chapters or it's consisted of three chapters. It shouldn't make any sense at all. If I can get a little down and dweeby myself, I don't personally find that argument very persuasive. Whatever Mrs. Plotkin told us in ninth grade, comprised of isn't really a passive. It's one of a bunch of curious adjective phrases like descended from, avenged of and possessed of. She's possessed of a mischievous spirit - that doesn't mean the spirit possesses her. The English language usually knows what it's doing, even if it doesn't always seem as tidy as we'd like it to be. But right or wrong, the idea that comprised of is illogical has become one of those nuggets of English word-lore that are just obscure enough so that people can take personal ownership of them - not pet peeves, exactly, but proprietary ones. It gives you the gratifying feeling of being alert to an error that has escaped the notice of other English speakers since the age when Jonathan Swift was walking the earth. Well, we all have our little fetishes. What makes Giraffedata remarkable is that he's acted his out on such a wide canvas. He's not just engaging in sporadic acts of resistance, like the people who scratch out misplaced apostrophes on the signs over the vegetable bins at Piggly Wiggly. He's waging total jihad against comprised of across 5 million English language Wikipedia articles. And he's vowed not to stop until he's driven it into the sea. But it's striking that Giraffedata has been able to bring this off in the collaborative environment of Wikipedia. After all, what one Wikipedian can delete, another Wikipedian can restore. That's what's supposed to keep the whole enterprise from going off the rails. But even the editors who disagree with him about comprised of are evidently resigned to letting him have his way. Nobody's about to be as zealous about hanging on to the phrase as Giraffedata is about getting rid of it. And after all, it's not as if eliminating it does any real harm. But it does show how the Wikipedia system sometimes puts it at the mercy of the dogged true believers. Not when it comes to the serious stuff - 9/11 truthers and anti-vaccinationists don't get very far. But you can pretty much have the run of the place if you dedicate yourself to some crotchet that nobody cares about remotely as much as you do. And for those purposes, the obscure quirks of English grammar are ideal. This isn't just about Wikipedia. Giraffedata's jihad is only an exaggerated example of what I think of as the pedant's veto. It doesn't matter if you consider a word to be correct English. If some sticklers insist that it's an error, the dictionaries and style manuals are going to counsel you to steer clear of it to avoid criticism. That can be the prudent course, especially in an age when email and Web comment threads make things easy for what William Safire used to call the gotcha gang. It's annoying to have to pass over a perfectly good word just because somebody has a bone to pick with it, but who wants to start with these people? But understand this, every time we avoid saying comprised of, the pedants win. GROSS: Geoff Nunberg is a linguist who teaches at the University of California, Berkeley School of Information.

That incident and others have led to calls for the use of body cameras that would record police encounters with the public. The Denver Police Department has been trying them out. NOELLE PHILLIPS: They're fairly small, maybe look like a pencil. And they can be clipped onto the chest, or they can be clipped onto the glasses. And then they wear, like, a little iPod-sized box with an on-and-off button that they can push. RATH: That's Noelle Phillips of the Denver Post. After a six month pilot program, 800 Denver cops will start wearing body cameras later this year. Officers are supposed to start recording as soon as they respond to a call or enter a scene. But Phillips says that a report by an independent monitor found that in many cases involving the use of force, the cameras weren't rolling. PHILLIPS: About only 1 in 4 use-of-force incidents were actually recorded by the body cameras. And he was counting the actual punch, baton strike, spraying with mace, Taser shocks. And he said a lot of them were missed because either the people involved weren't assigned cameras, like sergeants or cops working off-duty security at bars. There was also officers forgot to turn them on or said the situation deteriorated too quickly and we didn't have time. Or there was a technical malfunction, and the thing just wasn't working. RATH: So that sounds kind of spotty. What was the Denver Police Department's response? PHILLIPS: They've objected to the monitor's findings. They've said his evaluation was outside the scope of their pilot project. It wasn't fair to count uses of force involving people who were not assigned the cameras. And they offered a much higher percentage of incidents that were recorded. RATH: And a number of these incidents involved off-duty police officers. Could you explain that? PHILLIPS: So this happens in a lot of police departments across the country. Parades, special events, bars, liquor stores hire police officers to work security for them. But while the officers are working, they're wearing their uniforms. They're bound by the department's policies and practices. They really still represent the police department even though they're not at that point working in official police assignment. RATH: Are they required to use the camera then when they're in those off-duty situations? PHILLIPS: During the pilot project, off-duty officers did not wear the cameras. Going forward, we don't know how they're going to issue these cameras and use them. It's something for the city to talk about. Later this year, they're going to field about 800 body cameras for a force that has about 1,400 officers. RATH: And for the incidents that were recorded, were there any use-of-force incidents that were investigated using video from body cameras? PHILLIPS: Yeah. I wrote about one that involved some kind of disturbance on the Denver 16th Street Mall. It's a long strip with a bunch of shops and restaurants and nightclubs. So there's a fight in daylight. Seven officers went. And the suspect started kicking at officers while he was handcuffed. And one officer used his knee to pin the guy by the neck. That's against department policy. So the Police Department reviewed that and decided yes, that was excessive force. It was inappropriate, and the officer was suspended for four days. Now, during that incident, there were seven officers who responded, but only three captured the actual use of force with their cameras. RATH: So Noelle, there have been similar kinds of findings about police body cameras in other cities - Rialto, Calif. , New Orleans. Do you have a sense that there are things that are going to change or lessons for police departments going forward? PHILLIPS: Absolutely. The independent monitor said from the beginning that he wanted to evaluate this and take a look at it as the policy is being developed so that it can be the best that it can be rather than letting it go for a year and saying, oh, whoops, we found all these problems. This is important. Police departments all over the country are saying we're going to use body cameras - that they will tell us what happens when things go south and things turn violent with officers in the general public. So lots of groups are saying, hey, let's consider all these recommendations. How does the technology work? And make it the best that it can be.

Last week, the parent company of Wikipedia filed suit against the NSA, claiming their use of upstream surveillance violates the Fourth Amendment. Here's an example of what they're talking about. STEPHEN VLADECK: If you send an email or if you make a phone call through Skype or some other Internet protocol to a friend in another country or even to someone within the U. S. where it goes through another country's server, that's the kind of content that upstream allows the government to collect. RATH: That's Steve Vladeck. He's a professor at the American University Washington College of Law. He says the Wikipedia lawsuit is different from the other cases challenging the NSA. VLADECK: Under upstream, what the NSA is apparently doing, is they're tapping the backbone of the Internet. In effect, if we think of the Internet as a highway, they're on the highway and intercepting traffic as it crosses the highway. And in critical distinction to the programs we've learned about already to the programs that are already being challenged, part of what the NSA is collecting through upstream is content - that is to say, the content of phone calls, the content of emails - and not just the metadata that has been at the heart of, for example, the telephone bulk phone records program. RATH: But, you know, the NSA's mission is to collect intelligence and especially and in particular, you know, overseas intelligence. How does this go against the NSA's mission? VLADECK: Well, so that's - I mean, the real tension here is between, on the one hand, the concededly valid mission of the NSA to collect meaningful, true foreign intelligence surveillance information and on the other hand, the settled expectation of privacy that U. S. citizens everywhere and that non-citizens lawfully present in the United States have in the content of their communications. It's not the case that just because the NSA says it might be relevant to foreign intelligence surveillance that we lose that expectation of privacy. And indeed, the courts have yet to sort out how this kind of bulk collection of content, as opposed to metadata, interacts, intersects with the Fourth Amendment. That's the elephant in the room. That's the question that this lawsuit is trying to provoke the federal courts to answer. RATH: In his op-ed in The New York Times, Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales talked about being especially concerned about Wikipedia contributors who live in countries with oppressive governments. And he cites as example, you know, someone who's contributing in Egypt. And the U. S. and Egypt share intelligence. So that could put that person in danger potentially. But how does someone in Egypt have those protections of the Fourth Amendment? Even if the Patriot Act expired, wouldn't that Egyptian person just be out of luck? VLADECK: The Supreme Court has held that non-citizens outside the United States don't have Fourth Amendment rights. But critically, there might still be policy implications for why it's unwise for us to be collecting this information in bulk. And perhaps even more importantly, upstream is not just about collecting the information of Egyptian citizens living in Egypt. We know now that the government is collecting tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of communications of U. S. persons, of individuals who are unquestionably protected by the Fourth Amendment. And I think that's why we're seeing this lawsuit getting so much attention. RATH: Now, the revelation about this kind of surveillance came out of documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden back in 2013. Why is a lawsuit happening now? VLADECK: I think it took a little longer for folks to fully appreciate what the upstream program was, how it's different from PRISM and the unique privacy interests that it implicates as distinct from these other programs. And I think it was only as we learned more that we fully began to understand just how pervasive upstream collection was and just how fundamentally different it was, insofar as it meant the government was acquiring the content of our communications, and not just the details about who we called and how long we spoke for and where we were when we made that phone call.

Ellen Pao is seeking $16 million in lost wages and future earnings from her former employer. She took the witness stand last week and said she was passed over for a promotion because she's a woman and was later fired for complaining. Closing arguments are expected in the next week or two. From member station KALW, Audrey Dilling reports. AUDREY DILLING, BYLINE: Ellen Pao worked for Kleiner Perkins, the venture firm that funded Google and Amazon. Pao was fired in 2012. The company says it let her go because she didn't have what it takes. In court, Pao's attorneys have presented performance reviews that describe Pao as too quiet, too aggressive and lacking people skills. They've also shown the jury reviews of male colleagues who received similar feedback, but the male colleagues were promoted. JOAN WILLIAMS: What Ellen Pao is saying is that she got caught between being seen as too masculine to be likable or too feminine to be competent. DILLING: Joan Williams is a professor at University of California, Hastings College of the Law. She specializes in women's issues in the workplace. WILLIAMS: So, you know, I don't know Ellen Pao - maybe she's impossible. But yes, this does track a common pattern of gender bias. DILLING: Williams says this is especially common in two industries. WILLIAMS: Tech and finance, and that's the particular microclimate we're dealing with here. DILLING: It's a microclimate where Ellen Pao says women at her Silicon Valley venture firm were treated differently. They were excluded from all-male events, she says in court filings, and denied seats on company boards. And she says the company failed to do anything about the retaliation of a male coworker she had an affair with. As for that behavior, Williams says. . . WILLIAMS: That's old-fashioned stuff. Now, they - again, they deny it. DILLING: Kleiner Perkins actually has more female partners than the average venture firm. Kleiner executive John Doerr testified in court that he thinks companies with women make better decisions. No representative of the company would speak for this story. Phil Sanderson chairs the Western Association of Venture Capitalists. He says a successful investor is good at two things. PHIL SANDERSON: Bringing in leads, investing in them and making money. And the second is working well in a collaborative environment with your partners. DILLING: The venture firm claims Ellen Pao couldn't do that. KAY LUCAS: These are really top people - men and women. DILLING: Kay Lucas is an employment attorney in San Francisco. LUCAS: I know - I have known some of them. I think this particular industry is such a highly competitive industry. Frankly, I think a whole bunch of them are probably difficult people. DILLING: Lucas has represented women with discrimination claims like Ellen Pao's. LUCAS: But I have to say, it's very often that the women are then forced to leave once they raise the issue. And this is my, frankly, great beef with Sheryl Samberg's \"Lean In\" because when they lean in, they get retaliated against, and they often are forced out of the company - maybe not terminated, but you're not a good fit or whatever. DILLING: Before Pao left Kleiner Perkins, she filed a formal gender discrimination complaint that alleged much of what she's suing the company for now. The firm hired an independent investigator to look into it. That investigator found no bias. If the jury disagrees, Pao stands to win $16 million in damages. The trial is expected to continue until late March. For NPR News, I'm Audrey Dilling. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:  A trial underway in San Francisco is offering a rare look into the world of venture capital and allegations of sex discrimination. Ellen Pao is seeking $16 million in lost wages and future earnings from her former employer. She took the witness stand last week and said she was passed over for a promotion because she's a woman and was later fired for complaining. Closing arguments are expected in the next week or two. From member station KALW, Audrey Dilling reports. AUDREY DILLING, BYLINE: Ellen Pao worked for Kleiner Perkins, the venture firm that funded Google and Amazon. Pao was fired in 2012. The company says it let her go because she didn't have what it takes. In court, Pao's attorneys have presented performance reviews that describe Pao as too quiet, too aggressive and lacking people skills. They've also shown the jury reviews of male colleagues who received similar feedback, but the male colleagues were promoted. JOAN WILLIAMS: What Ellen Pao is saying is that she got caught between being seen as too masculine to be likable or too feminine to be competent. DILLING: Joan Williams is a professor at University of California, Hastings College of the Law. She specializes in women's issues in the workplace.

And now we're doing it again - enter Apple. The company is reportedly working on a TV service with a selection of channels that could feature many of the top networks. Meg James, of the Los Angeles Times, has been looking into this. Welcome, Meg. MEG JAMES: Thank you. GONYEA: First, what have you learned about what Apple is planning? JAMES: Well, Apple is planning a new television service that would have some of the major broadcast networks - CBS, Fox and ABC. And they'd like to have their new service launch this fall in time for the rollout of the new fall season. GONYEA: What's the cost? JAMES: We really don't know the actual cost because Apple is keeping the details tight under wraps. But we think it's going to be about $30 to $40 a month for a subscription. It really depends on the number of channels and what channels that they have in their package. GONYEA: You didn't mention NBC as one of the potential networks in there. What's going on there? JAMES: That's a very interesting case. NBC is owned by the nation's largest cable operator - Comcast. And right now Comcast is trying to get federal approval for a major takeover of the second largest cable company - Time Warner Cable. And one of the reasons why some have speculated that NBC isn't involved right now is because Apple is looking to take a bite out of Comcast, you know, core business, which is offering cable TV channels. GONYEA: So cable's been feeling this pressure and this competition from all over the place for a while. But how does Apple's potential entry with its own service really change that? JAMES: The reason why so many people think that Apple might be a game changer is because of their success with all of their devices - the iPhone, the iPad, and now they're even rolling out a watch. If Apple could corner the market on delivery of TV channels then it's going to put a lot of these incumbents - like Comcast, Time Warner Cable - on their heels. They're going to have to cut their prices to try to compete with these lower-cost options that Apple and others are, you know, trying to provide. GONYEA: Again, we don't know the cost yet, but, say, the basic Apple offering here of this service is in that $30 range or so, as you mentioned. It sounds a lot cheaper than your $90 or $100 cable bill. But if you have to cobble services together, adding HBO to that and Netflix and a few other things, is it really going to be cheaper? JAMES: Well, analysts have pointed that out this week. They say that - and this actually, Don, might be the ace in the hole for the traditional players - the DirecTVs, the Comcasts and Cox. The thinking is is if you start, you know, paying $15 for HBO here, $30 or $40 to Apple there, then you have your Netflix subscription that it's going to end up costing $70 or $75, whereas these traditional providers like Comcast and Time Warner Cable also provide the high-speed Internet lines that you're still going to need. And so the thinking is is that a lot of consumers will want to write just one check rather than five different checks to all these different programmers. GONYEA: Meg James is corporate media reporter for the Los Angeles Times. Meg, thank you. JAMES: Thank you, and welcome to the brave new world of TV. GONYEA: All right.

The health insurance company based outside Seattle says hackers may have compromised 11 million customer accounts. Attacks like that are prompting some companies to buy cyber insurance, and that business is growing quickly, as we learn from reporter Kaomi Goetz. KAOMI GOETZ, BYLINE: Steve Hawkins strokes the hair of his four-year-old English Labrador. STEVE HAWKINS: Sammy, Sammy. Good girl, good girl. Who's my good girl? GOETZ: Sammy is more than a pet. She's trained to sniff out bedbugs for Hawkins' exterminator business called 5 Star Environments in Manhattan. It's one way to get an edge against competitors who don't use dogs. Another is being able to assure clients their information is safe. Hawkins learned the importance of data protection two years ago. That's when hackers got into his computer and stole his customers' credit card information. He immediately beefed up his firewalls to prevent it from happening again, but still, he worries. HAWKINS: A lot of what's going on in the news makes you think about the smaller companies like myself - protecting myself. GOETZ: One way to do that is having cyber insurance. Like most companies, Hawkins already has general liability coverage for things like workers comp and property liability, but it doesn't cover hacker attacks. Cyber insurance pays for privacy attorneys to sift through state and federal data breach laws. There also might be regulatory fines and costs for setting up call centers, credit monitoring and help with PR. But bundling that risk into a monthly premium isn't an exact science. John Farley is vice president of insurance brokerage HUB International. He says underwriters are used to large swaths of data. JOHN FARLEY: It's much different in cyber because in cyber, there's really not a lot of claims data out there. It's relatively new, and it's not readily shared. GOETZ: He says putting a price on loss of reputation, like the recent hack on Sony Pictures, is harder to quantify. Yet, that isn't stopping insurers from writing policies or companies from buying them. Insurance industry researcher Advisen says the number of premiums paid for cyber insurance was $2. 1 billion last year. That's up from 1. 8 billion in 2013. Farley says cyber insurance is booming. FARLEY: If you went back 10 years ago and asked the insurance buyer - the risk manager - at corporation, you know, what keeps you up at night? They might answer that question and say, you know, being involved in a mass tort or a big product recall where they're getting sued. Those concerns are still very valid today. But if you ask that same question - what keeps you up at night? - cyber rescue is always at the top. GOETZ: But because they are so new, cyber policies can be tricky. Ed Stroz is a former FBI agent who founded cyber security firm Stroz Friedberg in Manhattan. He says companies have to be realistic. ED STROZ: You have to look at the terms of the policy, the kind of insurance products that are out there and how well that aligns with the kind of coverage your client seeks to get. GOETZ: If companies aren't careful, their cyber insurance policy might surprise them when they need it most. Retailer Target suffered a massive data breach in late 2013. About 100 million customer accounts were compromised. That shook investor and customer confidence. The cost of breach reached $148 million by the second quarter, but its cyber insurance policy paid out only 38 million. One reason payouts sometimes fall short is an insurer might decide the company was negligent on security, even for something as simple as failing to regularly change security passwords. HAWKINS: Come on. Yeah, that's my girl. Give me a kiss. GOETZ: Steve Hawkins knows cyber insurance isn't a hundred percent guarantee, but he's willing to do whatever he can. HAWKINS: Listen, we're a small company, but we are a target. There's no question. GOETZ: And he's trying to educate other small business owners to the risk because he knows hackers are always one step ahead. For NPR News, I'm Kaomi Goetz in New York.

Millions have fled their country for safety. Many are in neighboring Turkey. NPR's Deborah Amos reports from southern Turkey, near the Syrian border, on a refugee who developed an app and a website for Syrian exiles. DEBORAH AMOS, BYLINE: When Mojahid Akil left Syria, he didn't have time to pack. But he arrived in the southern Turkish town of Gaziantep with a valuable skill. He's a computer programmer. Now his phone app helps Syrian refugees adjust to life in Turkey, where many of them don't speak the language, where the rules and the laws are overwhelming. MOJAHID AKIL: We called it Help Me. If you click on Help Me, we give you a step-by-step. AMOS: Step-by-step help to find critical services - how to find a hospital, a school or get a cell phone. Help Me is one feature of the app and website called Gherbtna, which translates to mean exile, loneliness or a feeling of foreignness in Arabic. It's exactly what refugees feel, so the site also includes information on the best place to get a meal that reminds them of home. AKIL: This is the application. AMOS: So if I want to find a restaurant that's only Syrian, this is where I look? AKIL: Yes, it's the main page now - news. . . AMOS: Yeah. AKIL: . . . And information. AMOS: So this is everything you need to know. . . AKIL: Yes. AMOS: . . . If you've just fled your country and you need to know. . . AKIL: Yes. AMOS: . . . What the rules are. AKIL: Yes, just click here. AMOS: More than 10,000 Syrians have clicked for answers to looming problems that come with an indefinite stay - how to register the birth of a child, the death of a grandparent when you're so far from home. Is there a way to legally register a marriage? AKIL: (Speaking Arabic) One, two, three, four - (speaking Arabic). AMOS: This gives me all the steps - one, two, three, four - how do I register my marriage in Turkey. Akil started building his phone app a year ago, and it was a hit as soon as he introduced it earlier this year. The Turkish government provides information for the site, and users share what they know. As the war in Syria drags on into a fifth year, refugees are forced to adjust to a long, uncertain stay. Many have avoided any interactions with the Turkish system. There was the language barrier, of course, but something else held them back, says Tamam Barrodi, a businessman from Aleppo, also a refugee. He says Syrians are afraid of their own government and so instinctively distrust officials. TAMAM BARRODI: We are all the time afraid from the rules. We are all the time afraid from the police. If we are right or wrong, we are all the time afraid from that. Let's teach them how to deal with this new situation in Turkey, in other countries. AMOS: Barrodi applauds the phone app, which helps Syrians adjust to a new culture. He heads a program that teaches business skills and civic education for refugees - high school graduates who may live in Turkey for years. BARRODI: Now they are coming to a democracy, so there is another system - how to do with the people, how to deal with the rules. AMOS: We have to help ourselves, he says, and a phone app is a start. Deborah Amos, NPR News. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  This next story is about Syrian refugees who are finding the help they need with technology. Millions have fled their country for safety. Many are in neighboring Turkey. NPR's Deborah Amos reports from southern Turkey, near the Syrian border, on a refugee who developed an app and a website for Syrian exiles. DEBORAH AMOS, BYLINE: When Mojahid Akil left Syria, he didn't have time to pack. But he arrived in the southern Turkish town of Gaziantep with a valuable skill. He's a computer programmer. Now his phone app helps Syrian refugees adjust to life in Turkey, where many of them don't speak the language, where the rules and the laws are overwhelming. MOJAHID AKIL: We called it Help Me. If you click on Help Me, we give you a step-by-step. AMOS: Step-by-step help to find critical services - how to find a hospital, a school or get a cell phone. Help Me is one feature of the app and website called Gherbtna, which translates to mean exile, loneliness or a feeling of foreignness in Arabic. It's exactly what refugees feel, so the site also includes information on the best place to get a meal that reminds them of home. AKIL: This is the application. AMOS: So if I want to find a restaurant that's only Syrian, this is where I look? AKIL: Yes, it's the main page now - news. . . AMOS: Yeah. AKIL: . . . And information. AMOS: So this is everything you need to know. . . AKIL: Yes. AMOS: . . . If you've just fled your country and you need to know. . . AKIL: Yes. AMOS: . . . What the rules are. AKIL: Yes, just click here.

I'm Guy Raz. Here's a question to start the show with. Why is it sometimes so hard to feel empathy for strangers? JEFF MOGIL: Because you're stressed by them. RAZ: You're stressed by them? MOGIL: Yeah, and I think this is something that, you know, people don't think about a lot, but it's true. RAZ: This is Jeff Mogil. He's a neuroscientist at McGill University in Canada. MOGIL: I mean, for most of the history of our species, we were living in groups of, you know, a hundred people or so, we knew all of them and we didn't have empathy for strangers. But that was fine because we barely ever saw any strangers. RAZ: Which is why today, if you take any two strangers and you put them in a room together, as Jeff did in a recent study. . . MOGIL: You know, they weren't doing anything. They weren't competing in any way. But the very fact that you took two people and stuck them in a room and closed the door increased stress levels in both of them. RAZ: It increased their heart rates and made their palms sweaty because. . . JANE MCGONIGAL: You're trying to figure out if you can trust them. You're trying to see if you have anything in common. It's harder to relate them, to talk to them when you don't have any familiarity. RAZ: This is Jane McGonigal. She's a videogame designer, and Jane told us about Jeff's study. MCGONIGAL: A great new study that just came out a couple of weeks ago. RAZ: And Jeff wanted to test out the hypothesis that being around strangers creates stress which decreases empathy. MCGONIGAL: They tested this by using your perception of pain if you both plunge your hands into a freezing cold bucket of ice water. MOGIL: For 30 seconds, and then they immediately take their hands out and they give a rating. MCGONIGAL: And they would ask you to rate how painful it was and how much pain you thought the other person was feeling. RAZ: And so Jeff gave each subject the pain test three times, once with a stranger in the room, both of them plunge their hands into the water; once alone, nobody else in the room; and then one more time, but this time with a friend and again, both of them plunge their hands into the water. MOGIL: And what we found was if they were tested across from their friend, their pain was worse than when they were tested by themselves. But if people were tested across from a stranger, their pain was the same as when they were tested by themselves. RAZ: How does that make sense? Like, you would think that if you're across from your friend, it would be OK because your friend is there and you would - it wouldn't be as painful 'cause you're both going through this thing, right? MOGIL: You would, wouldn't you? RAZ: Yeah, right. MOGIL: That's the amazing thing about it. And the only explanation is that the pain from your friend is adding to your own pain just a little bit, making your experience of your own pain worse. RAZ: This is a form of empathy called emotional contagion. And what Jeff found is that it happens between friends, but not between strangers. MOGIL: The stranger's pain doesn't affect you at all. RAZ: Wow. So we're really, like, wired not to care about strangers. MOGIL: Yeah, I mean, yes (laughter). RAZ: That sort of sucks. MOGIL: (Laughter) I guess so. RAZ: So the final question for Jeff Mogil and his researchers at McGill University was, could there be a way to reduce stress and create empathy between two strangers who had just met? MCGONIGAL: These researchers found that you can essentially reduce the level of stress that you have interacting with a stranger to nothing by playing \"Rock Band\" for 15 minutes. (SOUNDBITE OF ACDC SONG, \"BACK IN BLACK\")RAZ: \"Rock Band\" - the videogame, of course, where you play plastic instruments. MCGONIGAL: You play the drums. I play the guitar. MOGIL: They were working together for the same score. MCGONIGAL: It's a pretty cooperative game. And for 15 minutes, you play this game together. You will then test at the same level of stress as you would with one of your closest friends. RAZ: So in just 15 minutes, if you played \"Rock Band\" with just a stranger, you would start to feel empathy towards them? MOGIL: That's what we showed. So what was blocking the empathy effect in strangers was stress. And playing \"Rock Band\" together blocked the stress. Block the stress, the empathy can emerge. MCGONIGAL: You would literally feel their pain more. . . RAZ: Wow. MCGONIGAL: . . . If you had played a videogame with them. RAZ: Jane McGonigal has actually done a lot of this kind of research herself. MCGONIGAL: I'm a researcher of games and how they change how we think and act in our real lives. RAZ: And Jane, like the other TED speakers on the show today, has wondered how play can make us better at other things in life, whether it can make us healthier, more creative, more social. And as we'll hear, play can mean a lot of things, like building a tree house or pulling off an elaborate prank or in Jane's case, playing video games. MCGONIGAL: I don't know about you, I'm so sick of talking about the same things when it comes to games. All the things that we worry about - our kids aren't getting enough exercise or, oh, there's so much violence in popular media. I mean, these things are all true, but at the end of the day, how does it help us take advantage of the beneficial aspects of games? It doesn't. RAZ: We'll hear more from Jane later in the show.

Some police departments across the country have already started offering up their headquarters as voluntary safe zones for Craigslist deals. Patrick Skahill from member station WNPR reports. PATRICK SKAHILL, BYLINE: Sabastian Rivera likes to ride BMX bikes. And when he's customizing his ride, he says he'll hop onto Craigslist to look for free stuff or to trade bike parts with people in his area. SABASTIAN RIVERA: So it's pretty easy as long as, like, I get the person's number or I get their Facebook, you know, another way to communicate besides Craigslist. SKAHILL: As we talk in downtown Hartford, Rivera echoes what a lot of people told me. Be cautious with anonymous online deals. Get as much information as you can about the person you're dealing with. And always meet in a public place. Now the Hartford Police Department is hoping the public's place of choice will be a parking lot right outside its headquarters. Brian Foley is chief of detectives. BRIAN FOLEY: That parking lot is under 24-hour video surveillance. It's well lit. There's cops all around this building all the time. SKAHILL: Hartford police are calling it Operation Safe Lot. And the idea is to provide the public a well-guarded space for buying and selling their stuff. Foley says it's in response to crime spikes tied to Craigslist deals in the city. And even though the parking lot is small, Foley says officers are willing to work around occasional electronic or furniture swaps happening right outside their front door. FOLEY: If it's going to prevent a robbery, if it's going to prevent a homicide, if it's going to make our citizens feel safe, you know, we can live with it. We don't want it to become a flea market out there, but certainly it hasn't been a problem. SKAHILL: In recent months, other departments around the country have been starting this up too. Boca Raton Police Chief Daniel Alexander says his department started offering up its parking lot last June. DANIEL ALEXANDER: And it's something that's positive for us to do for the community. A lot of people come down here for, you know, situations and circumstances that aren't very positive. This, to us, is a positive. SKAHILL: Since the safe lot programs are new, Alexander and other officers say it's hard to gauge yet whether or not it's working. Craigslist wouldn't answer questions about why it's now telling users to consider police parking lots for high-value exchanges. But back in downtown Hartford, Mike Loin says he thinks the company should embrace this idea for smaller transactions too. MIKE LOIN: I think it would open it up for a bigger customer base, you know, especially for someone who may be a mother or a woman or something like that who may not feel as comfortable selling or buying a product that way. SKAHILL: Going forward, the Hartford police say it hopes more stations start offering up their parking lots for all types of social media transactions - that is, of course, as long as they're legal.

SIEGEL: That's Lee Rainie, director of internet, science and technology research at the Pew Research Center. Those percentages may seem impressive, but Rainie says a large number of Americans are still offline - more than the entire population of Florida. RAINIE: Probably over 20 million people don't use the Internet at all, don't think that it's relevant to their life or would struggle to use the technology. And probably higher numbers than that don't have smartphones or other mobile-connected devices. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Lee Rainie explains that group is made up of mostly older Americans. RAINIE: Age 72 seems to be a major cut-off moment. If you're older than that, you're much less likely to have Internet access. They are less well-off. They live in lower-income households, and they have high school diplomas rather than college educations. Rural people are less likely to have broadband connections in their homes. And people who have disabilities also are less likely to use the Internet. CORNISH: He says a part of the federal stimulus program passed during the Great Recession focused on narrowing this digital gap. It's expanded Internet access in places, including libraries and recreation centers.

But St. Louis Public Radio's Veronique LaCapra tells us that a lot of what you think is getting recycled probably isn't. VERONIQUE LACAPRA, BYLINE: Remember the days when recycling meant prying the staples out of office paper, meticulously washing bottles and cans and taking everything, carefully separated, to a drop-off center? Now? (SOUNDBITE OF CANS FALLING)LACAPRA: I just toss it all into a big, blue dumpster in the alley behind my house. Single-stream has made recycling a lot easier for consumers. But then you see a garbage truck picking up recycling and wonder. . . (SOUNDBITE OF GARBAGE TRUCK)LACAPRA: . . . Is it just headed for a landfill? It turns out it's not. Single-stream recycling ends up at a place called a materials recovery facility, or MRF - as in M-R-F - for short. A MRF is part warehouse, part industrial plant. A single facility can process hundreds of tons every day, using workers and high-tech machines. Brent Batliner manages the St. Louis area recycling division of Republic Services. He's standing next to something called an optical sorter. BRENT BATLINER: This machine is like a large grocery store scanner. It's got infrared scanners that, as material passes underneath it, it will read the chemical makeup of the bottle. LACAPRA: This optical sorter is set to scan for HDPE, or number two plastic. When a milk jug or detergent bottle reaches the scanner, a row of air jets sends it flying off the conveyor and into a storage bunker 25 feet below. BATLINER: Pops it right off the belt. LACAPRA: There are more optical sorters - a machine with a magnetic belt to capture steel and one with spinning magnets that repel aluminum. But even with all that high-tech equipment, single-stream recycling is far from perfect. Batliner says some of the residential single-stream recycling here does end up at a landfill. Part of the problem is - well, you. While you pat yourself on the back for the plastic bags and greasy pizza boxes you try to recycle, the MRFs can't process them. GARY GILLIAM: People sometimes want to put a lawnmower motor in. You know, well, it's steel. But it's not what we do here. LACAPRA: That's Gary Gilliam. In his 20 years with Resource Management, which runs another St. Louis area MRF, Gilliam has seen it all. GILLIAM: One of the guys came in one day with a hand grenade. LACAPRA: It turned out to be a fake. Contamination is a bigger problem. Mixing everything together is convenient, but it leads to wet paper and bits of broken glass that can't be sorted. SUSAN COLLINS: As we often say, you can't unscramble an egg. LACAPRA: Susan Collins, who directs the Container Recycling Institute, a nonprofit research and advocacy group, says what single-stream wins in volume, it sacrifices in quality. COLLINS: In terms of preserving the quality of materials so that the maximum materials collected can actually be recycled, single-stream is one of the worst options. LACAPRA: Collins says about a quarter of single-stream recycling goes to the dump. For glass, that loss can be as high as 40 percent. Even so, in the constant tug-of-war between quality and convenience, convenience wins. And while single-stream processing increases in popularity, the trade-off is apparent. For NPR News, I'm Veronique LaCapra. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  You know, there's no question that recycling is a good thing, and taking that blue tub out to the curb is an easy way to feel good about yourself. But St. Louis Public Radio's Veronique LaCapra tells us that a lot of what you think is getting recycled probably isn't. VERONIQUE LACAPRA, BYLINE: Remember the days when recycling meant prying the staples out of office paper, meticulously washing bottles and cans and taking everything, carefully separated, to a drop-off center? Now? (SOUNDBITE OF CANS FALLING) LACAPRA: I just toss it all into a big, blue dumpster in the alley behind my house. Single-stream has made recycling a lot easier for consumers. But then you see a garbage truck picking up recycling and wonder. . . (SOUNDBITE OF GARBAGE TRUCK) LACAPRA: . . . Is it just headed for a landfill? It turns out it's not. Single-stream recycling ends up at a place called a materials recovery facility, or MRF - as in M-R-F - for short. A MRF is part warehouse, part industrial plant. A single facility can process hundreds of tons every day, using workers and high-tech machines. Brent Batliner manages the St. Louis area recycling division of Republic Services. He's standing next to something called an optical sorter. BRENT BATLINER: This machine is like a large grocery store scanner. It's got infrared scanners that, as material passes underneath it, it will read the chemical makeup of the bottle. LACAPRA: This optical sorter is set to scan for HDPE, or number two plastic. When a milk jug or detergent bottle reaches the scanner, a row of air jets sends it flying off the conveyor and into a storage bunker 25 feet below. BATLINER: Pops it right off the belt. LACAPRA: There are more optical sorters - a machine with a magnetic belt to capture steel and one with spinning magnets that repel aluminum. But even with all that high-tech equipment, single-stream recycling is far from perfect. Batliner says some of the residential single-stream recycling here does end up at a landfill.

The NSA's techniques for gathering emails and phone records have been controversial for some time. And that may be making it harder for the agency to recruit new codebreakers. NPR's Geoff Brumfiel visited the NSA to see firsthand if the agency can still draw top math and computing talent. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: Neal Ziring is a computer scientist at the NSA. And contrary to what you might believe about the NSA, it's not all supercomputers cracking codes. NEAL ZIRING: There's no such thing as a computer that can break any code. And there isn't. It's all hard work. BRUMFIEL: Work done by a lot of people - nationwide, the NSA employs roughly 35,000. And each year, it must find new recruits to keep it at the cutting edge of code making and code breaking. It gets those recruits from places like Johns Hopkins University, which is just up the road from the NSA's Maryland headquarters. Matthew Green is a professor of computer science there. He says each year, he has students going to work for the NSA. MATTHEW GREEN: Well, it ranges. Sometimes, it's a half-a-dozen. Sometimes, it's just one or two. BRUMFIEL: Johns Hopkins may be nearby, but it's not unique. The NSA recruits at hundreds of universities across the country. It's been that way for years until 2013, when Edward Snowden leaked a huge trove of top-secret NSA documents. They showed the agency had a sweeping program that's scooped up data from emails, phones and elsewhere. GREEN: Before the Snowden leaks, we all looked at the NSA as basically being, you know, a spy agency. And they did what they were supposed to do, which is they found people who are threats to national security, and they listened into their traffic. But we've learned that they're collecting this incredible amount of information. And they're not shy about doing whatever they have to do to get access to that information. BRUMFIEL: Now Green doesn't feel as friendly towards the NSA as he once did. He thinks it's important people learn about the Snowden documents. He teaches about them in his classes to students like Daniel Swann. DANIEL SWANN: I'm a fourth-year concurrent bachelors-masters student in computer science here at Hopkins. BRUMFIEL: Swann grew up not too far from the NSA in Annapolis, Md. And he's exactly the type of person they would love to have working for them. SWANN: When I was a senior in high school, I thought I would end up working for a defense contractor or the NSA itself. That was actually a big priority for me. I wrote about that in my college essay - about how serving the country was important to me - things like that. But the past couple years, (laughter) I can say that has definitely taken a different turn. BRUMFIEL: After Snowden and taking Matthew Green's class, Swann says he's changed his mind about the NSA. SWANN: I can't see myself working there in the near future, partly because of these moral reasons. BRUMFIEL: Someone like Daniel Swann is a fairly rare commodity. Hopkins is a big university. But this year, the school's Information Security Institute, which specializes in cybersecurity, will produce just 31 masters. And of those, just five are U. S. citizens, a requirement to work at the NSA. The agency must recruit hundreds of computer science and math students each year. How many like Daniel Swann are turning away because of the Snowden leaks? ZIRING: That's kind of a tricky question. BRUMFIEL: That's Neal Ziring. Ziring also helps lead academic outreach for the agency. ZIRING: When I've been out on campuses and talking to students - right? - there are some of them that - that puts them off, or it makes them have doubts. BRUMFIEL: But honestly, Ziring says there's a much bigger problem. ZIRING: I was at Dartmouth career fair a few months ago. And our table's sort of right across from Facebook. And we are looking for some of the same things that they are. BRUMFIEL: Ever since the Snowden leaks, cybersecurity has been hot in Silicon Valley. That's in part because the industry no longer trusts the government as much as it once did. Companies want to develop their own security, and they're willing to pay top dollar to get the same people the NSA is trying to recruit - students like Daniel Swann. Last summer, Microsoft paid him $7,000 a month to be an intern. They even threw in a rental car. SWANN: It was actually really nice. It was a Subaru Legacy (laughter). BRUMFIEL: The NSA's Ziring says the agency can't compete on money. So he tries to sell it in other ways. ZIRING: You know, we have good health benefits. And we're government - right? - so we have huge scope of insurance to choose from. BRUMFIEL: Can things like work-life balance and continuing education really attract young talent when the money is so good elsewhere? I put that question to one of the NSA's newest recruits. ALISA: My name is Alisa. I've been working at NSA for just under two years. BRUMFIEL: The NSA won't tell me Alisa's last name because her work is classified. But she's a mathematician in her mid-twenties. She joined right as the Snowden documents were being made public. She wrestled with whether it was the right thing to do. Her mom wanted her to go for the big bucks. ALISA: She actually kind of held a grudge for a long time that I was not getting a higher-paying job. BRUMFIEL: But Alisa came anyway. And she's glad she did. ALISA: I absolutely love what I'm doing now. BRUMFIEL: Which is classified, so she won't say anything more about it, except it's the kind of stuff she can't work on anywhere else. The NSA says that, so far, it's been able to find enough students like Alisa. But it will keep having to make the hard sell. This year alone, the agency will need to hire a total of 1,600 new recruits. Geoff Brumfiel, NPR News, Washington.

It ends in China with a crazy week-long meet up between the guy whose phone was stolen and the Chinese restaurant owner who ended up with that phone. The whole thing a viral sensation across China propagated through social media. A month ago on the program, we heard the first chapter in this story from BuzzFeed writer Matt Stopera. He joins us now for the latest wild installment. Matt, welcome back. MATT STOPERA: Thank you. BLOCK: Let's give a brief rundown of how this all started. Your phone was stolen. Eventually, you started seeing pictures on your new phone of a guy posing with an orange tree. You posted about that on BuzzFeed. Netizens in China made it their mission to track down the orange tree guy. Brother Orange is found, and then he invites you to visit, so you headed off to China a few weeks ago. You're now famous in China, right? STOPERA: It doesn't make any sense at all. So we kind of became a famous couple almost. We were riding around in cars with our faces on it. BLOCK: What do you mean with your faces on it? STOPERA: They had big decals of me and Brother Orange, a picture of us together, and so that everywhere we went, it was just - it was crazy. BLOCK: Well, you and Brother Orange had amazing adventures. You've put this all up on BuzzFeed with photographs and videos. Tell us about some of the things you did in your time in China with Brother Orange. STOPERA: I basically got to see this city - this southern Chinese city - called Meizhou where he's from, which is relatively unknown in China. But there's 4. 5 million people who live there, which makes it bigger than Los Angeles (laughter). I kind of describe it - it's like Savannah, Ga. , with, you know, the overhanging trees, but with huge lush mountains and red rocks, and it's beautiful. BLOCK: I especially love the pictures, Matt, of you and Brother Orange in the mud baths. STOPERA: (Laughter) That was this resort where they do mud baths. And, you know, we have a press pool following us, and they're just all around us taking videos and watching me and Brother Orange take a mud bath, and that was really funny. I think that that was one of the moments where me and Brother Orange actually became really close because we were both in on this crazy experience, and we were just like, I can't believe this is happening right now. BLOCK: Well, what did you get to know about Brother Orange and his family? STOPERA: Coming into this, one of the lessons I learned is never judge a man by his selfies because in his selfies he looks so serious, and in real life he was just the warmest, funniest, like, very smart guy. And he has four kids - three girls and a boy - and he has a wife, and they were all just so legitimately touching how they welcomed me into their home and into their family so quickly. BLOCK: You speak virtually no Chinese, right? Brother Orange speaks just about no English. How were you communicating? STOPERA: We had two translators, but, you know, you'd be surprised about how much nonverbal you can do with each other. You know, how much you slept. Did you sleep well? We also, in the middle of the trip, we developed this, you know, symbol where we tapped our hearts and said happy, happy, happy, happy whenever we, you know, had a moment. And so when I think about that, that's just big. BLOCK: It looks, from the way you've described it, that it was really hard to leave Brother Orange by the end of your trip. STOPERA: This is one of the hardest things for me to explain because a lot of people - did you really become friends with Brother Orange? And it's one of those things that we went through this experience together and I bring it back to a big part was this Chinese idea of fate and destiny. And you can't help but understand that and really believe in that at the end of this trip that, you know, this whole thing was kind of meant to be.

And if you're planning a trip, you'll need a place to stay. Fortunately, there are options - maybe a colonial property that takes your breath away or a little, yet comfortable house. Those are just a few of the more than 1,000 listings newly available in Cuba through the online marketplace Airbnb. To learn more about what this means, we turn to Ted Henken. He's co-author of the book \"Entrepreneurial Cuba: The Changing Policy Landscape. \" Welcome to the program. TED HENKEN: Great to be here. CORNISH: So just quickly, for folks who aren't familiar with Airbnb, it's this website where people can rent out rooms in their home or rent out their whole home to visitors. It's done over the Internet, and you search online, you book online and you also make the payments online. So, Ted, help us out. How would this work in Cuba where Internet access is very limited? HENKEN: Right, well, Cubans are actually veterans in the B'n'B part. They're not veterans, obviously, in the Air part because Internet penetration is somewhere between five and 15 percent. My understanding, however, is that Airbnb has been working on this for the past three months. They've been visiting Cuba, and they have developed workarounds and Cubans are very, very familiar with the philosophy of workarounds. So they've approached a business here in Miami where I'm talking to you from. And that business is a veteran at sending money to Cubans in Cuba, and so they're kind of going to be the middleman for Airbnb to get that money to the people on the ground. However, the person in Cuba will need access to the Internet to realize that they've got a reservation. It's going to cost those people money because people in Cuba generally don't have household Internet access. CORNISH: So tell us more about these homeowners then. I mean, who are these people? HENKEN: Well, I began researching this almost 20 years ago in the late '90s. And it was a kind of a booming business, booming idea back then because Cuba had embraced tourism after having kicked it out of the country years before. And so people from all walks of life went into this. Obviously, the unleashing of curious Americans onto Cuba is going to be welcomed by these homeowners. As you described, there are colonial palaces; there are hovels. You could find a doctor living in a hovel and you could find a taxi driver living in a colonial mansion, given the fact that the income pyramid is reversed. And people in services who deal with foreigners often make more - lots more - than people who have professional jobs working for the government. CORNISH: Now, I have a newspaper here with the Airbnb ad, and it's a full-page ad. It says one giant leap for man's kindness and on the bottom there are two flags, and it sort of looks like the moon landing. And, you know, it's Cuba. It's not the moon (laughter), right? Like, how big a deal is this really, this kind of e-commerce coming to Cuba? HENKEN: Well, it is the moon when you think about Americans' access to Cuba and, often, Cuban people's interactions with Americans. I see it as kind of a win-win-win-win, meaning that the homeowner - the Cuban - is going to be empowered by having the possibility of more income. But you also have the U. S. government trying to justify its policy by saying this is money going directly into the pockets of Cubans. It's people to people interaction between Cubans and Americans. That's happening. But Airbnb also had to get the United States government and the Cuban government kind of on board to approve this, and they're all doing it. And I think it's - one of the fruits - it's a small fruit compared to the entire embargo. But in line with other companies that have announced - credit card companies, telecom companies - you also had, just a few weeks ago, Netflix starting this business. I think both Netflix and Airbnb are doing something very smart. Internet penetration in Cuba can't get any worse, so it's only going to get better. And that's going to allow the business to scale up over the next three to five years. CORNISH: Ted Henken - he's a professor of sociology and Latin American studies at Baruch College, City University of New York. He co-wrote the book \"Entrepreneurial Cuba: The Changing Policy Landscape. \" Thanks so much for talking with us. HENKEN: Thanks for having me. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  Cuba is opening up.

It's done over the Internet, and you search online, you book online and you also make the payments online. So, Ted, help us out. How would this work in Cuba where Internet access is very limited? HENKEN: Right, well, Cubans are actually veterans in the B'n'B part. They're not veterans, obviously, in the Air part because Internet penetration is somewhere between five and 15 percent. My understanding, however, is that Airbnb has been working on this for the past three months. They've been visiting Cuba, and they have developed workarounds and Cubans are very, very familiar with the philosophy of workarounds. So they've approached a business here in Miami where I'm talking to you from. And that business is a veteran at sending money to Cubans in Cuba, and so they're kind of going to be the middleman for Airbnb to get that money to the people on the ground. However, the person in Cuba will need access to the Internet to realize that they've got a reservation. It's going to cost those people money because people in Cuba generally don't have household Internet access. CORNISH: So tell us more about these homeowners then. I mean, who are these people? HENKEN: Well, I began researching this almost 20 years ago in the late '90s. And it was a kind of a booming business, booming idea back then because Cuba had embraced tourism after having kicked it out of the country years before. And so people from all walks of life went into this. Obviously, the unleashing of curious Americans onto Cuba is going to be welcomed by these homeowners. As you described, there are colonial palaces; there are hovels. You could find a doctor living in a hovel and you could find a taxi driver living in a colonial mansion, given the fact that the income pyramid is reversed. And people in services who deal with foreigners often make more - lots more - than people who have professional jobs working for the government. CORNISH: Now, I have a newspaper here with the Airbnb ad, and it's a full-page ad. It says one giant leap for man's kindness and on the bottom there are two flags, and it sort of looks like the moon landing. And, you know, it's Cuba. It's not the moon (laughter), right? Like, how big a deal is this really, this kind of e-commerce coming to Cuba? HENKEN: Well, it is the moon when you think about Americans' access to Cuba and, often, Cuban people's interactions with Americans. I see it as kind of a win-win-win-win, meaning that the homeowner - the Cuban - is going to be empowered by having the possibility of more income. But you also have the U. S. government trying to justify its policy by saying this is money going directly into the pockets of Cubans. It's people to people interaction between Cubans and Americans. That's happening. But Airbnb also had to get the United States government and the Cuban government kind of on board to approve this, and they're all doing it. And I think it's - one of the fruits - it's a small fruit compared to the entire embargo. But in line with other companies that have announced - credit card companies, telecom companies - you also had, just a few weeks ago, Netflix starting this business. I think both Netflix and Airbnb are doing something very smart. Internet penetration in Cuba can't get any worse, so it's only going to get better. And that's going to allow the business to scale up over the next three to five years. CORNISH: Ted Henken - he's a professor of sociology and Latin American studies at Baruch College, City University of New York. He co-wrote the book \"Entrepreneurial Cuba: The Changing Policy Landscape. \" Thanks so much for talking with us.

Now the ever-present video camera is bringing celebrity status to the natural world. Grace Hood from Colorado Public Radio explains. GRACE HOOD, BYLINE: Nik Brockman is Boulder County's web specialist. He's running through the cast of characters from last season. There were two females. A second female arrived and kicked out the original female. They think she was bonded to the male who was also living there. NIK BROCKMAN: And then those two were the ones that took over the nest. HOOD: Oh, really? So there was, like, a nest takeover? BROCKMAN: So it was, yeah, it was what some people called it - the home-wrecker, the home-wrecker osprey. HOOD: A romantic slight is a storyline that's the bread-and-butter of reality TV programming. It plays well to nest cam watchers too. Since the osprey cam started four years ago, Brockman says it's become the most popular page on the County's website. So when the county's camera got zapped by lightning last year, Boulder spent thousands to reinstall it. BROCKMAN: It's a good combination of using technology to see what's going on that you might not be able to see at the ground level but also raising issues around open space and wildlife preservation. HOOD: Preservation is what drew Bob Anderson and the Raptor Resource Project into nest cams more than a decade ago. Today, the bald eagle camera he set up in Decorah, Iowa is one of the most-watched in the country. He says there's a sense of ownership for regular viewers. BOB ANDERSON: Somewhere between 50 hours and 500 hours of watching, whatever bird cam, you know, blows your dress up, it becomes your bird. HOOD: Anderson says everyone from the disabled who can't get outdoors to students in classrooms have been tuning in lately since the eaglets have appeared. He thinks what makes to the Decorah cameras so popular are the social components, an army of volunteers who post pictures and field questions. Charles Eldermire is the bird cam's project leader at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology in New York. His lab hosts 6 to 20 cameras depending on the time of the year. CHARLES ELDERMIRE: It's a relatively small investment for what might be a large amount of web traffic. HOOD: And it's not just about cameras. The feed appears on a webpage with its own timeline, frequently asked questions on the species and Facebook links. ELDERMIRE: And that gives you a great audience to then talk to about - at least for us as a nonprofit - what our mission is. HOOD: Its led to teachable moments for the lab's viewing audience around the perils of plastics for the Laysan Albatross. But Eldermire says a 24/7 live feed of wild creatures can also create awkward situations, like when one nestling is trying to kill another. ELDERMIRE: So we don't sugarcoat anything. But what we try and do is provide enough information and in an engaging enough way that people aren't surprised by what's going to happen. And they know that we are thinking of them as viewers when we're crafting the environment that they can watch it in. HOOD: Eldermire says volunteers are on-call at all hours. So if there's an event like death, viewers are notified before they load the nest cam. Back in Boulder County, the osprey nest cam has gotten another dose of drama this year. Web specialist Nik Brockman says once again, there's a home-wrecker scenario with the same two females from last season scuffling over the male and the nest.

What happens when it's your photograph that becomes the joke shared by millions of strangers? NPR's Jasmine Garsd asked one young woman, who was launched from obscurity thanks to a meme. JASMINE GARSD, BYLINE: You may never have heard of Laina Morris, but if you've spent enough time on the Internet, you've seen her picture. In it she has this discombobulated wide-eyed glare. Several years ago, that picture became an extremely popular Internet meme known as the overly attached girlfriend. It generally has a joke written on it, which goes something like this - took you 15 minutes to get home. Google Maps says it takes 12. Who is she? Or this - I was looking through your text messages earlier. Who's mom? Back in 2012, Morris found out about a Justin Bieber contest. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"BOYFRIEND\")JUSTIN BIEBER: (Singing) If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go. LAINA MORRIS: Basically, he asked people to make a parody of the song \"Boyfriend\" and make it \"Girlfriend. \" And I don't know. I just thought that it would be really funny to enter the contest, but make the song really creepy and weird (laughter). (SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO, \"JB FANVIDEO\")MORRIS: (Singing) If I was your girlfriend, I'd never let you leave without a small recording device taped under your sleeve. GARSD: It's appropriate that Morris's golden ticket into Internet stardom was Justin Bieber, who himself was discovered on YouTube. She didn't win the contest, but one of her Facebook friends uploaded a screenshot of her looking particularly menacing to reddit, a popular sharing site. Within hours, the picture had gone viral. MORRIS: The following morning, it had become the meme known as overly attached girlfriend now. It hit a million views that day. GARSD: It's impossible to know how many times the meme starring Morris has been shared. She says getting recognized on the streets was strange at first. MORRIS: You know, it was pretty exciting. It was confusing for sure, and I wasn't exactly sure what was going to happen or how it happened in the first place. GARSD: She says she doesn't like some of the jokes she's seen scrawled over her face online, but she also feels disconnected. MORRIS: To me, it's this character - this overly attached girlfriend. Yeah, it's me, but it's not really me. GARSD: Overly attached girlfriend might not be her, but Morris is definitely cashing in on her fame. She plugs brands like Audible, Autotrader and Kia. She's also appeared on Real Player's YouTube channel and Samsung's. She won't say how much she makes off of all this, but at age 23, she's been able to quit her job to focus on her YouTube channel, which has over a million followers and releases one comedy video a week, like this one spoofing people who pose as Super Bowl fans. (SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO,\"#SPORTS - SUPER BOWL\")MORRIS: I will watch the halftime show, though, because, like, if something goes wrong and I didn't tweet about it, that, like - I wouldn't even show my face in public, you know? That's just humiliating. GARSD: Morris has a face for television and the earnestness of a social media star. The videos are cute, and she says eventually she might like to become a comedian or a writer. And while the comedy greats got their start in standup, maybe YouTube is this generation's version of a dimly lit comedy club where you get your chops. Morris is actually really lucky. The Internet is filled with people who have watched helplessly as an unflattering picture or video of them goes viral. But for the time being, she says she can't complain.

In fact, this past weekend was buzzing with images of Hillary Clinton blended with Rosie the Riveter, depicted as the queen of England and shown as Miley Cyrus on a wrecking ball. In the U. S. , celebrities are fair game for this kind of mockery, but not so in Russia these days. Censors there have said that it is illegal to use celebrity photos in a meme when the image has nothing to do with the celebrity's personality. And, of course, memes have already popped up, mocking that policy. With us to explain it all is Kevin Rothrock, who wrote about the recent ruling for Global Voices and Quartz magazine. Welcome. KEVIN ROTHROCK: Thank you for having me. SIEGEL: First, tell us about the Russian case that prompted this policy. ROTHROCK: So there is this Russian musician who's well-known as this kind of crooner. He's popular among women, and he appealed to the federal censor and asked them to take to court this website that posted this meme - basically it's a very sexist obscene meme. It's anti-women, we can say, and because, essentially, his reputation as a musician is of a man who's beloved by women, who loves women and is essentially just sort of a kind guy who sings these sort of silly, silly songs. SIEGEL: He went to court to stop this. ROTHROCK: It's a very strange case because he's not actually the plaintiff. He's the third party in the case, and actually, the defendant is not the website. It is the top level domain of Tonga (ph), which is where the website is registered. So even the website is not actually technically the defendant in this case. This is just sort of a snapshot of really how the Russian legal system works. SIEGEL: And the upshot of this is an announcement of not a new law actually, but an announcement of a policy that bans certain kinds of, you would say, memes. ROTHROCK: That's right. I mean, in effect it really bans all memes using celebrities. Insofar as the language of this announcement, which was posted on VKontakte (ph) - which is the Russian equivalent of Facebook - they said that any images that use famous people's identities, or images, they're against the law if they take that image out of context of that person's reputation. And so that would, in theory, ban really any meme, I think, that uses a celebrity. It's very strange. SIEGEL: But it's very easy to find on the web pictures of a shirtless Vladimir Putin riding - and then take your pick - a cow, a shark. My favorite - he's riding a cracker, and it's called Putin on the Ritz. All of that, in theory, would be illegal. ROTHROCK: Well, right now in practice and in theory, the only thing that is illegal is the single meme that affects this one musician. But given Russia's track record for taking laws, taking court decisions, out of context or applying them more broadly than it was initially intended, I think it's fair to speculate that politicians could eventually become affected by this, or memes about politicians could become fair game, I think. SIEGEL: Is this an enforceable policy, given the technology and the global nature of the web? ROTHROCK: Just like I would say the vast majority of Russian laws against anything on the Internet, this law - or this decision is totally unenforceable. The entire point is not to purge the Internet of bad things. It's to make people online afraid of getting in trouble. SIEGEL: I believe almost instantly there were new memes popping up the Russians could see online after this - after this policy was announced. ROTHROCK: There were, and, in fact, the other thing is that the meme that's at the center of this story is actually six or seven years old. And so some of the speculation about this particular case is that the musician who brought the suit through the censor is in fact just sort of seeking publicity for his new album.

The European Union accuses the tech giant of abusing its power to stifle competition. Google has managed to avoid these kinds of charges in the U. S. Regulators in Europe have been investigating the company for nearly five years. Some in the U. S. see today's charges as European protectionism against American business. NPR's Laura Sydell reports. LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE: When you search for say, raincoats on Google, along with links and ads for big retailers like JCPenney or Walmart, there will usually be prominent sponsored links from Google Shopping. Retailers pay to be part of that listing which has ads, pictures and pricing. Margrethe Vestager, the EU Competition Commissioner, says this is unfair. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARGRETHE VESTAGER: Google's favorable treatment of its comparison shopping service - you probably know it as Google Shopping - is an abuse of Google's dominant position in general search. SYDELL: Vestager says the EU has also been hearing complaints about Google in other areas like travel. Google has its own travel service, and it appears prominently on top of the travel searches. For its part, Google says there's no evidence that it's harming competitors. In a blog post today, it noted, for example, that competing travel sites have 95 percent of the business. U. S. antitrust regulators have looked into these same issues and determined that there is no harm being done to consumers. But University of Pennsylvania Law Professor Christopher Yoo says Europe is different. CHRISTOPHER YOO: A lot of conduct that has no demonstrated harm to consumers will be subject to suit in Europe just because a company is big.

SYDELL: Economides says the biggest complaints against Google are coming from American companies, especially Microsoft, which was once itself a target of antitrust regulators in both Europe and the U.

What this means is that we're likely to be hearing a lot more in coming months about Google in Europe. Laura Sydell, NPR News. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:   Europe is taking aim at Google. The European Union accuses the tech giant of abusing its power to stifle competition. Google has managed to avoid these kinds of charges in the U. S. Regulators in Europe have been investigating the company for nearly five years. Some in the U. S. see today's charges as European protectionism against American business. NPR's Laura Sydell reports. LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE: When you search for say, raincoats on Google, along with links and ads for big retailers like JCPenney or Walmart, there will usually be prominent sponsored links from Google Shopping. Retailers pay to be part of that listing which has ads, pictures and pricing. Margrethe Vestager, the EU Competition Commissioner, says this is unfair. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARGRETHE VESTAGER: Google's favorable treatment of its comparison shopping service - you probably know it as Google Shopping - is an abuse of Google's dominant position in general search. SYDELL: Vestager says the EU has also been hearing complaints about Google in other areas like travel. Google has its own travel service, and it appears prominently on top of the travel searches. For its part, Google says there's no evidence that it's harming competitors. In a blog post today, it noted, for example, that competing travel sites have 95 percent of the business. U. S. antitrust regulators have looked into these same issues and determined that there is no harm being done to consumers. But University of Pennsylvania Law Professor Christopher Yoo says Europe is different. CHRISTOPHER YOO: A lot of conduct that has no demonstrated harm to consumers will be subject to suit in Europe just because a company is big. SYDELL: And Google is even bigger in Europe than in the U. S. Less than 70 percent of U. S. searches are done on Google, and in Europe it's more than 90 percent.

A private study that'll be released tomorrow says Iran in particular has increased the scope of its cyberattacks in the past few months. If true, Iran is doing so in the midst of delicate negotiations to curtail its nuclear program. But some are casting doubt on the study's conclusions. NPR national security correspondent David Welna has more. DAVID WELNA, BYLINE: It's titled \"The Growing Cyber Threat From Iran\" and the yet-to-be-released report's co-author is Fred Kagan. He's the director of the Critical Threats Project at the American Enterprise Institute, the hawkish Washington think tank. Kagan warns in that report that Western nations have severely underestimated Iran's capacity to wage cyber warfare. FRED KAGAN: We're seeing the Iranian capability and the scale of their attack infrastructure grow significantly over the past year. WELNA: The data for this report assessing Iran's cyber mischief was applied by Norse, an international cybersecurity firm. Sam Glines, its CEO and founder, says Norse has found that over the past year, Iran's attacks have more than doubled on the more than 8 million sensors that Norse has placed around the world that pretend to be critical industrial control systems. Glines says those attacks have not diminished during Iran's nuclear negotiations. SAM GLINES: There's been a slight increase, a slight spike in the last couple months. What we've also seen is that the distribution of the number of launch points from which the attacks are originating has increased dramatically. WELNA: Others have found exactly the opposite.

S. and foreign firms. He says even though an attack might look like it's coming from Iran, it could be coming from someplace else. JEFFREY CARR: Anyone can compromise computers based anywhere in the world, send malicious traffic from those computers and have the victim see traffic coming from countries that the attacker wants them to see it coming from. WELNA: Carr suspects the involvement of the American Enterprises Institute may explain the recent increase it reports in Iran's cyberattacks. CARR: There's a right-wing political motivation here, which is to paint Iran as a, you know, as a threat. WELNA: Carr notes that the report comes amidst sharp debate over lifting sanctions on Iran. The AEI's Kagan says there's no tie between the report and the nuclear talks. KAGAN: If we had really wanted to influence this process, we would have released a lesser product, but a more hyperbolic product, some weeks ago. WELNA: Still, Kagan says a nuclear deal could mean much more rapid growth in Iran's cyberattacks. KAGAN: We assess with a lot of confidence that if sanctions are lifted the Iranians will receive a lot more cash and access to a lot more technology, and some significant portion of that will go into their cyber programs.

The video-sharing website YouTube was founded 10 years ago. It's changed a lot since then, growing from a scrappy startup to a massive, globe-spanning news and entertainment platform. What was once a repository for \"America's Funniest Home Videos\"-style bloopers is now dominated by high-end videos produced by professionals. But as tech contributor Alexis Madrigal found, it's also a global archive of daily life, both humble and transcendent. ALEXIS MADRIGAL, BYLINE: For me, it all started with seagulls. Seagulls were the first animal that my little son began to identify in the world around him. And being over-excitable new parents, we fed his interests with delight. We showed him seagulls at the Berkeley Pier and at San Francisco's Embarcadero - dirty seagulls, majestic seagulls and seagulls that liked french fries. But then, that rare California rain came, and we were cooped up inside. He kept demanding to see seagulls, but we couldn't go out to find them. In an act of desperation, I pulled up YouTube and started searching for videos of these birds. There were thousands of results from all over the world. People from Tuscany to Tokyo to Texas all took the time to capture a few semi-precious moments with these ubiquitous birds and post them to YouTube. This felt like a new type of tourism. We could trot the globe via search term, and we found ourselves seeing not just seagulls but the world's beaches and bridges and ferries and forgotten harbors. After a few months though, seagulls lost their hold on our son's attention. Whales took center stage. And where seagull videos are humble but satisfying, whale watching videos are like watching a religious conversion. You can huff the fumes of transcendence. The reactions that people have to seeing a whale nearby are astonishingly similar. The person holding the camera shakily tends to scream and then exclaim, oh, my or, oh, my gosh or, oh, my God. Sometimes, they laugh hysterically, as if only peals of laughter can reset their neural circuitry to normal functioning. Just listen. (SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Oh. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Oh, my God, look at that. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Get that picture. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: (Laughter). UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: Oh, my God. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #4: Oh, my goodness. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #5: Oh, oh. (APPLAUSE)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Oh, my God. MADRIGAL: YouTube turned 10 years old earlier this year. Over that decade, the Google-owned service has become the dominant video platform on the web outside of Facebook. And increasingly, the most popular videos posted on the service are made by famous musicians, professional video producers, or people who are trying to become famous musicians or professionals. Early predictions for video sharing focused on everyday people sharing home videos and a crowd of amateur teen creators making clips for fun. But YouTube increasingly looks like TV, a select handful of well-paid people making stuff for the masses. In this, YouTube tracks with most of the rest of the Internet. What was once a wild and largely amateur place has become professionalized. There is money to be made on YouTube now for traditional or self-made stars who can command attention. Companies large and small now pay more than a billion dollars per year to advertise on YouTube, according to the research firm eMarketer. The decentralizing force of cheap content creation tools has been more than countered by the centralization of distribution in the hands of big media and technology companies. As I write this, 14 of the 15 videos YouTube says are the most popular right now are made by professionals, not at-home amateurs. And let's be honest; the pros are good. And their production budgets usually yield better video than the stuff made on smartphones. But that other YouTube, the common, the weird, the snapshots of daily life - they haven't gone away, even if they have been eclipsed at the top of the rankings. And the people making videos of whales and seagulls and all the other corners of the platform are a salve for most of what ails the Internet. No one posts shaky, low-resolution footage of dirty seagulls or themselves laughing hysterically during a whale encounter to become a social media star. These videos are veritable verity. And step back, too, and look at what YouTube has become as an archive. From the humblest video of a seagull pecking Doritos to the most awe-inspiring encounters with nature's most stunning creatures, so much video gets uploaded to YouTube. Each day, YouTube estimates that 432,000 hours of video gets posted on the service. It's become a stunning record of our current civilization, global in scope but intimate and personal at the same time. Future historians could have unprecedented access to the daily lives of all kinds of people. Of course, that's if Google commits to preserving this incredible record; and that's a big if. There are reasons to believe that such a massive digital archive will not be profitable for Google to save for future generations. As my friend Dan Cohen, head of the Digital Public Library of America, likes to say, Google is not in the forever business. But we can hope they'll save the whales. And in the meantime, we can listen to the ecstasy of the whale watchers. (SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #6: Whoa. (WHALE SPRAYING WATER)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: Oh, my God.

I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, we're exploring ideas about Maslow's hierarchy of human needs, and ranked at number two, security - the second step on the pyramid. BRUCE SCHNEIER: There's no other place for it to come. Security is basic. Without security, worrying about anything else doesn't matter. RAZ: This is Bruce Schneier. SCHNEIER: Schneier rhymes with frequent flyer. I'm a security technologist. I write. I speak. I have a company. I do research. RAZ: And Bruce thinks about security in a much bigger way than just through the prism of technology. He thinks about the psychology of security and fear. SCHNEIER: If you can't trust that a hundred unrelated people could get together in a room and not kill each other, I mean, you're not going to build a society. But we do that all the time. RAZ: Right. SCHNEIER: I mean, we watch a movie. We watch a sporting event. We have dinner. That's because we generally feel secure in our society and can act that way. Security is immediate. Security is personal. Security is survival. And until that need is met, other things are less important. RAZ: But when it comes to security, Bruce says we humans, we have a problem because in the modern world, we are not good at estimating just how secure we should feel. Here's how Bruce explained it from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SCHNEIER: So security is two different things, right? It's a feeling, and it's a reality. And they're different. You could feel secure even if you're not, and you can be secure even if you don't feel it. And really, we have two separate concepts mapped onto the same word. So if you look at security from economic terms, it's a trade-off. Every time you get some security, you're always trading off something. And whether this is a personal decision, whether you're going to install a burglar alarm in your home, or a national decision, whether you're going to invade some foreign country, you're going to trade off something - either money or time, convenience, capabilities, maybe fundamental liberties. So you'd think that us, as a successful species on the planet - right? - you, me, everybody - would be really good at making these trade-offs. Yet it seems again and again that we're hopelessly bad at it, right? And I think that's a fundamentally interesting question. I'll give you the short answer. The answer is, we respond to the feeling of security and not the reality. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SCHNEIER: We estimate the probability of something by how easy it is to bring instances of it to mind. So you get to imagine how that works. If you hear a lot about tiger attacks, there must a lot of tigers around. You don't hear about lion attacks; there aren't a lot of lions around. This works until you invent newspapers because what newspapers do is they repeat, again and again, rare risks. I tell people, if it's in the news, don't worry about it because by definition, news is something that almost never happens. (LAUGHTER)SCHNEIER: Right - when something is so common it's no longer news. Car crashes, domestic violence - those are the risks you worry about. RAZ: OK, you're talking about rationality - responding to risks in a reasonable way. I mean, I get that, but like, once I had children, right, there was this feeling that would come over me - it still does pretty much every day - which is, are they OK? I mean, is everything OK? And I get that that's irrational. SCHNEIER: It is. And they are always OK. It's kind of neat. RAZ: But the thing is is that if something happened, its - I think it's, like, the fear of the possibility of something possibly happening that could possibly go wrong that could be. . . SCHNEIER: It's worst-case thinking. RAZ: Yeah. SCHNEIER: I mean, worst-case thinking I think is incredibly dangerous, incredibly damaging. But, you know, we are creative people, you know? When you ask us the worst case, we can come up with all kinds of great stories. RAZ: Yes. SCHNEIER: And all the things we watch - the movies, the TV shows - they tend to be about worst-case stuff. You know, we sort of like watching other people's disasters. I mean, we want it to become OK in the end, but you know, we don't tend to watch people's normal days where nothing happens. We watch the extremes. And then, you know, we think extremes are more normal. RAZ: But there are people who spend a good part of their lives in these extreme, insecure situations - places like war zones or, you know, places where people are competing for resources - and that becomes normal to them. So I mean, can people survive and thrive in a situation that is fundamentally insecure? SCHNEIER: People can thrive to the extent they can, but you will generally find smaller communities. You'll find shorter-range plans. You'll find less-complex systems of everything because that's all you can do. You're not going to worry about whether you're happy or not if you're constantly under the threat of attack - that until you're secure, happiness or not isn't really relevant to you. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SCHNEIER: So let me complicate things, right? I have feeling and reality. I want to add a third element. I want to add model. Right, so feeling is based on our intuition. Model is based on reason. In a modern and complex world, you need models to understand a lot of the risk we face. You know, there's no feeling about germs. You need a model to understand them. Models can come from the media, from our elected officials. Think of models of terrorism, child kidnapping, airline safety, right? So models can change, right? Models are not static. You know, an example - a great example is the risk to smoking. In the history of the past 50 years, the smoking risk shows how a model changes. It also shows how an industry fights against a model it doesn't like. I mean, really, though, information seems like our best hope. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SCHNEIER: We have the ability, as thinking human beings, to overcome our fears. RAZ: But this goes back to, as you said in your TED Talk, feeling secure rather than being secure. And isn't feeling secure - isn't it just as important? SCHNEIER: It is just as important. And this is where our brains kick in, that we are smart enough as a species to recognize that we can get over some of our primal urges. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SCHNEIER: But the goal isn't to become unfeeling Vulcans. The goal is to integrate our feeling in reality. RAZ: Bruce Schneier has written about this in a book called \"Data And Goliath. \" You can see his whole talk at ted. com. GUY RAZ, HOST:  It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz.

BRUCE SCHNEIER: There's no other place for it to come. Security is basic. Without security, worrying about anything else doesn't matter. RAZ: This is Bruce Schneier. SCHNEIER: Schneier rhymes with frequent flyer. I'm a security technologist. I write. I speak. I have a company. I do research. RAZ: And Bruce thinks about security in a much bigger way than just through the prism of technology. He thinks about the psychology of security and fear. SCHNEIER: If you can't trust that a hundred unrelated people could get together in a room and not kill each other, I mean, you're not going to build a society. But we do that all the time. RAZ: Right. SCHNEIER: I mean, we watch a movie. We watch a sporting event. We have dinner. That's because we generally feel secure in our society and can act that way. Security is immediate. Security is personal. Security is survival. And until that need is met, other things are less important. RAZ: But when it comes to security, Bruce says we humans, we have a problem because in the modern world, we are not good at estimating just how secure we should feel. Here's how Bruce explained it from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SCHNEIER: So security is two different things, right? It's a feeling, and it's a reality. And they're different. You could feel secure even if you're not, and you can be secure even if you don't feel it. And really, we have two separate concepts mapped onto the same word. So if you look at security from economic terms, it's a trade-off. Every time you get some security, you're always trading off something. And whether this is a personal decision, whether you're going to install a burglar alarm in your home, or a national decision, whether you're going to invade some foreign country, you're going to trade off something - either money or time, convenience, capabilities, maybe fundamental liberties. So you'd think that us, as a successful species on the planet - right? - you, me, everybody - would be really good at making these trade-offs. Yet it seems again and again that we're hopelessly bad at it, right? And I think that's a fundamentally interesting question. I'll give you the short answer. The answer is, we respond to the feeling of security and not the reality. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SCHNEIER: We estimate the probability of something by how easy it is to bring instances of it to mind. So you get to imagine how that works. If you hear a lot about tiger attacks, there must a lot of tigers around. You don't hear about lion attacks; there aren't a lot of lions around. This works until you invent newspapers because what newspapers do is they repeat, again and again, rare risks. I tell people, if it's in the news, don't worry about it because by definition, news is something that almost never happens. (LAUGHTER) SCHNEIER: Right - when something is so common it's no longer news. Car crashes, domestic violence - those are the risks you worry about. RAZ: OK, you're talking about rationality - responding to risks in a reasonable way. I mean, I get that, but like, once I had children, right, there was this feeling that would come over me - it still does pretty much every day - which is, are they OK? I mean, is everything OK? And I get that that's irrational. SCHNEIER: It is. And they are always OK. It's kind of neat. RAZ: But the thing is is that if something happened, its - I think it's, like, the fear of the possibility of something possibly happening that could possibly go wrong that could be. . . SCHNEIER: It's worst-case thinking. RAZ: Yeah. SCHNEIER: I mean, worst-case thinking I think is incredibly dangerous, incredibly damaging. But, you know, we are creative people, you know? When you ask us the worst case, we can come up with all kinds of great stories. RAZ: Yes. SCHNEIER: And all the things we watch - the movies, the TV shows - they tend to be about worst-case stuff. You know, we sort of like watching other people's disasters. I mean, we want it to become OK in the end, but you know, we don't tend to watch people's normal days where nothing happens. We watch the extremes. And then, you know, we think extremes are more normal. RAZ: But there are people who spend a good part of their lives in these extreme, insecure situations - places like war zones or, you know, places where people are competing for resources - and that becomes normal to them. So I mean, can people survive and thrive in a situation that is fundamentally insecure? SCHNEIER: People can thrive to the extent they can, but you will generally find smaller communities. You'll find shorter-range plans. You'll find less-complex systems of everything because that's all you can do. You're not going to worry about whether you're happy or not if you're constantly under the threat of attack - that until you're secure, happiness or not isn't really relevant to you. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SCHNEIER: So let me complicate things, right? I have feeling and reality. I want to add a third element. I want to add model. Right, so feeling is based on our intuition. Model is based on reason. In a modern and complex world, you need models to understand a lot of the risk we face. You know, there's no feeling about germs. You need a model to understand them. Models can come from the media, from our elected officials. Think of models of terrorism, child kidnapping, airline safety, right? So models can change, right? Models are not static. You know, an example - a great example is the risk to smoking. In the history of the past 50 years, the smoking risk shows how a model changes. It also shows how an industry fights against a model it doesn't like. I mean, really, though, information seems like our best hope. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SCHNEIER: We have the ability, as thinking human beings, to overcome our fears. RAZ: But this goes back to, as you said in your TED Talk, feeling secure rather than being secure. And isn't feeling secure - isn't it just as important? SCHNEIER: It is just as important. And this is where our brains kick in, that we are smart enough as a species to recognize that we can get over some of our primal urges. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SCHNEIER: But the goal isn't to become unfeeling Vulcans. The goal is to integrate our feeling in reality.

An estimated 1 million people will line the streets to watch. Thousands of police will be checking bags and monitoring the crowds, but they can't watch everyone. Bill Ridge, with the Boston Police, says that's why video surveillance is a big part of the security plan. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BILL RIDGE: We've got a lot of cameras out there. We're going to be watching, you know, the portions in Boston and particularly the routes along Boylston Street, the finish line. GREENE: That's the area where bombs were detonated two years ago. Video footage helped apprehend the terrorists, and cameras are now being installed at a feverish pace across the city. That increased surveillance, though, is worrying to some. Curt Nickisch from member station WBUR reports. CURT NICKISCH, BYLINE: On the roof of a tall office building overlooking the finish line, workers are installing a high-definition video camera. MARK SAVAGE: That's pretty much it. So we should be able to fire this up. NICKISCH: They work for Lan-Tel Communications, a Massachusetts company contracting for Boston Police and marathon organizers. ERIC NISBET: All right, yep. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Yep, we're good. NISBET: You're all green. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Yep. NICKISCH: At a satellite office at an undisclosed location, a tech worker is linking the cameras into the computer network. Project manager Eric Johnson shows me how police can remotely watch and control the cameras. ERIC JOHNSON: I'm zooming in on the infield of Fenway Park. NICKISCH: He uses a laptop to swivel and zoom an HD video camera installed on a building hundreds of yards away from the ballpark. You can see home plate. Like, I could probably tell from this camera if the pitch is low and outside. JOHNSON: Yes, you could, absolutely. NICKISCH: The same way your TV at home has gotten so much better, so have video cameras. Johnson says cheaper bandwidth and data storage make it easy to record more and better video. JOHNSON: The wow factor in 2004 was being able to see a camera on a computer. Now, a lot of the law enforcement, that factor's gone. It's like, OK, I can see the image. But what can you do for me beyond that? NICKISCH: There's a lot they can do. Boston has programmed cameras to automatically turn toward the sound of gunshots. Ideally, the software, Johnson says, could alert police when crowds form or when a certain suspect is recognized by a camera. JOHNSON: They are not in every neighborhood. But I think they should be. NICKISCH: Not everyone agrees. KADE CROCKFORD: Yeah, well, right where we're standing, we can see four separate surveillance cameras. NICKISCH: That's Kade Crockford, with the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts. And we're standing outside the Old State House. This is where, in 1761, arguments against British warrants inspired the American Revolution and the Fourth Amendment, limiting search and seizure. Crockford says she understands the need for surveillance at a big public event like the Boston Marathon. CROCKFORD: That doesn't trigger privacy concerns. What does trigger privacy concerns is the city of Boston installing a network of cameras, some in residential neighborhoods, that enable law enforcement to track individual people from the moment that we leave our homes in the morning until the moment we return at night, seeing basically everywhere we went and everything that we did. NICKISCH: Boston Police won't say how many cameras are already in the city's network or how many new ones are going up for the marathon. But some of them will stay online afterward. ED DAVIS: That picture was taken just as the first bomb went off. NICKISCH: We're in the office of Ed Davis. He was Boston's police commissioner two years ago, during the marathon bombing attacks. He says dramatic video footage was crucial to winning a guilty verdict. DAVIS: The cat's out of the bag. The video exists. The question now is, how do we protect people's rights in the everyday application of the technology that's already on the street? NICKISCH: Davis says the answer is to be vigilant. In Boston, the city that runs a marathon on Patriots' Day commemorating the opening battles of the American Revolution, the right balance between public security and personal liberty is an ongoing search.

UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: You got a gift, the kind that very few people have. RATH: Needless to say, \"Daredevil\" has quite a few blind fans, and they were very much looking forward to the show. The FCC requires broadcasters to provide audio descriptions of many shows so blind people can enjoy TV along with everyone else. But Netflix isn't a broadcaster. It's an Internet-based service. And initially, there was no word about whether they would provide audio descriptions for \"Daredevil. \" The superhero wouldn't have been able to enjoy his own show. ROBERT KINGETT: To be quite frank, I said, well, that's just utterly insane. RATH: Robert Kingett is a journalist and activist in Chicago. He's one of those blind \"Daredevil\" fans, and he also lives with cerebral palsy. When Robert heard \"Daredevil\" wouldn't have an audio description option, he started advocating online that this, of all shows, should be accessible. This week, Netflix announced they had added the option of audio descriptions for the show, the first time they've ever done that. Here's how it sounds. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"DAREDEVIL\")UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR: Matching each other kick for kick and punch for punch, Matt eventually hurls Healy into a discarded mirror in the alley. KINGETT: It was incredible. In fact, me and a quite a bit of other blindies all gathered around and had a big thing of popcorn and watched the first episode in jubilance (laughter). RATH: But Robert Kingett and other advocates are not resting. There's a ton of material online that's not accessible to the blind and people with other disabilities. And now some groups are making the legal argument that the Internet is a public space, so the rules of the 25-year-old Americans with Disabilities Act apply. Tori Ekstrand is a media law professor at the University of North Carolina and recently wrote about these issues for The Atlantic. She says two lawsuits challenged Netflix, but they turned out quite differently. TORI EKSTRAND: In the 9th Circuit, we had an unpublished ruling recently that basically handed down a decision that said there is no requirement for Netflix to provide necessarily this type of closed captioning the plaintiff was looking for in that case, because there's no connection to a physical place. In a number of other circuits, including the case that was heard in the District Court in Massachusetts, there doesn't need to be that connection. The 1st, 2nd and 7th Circuits are reading the ADA more broadly to say Congress intended for the disabled to have access to non-physical structures, like the Internet. For private entities, we're going to start to, I think, see some indication from the Department of Justice about what the expectations are. The DOJ is responsible for the administration of the ADA. Hopefully, we'll find out what they think. RATH: What about the burden this puts on businesses to do that extra coding and do some stuff that is probably going to cost them some money? EKSTRAND: So there is a burden, potentially, and an obligation. I would argue it's no different than the burden to make a building accessible, to widen doorways, to run elevators, to offer students, say, in a school setting the types of accommodations they need to succeed. You know, we faced these costs back in 1991, and we did it. We took down buildings. We retrofitted buildings. That cost money. I'm sure people who owned these buildings weren't that thrilled. We knew we had to do it, and we did do it. RATH: What about - just to push back on that a little bit, you know, one of the things that people have said is great about the Internet is, in a way, that it's place without rules. You don't have to have, you know, zoning rules. You don't have to, you know, have physical infrastructure. Anybody can get online and sell whatever they want to, and that's what's great about the Internet. EKSTRAND: If one of the beauties of the Internet is it's sort of democratizing nature, there's a whole part of society that is essentially locked out. And the reality is, people don't think this about themselves, but we are all temporarily abled (laughter). We will all face a disability at some point in our life, most likely. The numbers bear that out. And I know if that happens to me, I want to still be able to enjoy the web. And having this technology is something we should all really care about. It's not just for one segment of people or for your grandmother or for a cousin, say. This may actually happen to you. RATH: Tori Ekstrand teaches media law at Chapel Hill. Tori, thanks very much.

Just film something silly happening, post it to the Internet, all your friends would share it, and all of a sudden you're the most popular person online. Well, it's not that easy. KPCC's Jacob Margolis takes a look behind the curtains at the people who decide if a video is going to go viral. First, a heads up - there's some crude language here since crudity often defines what takes off online. JACOB MARGOLIS, BYLINE: To those who think viral fame is easy and painless, meet Jared Frank. JARED FRANK: So as far as how many views I have, its right under 37 million views right now. As to how I got kicked in the head, it's kind of a longer story. MARGOLIS: A couple of years ago when he was traveling through Peru, Frank was taking a video selfie in front of some train tracks. And he didn't realize it, but a train was coming by pretty fast. A guy leaned off the side of it and planted a boot squarely on his head. (SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO, \"KICKED IN THE HEAD BY A TRAIN\")FRANK: Wow, that guy kicked me in the head. I think I got that on film. MARGOLIS: It looks like one of those slow-motion videos of someone getting punched in the face. His entire head looks like it's wrapped around this guy's boot. FRANK: I kept it for a very long time before sharing it 'cause I was - I was going to delete it, right? As soon as it happened, I was, like, ready to just press the delete button because it was embarrassing. MARGOLIS: But that video he was mortified by, people started to watch it. And even though it only had a couple hundred views, he started to get offers from companies to buy it. He didn't know it at the time, but these companies wanted to make his video go viral. FRANK: And at first, it's one of those things where there's somebody on the Internet saying that they're going to give you money. So it's like how real can this possibly be? MARGOLIS: Real enough that he ended up signing a deal with Jukin Media. They're an online video licensing company. What do they do? Well, say you see a viral video play in an advertising campaign or on an MTV show about viral videos. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"RIDICULOUSNESS\")ROB DYRDEK: This dude - this dude driving that train is, like, enough with this selfie [expletive]. MARGOLIS: Every time these shows play clips like Frank's, they have to get permission from video owners. And if Jukin Media owns the video, they say to the shows no, you can't play it for free. Pay us $200 to a couple grand for the rights to broadcast it and Frank and Jukin can get a cut. At the same time, Jukin's always saying to shows hey, check out this clip. This is something that's going to go viral. The clips are short, but they're great fodder for commentary, so they're good for filling time, which is gold in broadcasting land. So how's Jukin finding these videos? Well, they've got a secret weapon. His uniform - a T-shirt and jeans. He's got two computer screens in front of him, and he's in the middle of a huge office packed with 20-somethings watching YouTube videos. He has a Post-it note on his computer reminding him to buy Cheez-Its. His name is Nate Granzow. NATE GRANZOW: So a kid went down the slide and pretty much went head first into the side of the slide. And it was really funny, so I'm going to accept it. MARGOLIS: All day long he goes through hundreds of different videos like this. If he likes them, Jukin will reach out to the creators and offer them a deal, but not everything meets his standards. GRANZOW: One guy tossing another guy in the air, kicks the dog, but it was kind of off camera, so - going to reject it. MARGOLIS: What whets Granzow's appetite? What makes a good viral hit? Let's ask his boss, CEO Jonathan Skogmo. JONATHAN SKOGMO: For us, it's got to be short. MARGOLIS: Ten to 120 seconds long. SKOGMO: It's got to be shareable. MARGOLIS: But part of it's just about that gut feeling. SKOGMO: We do know that a guy getting kicked in the nuts is a guy getting kicked in the nuts and that's going to hurt anywhere. MARGOLIS: It's a pretty good deal for Jukin. Someone else is creating the content, but how'd everything end up for Frank? FRANK: There isn't a single country in the whole world that hasn't viewed my video at least once, and North Korea has got three or four views. I think 3 views, which I joke with my friends that it was just, like, Kim Jong Un and, like, his two, like, lieutenants or something that watched the video or something like that. MARGOLIS: After nearly 37 million views and licensing deals around the world, he's made more than $30,000 off of the whole thing, which he says he's using for his education. And for that, he says it was worth getting his head smashed in. For NPR News, I'm Jacob Margolis in Los Angeles. LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST:  Maybe you think you could create a video that would go viral. Just film something silly happening, post it to the Internet, all your friends would share it, and all of a sudden you're the most popular person online. Well, it's not that easy. KPCC's Jacob Margolis takes a look behind the curtains at the people who decide if a video is going to go viral. First, a heads up - there's some crude language here since crudity often defines what takes off online. JACOB MARGOLIS, BYLINE: To those who think viral fame is easy and painless, meet Jared Frank. JARED FRANK: So as far as how many views I have, its right under 37 million views right now. As to how I got kicked in the head, it's kind of a longer story. MARGOLIS: A couple of years ago when he was traveling through Peru, Frank was taking a video selfie in front of some train tracks. And he didn't realize it, but a train was coming by pretty fast. A guy leaned off the side of it and planted a boot squarely on his head. (SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO, \"KICKED IN THE HEAD BY A TRAIN\") FRANK: Wow, that guy kicked me in the head. I think I got that on film. MARGOLIS: It looks like one of those slow-motion videos of someone getting punched in the face. His entire head looks like it's wrapped around this guy's boot. FRANK: I kept it for a very long time before sharing it 'cause I was - I was going to delete it, right? As soon as it happened, I was, like, ready to just press the delete button because it was embarrassing. MARGOLIS: But that video he was mortified by, people started to watch it. And even though it only had a couple hundred views, he started to get offers from companies to buy it. He didn't know it at the time, but these companies wanted to make his video go viral. FRANK: And at first, it's one of those things where there's somebody on the Internet saying that they're going to give you money. So it's like how real can this possibly be? MARGOLIS: Real enough that he ended up signing a deal with Jukin Media. They're an online video licensing company. What do they do? Well, say you see a viral video play in an advertising campaign or on an MTV show about viral videos. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"RIDICULOUSNESS\") ROB DYRDEK: This dude - this dude driving that train is, like, enough with this selfie [expletive]. MARGOLIS: Every time these shows play clips like Frank's, they have to get permission from video owners. And if Jukin Media owns the video, they say to the shows no, you can't play it for free. Pay us $200 to a couple grand for the rights to broadcast it and Frank and Jukin can get a cut. At the same time, Jukin's always saying to shows hey, check out this clip. This is something that's going to go viral. The clips are short, but they're great fodder for commentary, so they're good for filling time, which is gold in broadcasting land. So how's Jukin finding these videos? Well, they've got a secret weapon. His uniform - a T-shirt and jeans. He's got two computer screens in front of him, and he's in the middle of a huge office packed with 20-somethings watching YouTube videos. He has a Post-it note on his computer reminding him to buy Cheez-Its. His name is Nate Granzow. NATE GRANZOW: So a kid went down the slide and pretty much went head first into the side of the slide. And it was really funny, so I'm going to accept it. MARGOLIS: All day long he goes through hundreds of different videos like this. If he likes them, Jukin will reach out to the creators and offer them a deal, but not everything meets his standards. GRANZOW: One guy tossing another guy in the air, kicks the dog, but it was kind of off camera, so - going to reject it. MARGOLIS: What whets Granzow's appetite? What makes a good viral hit? Let's ask his boss, CEO Jonathan Skogmo. JONATHAN SKOGMO: For us, it's got to be short. MARGOLIS: Ten to 120 seconds long. SKOGMO: It's got to be shareable. MARGOLIS: But part of it's just about that gut feeling. SKOGMO: We do know that a guy getting kicked in the nuts is a guy getting kicked in the nuts and that's going to hurt anywhere. MARGOLIS: It's a pretty good deal for Jukin. Someone else is creating the content, but how'd everything end up for Frank? FRANK: There isn't a single country in the whole world that hasn't viewed my video at least once, and North Korea has got three or four views. I think 3 views, which I joke with my friends that it was just, like, Kim Jong Un and, like, his two, like, lieutenants or something that watched the video or something like that. MARGOLIS: After nearly 37 million views and licensing deals around the world, he's made more than $30,000 off of the whole thing, which he says he's using for his education.

On many tribal reservations, electricity of any kind is out of reach, which is why some on the Navajo Nation are turning to solar power out of necessity. Ibby Caputo reports. IBBY CAPUTO, BYLINE: Electricity can be magical. Derrick Terry remembers the first winter when there were lights on at his grandmother's house. DERRICK TERRY: And you see the Christmas lights in the distance, it's like seeing that unicorn. It's an indescribable feeling, I guess, when you first get electricity. CAPUTO: Terry grew up on the Navajo Nation, which is about the size of West Virginia and covers the corners of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. When Terry was a boy, his family used a 12-volt car battery to supply their house with power. TERRY: To run the TV. And that was only to a time that the battery got low. And then you run back outside and you start a vehicle up so it can charge back up. CAPUTO: Terry now works for the Navajo Travel Utility Authority. He says his family was not alone. TERRY: One in every 3 of us lived like that. And if we didn't, we knew our neighbor did. It's really, really common. CAPUTO: It's still common. The U. S. Department of Energy estimates 18,000 Navajo homes lack electricity. Navajo engineer Sandra Begay-Campbell runs a tribal energy program for Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, N. M. She says the main challenge to electrifying Navajo homes is the price of infrastructure. It can cost up to $50,000 to extend the electrical grid one mile. SANDRA BEGAY-CAMPBELL: If you're going to put in power poles, you're going to have to go through really hard dirt roads, a lot of rocks, maybe go over a mountain, go through a canyon. CAPUTO: Many Navajos live and graze animals in the wide-open spaces far away from the power grid. And with more than half of all Navajos living at or below the poverty line, Begay-Campbell says it's an unrealistic expense. But with the help of government grants, some Navajos have experimented with a more affordable option - solar power. U. S. veteran and Navajo Leo Thompson only lives a half mile from a power line on the Navajo Nation in Crownpoint, N. M. LEO THOMPSON: Well, I used to use a generator for electricity. And the price went up, so I decided to have solar power. CAPUTO: Thompson, who works as an electrician's assistant, pays the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority $75 a month to maintain and service his solar panel unit - a unit that costs significantly less than running a power line. Thompson says it's pretty convenient. Until recently, he stored his food in an ice chest or hung it from the eaves of his roof so it wouldn't spoil. Now he has an apartment-sized refrigerator. THOMPSON: Here's the freezer, keep food in there and the bottom has two shelves and got a tray on the bottom for it and then the door shelves. CAPUTO: His fridge is filled with meat. THOMPSON: Well, I share with my neighbor. He doesn't have a solar panel, so he keeps his food here. CAPUTO: Thompson's neighbor also comes over sometimes to listen to the radio and charge a cell phone. The Navajo Tribal Utility Authority has deployed 260 solar panel units, but there is currently no funding for more. Thompson says the only downside of the solar unit is when its batteries run out of juice. THOMPSON: Well, when it shuts off, you can't do nothing till the morning. CAPUTO: On cloudy days, or if there's too much electricity being used, the batteries can lose their charge, leading to a long, dark night. For NPR News, I'm Ibby Caputo.

ZEYNEP TUFEKCI: Let's say there's 10 of you in a room and you're all bored. and you're watching a talk, but nobody knows that everybody's bored. You know, everybody thinks, I'm the only one bored and this must be fascinating - you know, you're just kind of forcing yourself to act interested. And then somebody gets up and says, this is so boring. And everybody goes, I think so too. Right? RAZ: Right. TUFEKCI: That's what social media does. It can create a synchronized moment where everybody gets together. RAZ: This is Zeynep Tufekci. She studies how that dynamic happens on a global scale and how social media fuels protest movements. TUFEKCI: I find them very fascinating aspects of human societies, when a bunch of people get together and say, we'd like to change something. RAZ: In 2011, Zeynep went to Cairo's Tahrir Square to see how those protests gained steam through social media. And then in 2013, when she started hearing about protests in Istanbul, just blocks from where she was born, Zeynep knew right away. . . TUFEKCI: I have to see this thing that's happening that has never happened in Turkey, which is a spontaneous, leaderless, grassroots social media-fueled new kind of movement. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: (Shouting). RAZ: This was the Gezi Park protest in Turkey back in 2013. It originally started as a demonstration to protect a park, but then it turned into a protest against the government. TUFEKCI: Tens of thousands of people, maybe hundreds of thousands of people, just showed up. RAZ: And they created a sort of pop-up community right there in Gezi Park. TUFEKCI: They organized a food distribution. There was a soundstage. There were workshops and there was yoga, and somebody remarked to me it was almost like being retired in the world's greatest retirement community, except you got tear-gassed occasionally. RAZ: But this was all done primarily on social media at first. TUFEKCI: It's both, right? I mean, there's a lot of people who are discussing in person and then they start following each other on Twitter. The social media part is integral to it because you can do by just a few people what would've taken hundreds of people maybe, without these tools. RAZ: This is how movements start now. The Green revolution in Iran, Occupy Wall Street, the Arab Spring, all driven by the power of social media. But as technology makes organizing easier, it also raises a question. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)TUFEKCI: Why haven't successful outcomes become more likely as well? RAZ: Here's Zeynep's TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)TUFEKCI: In embracing digital platforms for activism and politics, are we overlooking some of the benefits of doing things the hard way? I believe so. I believe that the rule of thumb is easier to mobilize does not always mean easier to achieve gains. To understand this, I went back to Turkey about a year after the Gezi protests and I interviewed a range of people, from activists to politicians, from both the ruling party and the opposition party and movements. I found that the Gezi protesters were despairing. They were frustrated and they had achieved much less than what they had hoped for. This echoed what I'd been hearing around the world from many other protesters that I'm in touch with. And I've come to realize that part of the problem is that today's protests have become a bit like climbing Mount Everest with the help of 60 Sherpas, and the Internet is our Sherpa. What we're doing is taking the fast routes and not replacing the benefits of the slower work. RAZ: Like, for example, the slow painstaking work that went into building the civil rights movement - because imagine the sheer logistics that took. It didn't just start one day when Rosa Parks refused to go to the back of the bus. That moment was the culmination of a lot of planning and organizing. For one thing, Rosa Parks had been involved with the NAACP. TUFEKCI: And she wasn't the first person to refuse to go to the back of the bus. There had been many before. It's just, that was chosen by the organization as the right moment. RAZ: So how did one woman's arrest lead to a citywide protest in just a few days? TUFEKCI: To our modern, maybe 21st century eyes and ears, it might be like, I'll put it on Facebook. Well, you won't - there is none. Right? I'll put it on television. No - you will be censored. So they had about 68 organizations that already crisscrossed the town of Montgomery, which is how they got the word out. People called each other, talked to each other, distributed leaflets. Now, these people who were boycotting the buses, the black workers, they have to go to work. So they organized this massive system of carpools. So what they had to do was basically meet every day, almost, just to take care of the arduous logistics. It's not a simple undertaking. They operated a shadow bus company for a year with no budget. And that is quite impressive. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)TUFEKCI: The civil rights movement in the United States navigated a minefield of political dangers, faced repression and overcame, won major policy concessions and navigated and innovated through risks. In contrast, three years after Occupy sparked that global conversation about inequality, the policies that fuel it are still in place. Europe was also rocked by anti-austerity protests, but the continent didn't shift its direction. In embracing these technologies, are we overlooking some of the benefits of slow and sustain? RAZ: I mean, you think about the civil rights movement or the women's rights movement or the gay rights movement, and they seem so enduring. But then you think about Arab Spring or Occupy or Gezi Square, and you wonder what happened to them. TUFEKCI: They follow a different trajectory. We've seen a pattern in terms of how these movements go bust in the initial phase. All of a sudden, you go from zero to 100 miles an hour. And when the repressive forces come at you, that's the first curve that very fast car has to turn. And they've only been together 10 days. That doesn't give you enough organizational depth. It's not just about whether formal or informal. There's something that comes from working together and making decisions day in and day out over a long period of time. You know, you develop ways of trusting each other and you develop ways of decision-making together that this way of participating in movements, I think, doesn't allow them to learn how to do. RAZ: It would seem like the difference between like, the civil rights movement and these other movements is pretty clear - that it's organization, that's the difference. TUFEKCI: I would say organization is probably the key difference. To be fair of course, things are very young and we've just started and it's not like the civil rights movement found the right organizational form on day one. You know, you can use technology to do things in an ad hoc manner. Or you can use it to build long-lasting communities that know how to think together. But again, it has to be reflective and thoughtful because if you just sort of say, oh, here's my hash tag and I'm just going to sort of get something big, that doesn't lead to the next step either. The organizational question looms really large over these wave of movements. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)TUFEKCI: Movements today have to move beyond participation at great scale very fast and figure out how to think together collectively, develop strong policy proposals, create consensus, figure out the political steps and relate them to leverage because all these good intentions and bravery and sacrifice by itself are not going to be enough. To understand all this, I interviewed a top official from a ruling party in Turkey and I asked him, how do you do it? They too use digital technology extensively, so that's not it. So what's the secret? Well, he told me. He said the key is he never took sugar with his tea. I said, what has that got to do with anything? Well, he said his party starts getting ready for the next election the day after the last one, and he spends all day every day meeting with voters in their homes, in their wedding parties, circumcision ceremonies, and then he meets with his colleagues to compare notes. With that many meetings every day, with tea offered at every one of them - which he could not refuse because that'd be rude - he could not take even one cube of sugar per cup of tea because that would be many kilos of sugar, and he'd even calculate exactly how many kilos, and - that point I realized why he was speaking so fast. We had met in the afternoon. He was already way over-caffeinated. But his party won two major elections within a year of the Gezi protests, with comfortable margins. Now, to be sure, governments have different resources to bring to the table, it's not the same game. But the differences are instructive. And like all such stories, this is not a story just of technology. It's what technology allows us to do converging with what we want to do. RAZ: Do you think that humans are like, almost naturally inclined to organize, like, almost like it's part of our DNA? TUFEKCI: Yes. Yes, people I've interviewed tell me that they've never felt better in their lives than they do in the middle of that protest, in that middle of occupation. And in fact, I think that's what draws a lot of people to protests, is that in our everyday life, we're not that empowered, you know? A lot of times, our job is routine and we're told what to do. And in a protest situation, you're like, here - empower yourself and do things. And people do amazing things. The question is, how do you take that amazing energy and build a lasting organization that's not just about taking care of immediate needs, but about decision-making and staying together and navigating? RAZ: Zeynep Tufekci is a professor at UNC Chapel Hill. You can see her full talk at ted. npr. org. More ideas about organizing in a moment. I'm Guy Raz and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. GUY RAZ, HOST:  So, organization can be born out of a crisis, but sometimes, it just happens.

The Green revolution in Iran, Occupy Wall Street, the Arab Spring, all driven by the power of social media. But as technology makes organizing easier, it also raises a question. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) TUFEKCI: Why haven't successful outcomes become more likely as well? RAZ: Here's Zeynep's TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) TUFEKCI: In embracing digital platforms for activism and politics, are we overlooking some of the benefits of doing things the hard way? I believe so. I believe that the rule of thumb is easier to mobilize does not always mean easier to achieve gains. To understand this, I went back to Turkey about a year after the Gezi protests and I interviewed a range of people, from activists to politicians, from both the ruling party and the opposition party and movements. I found that the Gezi protesters were despairing. They were frustrated and they had achieved much less than what they had hoped for. This echoed what I'd been hearing around the world from many other protesters that I'm in touch with. And I've come to realize that part of the problem is that today's protests have become a bit like climbing Mount Everest with the help of 60 Sherpas, and the Internet is our Sherpa. What we're doing is taking the fast routes and not replacing the benefits of the slower work. RAZ: Like, for example, the slow painstaking work that went into building the civil rights movement - because imagine the sheer logistics that took. It didn't just start one day when Rosa Parks refused to go to the back of the bus. That moment was the culmination of a lot of planning and organizing. For one thing, Rosa Parks had been involved with the NAACP. TUFEKCI: And she wasn't the first person to refuse to go to the back of the bus. There had been many before. It's just, that was chosen by the organization as the right moment. RAZ: So how did one woman's arrest lead to a citywide protest in just a few days? TUFEKCI: To our modern, maybe 21st century eyes and ears, it might be like, I'll put it on Facebook. Well, you won't - there is none. Right? I'll put it on television. No - you will be censored. So they had about 68 organizations that already crisscrossed the town of Montgomery, which is how they got the word out. People called each other, talked to each other, distributed leaflets. Now, these people who were boycotting the buses, the black workers, they have to go to work. So they organized this massive system of carpools. So what they had to do was basically meet every day, almost, just to take care of the arduous logistics. It's not a simple undertaking. They operated a shadow bus company for a year with no budget. And that is quite impressive. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) TUFEKCI: The civil rights movement in the United States navigated a minefield of political dangers, faced repression and overcame, won major policy concessions and navigated and innovated through risks. In contrast, three years after Occupy sparked that global conversation about inequality, the policies that fuel it are still in place. Europe was also rocked by anti-austerity protests, but the continent didn't shift its direction. In embracing these technologies, are we overlooking some of the benefits of slow and sustain? RAZ: I mean, you think about the civil rights movement or the women's rights movement or the gay rights movement, and they seem so enduring. But then you think about Arab Spring or Occupy or Gezi Square, and you wonder what happened to them. TUFEKCI: They follow a different trajectory. We've seen a pattern in terms of how these movements go bust in the initial phase. All of a sudden, you go from zero to 100 miles an hour. And when the repressive forces come at you, that's the first curve that very fast car has to turn. And they've only been together 10 days. That doesn't give you enough organizational depth. It's not just about whether formal or informal. There's something that comes from working together and making decisions day in and day out over a long period of time. You know, you develop ways of trusting each other and you develop ways of decision-making together that this way of participating in movements, I think, doesn't allow them to learn how to do. RAZ: It would seem like the difference between like, the civil rights movement and these other movements is pretty clear - that it's organization, that's the difference. TUFEKCI: I would say organization is probably the key difference. To be fair of course, things are very young and we've just started and it's not like the civil rights movement found the right organizational form on day one. You know, you can use technology to do things in an ad hoc manner. Or you can use it to build long-lasting communities that know how to think together. But again, it has to be reflective and thoughtful because if you just sort of say, oh, here's my hash tag and I'm just going to sort of get something big, that doesn't lead to the next step either. The organizational question looms really large over these wave of movements. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) TUFEKCI: Movements today have to move beyond participation at great scale very fast and figure out how to think together collectively, develop strong policy proposals, create consensus, figure out the political steps and relate them to leverage because all these good intentions and bravery and sacrifice by itself are not going to be enough. To understand all this, I interviewed a top official from a ruling party in Turkey and I asked him, how do you do it? They too use digital technology extensively, so that's not it. So what's the secret? Well, he told me. He said the key is he never took sugar with his tea. I said, what has that got to do with anything? Well, he said his party starts getting ready for the next election the day after the last one, and he spends all day every day meeting with voters in their homes, in their wedding parties, circumcision ceremonies, and then he meets with his colleagues to compare notes. With that many meetings every day, with tea offered at every one of them - which he could not refuse because that'd be rude - he could not take even one cube of sugar per cup of tea because that would be many kilos of sugar, and he'd even calculate exactly how many kilos, and - that point I realized why he was speaking so fast. We had met in the afternoon. He was already way over-caffeinated. But his party won two major elections within a year of the Gezi protests, with comfortable margins. Now, to be sure, governments have different resources to bring to the table, it's not the same game. But the differences are instructive. And like all such stories, this is not a story just of technology. It's what technology allows us to do converging with what we want to do. RAZ: Do you think that humans are like, almost naturally inclined to organize, like, almost like it's part of our DNA? TUFEKCI: Yes. Yes, people I've interviewed tell me that they've never felt better in their lives than they do in the middle of that protest, in that middle of occupation. And in fact, I think that's what draws a lot of people to protests, is that in our everyday life, we're not that empowered, you know? A lot of times, our job is routine and we're told what to do. And in a protest situation, you're like, here - empower yourself and do things. And people do amazing things. The question is, how do you take that amazing energy and build a lasting organization that's not just about taking care of immediate needs, but about decision-making and staying together and navigating? RAZ: Zeynep Tufekci is a professor at UNC Chapel Hill. You can see her full talk at ted. npr. org. More ideas about organizing in a moment.

Those video recordings could in theory provide accountability and transparency. But as NPR's Richard Gonzales reports, it's also introducing the question of whether to let police see the videos they record. RICHARD GONZALES, BYLINE: Last summer, a rookie police officer in Oakland, Calif. pulled his gun on a man and his two young sons outside of a fire department station at night. The action was recorded by the cop's body camera. (SOUNDBITE OF BODY CAMERA RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED OFFICER: Put the bag down. Put your hands up. Put your hands up. Turn around. GONZALES: The cop quickly learned that the suspect wasn't a burglar but rather an off-duty firefighter. (SOUNDBITE OF BODY CAMERA RECORDING)KEITH JONES: I'm an Oakland firefighter. That's my truck right there. See the K and J in the front? See the firefighter plates? UNIDENTIFIED OFFICER: Stay right there. Don't move. GONZALES: Fortunately, the confusion was over in just a couple of minutes, as the firefighter, who is black, convinced the cop, who is white, that there was no crime. The office apologized. But like virtually any video involving police these days, the incident went viral, in part because a body camera video existed in the first place. The Oakland Police Department has been using body cameras since 2010, and they've had an impact. Cases of use of force and citizen complaints are both down says police Chief Sean Whent. The question is whether officers' reports fit what their cameras have recorded. SEAN WHENT: Our experience has been that the evidence has largely supported the actions of the police officers and shown that they were in fact behaving appropriately. GONZALES: Whent has been in Sacramento a lot lately, testifying on behalf of a hotly contested proposed law. The bill would have prevented police officers from reviewing their own recordings before giving a statement whenever they were involved in a case of the use of force. Whent says he wants to know what a cop recalls from an incident, not what the video recorded. That's important because it goes to the cop's state of mind. WHENT: And we believe that the public has more faith in the process if the officer does not watch the video prior. GONZALES: It's all about transparency, says Whent. But many law enforcement groups aren't buying that. They've rallied in opposition to the measure, saying it would undermine accurate police reports. And, they say, it presumes that the police will lie. MIKE RAINS: That's - that's absurd. GONZALES: Mike Rains is an attorney who specializes in representing police officers and their unions. RAINS: It really is the only reason for not showing an officer a video, is that, OK, we don't want you to be able to get your story straight. And it's all premised on that. It's crazy. GONZALES: Crazy or not, this debate is just one of the questions raised by cops and body cameras. Throughout the nation, policymakers are talking about rules for when a cop's camera should be turned on, where the recordings will be stored and when the video will be shared with the public, if at all. But this issue of whether a cop can see his or her video before writing a report is the most contentious, says Laurie Levenson, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. Sure, she says, there is a risk that some cops will tailor their reports based on their videos. LAURIE LEVENSON: On the other hand, it may not be possible for them to be as much as a schemer as people think they can be because you have lots of videos, not just the one that might be on the officer himself. In this day and age, we might have videos from other perspectives. And they cannot anticipate what those will show. GONZALES: Still, it appears that for now, law enforcement is winning the debate. Earlier this week, the Los Angeles Police Commission voted to allow LAPD cops to review their video before writing reports. And then yesterday, the California assembly bill was amended to give police around the state the same right, except in cities like Oakland that already limit the police.

That's why there's insurance. Now in many industries, companies reward their most loyal customers with discounts, but with car insurance the opposite can happen. You can be punished with a higher premium because you stay with your provider. Michigan Radio's Tracy Samilton tells us why. TRACY SAMILTON, BYLINE: It happens to a lot of us - no accidents, but all of a sudden, boom. Your car insurance goes up. JUSTIN MULHOLLAND: I'm Justin Mulholland. I live here in here in Whitmore Lake, and I'm a financial adviser. I own University Benefits; it's a company that manages money for people at University of Michigan. SAMILTON: Mulholland has three cars. He insured them through a company that quoted him a decent rate, but after two years, his premium jumped. You might imagine that a guy who helps people manage their money also pays attention to his own. MULHOLLAND: I got on the phone with another friend of mine who sells insurance, and he got me a deal with Cincinnati Insurance. That brought it down to what it was before, and it stayed there ever since. SAMILTON: Mulholland's lack of loyalty in the face of a premium hike means he's less likely to be snared by the practice called price optimization. BOB HUNTER: Well, it's really profit maximization. SAMILTON: Bob Hunter is a former Texas insurance commissioner who's with the Consumer Federation of America. Hunter says companies can utilize software that compiles an astonishing amount of data on your behavior. HUNTER: They have all the information on what you buy at your grocery store. How many apples? How many beers? How many, you know, steaks? They have all the information on your house. SAMILTON: Hunters says a sophisticated algorithm crunches that data and spits out an index showing just how sensitive you might be to rate hikes, whether you'll shop around for another company instead. He says you'll never see that index, but you could see an appealing loyalty discount on your premium statement. HUNTER: They'll give you a 10 percent discount for loyalty after they've raised your rate 25 percent. SAMILTON: Joel Laucher is deputy commissioner of rate regulation for California. He says there are legitimate risk-based reasons for different rates - your driving record, where you drive, if you have a garage - but how you shop, how loyal you are. . . JOEL LAUCHER: Unlike the other things, which are based on losses - loss data - this one isn't. SAMILTON: Laucher says most companies won't admit they're doing it, and it's so complicated even insurance commissioners have trouble understanding if price optimization is at work, so California recently issued a notice to insurers - kind of a firm reminder. LAUCHER: We're aware of this thing; don't do it. And they may say, oh, no, I wasn't doing it, and hopefully even if they were, they stop. SAMILTON: Only Progressive and State Farm told us they don't price optimize. Farmers Insurance emailed us, quote, \"your questions involve a complex matter in which there continues to be lack of agreement on what it really means. \" We asked Nationwide about its December 2014 letter to the Maryland Insurance Administration describing its use of price optimization.

HARTWIG: And keeping costs down for such things as churn is a completely reasonable component. SAMILTON: Churn meaning how many customers might bolt if faced with higher rates. On one point there's complete agreement between the industry and its critics. Here's Robert Hartwig again. HARTWIG: If an individual is unhappy with their insurer for any reason, they should shop. SAMILTON: And Bob Hunter of the Consumer Federation of America.

What about water production? Is there some way for us to harvest water? (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"STAR WARS: EPISODE IV - A NEW HOPE\")SHELAGH FRASER: (As Aunt Beru) Luke. . . CORNISH: There was in \"Star Wars. \" Remember Luke Skywalker worked at his uncle's moisture farm on Tatooine? They had machines that pulled water right out of the desert air. That's why Uncle Owen bought C-3PO. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"STAR WARS: EPISODE IV - A NEW HOPE\")PHIL BROWN: (As Uncle Owen). What I really need is a droid who understands the binary language of moisture vaporators. ANTHONY DANIELS: (As C-3PO) Vaporators? Sir, my first job was programming binary load lifters - very similar to your vaporators in most respects. CORNISH: Moisture vaporators - that's a science-fictional name for something that does exist. Atmospheric water generation has been used in disaster relief situations to generate lots of drinking water. Abe Scher's company sent machines to Haiti after the 2010 earthquake. He is CEO of Aqua Sciences. ABE SCHER: The user produces their own water from the supply they have above their heads. CORNISH: Scher says his method doesn't rely on condensation like some methods do, but on a chemical desiccant. SCHER: We strip the water molecules that are present in the atmosphere using natural salts. And those salts work to not only extract the water from the air, but they're a natural antiseptic, so they clean the water as well. CORNISH: We caught Scher today at the airport as he headed to California to talk with state officials about using his machines to counter the drought. He says it could be scaled up to work on a farm. Another way to harvest water from the supply of above our heads? Fog fences. BEN SPENCER: So it's almost like a large tennis net. CORNISH: That's Ben Spencer, an assistant professor at the University of Washington. And he says they're also called fog collectors. Picture a big cloth mesh between two poles. Fog blows through and. . . SPENCER: The water that's collecting on the mesh is dripping down into the gutter and then down into a storage tank from there. CORNISH: Spencer is joining other researchers in the mountains of Peru next month where they're using this method to irrigate trees. Now, could it work in California? Spencer says yes, but. . . SPENCER: Fog varies over the course of the year, and the density of that fog is going to vary based on the weather you're having at a certain period. CORNISH: So it would work best in combination with other techniques. And at least in California, they're hearing all kinds of ideas.

MAX GOMBERG: It's been everything from, you know, towing icebergs down from Alaska to running a pipeline from the wetter parts of the country. There are many ideas out there that are technically feasible. CORNISH: But Gomberg says the bottom line is, is the solution proven? Will it be cost-effective and environmentally sound? GOMBERG: There's actually a lot of water that falls in California, even in a dry year. Our focus is really on bringing demand down to a more sustainable level. CORNISH: And that means conservation, capturing storm water and recycling - not exactly \"Star Wars,\" but tried and true. And if you have a crazy idea to solve the drought, you can always tweet it to us @npralltech. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  So that's water conservation. What about water production? Is there some way for us to harvest water? (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"STAR WARS: EPISODE IV - A NEW HOPE\") SHELAGH FRASER: (As Aunt Beru) Luke. . . CORNISH: There was in \"Star Wars. \" Remember Luke Skywalker worked at his uncle's moisture farm on Tatooine? They had machines that pulled water right out of the desert air. That's why Uncle Owen bought C-3PO. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"STAR WARS: EPISODE IV - A NEW HOPE\") PHIL BROWN: (As Uncle Owen). What I really need is a droid who understands the binary language of moisture vaporators. ANTHONY DANIELS: (As C-3PO) Vaporators? Sir, my first job was programming binary load lifters - very similar to your vaporators in most respects. CORNISH: Moisture vaporators - that's a science-fictional name for something that does exist. Atmospheric water generation has been used in disaster relief situations to generate lots of drinking water. Abe Scher's company sent machines to Haiti after the 2010 earthquake. He is CEO of Aqua Sciences. ABE SCHER: The user produces their own water from the supply they have above their heads. CORNISH: Scher says his method doesn't rely on condensation like some methods do, but on a chemical desiccant. SCHER: We strip the water molecules that are present in the atmosphere using natural salts. And those salts work to not only extract the water from the air, but they're a natural antiseptic, so they clean the water as well. CORNISH: We caught Scher today at the airport as he headed to California to talk with state officials about using his machines to counter the drought. He says it could be scaled up to work on a farm. Another way to harvest water from the supply of above our heads? Fog fences. BEN SPENCER: So it's almost like a large tennis net. CORNISH: That's Ben Spencer, an assistant professor at the University of Washington. And he says they're also called fog collectors. Picture a big cloth mesh between two poles. Fog blows through and. . . SPENCER: The water that's collecting on the mesh is dripping down into the gutter and then down into a storage tank from there. CORNISH: Spencer is joining other researchers in the mountains of Peru next month where they're using this method to irrigate trees. Now, could it work in California? Spencer says yes, but. . . SPENCER: Fog varies over the course of the year, and the density of that fog is going to vary based on the weather you're having at a certain period. CORNISH: So it would work best in combination with other techniques. And at least in California, they're hearing all kinds of ideas.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN: This is the final boarding call for regional train 125. . . JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: There is limited train service today at Amtrak's 30th Street Station in Philadelphia, but Tuesday's derailment is not far from anyone's mind. Passengers seem acutely aware that the derailed train approached the curve near Frankford Junction at twice the posted speed limit of 50 miles per hour. BOB DOCKHORN: It was clearly too fast. In Frankford, they have to slow down, and clearly this train didn't. CHRIS LOMBARDI: It seems like something went terribly wrong, but you're not sure what. It shouldn't have been going that fast. ZAKIA KUSH: It seems it was human error. There was no reason for them to be speeding on the track.

By one estimate, it would cost an additional $5 billion to install this technology across the country. That's an expensive proposition for Amtrak at a time when the railroad is a fighting against budget cuts in Washington. Today, House Speaker John Boehner said Amtrak's funding has nothing to do with the accident in Philadelphia.

It's a technology designed to automatically slow or stop trains before a derailment or a collision. In 2008, Congress mandated that positive train control be installed throughout the rail system by the end of 2015. It was not installed at the Amtrak crash site. Yesterday, the NTSB said had such a system been installed along that stretch of rail, the accident wouldn't have happened. For more on this, we're joined by Steven Ditmeyer. He's former director of research and development at the Federal Railroad Administration. Welcome to the program. STEVEN DITMEYER: Thank you, Melissa. BLOCK: And, first of all, do you agree with the NTSB that if there were positive train control along this stretch of track that this crash wouldn't have happened? DITMEYER: Yes. If this train had been moving along - and because the engineer was not slowing down - the PTC system would have brought the train down to the proper speed to go through that curve. BLOCK: How does the system work? DITMEYER: PTC systems use positioning technology, digital data communications, onboard computers and computers at the control center. In the case of Amtrak's PTC system, they have installed transponders - radio frequency ID devices - between the rails at very specifically measured locations. And those transponders contain information about speed limitations ahead. And when a train passes over it, its radio receiver detects that and so the onboard computer knows that there is a speed restriction ahead. And if the engineer doesn't obey it, the system intervenes. BLOCK: And is it only for excessive speed? In other words, if there were something on the tracks, would positive train control detect that and slow a train down? DITMEYER: No. Positive train control doesn't have vision ahead to see if there's something blocking the tracks. However, if there is another train there, the nature of the Amtrak PTC system knows the location of trains ahead and stops the following train from colliding with it. BLOCK: How complicated is it for railroads to put this positive train control system in place? DITMEYER: PTC is a relatively complicated system. Amtrak's version of PTC was developed around the year 2000 so that they could install it and get permission to run their new Acela train sets at higher speeds than the traditional Northeast Corridor trains. They installed it between New Haven and Boston because Acelas would be traveling at 150 miles an hour over portions of that territory. And they installed it on other parts of the corridor where the Acelas would be running at higher speeds. There have been some problems encountered in the intervening years. For one was getting sufficient radio frequencies assigned to the railroads to handle these new systems. The radio frequency issues seem to have been overcome, and Amtrak has all along been talking of having PTC over the entire route implemented by the end of this calendar year, which is when the federal mandate required it. BLOCK: And does that seem doable? DITMEYER: Yes, it does. BLOCK: Is it an expensive system to put into place? DITMEYER: Yes, it is. It's hundreds of millions of dollars for Amtrak and for the commuter railroads that operate on Amtrak in the Northeast Corridor. The freight railroads are implementing a slightly different version of PTC that uses GPS positioning, and they have been spending something on the order of $5 billion for the freight railroads in the U. S. BLOCK: You know, with any deadly accident like this, whether it's a plane crash or, in this case, the train crash, there's always a really brutal cost-benefit analysis that goes into safety measures and whether the cost is worth it given how rare accidents might be. Is there that sort of calculus going on with positive train control? DITMEYER: Well, that calculus has been taking place over the years leading up to this incident. And there has been a general conclusion on the part of railroads, unions, the federal regulators and so on, that the safety benefits alone do not justify the very large investment in PTC. However, there are potential other benefits that derive from PTC, including the ultimate potential of improving train running times, reliability, asset utilization and track capacity. But the safety benefits alone - unfortunately, there appears to be agreement that they alone do not justify the capital expenditure. BLOCK: Steven Ditmeyer, thanks for talking to us.

Even before the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. , last summer, American police forces were finding themselves under increased scrutiny. Incidents since then have only increased the pressure. Camera phones and social media make it easier to question them. And police are changing their behavior, though not always in the way the public might like. NPR's Martin Kaste reports. MARTIN KASTE, BYLINE: Let's be clear. There are a lot of things about police that haven't changed - for instance, bagpipes. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Four. (SOUNDBITE OF BAGPIPES)KASTE: Cops still play them at funerals and at ceremonies like this one at the National Law Enforcement Memorial here in Washington, D. C. This was Tuesday afternoon, the festive finish to an annual police bike ride. (APPLAUSE)KASTE: Nearly 2,000 cops from around the country cycling in memory of colleagues who died on the job. They were welcomed by friends and families, some of them wearing T-shirts with the image of the thin blue line. Josh Underwood is a sheriff's deputy from St. Johns County, Fla. He shows the metal wristbands that the riders wear. JOSH UNDERWOOD: It's an engraved band, and you have somebody's name on it, so that's who you ride for that year. And usually the tradition is you find that family and you give them that band and say hey, I rode for your son or your brother, you know, your husband. KASTE: But this event feels a little different this year - more embattled. It's hard to forget about Ferguson, North Charleston, and this year, the riders were routed away from Baltimore because they were worried about becoming targets. Steve Staletovich watches the cyclists arrive. He's a sergeant with the Indianapolis Police Department, and he's been on the job for 30 years. STEVE STALETOVICH: And over the 30 years I've seen a lot of changes - a lot of ups and downs - but I've got to tell you, the current situation is about as bad as I've seen. KASTE: Lately, he's been checking the news every morning for incidents involving police, incidents anywhere in the country so that he can warn his officers at roll call. STALETOVICH: I tell them hey, this is going to break today, and it's going to be ugly, and there's going to be some catcalls and some jeers. KASTE: America's local police are now acting on a national stage. When something happens in South Carolina, the cops feel the effects in Indianapolis. And as I've talked to cops over the last year, one word keeps coming to mind - disruption. It's a Silicon Valley cliche, but police embrace it, and they're quick to point out the technologies that are doing the disrupting. STALETOVICH: Social media has made stories that never would have been heard or seen before national news. KASTE: On the other side of the country, another veteran cop makes this analogy. . . CLOYD STEIGER: It's just like Vietnam. The first cameras that went to war in Vietnam - everybody was shocked at the violence. KASTE: That's Cloyd Stieger. He's a police detective in Seattle, and he started out as a patrolman in 1979. He says it's like when the TV cameras arrived in Vietnam because, like that moment, the public is getting a dose of harsh reality. STEIGER: People see things that they didn't see before, and people watch the TV shows, and it's so sanitized. That's what they think violence is supposed to really look like. Well, it doesn't. That's not the way use of force looks. Use of force looks ugly, but that's the way it's always been. KASTE: Now, civilians hear this and think good, the more transparency the better. A lot of cops say that, too, but some of them add this warning - all this exposure is going to mean a different kind of policing. Steiger says it's making cops more passive. He recalls what it was like to patrol the streets back in the '80s. STEIGER: Our whole job was to go and shake gang bangers or dope dealers and stuff to kind of clean up the area. KASTE: That would never fly today, especially in Seattle, a city that's been burned by unflattering videos of aggressive cops. Two of Steiger's sons are patrolmen, and they tell him it's a whole different philosophy now. STEIGER: You know, if you're driving down the street and there's a guy you think is dealing drugs or prowling cars or something and if you stop him and things kind of go bad a little bit - like you get - have a use of force situation - then it's micromanaged. Everybody looks at everything you said, everything you did. But if you just choose to just drive on by - no one ever second-guesses you if you just ignore it. KASTE: But cops say when they are forced to act, when things do get confrontational, then they face the other part of this disruption - people now are a lot more willing to ask questions and even talk back. It's as if they have been practicing it in their minds while watching other people's videos of encounters with the police. And police trainer Mark Best says people also now seem to know what they're talking about. MARK BEST: They may know how far a police officer can go. They do the research on the Internet where it used to be you had to go down to the law library. Now you just click a mouse button and, you know, people know their rights and - which they should. KASTE: He says he's now training aspiring police officers to expect questions and to explain what they're doing. Still, there's a fundamental conflict here. For the past few decades, American cops have been trained in something called command presence. That's the technique of using a forceful tone and body language to take control of a scene. It's meant to keep things from spinning out of control, but it can also come off as offensive, and it looks terrible on video. In Seattle, Cloyd Steiger worries about cops losing their command presence. STEIGER: There's nothing wrong with, you know, saying hey, why are you stopping me and giving an explanation. That's not what I'm talking about. But I'm talking about the in your face, you can't touch me, trying to walk away and stuff that leads to physical confrontations that wouldn't have led to a physical confrontation before. KASTE: Still, Steiger doesn't think the public's challenging attitude will last. He takes the long view. He says just wait until the crime rate goes back up again. STEIGER: The pendulum has swung many times in my career. This is the farthest it's swung in its arc, but that doesn't mean it won't swing back to the middle where it needs to be. KASTE: You hear that from a lot of the older cops. Laurie Robinson has heard it, too, and she doesn't buy it. LAURIE ROBINSON: I don't think this is just a pendulum swing. KASTE: She's a professor of criminology, law and society at George Mason University, and she co-chaired President Obama's task force on 21st-century policing. ROBINSON: I think that there is something different now, in part because of the visibility of what's occurred due to social media, due to the 24-hour media cycle. And part of it because of the focus of the American people on what has been occurring. KASTE: She thinks the effect of all this attention will be a fundamental change in the culture of American policing. It's a change that's already underway, and what's interesting here is how it's happening. America has one of the most decentralized police systems in the world. We can't even figure out exactly how many local police agencies we have. And the federal government doesn't have a good way to force nationwide reform. And yet, that reform seems to be happening, and it's being propelled by people on the Internet. Martin Kaste, NPR News, Washington. INSKEEP: We're going to keep talking about our changing police culture tomorrow. We hear from two leaders changing the way officers are trained - the chief of the Camden County New Jersey Police Department and the director of Washington State's police academy.

STEVE STALETOVICH: And over the 30 years I've seen a lot of changes - a lot of ups and downs - but I've got to tell you, the current situation is about as bad as I've seen. KASTE: Lately, he's been checking the news every morning for incidents involving police, incidents anywhere in the country so that he can warn his officers at roll call. STALETOVICH: I tell them hey, this is going to break today, and it's going to be ugly, and there's going to be some catcalls and some jeers. KASTE: America's local police are now acting on a national stage. When something happens in South Carolina, the cops feel the effects in Indianapolis. And as I've talked to cops over the last year, one word keeps coming to mind - disruption. It's a Silicon Valley cliche, but police embrace it, and they're quick to point out the technologies that are doing the disrupting. STALETOVICH: Social media has made stories that never would have been heard or seen before national news. KASTE: On the other side of the country, another veteran cop makes this analogy. . . CLOYD STEIGER: It's just like Vietnam. The first cameras that went to war in Vietnam - everybody was shocked at the violence. KASTE: That's Cloyd Stieger. He's a police detective in Seattle, and he started out as a patrolman in 1979. He says it's like when the TV cameras arrived in Vietnam because, like that moment, the public is getting a dose of harsh reality. STEIGER: People see things that they didn't see before, and people watch the TV shows, and it's so sanitized. That's what they think violence is supposed to really look like. Well, it doesn't. That's not the way use of force looks. Use of force looks ugly, but that's the way it's always been. KASTE: Now, civilians hear this and think good, the more transparency the better. A lot of cops say that, too, but some of them add this warning - all this exposure is going to mean a different kind of policing. Steiger says it's making cops more passive. He recalls what it was like to patrol the streets back in the '80s. STEIGER: Our whole job was to go and shake gang bangers or dope dealers and stuff to kind of clean up the area. KASTE: That would never fly today, especially in Seattle, a city that's been burned by unflattering videos of aggressive cops. Two of Steiger's sons are patrolmen, and they tell him it's a whole different philosophy now. STEIGER: You know, if you're driving down the street and there's a guy you think is dealing drugs or prowling cars or something and if you stop him and things kind of go bad a little bit - like you get - have a use of force situation - then it's micromanaged. Everybody looks at everything you said, everything you did. But if you just choose to just drive on by - no one ever second-guesses you if you just ignore it. KASTE: But cops say when they are forced to act, when things do get confrontational, then they face the other part of this disruption - people now are a lot more willing to ask questions and even talk back. It's as if they have been practicing it in their minds while watching other people's videos of encounters with the police. And police trainer Mark Best says people also now seem to know what they're talking about. MARK BEST: They may know how far a police officer can go. They do the research on the Internet where it used to be you had to go down to the law library. Now you just click a mouse button and, you know, people know their rights and - which they should. KASTE: He says he's now training aspiring police officers to expect questions and to explain what they're doing. Still, there's a fundamental conflict here. For the past few decades, American cops have been trained in something called command presence. That's the technique of using a forceful tone and body language to take control of a scene. It's meant to keep things from spinning out of control, but it can also come off as offensive, and it looks terrible on video. In Seattle, Cloyd Steiger worries about cops losing their command presence. STEIGER: There's nothing wrong with, you know, saying hey, why are you stopping me and giving an explanation. That's not what I'm talking about. But I'm talking about the in your face, you can't touch me, trying to walk away and stuff that leads to physical confrontations that wouldn't have led to a physical confrontation before. KASTE: Still, Steiger doesn't think the public's challenging attitude will last. He takes the long view. He says just wait until the crime rate goes back up again. STEIGER: The pendulum has swung many times in my career. This is the farthest it's swung in its arc, but that doesn't mean it won't swing back to the middle where it needs to be. KASTE: You hear that from a lot of the older cops. Laurie Robinson has heard it, too, and she doesn't buy it. LAURIE ROBINSON: I don't think this is just a pendulum swing. KASTE: She's a professor of criminology, law and society at George Mason University, and she co-chaired President Obama's task force on 21st-century policing. ROBINSON: I think that there is something different now, in part because of the visibility of what's occurred due to social media, due to the 24-hour media cycle. And part of it because of the focus of the American people on what has been occurring. KASTE: She thinks the effect of all this attention will be a fundamental change in the culture of American policing. It's a change that's already underway, and what's interesting here is how it's happening. America has one of the most decentralized police systems in the world. We can't even figure out exactly how many local police agencies we have. And the federal government doesn't have a good way to force nationwide reform. And yet, that reform seems to be happening, and it's being propelled by people on the Internet. Martin Kaste, NPR News, Washington.

RACHEL BOTSMAN: (Laughter). RAZ: . . . What would you say? BOTSMAN: (Laughter) I didn't see the question coming. RAZ: This is Rachel Botsman, and this is the question that she asked the audience when she gave her TED Talk. BOTSMAN: Is this a serious question? RAZ: Yeah, yeah. Rachel writes about how our reputations are a kind of currency. BOTSMAN: I think they would say loyal, committed and passionate. RAZ: Those are great words. BOTSMAN: Thank you. RAZ: That's your reputation. BOTSMAN: Well, that's what I'd like people to think, yes. RAZ: And what people think of you drives what Rachel and others call the trust economy. BOTSMAN: People call it the sharing economy. They call it the collaborative economy, collaborative consumption - whatever you call it, trust is the social glue. RAZ: I mean, think about it. We exchange money without banks. BOTSMAN: You see things like Lending Club, Funding Circle, TransferWise. . . RAZ: We accept rides from strangers. BOTSMAN: Whether it's lifts, I call Uber and ridesharing. . . RAZ: We stay in other people's homes, people we've never met. BOTSMAN: From Couchsurfing to Airbnb all the way to the high-end of onefinestay, which is - I think properties now over a million dollars. RAZ: And all of those services run on trust. Here's how Rachel described it in her TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)BOTSMAN: Now, what's happening here is people are realizing the power of technology to unlock the idling capacity and value of all kinds of assets from skills to spaces to material possessions in ways and on a scale never possible before. It's an economy and culture called collaborative consumption, and through it, people are becoming micro-entrepeneurs. They're empowered to make money and save money from their existing assets. With every trade we make, comment we leave, person we'll flag, badge we earn, we leave a reputation trail of how well we can and can't be trusted. And it's not just the breadth but the volume of reputation data out there that is staggering. Just consider this - 5 million nights have been booked on Airbnb in the past six months alone. Thirty million rides have been shared on carpooling. com. This year, $2 billion worth of loans will go through peer-to-peer lending platforms. This adds up to millions of pieces of reputation data on how well we behave or misbehave. RAZ: Those numbers are way higher today. Rachel actually gave this talk a few years ago. And she thinks part of the reason these services are growing so fast is because there's been a kind of evolution in the way we trust - especially online. BOTSMAN: We trust people because through digital technologies we think we know them. RAZ: Yeah. BOTSMAN: So I'm going to trust this website to put in my name. I'm not going to use a pseudonym. RAZ: Right. BOTSMAN: I'm going to trust this website with payment information. I'm now going to trust this platform and put in this highly personal information and then I'm going to often meet that person off-line in the real world. So I generally believe that the way we are forming trust and the way we're trusting people is becoming compressed and accelerated. RAZ: Coming up in a moment, how the trust economy isn't just changing the way we do business. It's actually making us behave better. Stay with us. I'm Guy Raz, and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz, and on the show today, trust and consequences. And a few minutes ago, we were hearing from Rachel Botsman. She studies a part of the economy based entirely on trusting complete strangers. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)BOTSMAN: Meet 46-year-old Chris Mok, who has, I bet, the best job title here of super rabbit. Now, four years ago, Chris lost his job unfortunately as an art buyer at Macy's, and like so many people, he struggled to find a new one during the recession. And then he happened to stumble across a post about TaskRabbit. Now, the way TaskRabbit works is people outsource the tasks that they want doing, name the price they're willing to pay and then vetted rabbits bid to run the errand. Now, the tasks being posted are things that you might expect like help with household chores or doing supermarket runs. But I love that the number one task posted over a hundred times a day is something that many of us have felt the pain of doing - yes, assembling IKEA furniture. (LAUGHTER)BOTSMAN: It's brilliant. Now, we may laugh, but Chris here is actually making up to $5,000 a month running errands around his life. And 70 percent of this new labor force were previously unemployed or underemployed. I think TaskRabbit and other examples of collaborative consumption are like lemonade stands on steroids. RAZ: I really like this idea of that entire economies in some ways are sort of becoming decentralized. Like, this idea that to have economic powers isn't just for powerful corporations, but for anyone, I guess, right, if they're trusted. BOTSMAN: I mean, this the fundamental point that a lot of the critics miss is that what it does for everyone as it changes the role that you can play in society. You know, you don't have to be a passive consumer. You can be a provider. You can be an entrepreneur. You can be a lender. And that fundamentally is an empowering thing. You know, on peer-to-peer lending - so the default rate on peer-to-peer lending is now dropped below 0. 4 percent. And you compare that to a traditional bank, which I think is around 3 to 4 percent. Credit cards around 7 to 8 percent how people default, and so, you know, when you look at the research it's why is that, you know? Why is this system of peer-to-peer lending, and what people say is I - I trust you more than a big bank, but I also feel a sense of accountability to another human being, another individual that I do not feel to a corporation. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)BOTSMAN: It's only a matter of time before we have to perform a Facebook or Google-like search and see a complete picture of someone's behaviors in different contexts over time. And this will live in a some kind of reputation dashboard that will paint a picture of your reputation capital. Ultimately, when we get it right, reputation capital could create a massive positive disruption in who has power, trust and influence. A three-digit score - your traditional credit history that only 30 percent of us actually know what it is - will no longer be the determining factor in how much things cost, what we can access and, in many instances, limit what we can do in the world. Indeed, reputation is a currency that I believe will become more powerful than our credit history in the 21st-century. RAZ: You know, the thing about collaborative consumption and the trust economy that kind of bothers me - I mean, I love it and I want to be part of it, but I kind of feel like it shuts people out as well if they're not willing to sort of give everything up off the bat. Like, Facebook to me is really scary. You know, they have so much information and every click is a data point, and every friend is a data point. And why should I trust that they're going to keep that information safe? BOTSMAN: Yeah, I mean, this is something I raised in the TED Talk. It's who owns this data. RAZ: Right. BOTSMAN: Airbnb has data on how clean I am, whether I dropped the towels on the floor. RAZ: Wow, so the owner is actually - can actually write about that and then they can compile that information and store it somewhere. BOTSMAN: They do. Airbnb has all that data. RAZ: Wow. BOTSMAN: I mean, I'm not just saying this. Airbnb, I actually - I know the founders. I know that company really well and I trust them, but there's other companies where I'd think about - God, they could sell that data to XYZ. And it would really have implications that I'm not sure I'm comfortable with. RAZ: But you argue in your TED Talk that despite all these privacy concerns, you still think that there's value in this idea of reputation and trust as currency. BOTSMAN: Yeah, and, you know, if it makes people stop and think should I be trusted? And do I treat people well and do I behave well? It's difficult to argue that is a bad thing. I think, you know, a lot of trust has been destroyed in the world because we can hide behind things. And I think that's what's both empowering but incredibly frightening to people is the visibility around our behaviors and having to accept the consequences around that. RAZ: Maybe we'll just all behave better. BOTSMAN: (Laughter) Maybe. Maybe we'll behave better. Maybe we'll treat people better. RAZ: Rachel Botsman - she's written a book about this. It's called \"What's Mine Is Yours. \" You can see her entire talk at TED. NPR. org. GUY RAZ, HOST:  If someone were to ask you for three words to sum up your reputation. . .

A new report by an Asian-American professional group call Ascend took a look at the diversity numbers at five big-name tech companies in the Valley. Over a quarter of the professional workforce at those companies are Asian or Asian-American, but less than 19 percent are managers, and just under 14 percent are executives. Yesterday, we met a couple of Asian-Americans in tech and heard about their experiences. Yul Kwon is deputy chief privacy officer at Facebook. YUL KWON: I think one of the challenges for a lot of Asian-Americans, including me - like, you know, you can't help but feel a little sheepish, like, talking about these issues because you don't want it to be seeming as though you're self-serving. RATH: Is the experience different for the thousands of Asians born overseas currently working in the tech industry? Six years ago, Huong Tran left her home in Vietnam to enroll in Stanford Business School. It was an adjustment. HUONG TRAN: We believe that hard work and not necessarily self-promotion will get you ahead. I think that doesn't hold the same here, in that, you know, working hard is still important, but it doesn't mean that it's automatically going to get you rewarded. RATH: When she lived in Vietnam, Tran had started her own business, taking advantage of the explosion of retailers there after the country's admittance to the World Trade Organization. She left that behind to come to Stanford and start a new business here in the States. TRAN: But, you know, the hurdles of getting an H-1B sponsorship and visa and whatnot really changed how I think about my employment opportunities. RATH: So instead of starting her business straight out of school, Tran took an offer from Yahoo. She worked there until about six months ago - long enough to get her green card. Now she runs a home-swapping app called Magpie. Karan Chaudhry was born in India. He's also a Stanford grad and hasn't been as lucky. He's still on an H-1B visa. If you have a start-up, as Chaudhry does, it's even trickier. To get that visa, you have to prove you're a legitimate business with some real cash on hand. Chaudhry has already raised $5 or $6 million, he says, but he's been rattled by these meetings with venture capitalists. KARAN CHAUDHRY: It is really scary. Like, you're literally toying with your career, which is, like, hey, if that doesn't get approved, the funding is off. Or even though the funding is in, you will not be the person who will be the CEO. RATH: So why take that risk? Well, for one, Chaudhry says he is passionate about his idea. His company, DropThought, is a way for businesses to get real-time feedback from their customers. But he also says he and a lot of Asians strike out on their own because of a Catch-22 situation he describes. Without more established Asian role models or executives, it's tougher for younger ones to move up. CHAUDHRY: So it's almost like a vicious cycle. And I think with Satya Nadella becoming the CEO of Microsoft and immigrant companies becoming super successful, I think that balance will change, but it will not happen overnight. RATH: Chaudhry says he thinks Americans have an advantage, thanks to the way they're brought up - an emphasis on all-around development, including sports and socializing, rather than just academics. In a venture capital world where people who are fit and charismatic get more funding, that is huge. He wishes more companies would work to help Asian-born employees rather than just passing them over for promotions. CHAUDHRY: If people have the smarts and they're the right people for the job, let's not throw the baby out with the bathtub. And let's work on some of the areas which can actually be improved with coaching. RATH: Areas like communication skills, body language - that kind of thing. CHAUDHRY: Like, you see a lot of diversity training, and you see a lot of other workshops. What you don't see is an active thing of saying, we want to develop leaders out of certain people, and therefore, we'll have active coaching sessions. We'll identify people, and, you know, we'll do that. RATH: Huong Tran agrees that there's a problem. There are lots of Asians in the funnel, but they're just not making it to the top. But it's not just a problem for Asians. TRAN: I think the message is broader than that, in that, you know, if you replace that equation with other variables, the equation still doesn't change, in that we need more diversity. RATH: You can listen to the story of two Asian-Americans in the tech industry. Go to our website, npr. org.

Or even though the funding is in, you will not be the person who will be the CEO. RATH: So why take that risk? Well, for one, Chaudhry says he is passionate about his idea. His company, DropThought, is a way for businesses to get real-time feedback from their customers. But he also says he and a lot of Asians strike out on their own because of a Catch-22 situation he describes. Without more established Asian role models or executives, it's tougher for younger ones to move up. CHAUDHRY: So it's almost like a vicious cycle. And I think with Satya Nadella becoming the CEO of Microsoft and immigrant companies becoming super successful, I think that balance will change, but it will not happen overnight. RATH: Chaudhry says he thinks Americans have an advantage, thanks to the way they're brought up - an emphasis on all-around development, including sports and socializing, rather than just academics. In a venture capital world where people who are fit and charismatic get more funding, that is huge. He wishes more companies would work to help Asian-born employees rather than just passing them over for promotions. CHAUDHRY: If people have the smarts and they're the right people for the job, let's not throw the baby out with the bathtub. And let's work on some of the areas which can actually be improved with coaching. RATH: Areas like communication skills, body language - that kind of thing. CHAUDHRY: Like, you see a lot of diversity training, and you see a lot of other workshops. What you don't see is an active thing of saying, we want to develop leaders out of certain people, and therefore, we'll have active coaching sessions. We'll identify people, and, you know, we'll do that. RATH: Huong Tran agrees that there's a problem. There are lots of Asians in the funnel, but they're just not making it to the top. But it's not just a problem for Asians. TRAN: I think the message is broader than that, in that, you know, if you replace that equation with other variables, the equation still doesn't change, in that we need more diversity. RATH: You can listen to the story of two Asian-Americans in the tech industry. Go to our website, npr. org.", "section": "Race", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2015 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Another city just joined that fight, Santa Monica, Calif. The city council recently passed laws that will greatly limit rentals through sites like Airbnb. NPR's Sam Sanders reports. SAM SANDERS, BYLINE: Eighty-year-old Arlene Rosenblatt and her husband rent out their quaint converted duplex in Santa Monica when they're traveling to visit their grandkids. ARLENE ROSENBLATT: Let's see, that's my mom. A lot of these people are no longer alive. This is me. SANDERS: Rosenblatt's giving me a tour of her house. And she's pointing out dozens of photographs, many of her seven grandchildren. ROSENBLATT: Jud, Tom, Rebeccah, Jake, Eli, Mira, and Bella. SANDERS: She says the money they make renting through Airbnb helps. ROSENBLATT: I'm a retired school teacher. We don't get a lot of retirement income. My husband, all he has is his Social Security. SANDERS: Rosenblatt says under new rules in Santa Monica, she could lose up to $20,000 a year. The new guidelines say any rentals 30 days or less can only happen if the owner or permanent tenet stays in the house with the guest. That rule alone would make Rosenblatt's rentals illegal. The rules also implement a 14 percent tax on those rentals and require business permits. ROSENBLATT: Of course, I would get a business license. I would pay my hotel tax. But it's not fair for us to have to follow the same regulations that big business does. SANDERS: Rosenblatt's talking about leasing companies and vacation rental agencies that use Airbnb to post multiple listings for places no one actually lives in. She says she's being punished for what they're doing. So just who is using Airbnb in a place like Santa Monica, grandmas or business? Roy Samaan thinks he knows. ROY SAMAAN: The public persona that the company portrays does not really connect with which users generate the revenue. SANDERS: Samaan is a policy analyst for the Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy. He led a big study on Airbnb in LA. And he found that a third of Airbnb revenue in the city comes from leasing companies, companies with lots of listing, often apartments that are only used for vacation rentals - basically, de facto hotels. Samaan says those vacation rentals cut into the number of residential apartments to rent, not just in Santa Monica and LA, but all over the country. SAMAAN: Supply and demand exists. When you have a tight rental market, this really exacerbates those market forces by taking hundreds of additional units out of circulation. SANDERS: Airbnb disagrees. DAVID OWEN: It's absolutely false. SANDERS: David Owen is head of policy at Airbnb. His company says 8 out of 10 LA users only rent out the space they live in, so they aren't taking units out of the market. And, Owen says, you can't pin the entire rental crisis on Airbnb. OWEN: Cities like Los Angeles and Santa Monica are facing affordable housing issues that are decades old. Any straight line between those issues and home sharing or Airbnb is smokescreen for very real issues around housing affordability. SANDERS: But since Samaan's study was released, Airbnb's been quietly removing listings from some of the big vacation rental companies Samaan drew attention to. Arlene Rosenblatt says she wants the new rules in Santa Monica changed. But, she says, with or without Airbnb, she's staying in her home. ROSENBLATT: Obviously, I could sell it and move somewhere else. But I'm living my dream right now. I mean, we walk almost every morning on the beach path. It's - it's amazing.

It's part of the American dream - the notion that if you have a good idea and fire in your belly, you can turn that idea into a successful business. That message is everywhere in our culture. Here's President Obama this past week at a summit on entrepreneurship at the White House. (SOUNDBITE OF WHITE HOUSE SUMMIT)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: We have a lot of brainpower here. We've got innovators and investors, business leaders, entrepreneurs. We've even got a few sharks. MARTIN: That was a reference to the hit TV show \"Shark Tank\" because Americans love the idea of making it big so much, we watch the drama unfold on TV night after night. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"SHARK TANK\")UNIDENTIFIED MAN: All right, Curt (ph) I'm not going to invest in your schminkles (ph). I'm out. MARTIN: Even if an entrepreneur can line up some investment to get up and running, the odds of it all working out aren't great. The Small Business Administration says half of all new businesses fail within the first five years. For The Record today - risking it all to make it big. This morning, a tale of two entrepreneurs - one's business succeeds, the other's does not. JANE CHEN: My name is Jane Chen. I live in San Francisco. MARTIN: She started a company called Embrace that set out to save premature babies in developing countries with a product that keeps them at exactly the right temperature. CHEN: It looks like a little sleeping bag for a baby. You can heat it either through a hot water heater or through an electric heater that only requires 30 minutes of power. MARTIN: She and three friends came up with the idea when they were students at Stanford. They researched the market and in the end. . . CHEN: We thought to ourselves, hey, if we don't do this, no one else is going to. MARTIN: That's James Chen. Now our second entrepreneur. . . JEFF MARTENS: My name is Jeff Martens. I live in Portland, Oregon, and I'm a technologist and entrepreneur. MARTIN: Jeff's aha moment came in 2001. He was obsessed with the idea that there were all these personal computers out there in millions of homes, and couldn't all that computing power be harnessed to complete a job faster? MARTENS: We could split it up into many pieces, send those pieces to many computers and do it faster than if the client submitted. . . MARTIN: Suffice it to say, it's really technical. But the point is that he had an idea that he could not shake. MARTENS: And I just, literally, for years, could not stop thinking about it. It kept me up at night. I would wake up in the morning and think about it. MARTIN: Then in 2009, his big break. MARTENS: I was laid off. And it turns out that was probably one of the best things that happened to me. MARTIN: He got a severance package so he can afford to take a few months off and see if he could turn his idea into a business. There they are, Jane and Jeff, each moving along, trying to build their respective businesses, which is code for trying to find cash. And they found it - enough to keep each of them moving forward. Now this is a point in the story where you know something is going to change because that's what happens to entrepreneurs. There's almost always a low point, the moment when it seems like the whole enterprise might crumble. For Jane Chen, that came last year. She and her partners were selling a lot of their products in India, but national elections in that country created instability. CHEN: As a result of that, we were put into just a very, very precarious financial situation. And I thought to myself, you know, are we going to be able to make it out of this? MARTIN: For Jeff, the low point came when a member of his team quit. MARTENS: One of our employees was really pushing back on some software design that we were planning. And he said this just will not work. And it was really hard to hear. MARTIN: This is where these stories start to diverge. To climb out of her low point, Jane Chen reached out to an investor who gave her the funding she needed to keep going, an investor she randomly met in a meditation class months before, an investor who happened to be really interested in neonatal health. She does not necessarily think it's a coincidence. CHEN: I love this quote from Paulo Coelho in \"The Alchemist. \" He says \"when you truly believe in something, the universe will conspire in helping you to achieve it. \"MARTIN: And if you haven't already guessed it, the universe did conspire to help Jane Chen, and her business is still going strong today. That did not happen for Jeff Martens. MARTENS: We kept saying, oh, there's just this new investor around the corner or this new customer that will sign-up. And it's going to happen. And I think after telling ourselves that a number of times, we just couldn't believe it ourselves anymore. And to my surprise, the day that my cofounder and I decided to shut down our company, it was one of the easiest decisions we'd ever made. We looked at each other, and we said it's over. MARTIN: Jeff knew the risks when he was starting out. He remembers one meeting with a family friend. MARTENS: He said, you know, here's the deal, you better love what you're doing because you're going to lose a lot. And specifically, you're going to lose three things. You're going to lose your financial security. Think about your bank account now, and kiss all that money goodbye. It's gone. And then, he said, the second thing is, you know, think about your friends. And you might as well say goodbye to them because you won't have time for them anymore, and they won't understand what you're going through. And the third thing was you will probably lose your marriage. And I just thought to myself, no way, not me. MARTIN: So what happened for you and those three things? MARTENS: Unfortunately, they all came true for me. I became broke. I lost my house. I had to short sell it. I had to cash in my 401(k). And, you know, I miss my friends. I don't see them as much as I once did. That hit me once when I was on the phone with one of my friends, and I asked him what he did that weekend. And he said, oh, well, we all went and rented beach house at the Oregon coast. And we had a great time. And I said are you kidding me? How come I didn't know this? You didn't invite me. And he stopped, and he said, well, I guess we didn't think about it because every time we've asked you to do something in the past you've always said no. And the third thing is, unfortunately, my marriage has ended. And we were married for about 10 years and yeah. MARTIN: That's a lot. MARTENS: Yeah. MARTIN: Jeff is on solid footing now. He got a job with a tech company as a product manager. He likes the steady paycheck. He even likes the work. But he is absolutely convinced he will strike out on his own again at some point. However, he says he'll do things differently. Next time he'll try to be more open because he says in the startup world when someone asks you how things are going, there's only one right answer. . . MARTENS: Oh, man, we're killing it. Things are great. When they ask how sales are, you're killing it. Hiring is good. You're killing it. And on one hand, you have to say that because you don't want to put out the message that there's something wrong with your company. But the truth of the matter is you're lying most of the time. MARTIN: Jane Chen understands that pressure to succeed. In a lot of ways she puts it on herself. CHEN: Once we finish one thing, I'm always thinking, well, what's next? And how do we - you know, it's 150,000 babies now. How do we get to a million babies? MARTIN: She admits to being, perhaps, irrationally optimistic, believing, despite the odds, that everything will just work out. And that's the thing that entrepreneurs all have in common. It's not just optimism, it's ambition coupled with an uncanny ability to tolerate risk, even thrive on it. It was something Jane Chen had to explain to her family. CHEN: My parents are immigrants, and they moved to the U. S. to give us the chance for a better education and a better life. And so the path that I took, they were very, very opposed to it. But for me, it's, you know, I think that when you have a calling like that, like, I just felt it so deep in my heart. People would say to me, you know, you're crazy. Why are you doing this? And for me, it was always, I would be crazy not to do this. MARTIN: Entrepreneurs Jane Chen of San Francisco, California and Jeff Martens of Portland, Oregon.

Don't worry, that's not a spoiler to the \"Mad Men\" finale, but the show is over and spoilers are coming. We are going to talk about it for the next few minutes with NPR's Eric Deggans, so if you've not seen the \"Mad Men\" finale yet and want to, you may want to turn your radio down. Hi, Eric. ERIC DEGGANS, BYLINE: Hi, how's it going? INSKEEP: Doing fine, thank you very much. So was this finale worthy of the show? DEGGANS: Well, it's tough to talk about the finale without talking about the last few episodes of the show, and it felt like there was a lot of padding in the last few episodes of the season. There were whole storylines and characters that kind of seemed unnecessary, but it was also the finale that fans probably wanted to see. Every character had their storylines wrapped up in a mostly positive way, except we saw self-centered housewife Betty Draper diagnosed with terminal cancer. But in other cases, we saw Peggy Olson, the repressed copywriter, find the love of her life with art director Stan Rizzo, and the show's central character, adman Don Draper, spent several episodes traveling the country until he landed in a California yoga retreat that allowed him to think up this. (SOUNDBITE OF BOUNTY AD)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: I'd like to buy the world a home and furnish it with love. DEGGANS: That's right. As many fans suspected, Don Draper was the guy who thought up one of the most famous ad campaigns in history. INSKEEP: Wait a minute. Don Draper, the fictional character, thought up the real-life Coke ad that was huge in the '70s? DEGGANS: You got it. INSKEEP: All right. Well, sing along with me, Eric. You ready? One, two, three. INSKEEP AND DEGGANS: (Singing) I'd like to teach the world to sing in terrible harmony (unintelligible). INSKEEP: Anyway, going right on (laughter). DEGGANS: Sounds pretty good. INSKEEP: Well done, sir. You held up your end. Now, did the characters change very much at the end? DEGGANS: Well, I - you know, I'd say yes and no to that. I mean, this season, we saw Don Draper essentially kind of stripped down of everything. He got divorced a second time, he lost control of his job, and then he went on the road Jack Kerouac-style. And just when he's in this yoga retreat seemingly coming to terms with all this awful stuff that he did and what a bad dad he was, the smile comes over his face and we discover that he used all of this self-discovery to come up with just another advertising pitch. But there's one character who really has changed a lot and that's Don's daughter, Sally. There's a great moment in the finale where she tells Don about her mother's terminal illness and then tries to get him to let her brothers live with their stepdad because - let's face it - Don is a pretty awful dad. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MAD MEN\")KIERNAN SHIPKA: (As Sally) I'm telling you because she wants Jean and Bobby to live with Uncle William. JON HAMM: (As Don) Don't worry, you're all going to live with me. I promise. SHIPKA: (As Sally) Let me finish. I've thought about this more than you have. DEGGANS: Once again, Sally Draper proves she's both smarter and less dysfunctional than her parents. INSKEEP: The one thinking a little bit more than her parents, apparently. Now let me ask you, Eric Deggans, this show did not have the highest ratings on television, but it really burrowed into the culture. How is TV different now that it's gone? DEGGANS: One of the most interesting things to me about \"Mad Men\" is that it kicked off a spate of quality shows that we've seen, like \"Breaking Bad\" and \"The Walking Dead. \" It was particularly good for AMC, of course, the channel that aired it. But we also saw this spread to other areas of the cable dial. And I also liked the impact of the show itself. You know, people talked about it a lot. Matt Weiner, the guy who created the show, has said that period pieces are often about the time in which they're made. So what I think \"Mad Men\" did really well was communicate our own sort of modern discomfort with the future, our continuing struggles with sexism and how difficult it can be to change even when you know you have to change. So even with all the great dramas that are now on television, I really think \"Mad Men\" is going to be missed. INSKEEP: That's NPR's TV critic, Eric Deggans. Eric, thanks. DEGGANS: Thank you. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Last night was the end for Don Draper. Don't worry, that's not a spoiler to the \"Mad Men\" finale, but the show is over and spoilers are coming. We are going to talk about it for the next few minutes with NPR's Eric Deggans, so if you've not seen the \"Mad Men\" finale yet and want to, you may want to turn your radio down. Hi, Eric. ERIC DEGGANS, BYLINE: Hi, how's it going? INSKEEP: Doing fine, thank you very much. So was this finale worthy of the show? DEGGANS: Well, it's tough to talk about the finale without talking about the last few episodes of the show, and it felt like there was a lot of padding in the last few episodes of the season. There were whole storylines and characters that kind of seemed unnecessary, but it was also the finale that fans probably wanted to see. Every character had their storylines wrapped up in a mostly positive way, except we saw self-centered housewife Betty Draper diagnosed with terminal cancer. But in other cases, we saw Peggy Olson, the repressed copywriter, find the love of her life with art director Stan Rizzo, and the show's central character, adman Don Draper, spent several episodes traveling the country until he landed in a California yoga retreat that allowed him to think up this. (SOUNDBITE OF BOUNTY AD) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: I'd like to buy the world a home and furnish it with love. DEGGANS: That's right. As many fans suspected, Don Draper was the guy who thought up one of the most famous ad campaigns in history. INSKEEP: Wait a minute. Don Draper, the fictional character, thought up the real-life Coke ad that was huge in the '70s? DEGGANS: You got it. INSKEEP: All right. Well, sing along with me, Eric. You ready? One, two, three. INSKEEP AND DEGGANS: (Singing) I'd like to teach the world to sing in terrible harmony (unintelligible). INSKEEP: Anyway, going right on (laughter). DEGGANS: Sounds pretty good. INSKEEP: Well done, sir. You held up your end. Now, did the characters change very much at the end? DEGGANS: Well, I - you know, I'd say yes and no to that. I mean, this season, we saw Don Draper essentially kind of stripped down of everything. He got divorced a second time, he lost control of his job, and then he went on the road Jack Kerouac-style. And just when he's in this yoga retreat seemingly coming to terms with all this awful stuff that he did and what a bad dad he was, the smile comes over his face and we discover that he used all of this self-discovery to come up with just another advertising pitch. But there's one character who really has changed a lot and that's Don's daughter, Sally. There's a great moment in the finale where she tells Don about her mother's terminal illness and then tries to get him to let her brothers live with their stepdad because - let's face it - Don is a pretty awful dad.

They've hardened cockpit doors and tightened airport security. Now there's another frightening concern - a cyberattack where computer hackers take control of the plane. The FBI is, in fact, investigating a computer-security expert who claims that he did just that. Here to talk more about it is NPR technology reporter Aarti Shahni. Good morning. AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: Good morning. MONTAGNE: Now, this man in question is named Chris Roberts. Did he do what he claims to have done? SHAHANI: We don't know. The FBI is investigating and there's more than one incident to investigate. According to an FBI affidavit, Roberts said he'd hacked Boeing and Airbus planes like 15 or 20 times in the last few years. He allegedly popped off the cover to an electronic box, something that's below the passenger seat. It controls in-flight entertainment. He connected the box to his own laptop using an ethernet cable and then wiggled his way from the entertainment system to the navigation systems, so the affidavit says, and even monitored traffic from the cockpit - all this remotely, of course, from his seat. In one instance, Roberts allegedly got control of an airplane engine and caused the plane to move sideways. MONTAGNE: All right. So those are his claims, and they sound terrifying, actually, if that all happened. Is it plausible? SHAHANI: Well, law enforcement officials have told NPR there's no credible information suggesting that he in fact did this. And we talked to a bunch of private security researchers who say it's unlikely as well. One guy who was hired to test cybersecurity for a large airline pointed out that in-flight entertainment is typically segmented, cordoned off, from the control networks for motion, so unlikely there. Though, another guy did point out that we are talking about software here and software constantly has to be patched. And if a patch was ever not done, for example, there is some plausibility, some feasibility of breaking in. MONTAGNE: Well, last month, federal auditors issued a pretty harsh report saying the FAA has to deal with what it called significant weaknesses in cybersecurity. What about the airlines? Are they concerned? SHAHANI: It seems they're very concerned, but (unintelligible) behind closed doors. They don't want to talk publicly about their concerns, though one aviation analyst told us that right now, airlines are dealing with the problem of frequent-flyer programs getting breached. MONTAGNE: Well, last week, United Airlines announced it's going to offer reward miles to some hackers. What's that about? SHAHANI: Yeah, that's an interesting developing here. United actually called the FBI to deal with Roberts because as he was boarding one of their planes, he made this careless tweet about sabotaging their systems. And now the airline is offering to reward hackers for finding bugs in the company's website and mobile apps, and they'll pay in miles. Key detail - they're not asking hackers to look at in-flight entertainment or navigation while in the air, so key detail for flyers. MONTAGNE: Aarti, thanks very much. SHAHANI: Thank you.

I'm Guy Raz. Our show today is about one of the things that humans have been searching for since the beginning of recorded history - the fountain of youth. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HARVEY FINEBERG: Suppose I said that with just a few changes in your genes, you could get a better memory - more precise, more accurate and quicker. Or maybe you'd like to be more fit, stronger, with more stamina. How about living longer with good health? RAZ: This is Harvey Fineberg speaking on the TED stage. He's a physician and a medical ethicist and the former dean of Harvard's Medical School. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)FINEBERG: Which would you like if you could have just one? How many would opt for memory? How about fitness? What about longevity? Oh, the majority - that makes me feel very good as a doctor. If you could have any one of these, it would be a very different world. RAZ: All the hands went up when you asked that question. FINEBERG: Yeah. RAZ: Everybody wants to live longer. FINEBERG: Most people do want to live longer. RAZ: Yeah. FINEBERG: But we want to live longer healthier. You know, we have a chronological age, and we have a psychological age. And we have a physical age, which is how many years compared to the average person are you in your state of health at a given age. We can't do anything about the chronological age. That's the passage of time. RAZ: Yeah. FINEBERG: We can do something about the psychological age and the physical age. How we live, what we eat, whether we exercise regularly - those are the choices that are within our power today. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: That's today, and many of us do make those choices. But Harvey Fineberg has researched an entirely new world of choices we might someday have, choices that might change how long we live and even how future humans evolve. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)FINEBERG: Evolution does not necessarily favor the longest-lived or the strongest or the fastest and not even the smartest. Evolution favors those creatures best adapted to their environment. So as we think about the place again of humans in evolution, I would say that there are a number of possibilities. The first is that we will not evolve. The second possibility is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind - natural, imposed by the forces of nature. But there's a third possibility, an enticing, intriguing and frightening possibility. I call it neo-evolution, the new evolution that is not simply natural but guided and chosen by us. What if you could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate stroke? Wouldn't you want to make those changes in your genes? If we look ahead, these kind of changes are going to be increasingly possible. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: Harvey Fineberg's idea is that the kinds of changes Cynthia Kenyon made in those tiny little C. elegans will one day be common in humans, that eventually, we'll be able to edit human genes - splice parts in, take things out - but not just in a gene that might help us live longer, but in all kinds of specific genes that make some of us more susceptible to certain diseases. FINEBERG: Just a year ago, mice that were specially bred to have a gene defect that was analogous to muscular dystrophy were treated in embryo form, and the mice that grew up were much less likely to have the expression of muscular dystrophy. That suggests that this technology may become a way to treat human disease or to prevent human genetic disease. RAZ: I mean, so could that also prevent the diseases of aging, like - where things like cancer or Alzheimer's might one day seem like diseases of the 19th century like scarlet fever or smallpox. FINEBERG: We think of many diseases as natural phenomenon. RAZ: Right. FINEBERG: Infection is natural. But it's avoidable, whether it's a vaccine today or a gene edit in a hundred years from today. RAZ: Wow. FINEBERG: And imagine a world where you're walking on the street, and you just can't tell if someone is 80 or 180 years of age. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: I mean, that's - that's crazy. FINEBERG: I don't think it's crazy. It's unlikely in the near-term. RAZ: Right. FINEBERG: But it's not inconceivable. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)FINEBERG: Imagine, then, just two other little changes. You can change the cells in your body, but what if you could change the cells in your offspring? Eliminate the diabetes. Eliminate the hemophilia. Reduce the risk of cancer. Who doesn't want healthier children? And then that same analytic technology, that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease will also enable us to adopt super attributes. That better memory - why not have the quick wit? Why not have the quick-twitch muscle that will enable you to run faster and longer? Why not live longer? And when we are at a position where we can pass it on to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes we want, we will have converted old-style evolution into neo-evolution. We'll take a process that normally might require 100,000 years, and we can compress it down to 1,000 years and maybe even in the next 100 years. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: I mean, of course, this raises a ton of ethical questions, right? FINEBERG: Absolutely. RAZ: I mean, like, you're talking about a future where we create people who have certain genetic advantages. FINEBERG: We can try to anticipate the ethical questions with technologies, but we're better, usually, at trying to deal with them when they are tangible and real. Any of these tools is going to be powerful enough that it would also be subject to misuse and inappropriate use, so it's very important, in my mind, that it be used under very strict control and legal and ethical conditions. But we won't be able to undo new knowledge. When we have that knowledge and we have problems that we're trying to fix, we will have tremendous desire to fix those problems. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)FINEBERG: These are choices that your grandchildren or their grandchildren are going to have before them. Will we use these choices to make a society that is better, or will we selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us and not for others of us? Will we make a society that is more boring and more uniform or more robust and more versatile? These are the kinds of questions that we will have to face. And most profoundly of all, will we ever be able to develop the wisdom and to inherit the wisdom that we'll need to make these choices wisely. For better or worse and sooner than you may think, these choices will be up to us. Thank you. (APPLAUSE, SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: Harvey Fineberg is a physician and a medical ethicist.

WEINER: In this episode, executives at Dunder Mifflin are creating an ad campaign designed to raise the company's profile. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE OFFICE\")JOHN KRASINSKI: (As Jim Halpert) I think it's great that the company's making a commercial because not very many people have heard of us. I mean, when I tell people that I work at Dunder Mifflin, they think that we sell mufflers or muffins or mittens or - and frankly, all those sound better than paper, so I let it slide. WEINER: In the real world, the paper business doesn't appear to be faring much better. THAD MCILROY: Right now, the only thing that's doing well is toilet tissue. WEINER: Thad McIlroy is a paper industry analyst. Not only are U. S. companies facing drops in demand, they're also confronting tough competition from the country that invented paper 2,000 years ago. MCILROY: China, oh, God, China dwarfs what we're doing. WEINER: Literally dwarfs. Chinese scientists have developed genetically modified trees that grow 10 times faster than regular ones, and the Chinese government pumps billions of dollars into the country's paper mills. Meanwhile, global demand for many kinds of paper, such as newsprint, is falling. MCILROY: You just look at the decline. It's so rapid, and to imagine that there's going to be any - like, why would that stop? WEINER: If I said here's a million dollars, invest it in the paper industry, which segment would you invest in? MCILROY: I wouldn't. I really wouldn't. I wouldn't touch it with a barge pole. WEINER: So paper is dead, right?

UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: (As character)  I'm not. JONATHAN ANDERSON: Business is strong for us, so we're actually sold more than we can produce right now. WEINER: Jonathan Anderson is the manager of the Sonoco Paper Mill in Richmond, Va. Like the character in the Monty Python script, he and his company are not dead yet, far from it. They've boosted production by 30 percent over the past decade and can barely keep up with demand for their recycled paper. The mill has been around since the 1950s. It hasn't changed much since then. They're using the same equipment - not the same kind of equipment mind you, but the very same machines. The process hasn't changed much either. First, the raw material - other people's trash - is loaded onto a conveyor belt, water is added, then it's all mixed together in a vat that, well, you wouldn't want to take a dip in. ANDERSON: This basically would be like a big blender. You're adding a lot of water, and you're just taking mechanical energy to break that box down into fibers again, single fibers. WEINER: It's like a river of sludge and cardboard. ANDERSON: It's basically just water and fiber, and it turns into a slurry. WEINER: That slurry is eventually converted into a finished product - giant rolls of paper stacked end-to-end used to make containers for Pringles Potato Chips or Planters Peanuts, products not threatened by the digital revolution. In fact, for some paper companies, the Internet has been a godsend. Every time you order something on Amazon, it arrives in a cardboard - that is paper - package. Other paper companies are retooling to produce high-end stock used in photo books, like those made by Shutterfly and Snapfish. Yes, paper companies are nimble and resourceful, yet, says Anderson, they still can't seem to get any respect. ANDERSON: You talk to another professional and you tell them that you make paper, and that's really not exciting, you know? A lot of times they're like, well, I make pharmaceuticals or I make computers, and you say, well, I make paper, and they're like OK; but then people don't realize that they don't get away from paper anywhere in their life. And so I think it's not the cool thing; but it's the necessity, and it's not going away. WEINER: Just look at the way paper has wormed its way into our culture, into our language. We paper-over problems no doubt caused by all those paper-pushers who leave no paper trail but turn out to be paper tigers; and don't forget, says historian and self-confessed bibliomaniac Nick Basbanes, paper is a technology, an extremely versatile one. NICK BASBANES: It's resilient. It's resourceful. It's portable. It's foldable. It's strong if you want it to be strong. It can last 500 years if that's the goal, or if it's a hygienic tissue, maybe its lifespan is five or six or 10 seconds, but it's still doing its job, isn't it? It's amazingly resourceful. WEINER: There are, in fact, some 20,000 uses for paper but none as remarkable and seductive as the book. Basbanes recalls the time he found himself in the presence of a 500-year-old Gutenberg Bible. BASBANES: I darn near fainted when I was allowed to hold it in my hands. I mean, it was one of the great moments of my life to be allowed to touch where metal type bit into paper for the first time. WEINER: Would you have had the same reaction if you were looking at a digital copy of the Gutenberg Bible? In other words. . . BASBANES: No, no. I can answer that. WEINER: . . . What. . . BASBANES: You don't even have to finish the question. The answer is no (laughter) not at all. You know, there's something about the real thing, isn't it? And I think we're really having an appreciation for that as we really kind of dig a little further into the 21st century. What is it about the artifact, the material object, that really kind of makes people stop and say, wow, handling the real thing as opposed to the virtual copy. WEINER: He's not worried about paper's future. We may use less of it in coming years, but a paperless society, he says, is about as likely as a paperless bathroom. For NPR News, I'm Eric Weiner.

WEINER: Not just any paper, a small black notebook with an elastic band and a storied past. Picasso and Hemingway used an early version of the Moleskine, and now for 11. 99 plus tax, you can, too. The Italian company that makes Moleskine's - all 500 versions - is red hot, consistently recording double-digit sales growth. Oddly enough, the analog company's success has grown in tandem with the digital revolution. In fact, the company noticed something even stranger - a direct correlation between sales of their little black notebooks and proximity to an Apple Store.

Not that long ago, she found herself adrift professionally and emotionally, so she sought out a planner, a paper planner. None felt quite right, so she designed her own. Smelling a business opportunity, she launched this Kickstarter campaign. She was aiming for $10,000. She raised more than half a million. TRINIDAD: We went viral for a whole week, and it was insane. WEINER: Friends urged her to launch a digital version of her planner, but she resisted. TRINIDAD: And I put my foot down, and I said no. I said no apps. WEINER: She has nothing against apps. Her smartphone is chockablock with them, but she finds paper more intimate. TRINIDAD: It's this thing that is so intuitive, and it's between you and paper and a pen, and its kind of meditative I think whenever I make a mind-map of what I'm thinking or whenever I'm drawing that I feel - like, when I'm on my phone, it's never meditative.

It's called Lifeline. It's been around since 1985. Last year, about 12 million households were in the program, and now the chairman of the FCC wants to expand it so it can also help pay for broadband Internet. NPR's Brian Naylor has more. BRIAN NAYLOR, BYLINE: When it comes to the Internet, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler says there are the haves and the have-nots. Ninety-five percent of households with incomes over $150,000 a year have broadband access, he says, but just 48 percent of households making under $25,000 do. Villy Wang is founder of a San Francisco-based nonprofit called Baycat, which teaches low-income young people how to design websites and produce digital media. VILLY WANG: Getting subsidies for use of the Internet for greater access is important as a part of a way to keep bridging the digital divide that is alive and well. NAYLOR: FCC Chairman Wheeler today proposed to allow Lifeline recipients to use the subsidy - $9. 25 a month - to help pay for broadband access, not just phone service. Lifeline is funded by phone companies and consumers. It's the universal service fee you see on your phone bill. Kristine DeBry, a vice president at Public Knowledge, a consumer advocacy group, says Internet access is a necessity in the digital age no matter your income group. KRISTINE DEBRY: Low-income consumers are no different than anyone else in terms of how they need to communicate with doctors or schools or, you know, teachers, job applications. And this would just be a way to help low-income consumers to afford to be able to participate in society that way. NAYLOR: In a statement, Wheeler notes that 80 percent of the job openings of the Fortune 500 largest companies are posted online. Students use the Internet for tracking assignments and homework. Wang says for young people especially, an Internet connection is a way of being part of a community. WANG: Kids love to use the Internet for social media. And, you know, it doesn't matter what neighborhood you're from or how much you make, people want to belong to that bigger social media society on the Internet. NAYLOR: To be eligible for Lifeline, which was started under Ronald Reagan, recipient's incomes must be at or less than 135 percent of the government's poverty line or be enrolled in programs including Medicaid or food stamps. But critics say the program is susceptible to abuse. Republican Sen. David Vitter of Louisiana says in a statement that the program is full of fraud and why the FCC wants to expand it is, quote, \"beyond me. \" FCC Chairman Wheeler says he wants to overhaul the way eligibility for Lifeline is determined but did not go into details. A Senate panel has scheduled a hearing on the program next month. Brian Naylor, NPR News, Washington.

VILLY WANG: Getting subsidies for use of the Internet for greater access is important as a part of a way to keep bridging the digital divide that is alive and well. NAYLOR: FCC Chairman Wheeler today proposed to allow Lifeline recipients to use the subsidy - $9. 25 a month - to help pay for broadband access, not just phone service. Lifeline is funded by phone companies and consumers. It's the universal service fee you see on your phone bill. Kristine DeBry, a vice president at Public Knowledge, a consumer advocacy group, says Internet access is a necessity in the digital age no matter your income group. KRISTINE DEBRY: Low-income consumers are no different than anyone else in terms of how they need to communicate with doctors or schools or, you know, teachers, job applications. And this would just be a way to help low-income consumers to afford to be able to participate in society that way. NAYLOR: In a statement, Wheeler notes that 80 percent of the job openings of the Fortune 500 largest companies are posted online. Students use the Internet for tracking assignments and homework. Wang says for young people especially, an Internet connection is a way of being part of a community. WANG: Kids love to use the Internet for social media. And, you know, it doesn't matter what neighborhood you're from or how much you make, people want to belong to that bigger social media society on the Internet. NAYLOR: To be eligible for Lifeline, which was started under Ronald Reagan, recipient's incomes must be at or less than 135 percent of the government's poverty line or be enrolled in programs including Medicaid or food stamps. But critics say the program is susceptible to abuse. Republican Sen. David Vitter of Louisiana says in a statement that the program is full of fraud and why the FCC wants to expand it is, quote, \"beyond me. \" FCC Chairman Wheeler says he wants to overhaul the way eligibility for Lifeline is determined but did not go into details. A Senate panel has scheduled a hearing on the program next month. Brian Naylor, NPR News, Washington.", "section": "Technology", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2015 NPR.  All rights reserved.

As part of our series we're calling the Paper Trail, here's author and former NPR correspondent Eric Weiner. JIM TOOLE: Welcome. ERIC WEINER, BYLINE: If the book is dead, nobody bothered to tell the folks at this store in Washington, D. C. Books of every size, shape and genre occupy each square inch of the converted row house, including the bathroom, all arranged in order discernible only to Jim Toole, the endearingly grouchy owner of Capitol Hill Books. TOOLE: Fiction upstairs, nonfiction this level. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: OK. TOOLE: Many, many exceptions to that statement. (LAUGHTER)WEINER: Visitors are greeted by a makeshift sign announcing words that are banned in the store, such as awesome and totally, and most of all, Amazon. The online giant has crushed many an independent bookstore, but not Jim Toole's; not yet. TOOLE: Hanging in here with my fingernails. WEINER: Mighty strong fingernails, it turns out. Lately, independent bookstores like this one are enjoying a mini-revival; their numbers swelling 25 percent in the past few years. It's a revival fueled, at least in part, by digital natives, like 19-year-old Lindsay, who prefers paper books to e-readers, like the Amazon Kindle. LINDSAY: I don't have a Kindle. Kindles kind of freak me out. WEINER: Or 23-year-old Ross Destiche, who I find hauling an armful of books to the register. ROSS DESTICHE: Nothing matches the feel and the smell of a book. There's something special about holding it in your hand and knowing that that's the same story every time, and you can rely on that story to be with you. DAVID GELERNTER: Then there's a perfect design. It's made to fit human hands and humanize in human laps in the way that computers are not. WEINER: That's David Gelernter. He is, in some ways, the last person you'd expect to defend the old-fashioned book. A computer scientist, he helped pioneer advances like parallel computation and nearly paid with his life. In 1993, a package addressed to him exploded. It was sent by Ted Kaczynski, the so-called Unabomber, who was targeting people with the forefront of technological change. But David Gelernter admires the classic book known as \"The Codex\" and wonders why we're in such a hurry to discard it. GELERNTER: It's not as if books have lost an argument. The problem is there hasn't been an argument. Technology always gets a free pass, and we never sit down and say, are we sure that we want to abolish handwriting and stuff like that? There are no such debates. People don't ask themselves these questions. By and large, they take it for granted that if the technology is new, it must be better. WEINER: So is a digital book better than a printed one? The research results are mixed. Some studies find we absorb less material digitally while others find no discernible difference. One thing that is clear is. . . MARYANNE WOLF: That we are not only what we read but how we read. WEINER: That's Maryanne Wolf. She's a professor at Tufts University and author of a book on the reading brain. It's a subject she studies full time, so she assumes she was immune to the cognitive pitfalls that she catalogs in others. She was wrong. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: And in the course of our long tradition. . . WEINER: One evening, she picked up a favorite book, \"The Glass Bead Game\" by Hermann Hesse. The words didn't register. She found herself reading and re-reading the same paragraph, the same sentence. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: It is no longer even possible to determine their original name. It is, you know, no longer even possible to determine their original name. WOLF: It was like a slug fest. WEINER: Nothing was sinking in. WOLF: I could not immerse myself. It was the slowest, almost, sorghum - I can liken it only to molasses and sorghed (ph) experience of reading. I didn't like the book, I didn't want to experience it anymore, and I thrust it aside. WEINER: It took her two full weeks to return to the sort of immersive reading she had once been capable of. Her brain, she realized, had been altered - physically altered - by all of the scanning and flitting she had done during the day. WOLF: For me, the great lesson was that what we do during the day bleeds over into what we do during the night. The immersion online is always, in some ways, shadowed, if you will, by this constant reminder that we should be doing something else, too. That our email is just a click away, that there is this almost incessant feeling of, well, I should go faster. WEINER: Wolf is no Luddite and fully embraces what she calls the bi-literate brain, one equally at home in the digital and analog worlds, but warns that e-readers can deceive us. One study found that young students, digital natives, absorb material better on paper than on screen, even though they were convinced the opposite was true. WOLF: I think there's much we do not understand still about the advantages of this 2,000-year-old medium, and I am loathe to make it resemble this other entity. Rather, I would like to have both available. WEINER: Publishers seem to agree. THAD MCILROY: The books just look better. They just look better. WEINER: That's Thad McIlroy, a paper industry analyst. Rather than trying to out-digital the digital revolution, he says, publishing houses are turning to the natural strengths of paper. In other words, they're embracing their bookiness. MCILROY: Companies are saying we're going to spend more on covers. We're going to spend more on deckle paper, you know, all of that sort of thing. And, you know, those are the kind of things that are going to keep books with us for some time to come. WEINER: Just maybe, he says, for another 2,000 years. For NPR News, I'm Eric Weiner.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"HALT AND CATCH FIRE\")LEE PACE: (As Joe MacMillan) Now, tell me one thing that will be true about computers 10 years from now. MACKENZIE DAVIS: (As Cameron Howe) Computers will be connected together across one network with a standard protocol. PACE: (As Joe MacMillan) Like phone lines. DAVIS: (As Cameron Howe) Obviously phone lines. PACE: (As Joe MacMillan) What's your name? DAVIS: (As Cameron Howe) Cameron. GREENE: Cameron Howe is a very young, punk loner who intimidates her colleagues. As the second season begins, she has just founded an early Internet gaming startup. Mackenzie Davis, the actress who plays Cameron, says she was excited to explore the roots of the tech era. Are you a math whiz or a tech whiz or. . . DAVIS: No (laughter). No, I just play one on TV. GREENE: So what drew you to it then? I mean, why that subject matter? What did you find appealing? DAVIS: Well, because - I mean, tech stuff is no longer for an elite group of people. It's for everybody. It consumes my life whether I want it to or not. It's always the third person in the room. So I think uncovering where that began is of interest to even the most challenged person with technology. GREENE: Mackenzie Davis tells us she prepared for her character, well, how else? With that third person in the room online. DAVIS: Auditing the, like, open courseware online at, like, MIT Python programming classes and really trying to get into the mindset of a college student in these, I mean, only intro programming classes that were completely. . . GREENE: Wow, but you were actually taking some online classes from MIT to get ready for this? DAVIS: I was watching them. . . GREENE: Watching them, OK. DAVIS: . . . And taking notes and trying to keep up. There was a period of time where I was just locked in my apartment and doing so much sort of tech-heavy research and trying to learn as much about the inner workings of a computer and just have that be second nature to me. And I emerged one day and was talking to a friend about all the works that I've been doing and they were like, so how does a computer actually work? And I couldn't create an analogy. I had just consumed information, but I hadn't, you know, digested it and was able to process it and share it with them. And I realized that it might be all for not at that point. GREENE: Cameron names some of what she develops after people. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"HALT AND CATCH FIRE\")UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As character #1) You guys thought of a name yet? DAVIS: (As Cameron Howe) Excuse me. I wrote the bios. I name it - Lovelace. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: (As character #2) Lovelace. (LAUGHTER)DAVIS: (As Cameron Howe) Not Linda Lovelace, you pervs. Ada Lovelace, as in the first computer programmer ever. DAVIS: Ada Lovelace was actually Lord Byron's daughter - the poet. And she is the mother of modern coding. I mean, she alongside several other people in her day were interested in sort of automatons and just early punch card coding computers. And she was this genius that became this figurehead for both the entire industry and for female coders. GREENE: There are different portrayals of women, I feel like, operating in what can traditionally be seen as sort of a male world. How would you describe Cameron in that role? DAVIS: I always view Cameron and Donna as interesting feminist foils to each other. GREENE: Donna's the other lead female role. DAVIS: Donna's the other lead female role played by Kerry Bishe. She was working at TI in the first season and she now works for my company in the second season. GREENE: Texas Instruments. . . DAVIS: Texas Instruments, right, yeah, yeah. GREENE: . . . Which was a huge powerhouse at the time. DAVIS: Yeah, yeah, and she's an absolute genius in her own right, but she is maybe 10 years older than Cameron and has had to fight very hard for everything. And Cameron is sort of receiving the benefits of her long fight. And so any instance in which she encounters a whisper of sexism or doubt from people, either she won't register it 'cause she's so blind to anybody doubting her abilities 'cause it's always been that she was the smartest person in the room and it had very little to do with her gender, or she's completely bowled over 'cause she's just been lucky to exist in this realm in which it's survival of the fittest mind. GREENE: And do you feel like that stays true to what was happening in the 1980s? Is that part of sort of this story that we don't hear as much about? DAVIS: I would think so. I mean, these aren't characters that are based off of true people, but I think tech was a more inclusive environment in the 1980s than it is now. It's always a little alarming to me when I hear figures and go to events and see such underrepresentation of women in the room. GREENE: Well - but, I mean, Cameron and Donna, they're such prominent characters. I mean, was this the writers who wanted to put these characters really at the center of the story? DAVIS: Yeah, I think so. I mean, I think that that's the interesting story to tell. I mean, I think all of the characters have really interesting stories. But, I mean, as a viewer I'm personally less interested in the damaged, white, middle-class male figuring out his dreams and more interested in maybe an underdog figuring out how they're going to survive in a world that doesn't necessarily invite them in. GREENE: Well, you say you do events with people in the industry. What do women who work in this field tell you if they've seen the show and they meet you? DAVIS: There are not a lot of women that I've met. It's primarily men that have talked about their experiences in tech, either at this time or now. But as far as women sharing their personal experiences with me, I haven't had a lot of experience with it. GREENE: And does that just tell us something about the number of women out there in this field? DAVIS: I think so, or people don't just reach out to people to talk about their lives that often. But there hasn't been a lot of opportunity in my experience. GREENE: You know, I still am thinking back to when you mentioned that technology is, like, the third person in the room. DAVIS: Yeah. GREENE: I mean, when we're on a device or on a computer or doing anything related to technology, which, as you said, is almost all the time, is there a message you want us to get from watching the show? DAVIS: What I think about a lot with the show is people thinking that they know best; that they're creating something that is in any way intrinsically good and that they can unleash this thing on the world and that it will be in line with the ideals under which it was created. GREENE: Now, what is the danger and risk if they're not thinking about the impact of what they're creating? DAVIS: I think it's - the danger is more that the Internet and computers are not a reprieve from the real world. They will eventually replicate all of the dynamics we have. I mean, there are Internet wars. There are Internet popularity contests. There are very good people creating beautiful content and expanding your mind, and there are very bad people seeking to destroy others. GREENE: It sounds like you're describing sort of in 2015 we are seeing both the good and the bad of what was created in a very raw and organic way back in the '80s.

(SOUNDBITE OF GOOGLE CONFERENCE)SABHARWAL: The recent ones are at the top, and I can go back to when she was four years old as a flower girl in my wedding. But what's amazing is I can go all the way back to the week she was born. SYDELL: Facial recognition is fairly common, but the app can also group by dog breed. It even recognizes monuments and food. It got all my food pics right but one, which was actually a Petri dish of volcanic rock, but not bad. The app works across your devices. It's private and has free unlimited storage, though it does compress the photos. Still, it's a competitive world for photo apps. Analyst Rob Enderle thinks Google Photos is the best he's seen, but most people are already storing photos elsewhere. ROB ENDERLE: The idea of moving those pictures becomes daunting, and so you can't be just a little better, you have to be enough better to motivate somebody to move. Or you have to go up to people that have never put their pictures up or just have a few pictures up on another service. SYDELL: Which at this point, may not be very many of us.

THOMAS HIRSCHMANN: We're talking to cities, developers, architects and institutions. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: Thomas Hirschmann was at the National Building Museum here in Washington, D. C. , to show off his company. It's called The Third Fate. They had used virtual reality gear to record a temporary museum exhibit - a huge wooden labyrinth. And now. . . HIRSCHMANN: The maze is gone. They've torn it down, but we've captured the experience. Using a special camera rig, we documented that experience and recorded it in 360. Now within this VR headset, you're actually able to walk in and stand in the middle of the maze in the great hall here at the building museum and experience it as if it's there again. CORNISH: Hirschmann also envisions a future where builders and architects use virtual reality to show off designs before they're constructed. HIRSCHMANN: For an architect, you know, when you're even going in to talk with a potential client, you know, you bring in drawings, you bring in great photography. But what if you could bring your buildings with you? It's eventually - it's going to become more and more commonplace. It just - it's a natural fit with the built environment and architecture. It really works. BLOCK: Well, how about a quick virtual reality check on all this enthusiasm? Dan Tynan is a columnist for Yahoo Tech magazine. He's tried a bunch of virtual reality prototypes. DAN TYNAN: I have, you know, been the dork wearing the glasses. I have seen the other dorks wearing the glasses. CORNISH: And Dan Tynan suggests those big black goggles pose a problem. TYNAN: If you've ever seen anyone with a virtual reality headset on, they look like they're wearing scuba glasses that have been blacked out and they look like a blind person groping in a room because they're moving their hands around and moving things you can't see. So it's not a very social thing. BLOCK: Tynan says no doubt there's a market for virtual reality, but it'll have to overcome the social awkwardness. He says there's another technology that does that. It uses glasses that you see right through. TYNAN: I really think that most of those, you know, enterprise, architecture, medical university applications are going to use something called augmented reality. You know, you still put on, you know, geeky glasses and you still see things that aren't there in the physical world, but you also see the physical world. CORNISH: Like with Google Glass. Of course, that's another product that has yet to take off. BLOCK: The major factor in determining the long run commercial success of virtual reality will be revenue. Is there money to be made? And that will probably include advertising. Adweek reported this weekend that Mountain Dew and Volvo are among the companies experimenting with immersive virtual reality ads.

I'm Terry Gross. The Apple Watch has been one of the most highly anticipated devices of the decade. Billed as Apple's latest revolutionary product, the watch is a screen on your wrist with its own operating system and software. And as our technology correspondent Alexis Madrigal explains, it just might steal back some of your time from the attention hogging phone in your pocket. ALEXIS MADRIGAL, BYLINE: The Apple Watch is not what I expected. Yes, it's beautiful. You can stand in the shower and watch water bounce off the screen as if it were a lotus leaf. The details of the hardware can be stunning like that. But most of the features that really excited me when the watch was introduced have turned out to be disappointments. As a physical activity tracker, it's mediocre. The messaging system, which Apple seemingly lavished attention on, is no better than regular old texting. The hyped crown scroll wheel for navigation is a rarely used flourish. And yet, I still love the watch. I never want to take it off. It's a secondary device, a powerful extension of what your phone can do. And so you must have an iPhone to use an Apple Watch. The watch uses the phone's data network to do any and everything. With a glance, I can see the time, the date, my next calendar appointment, the temperature, my day's physical activity and the watches battery level. So why do I love it? It lets me do the business of communicating without the temptations that come with my phone. That was Apple's pitch in the weeks leading up to the launch in late April - that this would be a device that gives you back time and even focused attention. I was skeptical, given that its primary function is to notify you that stuff is going on on your phone, and yet, it does work. Before I got the watch, every text message or notification was an opportunity for prolonged distraction. I had to pull out my phone, and once it was out, what was there to prevent me from checking my Facebook page or Twitter or Instagram or maybe all of them? With the watch, the message comes in and I can deal solely with it without those other icons tempting me. And the watch parses incoming messages, anticipates my response, and provides a few contextual answers, like I'm on my way if someone says are you there yet, or yes and no when it detects that kind of incoming question. The computer's textual interpretation is not that deep, but it doesn't have to be to give genuinely useful options. Between the auto-responses and using voice-to-text, I find I don't need to type anything for most of the exchanges that I have during the day. The voice-to-text feature is particularly impressive. As long as the answer isn't too complex, the watch handles most text message level communications with ease. When you sync your watch and phone, watch apps that correspond to your phone apps just appear. And the genius of the watch is that its apps work differently from the ones on your mobile device. Each tends to deliver a single function through the watch. If it's Uber, that function is to call a car. If it's Trulia, it's to look for home listings right around you. If it's ESPN, it's to give you scores for your favorite teams. Bloated apps get stripped down to their essential utility. The single-serving app is a radical idea, and it doesn't always work well. The Twitter app lets you read the five most recent tweets in your feed. It feels silly. Instagram's app, on the other hand, is almost a recreation of its phone app, and it feels bulky. While many people worried about the watch's battery life, I can say that it's good enough to easily make it through a day, maybe two with light use, and charging is rapid. But what I did not anticipate was how much of a drain the watch would be on my phone. I still have an iPhone 5S, a phone that's a little over a year old, and it hasn't made it a full day since I got the watch, even on days when I'm not using it heavily. One night, I went to bed with the watch on and my phone next to me at 100 percent charge. When I woke up seven hours later, despite not having touched my phone or my watch, my phone's battery life had dropped to 69 percent. That's a lot of battery to lose for a night's worth of idle chatter between my watch and phone. In fact, the watch has taken such a toll on my phone's battery that I bought one of those cases that contains an extra battery. If you've got an older phone model, expect similar problems. Unlike the smartphone, which transformed the way I did just about everything, the Apple Watch slid into my life seamlessly. Within days, it had become an essential part of how I communicate with others and parse my days. The watch is not the revolution that the iPhone was. Rather, it's a reaction to the power and addictiveness of our phones, a helpful supplementary tool to manage my own psychology. And for me, at least, that's been worth the price.

Here to talk about all this is NPR's media correspondent David Folkenflik in New York. David, thanks very much for being with us. DAVID FOLKENFLIK, BYLINE: Of course. SIMON: So this is - for the most part I think it's fair to say Snapchat's known as an app for - people sometimes send silly pictures to each other. It's changing into something more. FOLKENFLIK: Yeah, well, it's still extremely popular among young people in particular. Pew recently had a study out saying two-fifths of teens between the ages of 13 and 17 use Snapchat frequently, so that's a pretty high number. Facebook, obviously, is still the monster, but I think it is evolving. You're seeing journalists and other people figuring out ways to take advantage of these really brief videos. You know, there are two things about them - they're brief and they go away. And so, you know, it offers an informality, an unstudied way of sharing a private moment, of sharing a quick insight that'll - is fleeting enough that it might disappear once you stop thinking about it. And therefore people are trying to play with the medium and seeing what they can get out of it. SIMON: But, surely, the whole idea of creating original content is for it not to disappear, isn't it? FOLKENFLIK: Well, you know, think about what original content means here. Original content means that they want stuff that is organic to the site. One of the things that is true about Snapchat is that it is purely mobile. You can't sign online at work. . . SIMON: Yeah. FOLKENFLIK: And take a look at it, so you're not going to get it later if you don't happen to have your - your iPhone or your Android close at hand. The second thing is that it's vertical, so you have to shoot it with that in mind, whether it's a picture with some sort of crudely-written caption that you can do on the app or whether it's one of these short videos or bursts of short videos they call a story if you collect these little collections of short videos together. The original content they do, they say they want to partner with people. So, for example, Madonna debuted a video that was designed for Snapchat earlier this year. They've got another musical group that's doing that as well. And they're finding ways to figure out how to take advantage of this new platform to tell stories in a distinctive way that'll keep people coming back. SIMON: Sean Mills from The Onion; Marcus Wiley from Fox recently joined the content and development teams. What do you think the implications of having those two creative types are? FOLKENFLIK: Well, I think it's - they're looking for ways to showcase what Snapchat does. Just as Buzzfeed, you know, really makes its money almost exclusively by dint of showing off to advertisers that they can create branded content that can go just as viral as the listicles of cute animals that we've come to know in recent years that Buzzfeed will share with us on various social media platforms. So Snapchat, too, wants to be able to show off what it can do to potential advertisers. And in so doing, they've got within Snapchat something called the Snap Channel that they are, you know, intending to develop some of their own content for. And I think this is an effort at doing that. SIMON: And opportunities for journalism appear. FOLKENFLIK: Well, you know, Snapchat has this Discover feature where it has partners. And this is the way in which Snapchat intends to go forward - not to build a newsroom of its own, but to partner with other folks - folks like Cosmo. , CNN. Vice has done a number of very - not only visually arresting things, but meaningful things where they create videos and create elements and stories that are specific for Snapchat. And one of the things that, you know, is intended to hook people and make them feel compelled to look at it every day is that the stuff just will disappear after a certain amount of time. It's either here or it's gone. Now, that's not what we think of as journalism. If something's. . . SIMON: Yeah. FOLKENFLIK: Ephemeral, it disappears; there's not a record of it. It's not likely to be an outlet that's going to hold people accountable. But if it's a new way for established brands to reach people, they want to be there.

OPM says it will begin to notify people who may have had data taken from them on Monday, as NPR's Aarti Shahani reports. AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: OPM can't know for sure what data the hackers copied and pasted, but the agency says it'll be as specific as possible when informing people. And OPM will offer victims 18 months of credit monitoring, as well as up to $1 million in cyber insurance coverage. Critics say that's not meaningful protection.

PRISCO: Now that it's in the hands of criminals, they have no obligation to keep the information confidential. And the information can be used for espionage, but it also can be used to take out credit.

S. have shot and killed nearly 400 people, according to a Washington Post analysis. And among the many who were not armed, two-thirds were black or Hispanic. Bringing attention to those deaths is the movement and slogan, Black Lives Matter. NPR's Michel Martin spoke with one of the organization's founders. MICHEL MARTIN, BYLINE: In 2013, after George Zimmerman was acquitted for killing 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Florida, a woman in California wrote an emotional Facebook post that ended with the words, our lives matter, black lives matter. Her friend, Patrisse Cullors, turned that into a hashtag, which has now gone global and sparked a movement. And I'm joined now by Patrisse Cullors to find out more. Patrisse, welcome. Thank you so much for speaking with us. PATRISSE CULLORS: Thanks for having me. MARTIN: Can you take me back to when your friend, Alicia Garza, wrote the piece and when you added the hashtag to the phrase Black Lives Matter? And I wonder if you could tell us if you had any particular hopes in that moment? CULLORS: You know, the moment George Zimmerman was acquitted, I said, this is dangerous. This is dangerous for our country. This is dangerous for the narrative around the devaluing of black life. And I was searching on social media to sort of understand what was happening. And when I finally reached Alicia Garza's love note to black people and that last, you know, black lives matter just like hit me in the gut. And I felt like this could be big, and I said to Alicia, #BlackLivesMatter - let's use this as something to develop a new narrative around what it means to believe and fight for black life. And I wanted it to go global. I didn't think I understood that it was going to go global. And now that it has, it's awe-inspiring, and it's also a lot of responsibility because it means that we're trying to figure out what's the next way forward. MARTIN: I wanted to ask you about that because one of the critiques of the movement is from people who say, now that we've elevated the issue, what are you leading us to do? And then the other critique is that it doesn't address the many ways in which African-American lives have been lost in violence within the community. CULLORS: Yes. Policy change, it's work I've been doing since I was 16 years old, so I understand the value of that work, and I think there's a myth that that work isn't happening. We are deeply entrenched in changing policies, but policy doesn't change the culture. You can have Jim Crow laws change, but we still have Jim Crow hate. And so Black Lives Matter reminds people that black people are human, but more importantly it reminds black people that we are human. It reminds black people that we have total agency to change our conditions. And so I think that lends a second question which is, why don't we talk about black-on-black crime? You know, this is a tricky question because it sort of points the question as if there isn't white-on-white crime or Latino-on-Latino crime. That's actually not the issue to me. The issue is what allows for those conditions to push people to enact harm. And so when you're living in abject poverty, when you're living amongst significant amount of violence - we have to look at the root causes, right? So if we're telling black people to pull up their pants, to change their behaviors, but we're not actually calling on the state to ensure that we have jobs, to ensure that we can feed our children, that's just a false way to deal with the actual problems. And so it's not that we don't want to talk about the violence that's happening in our communities. I just think that the way we talk about it is different. MARTIN: You know, of course many people in law enforcement would say that they engage in these actions in order to protect people within the community who are being preyed upon by other members of that community. What would you say to that? CULLORS: I think that's false. I think we need to redefine what public safety means. Public safety looks like the ability to be able to go to a job on a daily basis, the ability to have shelter, have access to healthy food. That's what public safety looks like. And if we continue to believe as a country that public safety exists in courtrooms and jail cells with people who wear badges, we are going to see more and more killings. We are going to see more and more harassment. And it's our job as community members to redefine and imagine a new way of living. MARTIN: You said that you've been an activist since you were 16. What made you an activist at that age? CULLORS: I grew up in Los Angeles, born and raised. LAPD patrolled my block daily. I witnessed a significant amount of state violence. I remember my home being raided at the age of 8 - the battery ram knocking my door down, then LAPD searching for my uncle. I remember at probably age 9, LAPD once again coming in our home. My mom had done nothing. They had handcuffed her. And I remember the shame she felt. I remember feeling also humiliated. And I remember my single mother, who was probably under 30 at the time - she's a teenage mom, worked three jobs, worked really hard for us - and just feeling like LAPD in particular had no respect for the lives of my family and the community around me and just feeling really hurt and angry at a young age and trying to understand why this was OK. And by the time I was 13, most of the boys in my community had been jailed. By the time I was 16, my brother was incarcerated in the county jails and was brutally beaten by the sheriff's department. And at that point, I realized there's something wrong with the system. This isn't about individual officers. This is about a culture of violence that exists inside law enforcement. And by the time I was 23, my brother and my father that raised me had spent most of their life in prison or jail because of the war on drugs. And I knew that the system didn't actually care to rehabilitate black communities. So for me, I had no choice but to be an activist. I was searching for something else outside of what I was witnessing, and I was searching for a way to find my dignity. This conversation for me is about the dignity of my family and my community, the dignity of black people because our dignity is lost at a very, very young age.

This is a milestone in the long-running fight over the future of the Internet. Big phone and cable companies had asked a federal appeals court to stay the rules. Yesterday, the court declined. As NPR's Joel Rose reports, it is hardly the last challenge the new rules will face. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: When you turned on your smartphone or computer or tablet today, you probably noticed that - actually, you probably didn't notice anything different at all. MATT WOOD: We feel like we've won a big victory, but the victory is that nothing much is changing. ROSE: Matt Wood is the policy director at Free Press, a Washington, D. C. nonprofit that spent the past decade pushing for strong open-Internet rules. WOOD: This was always about preserving the rights we've always had and keeping users in control of their Internet experience. And the cable company or the phone company can't try to make those choices for you. ROSE: The new rules require phone and cable companies to treat all of the traffic on their networks equally. Supporters say that's needed to stop your broadband provider from blocking or slowing the websites of its competitors or from charging companies like Amazon and Netflix more to get their data to you faster. But big phone and cable companies say the rules aren't necessary, and they're suing to overturn them. John Banks is a senior vice president at U. S. Telecom, an industry trade group that represents AT&T and Verizon, among others. JOHN BANKS: We've all subscribed to open Internet principles that say no blocking, no throttling, our companies don't do that. ROSE: But in 2007, the cable company Comcast was caught throttling. The Federal Communications Commission has tried before to craft similar rules, but they were struck down in court, so the FCC tried a different approach - regulating Internet access like an essential public utility, under laws that were originally written for the telephone. John Banks at U. S. Telecom says that's a mistake. BANKS: The idea that the Internet is like telephone service is a deeply scary one for consumers and businesses everywhere that I think, really, will slow down innovation and make the Internet, you know, a less cool place for people. ROSE: But Matt Wood at Free Press says tough, utility-style rules are the only way to keep giant phone and cable companies from abusing their power. WOOD: What they really don't like is having firm authority and an agency with teeth and with the ability to enforce these rules and protect Internet-users against cable and phone company transgressions. ROSE: Right now, the FCC is facing nearly a dozen lawsuits seeking to block the new rules. One of them comes from Voice Communication Exchange, a Washington, D. C. nonprofit founded by Daniel Berninger. DANIEL BERNINGER: For 20 years, we've been able to solve all these issues as they've arisen without the FCC coming in. ROSE: The Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit says it will expedite the case, with oral arguments as soon as December. That's not the only challenge to the FCC's rules. This week, Republicans in Congress inserted language into a House appropriations bill that would block funding for the FCC to enforce its rules until all legal challenges are resolved, a process that could take years.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: 11:54. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Fifty-five. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Time for some number crunching from our data expert Mona Chalabi from fivethirtyeight. com. She has given us this number of the week. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Sixty-five. MARTIN: That's the number of days it took for a group social experiment to play out on Reddit. The discussion site presented users with a 60-second timer known as the button. Press the button, and the timer would stop counting down from 60 seconds. Every time someone clicked the button, the timer reset and began the countdown again. More than one million people pressed the button before the timer reached zero. Why would anyone want to do this, and what in the world did this experiment mean? Here to explain is Mona Chalabi. Hey, Mona. MONA CHALABI: Hi, Rachel. MARTIN: OK, so this whole thing began on April 1. Reddit explained the whole thing to its users. The only rule was that people could only click once. But what was interesting about this was that people chose to click at different intervals within the 60 seconds, right? CHALABI: So users also got assigned a little circle next to their usernames. And the color of that circle indicates how long they had managed to wait before pressing the button. Now, let's say you only let the timer get down to 52 seconds before you pressed, then you'd get a purple circle. And the thing that's interesting from my perspective is Reddit was collecting and sharing data on what hundreds of thousands of users were doing. So we know that 58 percent of users had purple circles. And the people who waited less than 11 seconds were given a red circle. And they were only six percent of all users. Anyway this whole thing went on for a while as you said. And on June 5, 65 days after the experiment started, the timer finally managed to make it all the way down to zero with no one pressing the button to stop it. MARTIN: OK, so a reminder, every time someone clicked, it reset. You're saying it finally ran out, no one clicked. Then did the world as we know it end? Like, what happened? CHALABI: Nothing, absolutely nothing. The experiment just ended. MARTIN: So why does this matter? What did we learn from this? CHALABI: It's incredibly bizarre, but Reddit users cared a lot about this button. During the experiment, they quickly split up into dozens of factions based on those color-coded circles that I mentioned. MARTIN: Right. CHALABI: And they gave those groups meanings. They almost became mini clans; some even referred to as religions. So those that had purple circles - and again, they're the one's that didn't make it past 52 seconds - were a part of the violent hand. And then there were the illuminati, the emerald council, the orange revolution. And finally, those who had waited until the final 10 seconds were part of the red guard. MARTIN: Wait, so the people who were participating in this experiment, they were so attached to this that they created their own world with social relationships? This is bizarre. CHALABI: Completely, spontaneously with no direction from Reddit, the site that kind of created this. And they even kind of contributed characters to those different groups as well. So those who abstain and don't press the button, they kind of grayed out. They have a motto saying remain pure. Those who are labeled as purple are considered as kind of inpatient because, as I said, they didn't make it down to 52 seconds. And the red who old off for ages and only succumb to pressing the button in those last 10 seconds think of themselves as a little heroic. MARTIN: What is the takeaway from this? I mean, what did Reddit learn from this experiment, and - dare I ask - are there larger applications for what this means? CHALABI: Well, some people think so. Researchers at the Brookings Institution, they outlined in an article some reasons why the button is of interest to policymakers. One, they noted that the button pressers don't actually share any clear common interest with each other. And two, they had no strong incentive to participate, financial or otherwise, and yet they did. Against all the odds, the Reddit button people really got engaged. So the researchers think that public projects could take a lesson away from Reddit in getting people to engage more and participate. MARTIN: I have so many more questions, Mona, but we're going to have to leave it there. Mona Chalabi of fivethirtyeight. com. Thanks so much, Mona. CHALABI: Thanks, Rachel.

Press the button, and the timer would stop counting down from 60 seconds. Every time someone clicked the button, the timer reset and began the countdown again. More than one million people pressed the button before the timer reached zero. Why would anyone want to do this, and what in the world did this experiment mean? Here to explain is Mona Chalabi. Hey, Mona. MONA CHALABI: Hi, Rachel. MARTIN: OK, so this whole thing began on April 1. Reddit explained the whole thing to its users. The only rule was that people could only click once. But what was interesting about this was that people chose to click at different intervals within the 60 seconds, right? CHALABI: So users also got assigned a little circle next to their usernames. And the color of that circle indicates how long they had managed to wait before pressing the button. Now, let's say you only let the timer get down to 52 seconds before you pressed, then you'd get a purple circle. And the thing that's interesting from my perspective is Reddit was collecting and sharing data on what hundreds of thousands of users were doing. So we know that 58 percent of users had purple circles. And the people who waited less than 11 seconds were given a red circle. And they were only six percent of all users. Anyway this whole thing went on for a while as you said. And on June 5, 65 days after the experiment started, the timer finally managed to make it all the way down to zero with no one pressing the button to stop it. MARTIN: OK, so a reminder, every time someone clicked, it reset. You're saying it finally ran out, no one clicked. Then did the world as we know it end? Like, what happened? CHALABI: Nothing, absolutely nothing. The experiment just ended. MARTIN: So why does this matter? What did we learn from this? CHALABI: It's incredibly bizarre, but Reddit users cared a lot about this button. During the experiment, they quickly split up into dozens of factions based on those color-coded circles that I mentioned. MARTIN: Right. CHALABI: And they gave those groups meanings. They almost became mini clans; some even referred to as religions. So those that had purple circles - and again, they're the one's that didn't make it past 52 seconds - were a part of the violent hand. And then there were the illuminati, the emerald council, the orange revolution. And finally, those who had waited until the final 10 seconds were part of the red guard. MARTIN: Wait, so the people who were participating in this experiment, they were so attached to this that they created their own world with social relationships? This is bizarre. CHALABI: Completely, spontaneously with no direction from Reddit, the site that kind of created this. And they even kind of contributed characters to those different groups as well. So those who abstain and don't press the button, they kind of grayed out. They have a motto saying remain pure. Those who are labeled as purple are considered as kind of inpatient because, as I said, they didn't make it down to 52 seconds. And the red who old off for ages and only succumb to pressing the button in those last 10 seconds think of themselves as a little heroic. MARTIN: What is the takeaway from this? I mean, what did Reddit learn from this experiment, and - dare I ask - are there larger applications for what this means? CHALABI: Well, some people think so. Researchers at the Brookings Institution, they outlined in an article some reasons why the button is of interest to policymakers. One, they noted that the button pressers don't actually share any clear common interest with each other. And two, they had no strong incentive to participate, financial or otherwise, and yet they did. Against all the odds, the Reddit button people really got engaged. So the researchers think that public projects could take a lesson away from Reddit in getting people to engage more and participate. MARTIN: I have so many more questions, Mona, but we're going to have to leave it there. Mona Chalabi of fivethirtyeight. com. Thanks so much, Mona. CHALABI: Thanks, Rachel.

It's called \"Catastrophe. \" And we should note, it's for mature audiences, so there's some frank talk about sex coming up in a bit. Eric Deggans says it's also a fresh take on a modern relationship that avoids many pitfalls that sink lesser romantic comedies. ERIC DEGGANS, BYLINE: The story begins with Rob, a handsome, witty American advertising executive in London on business. After a chance meeting in a bar, he has an amazing week of romance and sex with a sharp, beautiful Irish school teacher named Sharon. Then after he's home in America, he gets a phone call from Sharon with this news. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"CATASTROPHE\")SHARON HORGAN: (As Sharon) I'm pregnant. ROB DELANEY: (As Rob) Did you just say pregnant? HORGAN: (As Sharon) Yeah, I said pregnant. Do you want me to say it again? Pregnant. DELANEY: (As Rob) I don't understand. I mean, how. . . HORGAN: (As Sharon) Well, I think. . . DELANEY: (As Rob) Because. . . HORGAN: (As Sharon) You know, we had sex about 25 times in a week and you wore a condom maybe twice. DEGGANS: But within moments, an interesting thing happens. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"CATASTROPHE\")HORGAN: (As Sharon) I don't know what you do when you get pregnant by a stranger. I don't know the etiquette. DELANEY: (As Rob) I'm not a stranger. I'm a familiar acquaintance, a friend, who helped you make a mistake but will now help you figure it out. DEGGANS: And here is where \"Catastrophe\" sets itself apart from many other TV comedies trying to build a modern romance story - because Rob is an adult. He's not a man-child avoiding responsibility or getting a forced crash-course on how to commit. For him, figuring it out means moving to London and eventually proposing marriage, which draws this response from Sharon. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"CATASTROPHE\")HORGAN: (As Sharon) Who are you? Do you have a middle name? Can you ride a horse?  Did a priest ever fiddle with you? DELANEY: (As Rob) Clifford. Yes. And no. But a nun did stay in the room with me when I changed out of dirty underpants once. HORGAN: (As Sharon. Laughter). DELANEY: (As Rob) My mom sent me an article about a study on arranged marriages, and they found that fewer arranged marriages end in divorce. HORGAN: (As Sharon) Is that because they end in suicide? DELANEY: (As Rob) I don't know. I didn't read the whole article. DEGGANS: Written for British TV by the show's two stars, Rob Delaney and Sharon Horgan, \"Catastrophe\" features an outlandish situation. What do you do when a disaster forces together two people who then realize, surprisingly, they're made for each other? Other TV shows trying to make sharp comedy out of modern marriage haven't fared nearly so well. These programs avoid sentiment and talk baldly about sex, but it's unclear if the characters even care for each other, which can make them seem insensitive, unrealistic and unlikable. Consider this example - the FX comedy \"Married\" features a long-married couple too self-obsessed to connect with each other surrounded by similarly self-obsessed friends. Here's a scene from last year's pilot episode. Husband Russ is complaining to his pal Bernie about his fading sex life.

Fortunately, \"Married\" seems to have corrected things for its second season, which starts next month on FX. But Amazon's \"Catastrophe\" never has that problem.

I'm Guy Raz. So sometime in 2011, Cesar Kuriyama felt stuck in time. CESAR KURIYAMA: I was about to turn 30, and I was working in advertising, and I was working 100-hour work weeks all the time. You know, I literally had, like, no life. My life was work. RAZ: Cesar was living in New York; he still does. But back then, he was living a life he had not planned. Eight years earlier, he had finished art school where he studied. . . KURIYAMA: Computer animation primarily, but I dabbled in sculpture and painting and film. And I just wanted to get a little taste of everything. RAZ: But then. KURIYAMA: But then I started working in advertising, and. . . RAZ: After about 10 years. . . KURIYAMA: You know, I found it less and less creatively fulfilling. And so I kind of hit a breaking point where I needed to do something about it. RAZ: It was a classic quarter-life crisis. And like any life crisis, it got Cesar thinking about better times. KURIYAMA: And so I was thinking back on when I was 20. RAZ: But there. . . KURIYAMA: And. . . RAZ: . . . He ran into another problem. KURIYAMA: It's kind of, like, I know generally what - I know where I was in college. I was a sophomore, who my friends were, what my classes were. But on a day-to-day basis, I have absolutely no idea. RAZ: And this is where the story really starts because Cesar thought with all of our modern technology, there had to be a better way to remember the past, to chronicle our own journey through time. KURIYAMA: And so I thought one second. RAZ: One second of video. KURIYAMA: And I realized, wow, I have this high-definition camera in my pocket at all times now thanks to my iPhone. And coming from an animation background, I know that there's a lot that you can capture with just a second. RAZ: So Cesar began recording short videos every day, and then he'd edit them together so that each day was represented by a single second of footage. Do you have a video with you that you can just, like, look at and describe to us, like, just for, like, 15 or 20 seconds? KURIYAMA: Sure. While I have my phone on, I might record the little NPR logo on the mic 'cause, you know, hey, you know. RAZ: Since he first got this idea, Cesar Kuriyama has been recorded a second of his life virtually every day. KURIYAMA: For over four years. RAZ: Wow. KURIYAMA: Four years and four months. RAZ: That's four years of life in a 25-minute video. KURIYAMA: All right, so I'm jumping over to June 1 of 2011. RAZ: OK. KURIYAMA: This is right before I took off on a 95-day road trip around the U. S. and Canada. RAZ: Wow. KURIYAMA: OK, so I'm going to hit play. June 1 is the odometer on the car. I am in Philadelphia crashing with some friends. I am biking through Pennsylvania. I am camping near Pittsburgh. I am going to - playing - learning how to play Settlers of Catan, which is one of my - turned out to be one of my favorite games ever. I play it all the time. I'm in Chicago. RAZ: For Cesar, watching his life flash by in a matter of seconds. . . KURIYAMA: It's like this feeling. RAZ: A feeling that you're looking at the answer to a question we all ask elves - where does the time go? KURIYAMA: You know, a couple of weeks in, I realized, wow, like, because it's all playing out chronologically, I can fill in the gaps pretty easily. You know, like, the second that comes tomorrow and the second that came before it. It's like you feel time, you know. It's a very difficult thing to try to perceive. . . . Near St. Louis. It's the Fourth of July, and I am heading to Austin. I've always wanted to go to Austin. I'm in Colorado. I'm camping on sand dunes, and I'm jumping - I worked up the courage to jump into a lake. I'm in Yosemite. . . RAZ: Since Cesar first started doing this about four years ago, he built this idea into an app. It allows anyone to stitch the recorded seconds into a seamless video and to experience something most of us never see. KURIYAMA: You know, think about the person you were on your first day of high school and the person you were on your last day of high school. Think about the person you were on your first day of college and the person you were in your last day of college, you know. There's a massive growth and evolution that happens in that span of time, but it happens gradually so you don't really feel it or sense it. And so now, when I can revisit, you know, the past four years in 24 minutes, you know, my understanding of time becomes far more finite than I think it's ever been. RAZ: And that raises a question - how can something so predictable - time - feel so different depending on where you are or who you are? LAURA CARSTENSEN: An hour takes forever when you're five. RAZ: Forever, remember, like, the summertime when you were a little kid, and it would just go on and on? CARSTENSEN: Right, right. RAZ: Is what we think of as time even real? DAN GILBERT: No matter how small we cut the moment - a second, a half a second, a quarter of a second - the present is a psychological illusion. RAZ: And if it is real, when did time begin? SEAN CARROLL: Is time an absolutely crucial part of our best description of the universe, or is time something that emerges as approximation if we look at the universe in a right way? RAZ: This episode, those questions and ideas about shifting time. Cesar Kuriyama, by the way, quit advertising to work full-time on his one-second-a-day app. KURIYAMA: Yeah, it takes up all my time (laughter). RAZ: Which I've used myself.

It involves elephants killed for their ivory. Biologists want to pin down where the worst poaching happens, and they found a new way to do that using DNA found in the ivory. Here's NPR's Christopher Joyce. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: Zoologist Sam Wasser spent years extracting DNA from elephant dung and tissue across the African continent. He used it to draw a map that shows the genetic signature of each major population, kind of like an elephant barcode. Then he started taking DNA from illegal ivory seized around the world. He matched the ivory's barcode to the population and place it came from. SAM WASSER: We wanted to see, well, what are the major hotspots that are driving this trade. JOYCE: The worldwide ivory trade starts where the animals are killed and extends to smuggling networks that reach around the world. WASSER: By focusing on these major hotspots, we can actually stop a major portion of the killing. And you can simultaneously choke the flow of ivory into these networks. JOYCE: Wasser is a professor at the University of Washington and describes his technique in the journal Science. He says he's found a few hotspots, but two really stand out. The first is a region called Tridom. It spans part of Gabon, the Republic of Congo, Cameroon and the Central African Republic. The other hotspot includes two game reserves, where elephants are supposed to be protected, in Tanzania and Mozambique. Wasser says they become the go-to places for poachers. WASSER: No one expected, including myself, that virtually 100 percent of these seizures over the last decade would come from just two places. I mean, who would've thought that? JOYCE: Now, wildlife experts suspect that poachers have descended on these places. But it's hard to catch them in the act or head off shipments before they leave the continent. Where authorities often do intercept a big ivory shipment is in ports in Asia, the world's largest ivory market. The ivory is often in a shipping container. Conservation biologist George Wittemyer of Colorado State University says the container can only be traced back to its last exit port in Africa. GEORGE WITTEMYER: What we haven't known before is the origination of the ivory within Africa and its movement in Africa to the port of export. JOYCE: But now DNA can link ivory in a port in China to a game preserve in Tanzania. That's hard evidence to show African governments what's going on within their borders. As for what goes on outside Africa - in countries like China, where people buy lots of illegal ivory - conservationists say there's been progress as well. Leigh Henry tracks the ivory trade for the World Wildlife Fund. She says China recently announced it will soon crack down on illegal ivory trading there. LEIGH HENRY: We've never really seen an admission from China that they are part of the problem. JOYCE: But Henry says China is watching closely what the U. S. does with its illegal ivory trade. It's a fraction of China's market but still significant. HENRY: China has said very directly that they cannot act alone, that they expect other countries to take similar actions to clamp down on their ivory markets and pointed specifically to the U. S. JOYCE: The U. S. government has drafted new regulations that will limit trade in ivory here. They're due out any time. Henry acknowledges, however, that international efforts to stifle demand for ivory moves slowly. In the meantime, DNA tracking could help slow the rate of poaching at the source.

JOYCE: The worldwide ivory trade starts where the animals are killed and extends to smuggling networks that reach around the world. WASSER: By focusing on these major hotspots, we can actually stop a major portion of the killing. And you can simultaneously choke the flow of ivory into these networks. JOYCE: Wasser is a professor at the University of Washington and describes his technique in the journal Science. He says he's found a few hotspots, but two really stand out. The first is a region called Tridom. It spans part of Gabon, the Republic of Congo, Cameroon and the Central African Republic. The other hotspot includes two game reserves, where elephants are supposed to be protected, in Tanzania and Mozambique. Wasser says they become the go-to places for poachers. WASSER: No one expected, including myself, that virtually 100 percent of these seizures over the last decade would come from just two places. I mean, who would've thought that? JOYCE: Now, wildlife experts suspect that poachers have descended on these places. But it's hard to catch them in the act or head off shipments before they leave the continent. Where authorities often do intercept a big ivory shipment is in ports in Asia, the world's largest ivory market. The ivory is often in a shipping container. Conservation biologist George Wittemyer of Colorado State University says the container can only be traced back to its last exit port in Africa. GEORGE WITTEMYER: What we haven't known before is the origination of the ivory within Africa and its movement in Africa to the port of export. JOYCE: But now DNA can link ivory in a port in China to a game preserve in Tanzania. That's hard evidence to show African governments what's going on within their borders. As for what goes on outside Africa - in countries like China, where people buy lots of illegal ivory - conservationists say there's been progress as well. Leigh Henry tracks the ivory trade for the World Wildlife Fund. She says China recently announced it will soon crack down on illegal ivory trading there. LEIGH HENRY: We've never really seen an admission from China that they are part of the problem. JOYCE: But Henry says China is watching closely what the U. S. does with its illegal ivory trade. It's a fraction of China's market but still significant. HENRY: China has said very directly that they cannot act alone, that they expect other countries to take similar actions to clamp down on their ivory markets and pointed specifically to the U. S. JOYCE: The U. S. government has drafted new regulations that will limit trade in ivory here. They're due out any time. Henry acknowledges, however, that international efforts to stifle demand for ivory moves slowly. In the meantime, DNA tracking could help slow the rate of poaching at the source.

The federal government wants to prevent explosive oil train derailments. Neither the industry nor safety advocates like how this is going. Here's NPR's David Schaper. DAVID SCHAPER, BYLINE: Since Valentine's Day, five trains carrying North Dakota Bakken crude oil have derailed and exploded into flames in the U. S. and Canada. No one was hurt in the incidents in Mount Carbon, W. Va. , and Northern Ontario in February, in Galena, Ill. , and Northern Ontario in March and in Heimdal, N. D. , last month. But each of those fiery train wrecks occurred in lightly populated areas. Scores of oil trains also travel through dense cities, particularly here, Chicago, the nation's railroad hub. (SOUNDBITE OF RAILCARS)SCHAPER: At least 40 trains carrying Bakken crude roll through the city each week on the BNSF railway's tracks alone, passing right by apartment buildings, homes, businesses and even schools. CHRISTINA MARTINEZ: Well, just imagine the carnage. SCHAPER: Christina Martinez is standing alongside the BNSF tracks in Chicago's Pilsen neighborhood where a long train of black tank cars is slowly rolling by St. Procopius, the school her 6-year-old attends. MARTINEZ: Yeah, just the other the day, they were playing soccer at my son's school on Saturday. And I saw the train go by, and it had the 1267, you know, the red marking. SCHAPER: The railroad tag cars carrying hazardous materials have diamond-shaped red placards indicating their contents - 1267 signifies crude oil. MARTINEZ: And I was like, oh, my God, can you imagine if it would derail and explode right here while these kids are playing soccer and all the people around there? SCHAPER: New federal rules require stronger tank cars for crude oil and other flammable liquids, phasing out older models that more easily rupture. But Martinez and others wanted rules limiting the volatility of what's going into those tank cars, too. Oil from North Dakota has a combustible mix of natural gases, including butane, methane and propane. North Dakota requires the conditioning of the gas and oil at the wellhead so the vapor pressure is below 13. 7 pounds per square inch before it's shipped. But even at that level, oil from derailed tank cars has exploded into flames. Lora Chamberlain of the group Chicagoland Oil by Rail wanted federal regulators to require even lower pressure. LORA CHAMBERLAIN: We don't want these bomb trains going through our neighborhood. De-gasify this stuff and so we're really, really upset at the feds - the Department of Transportation - for not addressing this in these new rules. SCHAPER: Others criticize the rules for giving shippers three to five years to either strengthen or replace the weakest tank cars. Paul Berland lives near the busy railroad tracks in suburban Elgin. PAUL BERLAND: The rules won't take effect for many years. They're still playing Russian roulette with our communities. SCHAPER: A coalition of environmental groups sued, alleging that loopholes could allow some dangerous tank cars to remain on the tracks for up to a decade. At the same time, an oil industry group is challenging the new regulations in court, too, arguing that manufacturers won't be able to build and retrofit tank cars fast enough to meet the new requirements. And even the railroad industry is taking legal action against the new rules. ED HAMBERGER: The one that we have real problems with is requiring something called ECP brakes - they're electronically controlled pneumatic brakes. SCHAPER: Ed Hamberger heads the Association of American Railroads and says the new braking system the government is mandating is unproven. HAMBERGER: They do not claim that ECP brakes would prevent one accident. Their entire safety case is based on the fact that ECP brakes are applied a little bit more quickly than the current system. SARAH FEINBERG: It's not unproven at all. SCHAPER: Acting Federal Railroad administrator Sarah Feinberg. FEINBERG: I do understand that the railroad industry views it as costly. I don't think it's particularly costly, especially when you compare it to the cost of a really significant incident with the train carrying this product. SCHAPER: Feinberg says her agency is still studying whether to regulate the volatility of crude. But some in Congress don't think this safety matter can wait. They're sponsoring legislation to force producers to condition the oil further to make it less explosive before shipping it on the nation's rails. David Schaper, NPR News, Chicago.

ARUN RATH, HOST: Meet Elliot - cyber security engineer by day, vigilante hacker by night. He's the unlikely hero at the center of the new TV show \"Mr. Robot. \" Sam Esmail is the show's creator and executive producer. SAM ESMAIL: Elliot is sort of an internal, isolated guy who can't really interact with people socially, in real life, but online he can hack them and knows all the intimate, private details of them. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MR. ROBOT\")MALEK: (As Elliot) Hacking her was simple. Her password - dylan2791 - favorite artist and the year in which she was born backwards. Although she's a psychologist, she's really bad at reading people. But I'm good at reading people. My secret - I look for the worst in them. RATH: Elliot, played by actor Rami Malek, stumbles across a secret society run by a man called Mr. Robot. Think of a cross between Wikileaks, Anonymous and the Weather Underground. Elliot is pulled into a web of anarchy and danger where all the moral lines are blurred. ESMAIL: Who's good and who's bad in the show? I don't know. I mean, you really can't pinpoint the clear-cut morality here - who is the person I should be rooting for and not. I think it's more interesting when it's messier 'cause I just think that's more true to life. RATH: You take us inside Elliot's head with this really intense inner narration. It reminds me a little bit of Travis Bickle in \"Taxi Driver\" because it's also (unintelligible) of loneliness - just this one voice. ESMAIL: Well, that would not be an accident (laughter) as \"Taxi Driver\" was a huge inspiration. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"TAXI DRIVER\")ROBERT DE NIRO: (As Travis Bickle) Loneliness has followed me my whole life everywhere. ESMAIL: One of the things about \"Taxi Driver\" that's so great is it's just a pure character piece. Obviously there's a plot and there's a story, but just you are purely inside this guy's brain. And when I went to write \"Mr. Robot,\" I just knew in order to really pull off this really tricky thing to see the world through this guy's point of view, I needed just to immerse the audience. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MR. ROBOT\")MALEK: (As Elliot) I never want to be right about my hacks, but people always find a way to disappoint. ESMAIL: Voice-over gets a bad rep a lot of times in screenwriting because people think it's lazy, whatever it is, but when it is done really well, it just adds this other dimension. It creates this sort of intimate relationship with the audience that you really can't do just with dialogue and scene. RATH: You know, the alienated young techie is almost - it's kind of a type now when you think of people like Edward Snowden, Chelsea Manning. Was that in your mind at all as you were coming up with this character? ESMAIL: No, I would say - I would say - look, teen angst, I think, has been around since, you know, Holden Caulfield. I mean, it's something that I think was there the whole time. I think it's kind of interesting that now it's associated with techies. I think it's a lot older than that, but it's cool the association has become more popularized with technology. RATH: So do you think if \"Rebel Without A Cause\" came out today the James Dean character would be a hacker? ESMAIL: Yeah, absolutely. (LAUGHTER)ESMAIL: You know, it's weird, it's like the nerds are having their moment, I would have to say, right about now. RATH: I love that my kids are growing up in that world. ESMAIL: Yeah, look, I endorse it. RATH: You know, I feel like since the cyber world or whatever you call it has been with us, filmmakers have struggled with how you portray it. You know, whether it's documentary or fiction, it's kind of hard to sustain interest around people typing on keyboards. But you do that while maintaining the drama. Can you tell us how you approach that as a film maker? ESMAIL: Yeah, you know, look, I will say I - so I was a nerd growing up, and I was a big techie. And I watched all those terrible movies and all those terrible television shows. And it was actually, I think, more work to portray it as poorly as they did because they forced all these CGI graphics and all this ridiculous stuff to force the drama there. One of the rules I have on my show is that we don't green screen anything. So everything that you see that we filmed is real. And so the actors, I really wanted them to react to what is actually going on on-screen. But I gotta be honest, I'm not some genius over here. I'm just actually going through what a programmer or coder or cybersecurity engineer would do in a certain hack. And the funny thing is, even though people don't completely understand it, they get it. And it's almost like when you watch a medical drama, or a legal drama or whatever, it's not - I don't necessarily understand all the terminology, but I get - I get what's going on emotionally. I get what the stakes are. RATH: I've seen a little bit on Twitter. It seems like you've been getting some good reaction from the hacker community. ESMAIL: Which is huge - I mean, you know how much of a risk that is to not only do a show about technology and about hackers, but then to kind of sort of reference hacker groups. There's a popular Twitter feed for Anonymous and it's all, you know, unofficial, but when they gave us kudos, I was in heaven. I mean, that's a real huge endorsement.

S. The glitch has practically shut down the visa application process. The 50,000 visa applications received daily - only a handful of emergency visas are getting issued. NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: It's well into cherry season in Washington state, and soon, it will be peach and then apple season. Dan Fazio is executive director of the Washington Farm Labor Association. He says that between June 1 and November, he expects 12,000 to 15,000 guest workers to come help pick fruit. But right now, it's not clear when the buses of workers will cross the Mexican border. DAN FAZIO: We canceled our crossings of about 250 each on the 15 and the 22. We're going to send a large group of 544 on the 29, and we're chartering the buses right now for that group to move. NOGUCHI: But it's not clear the State Department's visa system will be up and running by then. And Fazio worries fruit will simply die on the vine. He says one blueberry farmer in particular is desperate. FAZIO: If he doesn't get those 250 guest workers, he's going to lose his blueberry crop. NOGUCHI: The State Department first disclosed the hardware problem last week. It says the system isn't allowing processing of security-related biometric data, including fingerprints. And that is holding up tourists, workers and family members looking to get into the country. Agency spokesman John Kirby says it has 100 computer experts working hard to try to fix the system. JOHN KIRBY: They haven't got it fixed yet. We do expect, hopefully, sometime this week, it will get resolved. NOGUCHI: In the meantime, the effects from the glitch are being felt around the world. Take Peter Dropick, a vice president of events for the Ultimate Fighting Championship. PETER DROPICK: We had 12 of our athletes who weren't able to get their visas to securely enter the country. NOGUCHI: So for a championship in South Florida this Saturday, Dropick had to find substitutes among U. S. citizens or other athletes already in the country. And in West Virginia, John Giroir is still waiting to see if most of the foreign students due in for the prestigious National Youth Science Camp will make it a week after the month-long program started. JOHN GIROIR: Flights were already booked. Plans were already made, forms filled out. But on travel day, only two students out of the 17 were able to fly and join us. The others were held back. NOGUCHI: Moona Shakil is an immigration attorney in Virginia. She says several of her clients are trying to reunite with family and have been in limbo. MOONA SHAKIL: The longer it goes on, the more backlogs are going to get created. I think the consulates as well will have a difficult time trying to catch up.

It's the same for crimes against nature and southern Oregon is home to the world's only forensics lab dedicated solely to wildlife crime. With high-tech tools, the lab's shedding new light on illegal logging around the world. Jes Burns from Oregon Public Broadcasting has our story. JES BURNS, BYLINE: There's a small woodshop at the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Forensics Lab in Ashland, Ore. , but there's no sawdust or power tools. This shop is more like an archive, holding samples of some of the rarest woods on the planet. KEN GODDARD: African mahogany, Brazilian ebony, mahogany from the coastal south of Mexico. These woods have come from all over. BURNS: Lab director Ken Goddard flips through wooden planks the size of cell phones. The samples lay neatly on dozens of shelves. They're used to help identify illegal shipments of rare woods protected by international treaty. GODDARD: Basically, you would not continue investigation unless you are pretty sure you're dealing with endangered or threatened species. BURNS: With shipments of processed wood, this can be challenging because the limbs, leaves and DNA-rich sapwood have been removed. Just a few steps down the hall from the woodshop, deputy lab director Ed Espinoza leads the center's new forensic work on timber. ED ESPINOZA: If somebody had just called me out of the blue, first saying, can you identify wood with your mass spec, I would've said no, that's crazy. BURNS: The mass spec here is a relatively new kind of mass spectrometer. This one is called DART-TOF - or DART for short. And yes, it doesn't look or sound like much. It's more like a humming laser printer with a propane cylinder attached. That humble exterior hides some powerful technology. A few years back, an investigator asked if the lab could identify the wood confiscated in an alleged illegal shipment of agarwood, a protected incense tree. It struck Espinoza that he may be able to use the DART to identify the aromatic wood, which is used to make perfume. ESPINOZA: Originally, we had no idea if it was going to pan out or not. But I knew if it had an odor - this instrument is kind of like a massive nose, almost. BURNS: Espinoza shaved off a small sliver of the wood. With tweezers, he fed a sample into the DART. It needed just seconds to whiff the compounds and identify agarwood's unique chemical signature. ESPINOZA: It didn't occur to me until after the fact that I could apply it to other types of wood. BURNS: Espinoza and his team began collecting baseline samples of protected trees from around the world. These are the ones now stored in the lab's woodshop. In April, the Wildlife Forensics Lab became the first and only facility internationally certified to tell law enforcement that one sample is, say, legally traded Amazonian rosewood, versus contraband Brazilian rosewood. Shelley Gardner is the illegal logging program coordinator for the U. S. Forest Service. She says the new DART technology gives law enforcement a better chance to stop illegally harvested wood from becoming someone's guitar or a new dining room set. SHELLEY GARDNER: With that knowledge, I think their interests increase knowing that they can, if they are investigating a case, send a sample to a laboratory. BURNS: OK, so tree cases aren't as exciting or appealing as chasing tiger or ivory traffickers, but international timber tracking is a huge global business. Interpol estimates it's worth up to $100 billion a year. And lab director Ken Goddard says there are broader conservation goals at play. GODDARD: I think these wood cases are far more important than just the wood. I mean, trees can be re-grown. They are replaceable. That may not be true for the species that lived in that forest. BURNS: That's why disrupting illegal logging can save more than just a tree. It can also protect the homes of mammals, birds and insects. For NPR News, I'm Jes Burns.

But today's media world has no down time. This summer brings on an explosion of new TV shows. Here to talk about what shows go best with sun tan lotion and 90-degree weather is NPR TV Critic Eric Deggans. Hi. ERIC DEGGANS, BYLINE: Hi. WERTHEIMER: So how much choice do you think there really is on offer this summer? DEGGANS: Well, I actually did the count, and I found that there's at least 120 new and returning shows. And no matter what your tastes are, there's something out there for you. So if you love thrillers, for example, AMC's got this great drama about androids called \"Humans\" that just debuted, while CBS has got a drama coming from James Patterson called \"Zoo\" about the world's animals turning on humans. And if you're into comedy, two of my favorite stand-up comics are getting great new shows. On Comedy Central, Hannibal Buress - the guy whose jokes about Bill Cosby made everybody take another look at the allegations against Bill Cosby - he's got a new show coming called, \"Why? \" And TV Land has a show with Jim Gaffigan, this great stand-up comic, it's called \"The Jim Gaffigan Show,\" and it's about his real-life huge family that's also kind of religious and church-going, and how odd that is to be a stand-up comic and also have this very sort of busy family life. WERTHEIMER: So why is there such a huge quantity of television this summer? DEGGANS: Well, you know, cable always used to bring more TV in the summer because that was when the broadcast networks would traditionally kind of ramp down. But nobody watches re-runs on broadcast television, or what we call linear television anymore, so the networks have had to step-up their game too. Every network has new scripted and unscripted series coming this summer, even though most of them are not as good as the stuff that they're going to put on during the fall or the spring. And online platforms like Netflix and Amazon and Hulu, they got into the act too, so the result is this TV cycle that just never slows down very much. WERTHEIMER: HBO would seem to be a good example of that. They debuted three new shows in late June, including a second season of the hit show, \"True Detective. \" How's that going? DEGGANS: Well, I hate to say it, but \"True Detective\" is kind of a bust. I mean, everyone was kind of looking forward to seeing what they would do with the show because they're totally reinventing it. It's not that compelling. I really like, instead, another show that debuted on the same day, called \"Ballers,\" with Dwayne The Rock Johnson as a former NFL player-turned financial advisor who's trying to keep his buddies from going broke. We have a clip where The Rock has promised that he'd signed one of his friends from the NFL to a contract with this financial services company, and he's trying to explain to his boss why he hasn't signed the contract. So let's check it out. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"BALLERS\")ROB CORDDRY: (As Joe) Let me see the paperwork. DWAYNE JOHNSON: (As Spencer) We're working on it. CORDDRY: (As Joe) You don't have it? JOHNSON: (As Spencer) It's not a problem. He's checking in with his guy. CORDDRY: (As Joe) His - you just said you're his guy. JOHNSON: (As Spencer) I am almost his guy. Look, Vernon and I have an understanding. It's all good. CORDDRY: (As Joe) You have an understanding with a 24-year-old defensive lineman, Spence. That's not something we can bank on. DEGGANS: So what I love about this is, I think The Rock is a TV star in the making. I love watching him here. WERTHEIMER: What else should we have our eye on? DEGGANS: Well, the Sundance Channel has a series called \"Rectify\" about a guy who confessed to a murder but was exonerated by DNA evidence and has to come back to the small southern town where everything happened. I think it's a great drama and it's really strong. And USA just debuted this great cyberpunk drama called \"Mr. Robot. \" It's about a computer whiz who works for a security firm who's recruited by this group of hackers to take down his employer. Now, the star, Rami Malek, is amazing as this zoned-out prodigy who sees everything but really doesn't communicate it to the people around him. We as viewers get to hear about it through voiceover, and it might be the most unexpected creative hit of the summer. WERTHEIMER: OK, a lot to watch. NPR TV Critic Eric Deggans, thank you very much.

Not so fast. In the past couple of months, Wired staff writer Julia Greenberg has noticed a new hiring trend, starting with a posting for a news editor at Apple. JULIA GREENBERG: Within the posting, I mean, very specifically Apple says they're looking for humans because algorithms aren't enough. RATH: Algorithms aren't enough. There are things Apple thinks only a human can do for the company's upcoming newsreader app. And Greenberg says Apple isn't alone. Other giant tech companies are seeking real live humans to do what computers can't. GREENBERG: I also found similar sentiments on Twitter's website for an editorial lead, which has hinted that it's for their new upcoming event-based feeds. And then we also found some job postings for Snapchat, which for people who use Snapchat, they'll know that there are live stories. And those postings are actually curated by humans. RATH: And Snapchat has actually poached people from CNN, right? GREENBERG: Right. So I mean, these companies are very serious about bringing top journalists. And LinkedIn, which has had human curators since 2011, actually poached Dan Roth, who's pretty well-known in journalism communities. He was brought on to be the executive editor to lead LinkedIn's sort of news and content coverage. It's actually journalists who are being sought out for these jobs. RATH: Not coders, people with actual editorial skills. GREENBERG: Exactly. Exactly. RATH: So why do they need the humans? Where are the machines falling short? GREENBERG: Algorithms are really good at culling through a huge amount of data to bring sort of a more personalized answer, but they're not good at adding emotion. They're not good at showing you sort of, like, what that thing is that you need to know. They're really bad at understanding context in social norms. And so you'll see with algorithms that there might be two things, like, juxtaposed next to each other that really a human would never put next to each other because it doesn't really make sense, or you might see an algorithm sort of favor certain stories that - for example, this happens a lot on Facebook, where you might click on something out of obligation, but not necessarily because you want to see a lot of that in your feed. And Dan Roth, who I spoke to at LinkedIn, said that, for example, with breaking news, it's really hard for algorithms to know, like, oh, this just happened. The Supreme Court just announced, you know, this decision. An algorithm might not know that that's valuable. But there would be no doubt that a human who has experience in this would know. And then the other aspect of that is that algorithms are still really bad at understanding humor and language and sarcasm. And so that sort of emotional touch is something that humans can bring to the table. RATH: So Julia, you and I are journalists and human beings. Is there. . . GREENBERG: Yeah (laughter). RATH: Is there any reason why we just shouldn't think this is completely awesome? (LAUGHTER)GREENBERG: Well, you know, I talked to some people (laughter) - I talked to some researchers who said to me you know what? Like, right now, algorithms can't do this, but who knows, maybe 10, 15, 20, 50 years down the line. And I mean, it's really important to note that it's not one or the other. The companies are going use a combination of algorithms and humans. Humans are not going to be able to do that personalized kind of curation, especially at the scale that most of these tech companies operate at. Apple with Apple Music, Spotify and some other, you know, music and entertainment products have definitely also shown that, you know, you need human curation. These are the kinds of thing that you're seeing sort of all across the board. RATH: As Arnold Schwarzenegger is showing us once again in the movie theater, humans and machines can work together in common cause. GREENBERG: (Laughter) Yeah, exactly. RATH: Julia Greenberg is a staff writer at Wired. You can read her piece about humans replacing algorithms that replaced humans at wired. com. Julia, thanks very much. GREENBERG: Thanks so much. Thanks for having me. ARUN RATH, HOST:  Computer programs are super powerful, and they're coming for your job, right? Not so fast.

And so you'll see with algorithms that there might be two things, like, juxtaposed next to each other that really a human would never put next to each other because it doesn't really make sense, or you might see an algorithm sort of favor certain stories that - for example, this happens a lot on Facebook, where you might click on something out of obligation, but not necessarily because you want to see a lot of that in your feed. And Dan Roth, who I spoke to at LinkedIn, said that, for example, with breaking news, it's really hard for algorithms to know, like, oh, this just happened. The Supreme Court just announced, you know, this decision. An algorithm might not know that that's valuable. But there would be no doubt that a human who has experience in this would know. And then the other aspect of that is that algorithms are still really bad at understanding humor and language and sarcasm. And so that sort of emotional touch is something that humans can bring to the table. RATH: So Julia, you and I are journalists and human beings. Is there. . . GREENBERG: Yeah (laughter). RATH: Is there any reason why we just shouldn't think this is completely awesome? (LAUGHTER) GREENBERG: Well, you know, I talked to some people (laughter) - I talked to some researchers who said to me you know what? Like, right now, algorithms can't do this, but who knows, maybe 10, 15, 20, 50 years down the line. And I mean, it's really important to note that it's not one or the other. The companies are going use a combination of algorithms and humans. Humans are not going to be able to do that personalized kind of curation, especially at the scale that most of these tech companies operate at. Apple with Apple Music, Spotify and some other, you know, music and entertainment products have definitely also shown that, you know, you need human curation. These are the kinds of thing that you're seeing sort of all across the board. RATH: As Arnold Schwarzenegger is showing us once again in the movie theater, humans and machines can work together in common cause. GREENBERG: (Laughter) Yeah, exactly. RATH: Julia Greenberg is a staff writer at Wired. You can read her piece about humans replacing algorithms that replaced humans at wired. com. Julia, thanks very much. GREENBERG: Thanks so much.

Hacking Team talks openly about how it sells its spyware. Marczak, who's been investigating the company since 2012, figured they'd make those sales quickly and then look the other way. So in case a pro-democracy activist got located and shot, they wouldn't have blood on their hands. MARCZAK: They'd have more plausible deniability.

But Hacking Team said it has an internal policy to investigate abuse and terminate customers when appropriate. The company did not respond to NPR's inquiry asking them to specify when they've taken such steps. And a leaked customer list indicates they're continuing business in Ethiopia.

ADAM COLE, BYLINE: So Gordon Moore is one of the co-founders of Intel. And in 1965, he made this observation that it seemed like transistors were getting smaller and smaller at an exponential rate. He said every two years about you'll be able to fit twice as many transistors on a chip. WARD: So the transistors are getting smaller. The chips are getting smaller. Did this two-year prediction pan out? Was Moore right? COLE: It turns out, you know, for the last 50 years he's pretty much been spot on. And it's - it's turned into a self-fulfilling prophecy because companies like IBM and Intel, they'll set goals based on this law of how small they want their transistors to be. And just to give you a sense of just how dramatic this exponential shrinking is, I'm going to give you a little metaphor. WARD: OK. COLE: So let's say the transistors that are around when Moore first made this prediction back in 1965, those were about 100th of an inch wide.

But stream it on Netflix, probably not. Some say charging a tax on web streaming services sets dangerous precedent. But the city of Chicago has done it, saying they are leveling the playing field between digital companies and brick-and-mortar businesses. Chicagoans are calling the 9 percent tax a, quote, \"cloud tax. \" NPR's Cheryl Corley reports. CHERYL CORLEY, BYLINE: There was no debate or public hearings over Chicago's 9 percent cloud tax. The city says that's because it isn't new and is actually a clarification, not an expansion, of two taxes that have long been in effect. One is called the personal property lease transaction tax - the other, the amusement tax, which has traditionally been tacked onto tickets for concerts and sporting events. But now just about everybody who pays to stream a video or television show will have to pay more, like college student Luis Montalvo. LUIS MONTALVO: Currently, I'm catching up on \"Orange Is The New Black. \"(SOUNDBITE OF TV THEME SONG, \"ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK\")REGINA SPEKTOR: (Singing) The animals, the animals trapped, trapped, trapped 'til the cage is full. CORLEY: Netflix reportedly plans to pass along the 9 percent tax the city will apply to streaming and cloud-based services to customers like Montalvo. MONTALVO: It might not seem like a very big deal because it's just Netflix. But, you know, what are we going to tax next, you know? I feel like that's going to open the door to start taxing Facebook at some point, which sounds ridiculous to me. CORLEY: Facebook is not in the mix. But this tax will apply to paid subscriptions for streamed entertainment, like TV shows, movies and digital music and to so-called cloud-based services, like the multiple-listing service that realtors use. Brian Bernardoni, with the Chicago Association of Realtors, says that's raised a lot of concern in the industry. BRIAN BERNARDONI: We see this as akin to taxing a hammer each time you use it when you build a house. CORLEY: The tax is expected to add about $12 million in revenue to a city struggling to fill a deep budget hole. Michael Reever, with the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce, says Chicago has held the line on property and sales taxes. He calls the tax on cloud-based computer services a nickel-and-dime approach. MICHAEL REEVER: This kind of, you know, year-to-year, month-to-month kind of budget crisis management is not the way to go. And it certainly doesn't give businesses a certainty in how they invest their money. CORLEY: In a statement, the city says its rulings, which made streaming services and databases subject to those taxes, brings companies using new technology in line with brick-and-mortar businesses. The city also promised exemptions for startup tech companies based on their revenue. Bernardoni with the Realtors Association says regardless, there's plenty of people bothered by Chicago's approach. BERNARDONI: Tax policy is one of those things that not only people in the city of Chicago look at, but people across the country look at. And when we add new taxes, we add another cloud around the city saying this is not a good place to do business. CORLEY: The so-called cloud tax already in effect may have caught some off guard. But the high-tech industry is already considering a legal challenge to Chicago's tax on streaming and database services. Cheryl Corley, NPR News, Chicago.

LUIS MONTALVO: Currently, I'm catching up on \"Orange Is The New Black. \" (SOUNDBITE OF TV THEME SONG, \"ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK\") REGINA SPEKTOR: (Singing) The animals, the animals trapped, trapped, trapped 'til the cage is full. CORLEY: Netflix reportedly plans to pass along the 9 percent tax the city will apply to streaming and cloud-based services to customers like Montalvo. MONTALVO: It might not seem like a very big deal because it's just Netflix. But, you know, what are we going to tax next, you know? I feel like that's going to open the door to start taxing Facebook at some point, which sounds ridiculous to me. CORLEY: Facebook is not in the mix. But this tax will apply to paid subscriptions for streamed entertainment, like TV shows, movies and digital music and to so-called cloud-based services, like the multiple-listing service that realtors use. Brian Bernardoni, with the Chicago Association of Realtors, says that's raised a lot of concern in the industry. BRIAN BERNARDONI: We see this as akin to taxing a hammer each time you use it when you build a house. CORLEY: The tax is expected to add about $12 million in revenue to a city struggling to fill a deep budget hole. Michael Reever, with the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce, says Chicago has held the line on property and sales taxes. He calls the tax on cloud-based computer services a nickel-and-dime approach. MICHAEL REEVER: This kind of, you know, year-to-year, month-to-month kind of budget crisis management is not the way to go. And it certainly doesn't give businesses a certainty in how they invest their money. CORLEY: In a statement, the city says its rulings, which made streaming services and databases subject to those taxes, brings companies using new technology in line with brick-and-mortar businesses. The city also promised exemptions for startup tech companies based on their revenue. Bernardoni with the Realtors Association says regardless, there's plenty of people bothered by Chicago's approach. BERNARDONI: Tax policy is one of those things that not only people in the city of Chicago look at, but people across the country look at. And when we add new taxes, we add another cloud around the city saying this is not a good place to do business. CORLEY: The so-called cloud tax already in effect may have caught some off guard. But the high-tech industry is already considering a legal challenge to Chicago's tax on streaming and database services.

HENSLEY: Let's try it. NEARY: OK, let's do it. HENSLEY: All right, so we're at the Mayo Clinic Symptom Checker. Let's find out what your symptoms might be. There's a long list here that we need to check. NEARY: All right, cough, difficulty or painful swallowing, yeah. HENSLEY: Hoarse or muffled voice. NEARY: (Laughing) Yes. HENSLEY: (Laughter). NEARY: Sneezing. HENSLEY: Wow, you've get - you're checking off a lot of boxes here. NEARY: Sneezing, watery eyes. HENSLEY: OK, let's click Find Causes. NEARY: OK, let's read what's on this list. HENSLEY: Hay fever. NEARY: Influenza. HENSLEY: Acute sinusitis. NEARY: GERD. Epiglottis. HENSLEY: Epiglottitis, I think. NEARY: Epiglottitis, OK. Laryngitis, which I might be heading towards. HENSLEY: Strep throat. NEARY: But top of the list is common cold, which is probably what I have. HENSLEY: Yeah. NEARY: OK, all right. Let's talk about the studies. So they - the Harvard researchers tested 23 online symptom checkers. What did they find out? HENSLEY: Yeah, so they did a pretty interesting test. They fed in 45 different conditions - some rare, some common - with standardized kinds of symptoms and saw what the symptom checkers spit out. And when it came to the top suggestion for what was wrong with people, they were right about a third of the time. If you scrolled down the list, the way that we did, and went as far as 20 on the list, then they were right about half the time. NEARY: So is there anything that these kinds of apps - these symptom checkers - is there anything that they do well? HENSLEY: Quite a few of them went the next step and gave you advice about should you stay at home and take care of this yourself, go see your doctor or nurse practitioner for a regular appointment or get yourself to the emergency room right away - they did better at that. So in the case of the emergency care, in particular, they were right 80 percent of the time. The thing that the researchers point out, which is an important caveat, is that the checkers tended to be a little risk averse. So they tended to send people for care more often than they needed to. So in the case of things that the researchers thought you should be able to take care of yourself, they only said that that was right about a third of the time. NEARY: Yeah, and I would think if you're in a situation where you're ready to go to the emergency room, you might be really getting yourself to the emergency room without going to the computer. You'd know, in other words. HENSLEY: You would, but I think, for instance, in the case of a heart attack, sometimes the symptoms are pain in the arm and things like that, where the person might not connect the dots. But I think you're right. If it's something that's really a full-on emergency, it might be that you're not going to take time to boot up the computer or turn on your phone.

It's called STOPit. Todd Schobel created the app. He was inspired when he heard the story of a 15-year-old girl named Amanda Todd. She was harassed online and off for about two years. In September of 2012, she posted a YouTube video about that abuse, and a month later, she killed herself. Her video went viral. TODD SCHOBEL: I heard that story, and immediately, I pictured a child in a corner of a room just saying, I want it to stop; I want it to stop. SIEGEL: So Schobel created an app that allows students to report bullying anonymously. SCHOBEL: They know what's going on in these digital worlds well before adults do. So you give them a tool, within seconds, they can be an up-stander and not be a bystander. And that's how STOPit was born. SIEGEL: Here's how it works. Schools buy STOPit, and the app is made available to every student for free. Kids can use it to alert the school when they see something. SCHOBEL: So you can just type a message - you know, Jimmy is bringing a gun to school tomorrow - done. You can take a screenshot of anything you see on any electronic device and send that in as evidence. SIEGEL: One of the schools using STOPit is David Brearley Middle and High School in Kenilworth, N. J. BRIAN LUCIANI: We get numerous things online sent to us, whether it's a Twitter feed, a Facebook page, Yik Yak, anything of that nature. SIEGEL: That's Principal Brian Luciani. He says kids with smart phones can have a hard time getting away from bullies. LUCIANI: In the past, when kids had issues in school, even on the way to or from school, there was a breakdown period of maybe 10 to 12 hours where you could kind of be left alone. Now it is 24 hours, seven days a week. It is constant bombardment. SIEGEL: Luciani says the STOPit app makes students accountable. They're uploading screenshots when they see bullying on social media. LUCIANI: When I meet with a parent and I show them what their kids are doing, there's no more number argument about this is what he meant, this is what he didn't mean because you simply read it. And the simple question I always ask is, how would you take this, and what good comes of this comment? SIEGEL: Luciani says STOPit has helped reduce the number of bullying incidents in his school.

S. News and World Report, students are showing more interest in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math. DAVID GREENE, HOST: Black students in particular are making big gains earning advanced degrees. Women are also keeping pace, although large ethnic and gender gaps remain. MONTAGNE: We wanted to know more about the diverse men and women who are already working in American tech and science - the pioneers. And this past spring, for our series #RaceOnTech, we issued a social media callout to link up with them. Nearly 200 people came our way, and we picked 14 of them to feature. NPR's Michel Martin learns more about one. MICHEL MARTIN, BYLINE: Today we meet biologist Mamie Parker, a fish and wildlife specialist sent our way from member station WEAA in Baltimore. Welcome, Dr. Parker, thanks so much for joining us. MAMIE PARKER: Thank you so much for having me. MARTIN: Now, you know I want to know how you got into this field. Did you grow up in a rural area? Were you always fascinated by wildlife? PARKER: I have to say that I was. My mother was an avid angler, sharecropper, had 11 children - I'm number 11. The rest of the boys and girls did not want to be outdoors, but she wanted a companion and taught me life lessons out there. She passed away when I was fairly young, and I decided to do this in her honor. MARTIN: Well, how did you figure out how to make a career out of this interest of yours? PARKER: Well, that is really interesting because I did not see anyone that looked like me doing this type of work. But when I was in ninth grade, I heard the song by Marvin Gaye \"Mercy, Mercy Me\" things are like they used to be, and he talked about the pollution in the air and the wind that was blowing poison and the radiation and all of that. And so it was at that point when I decided, you know, I want to see what I can do about this. So I found out about U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service from a recruiter. Hannibal Bolton was his name and he was looking for interns. But he wanted me to leave Arkansas and head off to Wisconsin. And that was quite frightening for a Southern girl like myself that had hardly been north of Little Rock. But what he said made a lot of sense - you can get paid to do what you like to do best (laughter). Before I knew it, I had 20 years of service doing a lot in the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service. MARTIN: What's your specific expertise? I understand that you have a doctorate in ecology. What do you do? PARKER: Well, what do I do (laughter)? Well, I am a generalist. I work mostly on environmental impacts. So if they're building a bridge or a highway in an area where they're going to cross a river or a stream then I have a job to say, well, it'd be better if you placed it here, there or it would be better if you didn't do this at all, but if you were going to do it, here are some of the things that you can do to mitigate the impacts to the resources. MARTIN: I just wanted to go back to something you said earlier that it was unusual to see somebody like you in that field. Do you mean as a woman or do you mean as an African-American or most especially as an African-American woman? PARKER: Quite frankly, it was both. I remember my first job here in the D. C. area and the janitors in the building, they just kept coming and peeking in and I thought, what are they looking at (laughter)? And finally I saw one in the bathroom and she said I've been here for almost 40 years and she said no African-American woman has been in here except to clean this office. And for her, it was a proud moment. MARTIN: Can I ask how that made you feel? PARKER: Well, I think that it made me feel somewhat motivated to make sure that doesn't happen again where they will be able to see others. So I was inspired, but it is also a sad feeling because you mention pioneers. Michel, pioneers are very lonesome people. As you know, and you've heard people say, to whom much is given much is expected. So I saw it, too, as a responsibility to try to do well and be well in that role. MARTIN: Well, you've also been recognized for your leadership in protecting our waters from invasive species. Has your distinctive profile within this field been a help or a hindrance to you when you're really honest with yourself? PARKER: If I had to really think hard about it, it's been a help to me because of being unique and different in the field. On the other hand, I think the standards for women and minorities are still very high. And therefore, I feel like I have to work really, really harder than most to be successful in this field. And not just me, but most women in. . . MARTIN: Well, why is that though? Because people thought you couldn't take the rigors of fieldwork, or what was the hurdle you were fighting to get over? PARKER: I had many of them. First of all, you're right. Men didn't assume that we could get out there and work the boats and get out in the water. They didn't think we could work by ourselves out in the woods. They thought we'd be afraid of things like that. Not all men, I want to make it clear, but many did. I also was a Southerner going to the north, had a strong accent in their minds, so dealing with the actual stereotypes of different people from different parts of the country was even a challenge for me. And then the biggest challenge is not having family or friends in many of those places because I was pretty isolated. MARTIN: So bringing it to the present moment, there's been a lot of new attention to the whole question of diversity within the STEM workforce - and once again, that's science, technology, engineering and math. Given your long history in this field, what are your thoughts about that? PARKER: I think people from community of color really suffer a lot, again, from isolation, from feeling the need to prove themselves. And over time, it becomes very difficult to continue to work at a pace like that, and you have to really believe that the benefits outweigh the costs. And then also mentors are so important - having the right individual there for you when you think about quitting or you want to cry. And a lot of times I had to cry on the shoulders of those janitors in that building. You know, they were the ones that were there for me, telling me to get up and get back in the race again, you know? So there are people out there that can help children and adults now in the field. MARTIN: Mamie Parker holds a doctorate in ecology. She is now retired. She's a former assistant director at the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and she joined us here in Washington, D. C. Dr. Parker, thanks so much for speaking with us. PARKER: Thank you for having me. MARTIN: You can also share your stories and follow the digital footprint of Native American, Latino, Asian and African-Americans on the cutting edge of innovation using the hashtag #RaceOnTech.

But when I was in ninth grade, I heard the song by Marvin Gaye \"Mercy, Mercy Me\" things are like they used to be, and he talked about the pollution in the air and the wind that was blowing poison and the radiation and all of that. And so it was at that point when I decided, you know, I want to see what I can do about this. So I found out about U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service from a recruiter. Hannibal Bolton was his name and he was looking for interns. But he wanted me to leave Arkansas and head off to Wisconsin. And that was quite frightening for a Southern girl like myself that had hardly been north of Little Rock. But what he said made a lot of sense - you can get paid to do what you like to do best (laughter). Before I knew it, I had 20 years of service doing a lot in the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service. MARTIN: What's your specific expertise? I understand that you have a doctorate in ecology. What do you do? PARKER: Well, what do I do (laughter)? Well, I am a generalist. I work mostly on environmental impacts. So if they're building a bridge or a highway in an area where they're going to cross a river or a stream then I have a job to say, well, it'd be better if you placed it here, there or it would be better if you didn't do this at all, but if you were going to do it, here are some of the things that you can do to mitigate the impacts to the resources. MARTIN: I just wanted to go back to something you said earlier that it was unusual to see somebody like you in that field. Do you mean as a woman or do you mean as an African-American or most especially as an African-American woman? PARKER: Quite frankly, it was both. I remember my first job here in the D. C. area and the janitors in the building, they just kept coming and peeking in and I thought, what are they looking at (laughter)? And finally I saw one in the bathroom and she said I've been here for almost 40 years and she said no African-American woman has been in here except to clean this office. And for her, it was a proud moment. MARTIN: Can I ask how that made you feel? PARKER: Well, I think that it made me feel somewhat motivated to make sure that doesn't happen again where they will be able to see others. So I was inspired, but it is also a sad feeling because you mention pioneers. Michel, pioneers are very lonesome people. As you know, and you've heard people say, to whom much is given much is expected. So I saw it, too, as a responsibility to try to do well and be well in that role. MARTIN: Well, you've also been recognized for your leadership in protecting our waters from invasive species. Has your distinctive profile within this field been a help or a hindrance to you when you're really honest with yourself? PARKER: If I had to really think hard about it, it's been a help to me because of being unique and different in the field. On the other hand, I think the standards for women and minorities are still very high. And therefore, I feel like I have to work really, really harder than most to be successful in this field. And not just me, but most women in. . . MARTIN: Well, why is that though? Because people thought you couldn't take the rigors of fieldwork, or what was the hurdle you were fighting to get over? PARKER: I had many of them. First of all, you're right. Men didn't assume that we could get out there and work the boats and get out in the water. They didn't think we could work by ourselves out in the woods. They thought we'd be afraid of things like that. Not all men, I want to make it clear, but many did. I also was a Southerner going to the north, had a strong accent in their minds, so dealing with the actual stereotypes of different people from different parts of the country was even a challenge for me. And then the biggest challenge is not having family or friends in many of those places because I was pretty isolated. MARTIN: So bringing it to the present moment, there's been a lot of new attention to the whole question of diversity within the STEM workforce - and once again, that's science, technology, engineering and math. Given your long history in this field, what are your thoughts about that? PARKER: I think people from community of color really suffer a lot, again, from isolation, from feeling the need to prove themselves. And over time, it becomes very difficult to continue to work at a pace like that, and you have to really believe that the benefits outweigh the costs. And then also mentors are so important - having the right individual there for you when you think about quitting or you want to cry. And a lot of times I had to cry on the shoulders of those janitors in that building. You know, they were the ones that were there for me, telling me to get up and get back in the race again, you know? So there are people out there that can help children and adults now in the field. MARTIN: Mamie Parker holds a doctorate in ecology. She is now retired. She's a former assistant director at the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and she joined us here in Washington, D. C. Dr. Parker, thanks so much for speaking with us. PARKER: Thank you for having me. MARTIN: You can also share your stories and follow the digital footprint of Native American, Latino, Asian and African-Americans on the cutting edge of innovation using the hashtag #RaceOnTech.", "section": "Michel Martin, Going There", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2015 NPR.

I'm Guy Raz. We're talking about how to use and preserve finite resources on the show today, which few people in all of human history did better than MacGyver from that '80s TV show. NAVI RADJOU: MacGyver was my and remains my favorite TV action hero. RAZ: This is Navi Radjou. He's an innovation consultant and MacGyver fan. RADJOU: He will find himself in all kinds of crazy places, you know, in a prison cell, in somewhere in, you know, South America or whatever it is. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MACGYVER\")RICHARD DEAN ANDERSON: (As MacGyver) All right, MacGyver, think - rope. . . RADJOU: And he would just look around, and he will find some resources. . . . (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MACGYVER\")ANDERSON: (As MacGyver) . . . A smoke alarm, sheets of plywood. RADJOU: . . . That for us doesn't look like something to create a solution. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MACGYVER\")ANDERSON: (As MacGyver) It just might work. RADJOU: But he can do it. RAZ: That dude made, like, jetpacks out of toilet rolls. RADJOU: Yes, yes. I mean, what I like about this guy is that, you know, unlike James Bond, he doesn't wear a fancy suit, he doesn't have a Rolex. RAZ: James Bond had Q. MacGyver had toilet rolls. RADJOU: (Laughter) Exactly. MacGyver is like - you know, he's a one-man show. RAZ: Navi is probably such a MacGyver enthusiast because he grew up in a place where he had to be resourceful - in the city of Pondicherry, India. RADJOU: It's a very dry climate, so you don't have, you know, much water. Electricity was in short supply. For me, it's like living with less is almost like the norm. RAZ: About 18 years ago, Navi moved to Silicon Valley, and he started consulting for tech companies. And instead of being wowed by their innovation, he was baffled by how casually they were wasting basic resources. RADJOU: The one thing that struck me all the time is to see in the evenings all these office buildings being lit up. That's something I never understood is, like, you know, there's nobody working there after 6-7 p. m. , but I just see, like, it's all lit up. RAZ: The other resource Navi noticed companies squandering? Money, specifically when it came to research and development. RADJOU: Just because you invest more in R and D doesn't make a company more innovative. Maybe we need to look at a different way of innovating. RAZ: Maybe innovation, he thought, would happen in a more constrained environment. RADJOU: Because when you put a limitation on resources, you remove the limitation - right? - on creativity because necessity is the mother of invention. RAZ: Navi calls this idea frugal innovation, and he believes big tech companies could learn from inventors in the developing world. Here's his TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)RADJOU: For the past seven years, I have met and studied hundreds of entrepreneurs in India, China, Africa and South America, and they keep amazing me. Many of them did not go to school. They don't invent stuff in big R and D labs. The street is the lab. Why they do that? Because they don't have the kind of basic resources we take for granted like capital energy, and basic services like healthcare, education are also scarce in those regions. Take Mansukh Prajapati, a potter in India. He has created a fridge made entirely of clay that consumes no electricity. It can keep fruits and vegetables fresh for many days. In Africa, if you run off of your cell phone battery, don't panic. You'll find some resourceful entrepreneurs who can recharge your cell phone using their bicycles. Let's go to Lima in Peru, a region with high humidity and receives only one inch of rainfall each year. An intern in college in Lima designed a giant advertising billboard that absorbs air humidity and converts it into purified water generating over 90 liters of water every day. That can literally create water out of thin air. In India, we call it jugaad. Jugaad is a Hindi word that means an improvised fix, a clever solution born in adversity. RAZ: Yeah, I mean, in some ways, you're more liberated when you don't have as many resources. RADJOU: I think so because I always believe that when you have nothing to lose, the sky is the limit, right? RAZ: Yeah. RADJOU: So I think that a lot of big companies after a while stop innovating and die like Kodak - right? - who missed completely the digital revolution - is because they become so risk covers. So that means they have too much to lose. So when you have too much to lose, you only take baby steps, you know, in terms of discovering new things. But when you start from the bottom, you have nothing to lose. You are like an underdog. So when you are more on the offensive, you tend to innovate. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)RADJOU: I believe that the only way we can sustain growth and prosperity in the West is if we learn to do more with less. The good news is that's starting to happen. Several Western companies are now adopting frugal innovation to create affordable products for Western consumers. Let me give an example. In China, the R and D engineers of Simmons Healthcare have designed a CT scanner that is easy enough to be used by less qualified health workers like nurses and technicians. This device can scan more patients on a daily basis and yet consumes less energy, which is great for hospitals but is also great for patients because it reduces the cost of treatment by 30 percent and radiation dosage by up to 60 percent. This solution was initially designed for the Chinese market, but now it's selling like hotcakes in U. S. and Europe where hospitals are pressured to deliver quality care at lower cost. Ultimately, you'd like to see developed countries and developing countries come together and co-create frugal solutions that benefit the entire humanity. RAZ: So it sounds like you're proposing that we completely reimagine the way we make things. RADJOU: I would say yes, absolutely. We have to fundamentally redesign products, rethink the whole supply chain. My feeling is that what you begin to see is that companies also are now recognizing and research shows more and more there is indeed, in a way, a growing awareness among consumers around issues related to the environment. So they also expect companies to behave, you know, more environmentally responsible way. So I think it's going to happen, you know, gradually in the U. S. But when I look at Europe or Asia, I actually see a lot more aggressive moves by the governments, by citizens and by companies to actually embrace new innovation techniques that are more resource-efficient. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)RADJOU: As an Indian-born French national who lives in the United States, my hope is that we can harness the collective ingenuity of innovators from around the world to co-create frugal solutions that will improve the quality of life of everyone in the world while preserving our precious planet. Thank you very much. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: Navi Radjou - he is the co-author of the books \"Frugal Innovation\" and \"Jugaad Innovation. \" You can see his entire talk at ted. com.

These days, with Hulu and Netflix and all the network streaming online, you don't have to watch \"American Horror Story\" or \"The Bachelor\" live.

BECKY SULLIVAN, BYLINE: ESPN has been sitting pretty through all this cord-cutting stuff for one simple reason. People want to watch sports live. SHALINI RAMACHANDRAN: You're not going to wait two years to watch your football game. So that's kind of what has been holding together this idea of - all right, I'm going to pay for this bundle of 500 live channels 'cause I want to watch live sports the day it happens. SULLIVAN: Shalini Ramachandran is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal. She's been covering the cable industry for years. But even ESPN, she says, the king of live sports - they're showing signs of trouble. RAMACHANDRAN: In little over a year, basically since May 2014, it's lost 3. 2 million subscribers. SULLIVAN: Left and right, people are cutting the cord, and every time they do, ESPN loses a subscriber. Both the networks and providers are scrambling to figure out why these people are leaving. I called up two of them to find out for myself. JON DUARTE: You know, 90 bucks wasn't an expense that I could afford. SULLIVAN: Jon Duarte is an IT guy in San Antonio who loves sports. But he's from California originally, so it was tough to find his teams on TV in Texas, even with cable. DUARTE: Luckily, if the Spurs played the Lakers, I got to watch the Lakers. Or if ESPN was showing the Laker game, it was cool. But actually cutting the cord and then finding alternate sources gave me the ability to watch the Lakers, the Angels or the Niners. SULLIVAN: Turns out the choice is even easier if you don't like sports, like Benjamin Klahn in Joliet, Ill. , who realized he was paying hundreds of dollars a year basically to watch reruns and the Discovery Channel. BENJAMIN KLAHN: I'd seen a number of articles over the years about how much ESPN charges for the cable operators. So looking at my bill of, like, 50, 60 bucks a month, I'm paying a huge amount to ESPN, and I don't even like it. SULLIVAN: Millions of people now have left cable entirely, which means everyone who profited off of the reigning bundle model are now trying to figure out how to keep making money off of these people. For their part, cable providers have started selling what they call skinny packages - fewer channels, no ESPN. The sports leagues are also finding ways to hang onto these guys. The NBA, the NHL, the MLB - all of them already offer their own standalone streaming services, nut none of that helps ESPN, who still have to pay these huge fees for the right to broadcast these live sports in the first place. Just last fall, Shalini Ramachandran says, the NBA struck a new deal with ESPN, and the price nearly tripled to $1. 4 billion a season. All of this has left ESPN to tighten their belt elsewhere. RAMACHANDRAN: Because a lot of their costs are things that are really hugely valuable in what make ESPN what is, which is rights contracts with the NFL, the NBA - these big leagues. They can't really cut there. SULLIVAN: Finally, Ramachandran says, sports fans are notoriously tech savvy.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Four-hundred-and-fifty-three. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Twenty-five. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Time for some number crunching from our data expert Mona Chalabi from fivethirtyeight. com. She has given us this number of the week. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: Two-hundred-and-eighty-thousand. MARTIN: That is the total number of requests people have made to Google asking the search engine to remove Web pages about them from its searches. The company gets to decide whether to approve or deny each individual request. That decision-making process has come under scrutiny this past week. Here to explain is Mona Chalabi. Hey, Mona. MONA CHALABI, BYLINE: Hi, Rachel. MARTIN: Let's start with a very basic question first, Mona. What exactly is it that people are asking Google to do, remove Web pages in which they're mentioned? CHALABI: Kind of. So what they want to do is remove evidence of themselves online because, a reminded here, everything you do online stays online. And some people basically don't like that. So they want to erase their digital footprint. In Europe, people have the right to make that kind of request because back in May, 2014, the European Court of Justice - that's the highest court in the European Union - they ruled that an Internet search engine has to consider requests from individuals to remove links resulting from a search on their name. The ruling basically supported what's known as the right to be forgotten. So since that ruling back in May, over 280,000 requests have been made to Google. MARTIN: And are all those requests - 280,000 - those are all coming from Europe because we can't do that here in the states, right? CHALABI: So basically, if you're not happy about what you see when you Google Rachel Martin, for now there's not much you can do about it besides speaking to the people that produced that original content. MARTIN: All right. So this original European Court ruling came down in 2014. So why is this issue coming up now? CHALABI: Because it was this week that the British newspaper The Guardian found data that Google never intended to publish. And that data, according to a Guardian analysis, shows that some requests are coming from celebrities and politicians, as you probably might expect. . . MARTIN: Because they're really famous, and a lot of their biography is online. And maybe they don't like that. CHALABI: Exactly - sort of high-profile individuals who want to kind of manage their public image, if you like. But according to The Guardian, 95 percent of the requests that are being made to Google have come from regular members of the public. MARTIN: All right, so can you give me an example of what a request might look like? CHALABI: Sure. Google actually published several anecdotes on their site to illustrate the decisions that they're making. So in Sweden, for example, there was a woman who wanted to remove pages from search results that showed her home address. And Google accepted that one. In Hungary, by contrast, a high-ranking public official requested the articles that had been written about a really old criminal conviction be removed by Google. And Google actually turned down that request. Just to be clear, these aren't requests about removing the pages themselves from the Internet. They're requests to stop them from showing up in a Google search. And I guess the hope is that by them not appearing in Google, they're a lot harder to find. And they're kind of invisible. MARTIN: OK. So is there any data that shows how often Google grants these requests? CHALABI: Yeah. This information was also in the Google data that The Guardian retrieved and published this week. So as of March, 46 percent of all requests had been granted. Thirty-eight percent had been rejected. And the others were still pending a decision. But success also seems to kind of depend on the type of request made. So you can see the categories that Google have used. And removal requests that were marked with the label political, public figure, serious crime or child protection all had much higher rejection rates. MARTIN: So we've been talking about all these requests that are coming from Europeans. What about privacy rights here in the U. S. ? Is there any movement afoot to allow American users of Google the same right? CHALABI: There's absolutely a debate about this in the United States. But for the moment, citizens can't make the same request to Google that their European counterparts can. For U. S. companies, thought, it's a different story altogether. So so far, we can see that Google has received requests relating to copyright issues for about 41 million URLs. Now, the data isn't actually split up by country, but some of those are obviously American companies. Just by scanning the first two pages of requests, I can see Microsoft. I can also see Universal Music being listed there. And it's not just the private sector either. Google have received about 16,000 requests from courts and government agencies around the world to remove information from Google products since December, 2009. Two-thousand-two-hundred of those 16,000 requests came from the USA. That's the third-highest number of requests of any country in the world after Turkey and Brazil. Now, unfortunately, the really, really juicy stuff - I can't actually tell you what exactly governments are requesting to be removed. In fact, I can't tell you anything really beyond those numbers because that's all that gets published in Google's transparency report. And it also wasn't part of what The Guardian managed to kind of access earlier on this week. MARTIN: Mona Chalabi of fivethirtyeight. com. Thanks so much, Mona. CHALABI: Thanks, Rachel. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Fifty-two. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Four-hundred-and-fifty-three. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Twenty-five. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Time for some number crunching from our data expert Mona Chalabi from fivethirtyeight. com. She has given us this number of the week. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: Two-hundred-and-eighty-thousand. MARTIN: That is the total number of requests people have made to Google asking the search engine to remove Web pages about them from its searches. The company gets to decide whether to approve or deny each individual request. That decision-making process has come under scrutiny this past week. Here to explain is Mona Chalabi. Hey, Mona. MONA CHALABI, BYLINE: Hi, Rachel. MARTIN: Let's start with a very basic question first, Mona. What exactly is it that people are asking Google to do, remove Web pages in which they're mentioned? CHALABI: Kind of. So what they want to do is remove evidence of themselves online because, a reminded here, everything you do online stays online. And some people basically don't like that. So they want to erase their digital footprint. In Europe, people have the right to make that kind of request because back in May, 2014, the European Court of Justice - that's the highest court in the European Union - they ruled that an Internet search engine has to consider requests from individuals to remove links resulting from a search on their name. The ruling basically supported what's known as the right to be forgotten. So since that ruling back in May, over 280,000 requests have been made to Google. MARTIN: And are all those requests - 280,000 - those are all coming from Europe because we can't do that here in the states, right? CHALABI: So basically, if you're not happy about what you see when you Google Rachel Martin, for now there's not much you can do about it besides speaking to the people that produced that original content.

And I can't see anything because of the (expletive) windshield wiper fluid. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: OK, do it. Do it. Kill the engine. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: The last voice we heard was from a hacker who had remotely accessed the car's air-conditioning, stereo, wipers and ultimately cut the car's engine. It was part of a planned hack described in a pretty terrifying account in Wired Magazine today. Well, Senator Richard Blumenthal is among those concerned about the vulnerability of connected cars, and today introduced legislation to address it. He joins us now from Capitol Hill. Senator Blumenthal, welcome to the program. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: Thanks so much, Melissa. Good to be with you. BLOCK: And why did you start thinking about this? What's your big fear? BLUMENTHAL: Both Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts and I are concerned about protecting drivers from both security and privacy threats that are raised by the new advances in technology that are occurring. They're great in connecting drivers and their automobiles to the cyber world, but at the same time, they raise threats of security, such as you've just heard. Hackers can literally take control of your car. People intending to do you harm - domestic abusers, for example - could exploit these vulnerabilities to conduct surveillance. And automakers and technology companies they partner with will have incentives to sell information, violate your privacy. And that information can be sold to marketers, to others, shared, exchanged. This kind of the wild west of connecting the drivers without protecting them is what concerns us. BLOCK: And are all cars vulnerable in the way you're describing? How many are we talking about? BLUMENTHAL: All cars that are wireless-connected could be vulnerable, unless - and here's where our legislation is important - unless there are standards imposed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, also known as NHTSA, and the Federal Trade Commission, the FTC, to establish basic criteria - minimum kind of rules of the road, so to speak, that the automakers have to meet to protect consumers. BLOCK: And what kinds of costs to consumers do you think we're talking about if those standards that you want to see put in place are, in fact, enacted? BLUMENTHAL: The costs are minimal, and auto safety has been a priority of mine and others as we battle cybersecurity threats. Across many sectors of our economy, we're dealing with the costs in many different contexts. And we need to protect safety because when hackers take control of cars, people are directly and immediately in danger. Nothing could be more dangerous than, in effect, losing control of a car. And also, private information about where one shops or visits or drops off children or goes to the movies - that kind of basic information all also ought to be protected. The costs are well worth it, but they're minimal. BLOCK: One last thing before I let you go. We know that Chrysler has released a software update - a patch - to improve electronic security. The idea is it would prevent an attack like the one that the hackers carried out on that Jeep for Wired Magazine. Isn't it in carmakers' interests to improve security on their own, to be competitive without legislative intervention? BLUMENTHAL: Better security is a good selling point for the carmakers, but so is auto safety. We require minimal standards for auto safety, whether it's brakes or steering, and so we should also with wireless connections. And that fix by Chrysler, by the way, is a manual fix. We know from other safety defects that recall rates hover about 70 percent. It's much better to require cars to be secure before they leave the lot, rather than asking consumers to fix them after the fact. And I welcome Chrysler's recognition of this problem, but many of these car manufacturers are rolling out the next big thing - Wi-Fi in your car - and they have overlooked safety. What we need is standards, and they ought to be flexible standards in the law enforced federally by NHTSA. BLOCK: OK. Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, thanks for talking with us.

And imagine during his administration, tornadoes filled with man-eating sharks hit the eastern seaboard. All that happens tonight on Syfy's disaster movie parody, \"Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No! \" NPR TV critic Eric Deggans says this one is truly a disaster. ERIC DEGGANS, BYLINE: What's the first sign that Syfy's latest \"Sharknado\" movie is a dead horse beaten into a fine paste? The fact that appearances from NBC's \"Today\" show crew talking about tornadoes filled with man-eating sharks doesn't really seem that unusual anymore. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"SHARKNADO 3: OH HELL NO! \")MATT LAUER: (As himself) I'm Matt Lauer along with Savannah Guthrie, the \"Today\" show reporting live now. The Washington Monument, the White House, not far from where we are right now, both destroyed by the worst sharknado this country has seen since the first formation two years ago. DEGGANS: Fans of Syfy's aggressively awful disaster flick knows this means one thing. Ian Ziering's aptly named hero, Fin Shepard, is back in the thick of it. In a country filled with science guys and brainiacs, he's the only one who can really predict the ways of the sharknado. At least, that's what he tells the nation's president, Mark Cuban. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"SHARKNADO 3: OH HELL NO! \")IAN ZIERING: (As Fin Shepard) D. C. isn't safe. MARK CUBAN: (As U. S. President) What? ZIERING: (As Fin Shepard) I know how this is going to sound, but I can sense these storms now - the drop in temperature, the humidity, these crazy cloud formations. These sharks, they have a scent, and it's not a pretty one. DEGGANS: Neither is the scent of this movie, which has the distinct aroma of a joke repeated way too often. Now, to be fair, it has all the stuff that made the first two \"Sharknados\" such absurd, so-bad-it's-fun-to-watch entertainment. There's the gobbledygook explanations for how sharks survive in a tornado. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"SHARKNADO 3: OH HELL NO! \")UNIDENTIFIED ACTRESS: (As character) But sharknado sharks, they eat something that regular sharks don't, birds. DEGGANS: And there's the stunt casting of B- and C-level celebrities like David Hasselhoff and Ann Coulter, who plays the vice president. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"SHARKNADO 3: OH HELL NO! \")UNIDENTIFIED ACTRESS: (As character) What's your opinion of these shark storms, Madam Vice President? ANN COULTER: (As U. S. Vice President) I feel for the sharks, but they're wrecking our schools, our hospitals, our roads. DEGGANS: I won't say if she gets eaten by a shark or not. There's a fine line between movies that are so stupid they're fun to watch and movies that are just plain stupid. And \"Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No! \" proves even the dumbest fun can be ruined if you just tell the same lame joke over and over and over again. That won't bother Syfy or its owner, NBC Universal. Last year, \"Sharknado's\" sequel became the channel's most-watched original movie ever. It drew nearly 4 million viewers and one billion Twitter impressions. And that's one reason other cable channels have tried making fun of themselves with their own parody movies. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)DEGGANS: For instance, Lifetime's aptly titled film \"A Deadly Adoption\" featured Will Ferrell and Kristen Wiig. The two comic actors played it mostly straight as a couple who take in a pregnant woman who turns out to be a murderous psycho. Here, Ferrell is telling police their guest may have kidnapped their child. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"A DEADLY ADOPTION\")WILL FERRELL: (As Robert Benson) Have you issued some sort of alert? Are you putting up a roadblock? KRISTEN WIIG: (As Sarah Benson) She's pregnant, and we're adopting her baby. We actually know very little about her. She seems very nice. I'm sure this is just a misunderstanding. DEGGANS: Though it was kind of boring, \"A Deadly Adoption\" was the highest-rated original show on cable the night it aired. These kinds of movies, including \"Sharknado 3,\" make sense for cable channels seeking more media coverage and a new audience. But in \"Sharknado's\" case, Syfy's crafted a new installment that's a pale echo of the earlier versions, leaving fans to wonder what was really so funny the first time around. I'm Eric Deggans.

These sharks, they have a scent, and it's not a pretty one. DEGGANS: Neither is the scent of this movie, which has the distinct aroma of a joke repeated way too often. Now, to be fair, it has all the stuff that made the first two \"Sharknados\" such absurd, so-bad-it's-fun-to-watch entertainment. There's the gobbledygook explanations for how sharks survive in a tornado. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"SHARKNADO 3: OH HELL NO! \") UNIDENTIFIED ACTRESS: (As character) But sharknado sharks, they eat something that regular sharks don't, birds. DEGGANS: And there's the stunt casting of B- and C-level celebrities like David Hasselhoff and Ann Coulter, who plays the vice president. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"SHARKNADO 3: OH HELL NO! \") UNIDENTIFIED ACTRESS: (As character) What's your opinion of these shark storms, Madam Vice President? ANN COULTER: (As U. S. Vice President) I feel for the sharks, but they're wrecking our schools, our hospitals, our roads. DEGGANS: I won't say if she gets eaten by a shark or not. There's a fine line between movies that are so stupid they're fun to watch and movies that are just plain stupid. And \"Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No! \" proves even the dumbest fun can be ruined if you just tell the same lame joke over and over and over again. That won't bother Syfy or its owner, NBC Universal. Last year, \"Sharknado's\" sequel became the channel's most-watched original movie ever. It drew nearly 4 million viewers and one billion Twitter impressions. And that's one reason other cable channels have tried making fun of themselves with their own parody movies. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DEGGANS: For instance, Lifetime's aptly titled film \"A Deadly Adoption\" featured Will Ferrell and Kristen Wiig. The two comic actors played it mostly straight as a couple who take in a pregnant woman who turns out to be a murderous psycho. Here, Ferrell is telling police their guest may have kidnapped their child. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"A DEADLY ADOPTION\") WILL FERRELL: (As Robert Benson) Have you issued some sort of alert? Are you putting up a roadblock? KRISTEN WIIG: (As Sarah Benson) She's pregnant, and we're adopting her baby. We actually know very little about her. She seems very nice. I'm sure this is just a misunderstanding. DEGGANS: Though it was kind of boring, \"A Deadly Adoption\" was the highest-rated original show on cable the night it aired. These kinds of movies, including \"Sharknado 3,\" make sense for cable channels seeking more media coverage and a new audience. But in \"Sharknado's\" case, Syfy's crafted a new installment that's a pale echo of the earlier versions, leaving fans to wonder what was really so funny the first time around.

The people who want to use drones more widely inside the United States include the Air National Guard. It's building up a fleet of unmanned aerial vehicles. And military drones over U. S. territory are making some Americans uneasy. Here's Blake Farmer of our member station WPLN in Nashville. BLAKE FARMER, BYLINE: To understand why the National Guard would push to use drones domestically, remember that the guard is a collection of state-based militias. COLONEL KEITH ALBRITTEN: Most of the time, I work for the governor. How can I help the governor? How can I help him, in his state, with the problems that he has? FARMER: That's Colonel Keith Albritten of the Tennessee Air Guard. Up until a few years ago, his unit flew C-130s. But those nonthreatening cargo planes, often used to ferry supplies during disasters, have replaced by something a bit more ominous, the MQ-9 Reaper. It's a high-altitude, high-speed drone with a wingspan of more than 60 feet. It can carry Hellfire missiles and stay airborne for 24 hours without refueling. I took a tour of the hanger expecting an up-close look. All right, so where are the Reaper UAVs? ALBRITTEN: (Laughter) keep looking, my friend. Keep looking. They are not here. FARMER: A dozen guard units have drone missions. Five of them can take off and land in American bases. The rest, like this Tennessee unit, pilot drones that live overseas, taking off from foreign bases, controlled from here via satellites. The work is so secretive, Albritten won't even point out the building his pilots are in. ALBRITTEN: I can't really say. FARMER: Really? ALBRITTEN: Operational security - I can't really talk about that. FARMER: And that's the answer to a lot of questions about this. ALBRITTEN: It is. It is. I agree, but that part is the classified part. FARMER: Albritten wants an unclassified role for the drones too, offering surveillance during floods or after tornado outbreaks, assisting with manhunts and drug busts. He's raised his hand with the Pentagon to get what he calls iron in the state. ALBRITTEN: There's no iron. There's no aircraft here in Tennessee. I will say we're working to try to get iron in the state so that they're available for the governor to use in a state of emergency. FARMER: It's been done before. In 2013, a disarmed MQ-1 Predator hovered high above the smoke and flames of a remote wildfire near Yosemite, feeding live infrared video to the ground. The California Guard was so proud of this milestone it produced a highlight reel set to a dramatic score. (SOUNDBITE OF HIGHLIGHT REEL)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: This was a historical moment. I mean, we've been fighting for this to support the - you know, the American people here on the home soil. FARMER: But there's plenty of suspicion. In Tennessee, State Senator Mae Beavers pushed through a law governing drones and unwarranted surveillance. It targets police. But she has concerns about the military as well. MAE BEAVERS: The very idea that someone could use a drone to spy on you through your windows at home or, you know, in the privacy of your backyard even, I think that bothers people. ALBRITTEN: I don't care anything about you being in your backyard flipping burgers. FARMER: That's Col. Albritten again. He cites multiple layers of state and federal oversight. No less than the secretary of defense must sign off on any U. S. operation. Albritten says all video would be publicly available, and the unmanned aircraft wouldn't carry weapons. Still, there's some pushback even among drone supporters. RICHARD DAVIS: I mean, with the name Reaper, the first thing people think about are these killing machines. FARMER: Richard Davis is an assistant fire chief in Austin, Texas. He's researched and written about unmanned aircraft. He's an advocate for using drones in disaster response, but the less menacing kind - not the military's long-range high-flyers. DAVIS: In some cases, it would be overkill. FARMER: But if Reapers and Predators are what you have, guardsmen ask, why not use them. Tennessee Guard Commander Max Haston sees the drones as no more dangerous than other spying gear, like eavesdropping equipment. MAJOR GENERAL MAX HASTON: If I've got a device that's a listening device, I can't take it home and turn it on my neighbor's house and hear what he's doing. And that's illegal. FARMER: Still, Major General Haston acknowledges the anxiety. HASTON: I think the public has a fear of the government, you know, big brother spying on them. But it's less of a threat than driving down I-40 or I-65 with all the cameras on the road. It's there. FARMER: And if commanders like Haston have their way, National Guard drones will occasionally be there too. For NPR News, I'm Blake Farmer in Nashville.

And wouldn't you know it, the wooden Pinocchio magically became a real child. Fantasy games are the Pinocchio of sport, for all who play them become Geppettos. Isn't it the dream of every fan to construct his or her own team as Geppetto wanted to carve out a son? And fantasy sports allows that. You draft your own players for your make-believe team. And then you bet based on how your real players perform in real games. But then we call that fantasy - legal fantasy. According to federal law - now, get this - it's legal for you to bet on your make-believe team when it plays other make-believe teams, even though you cannot bet on real teams when they play other real teams. The rationale is that in selecting players for your team - let's say some San Francisco Giants - your analysis of baseball qualifies the activity as a game of skill. But in contradiction, you can't legally bet on the actual San Francisco Giants as an entity, even though you would be applying the same skills to evaluate your wager. It isn't just fantasy sports; it's fantasy jurisprudence. But it is hardly any dreamland. Fantasy sports are now estimated to be a $2 billion a year business in the United States with 57 million players. And each year, the numbers explode with more serious investors happy to broker the action. Just this month, Yahoo threw into the big time, booking games every day. Although, it is no fantasy that Yahoo will bank 10 percent of what they take in. To make it even more bizarre, while professional sports leagues have all taken hysterical stands against changing the federal law, which prohibits gambling on actual games, the sanctimonious leagues have entered into partnerships with major fantasy sites. You have to wonder with a lot of fans if already fantasy hasn't begun to trump reality. A fan may root for an actual team, but it's only an emotional attachment. With his fantasy team, he's put cash on the barrel head - ah, for love or for money? Pinocchio eventually became a real boy. Geppetto's fantasy beat reality. Why, if the popularity of fantasy sports keeps growing, someday we may play real games just to support our fantasy habit.

Fire officials have had to call off several operations to drop water and flame retardant on wildfires because private drones were hovering in the air space, apparently shooting video footage of the fires. Five drones were spotted over last weekend's San Bernardino County fire that engulfed Interstate 15. Those drones could cause a disastrous accident. Jennifer Medina has been writing about this for The New York Times, and she joins me now. And Jennifer, first, whose drones are these? Why exactly are they there? JENNIFER MEDINA: We don't really know specifically whose drones they are. One of the interesting things about drones is, there's no real way to know who's the owner and who is operating it from the ground. What we do know is that they're presumably hobbyists who are just interested in seeing what the fire looks like. As surely everyone knows, fires are huge and hard to see and really grasp from the ground, and an aerial shot is sort of this thing of horrific beauty. So presumably they're trying to capture that either to post to YouTube or perhaps to sell to news organizations. BLOCK: Now, drones are tiny. What are the risks that they pose to airplanes or helicopters that are trying to make drops of flame retardant or water? MEDINA: So firefighters say that no matter how tiny these things might be, they can get sucked quite easily into the propeller of a helicopter or an engine of an airplane and cause the aircraft to go down quite quickly. They also say they can lose their attention in a moment where every second that they're operating matters. BLOCK: Well, there's now legislation that's been introduced there in California to respond to this problem of drones in that airspace. What would that legislation do? MEDINA: There's two pieces of legislation that legislators here are pushing. One would increase fines and criminal punishment for people who operate and interfere with a fire using a drone. Another would give firefighters or law enforcement the ability to scramble the signals of a drone so that they would have the ability to take it out of the sky the moment they notice it. BLOCK: There are critics of those ideas though. They say they're premature and also just might not work. What are the problems that they see? MEDINA: Nobody knows what it would look like if you would take a drone out of the sky right away and how those things would - the mechanics of how that would play out and how it would work. BLOCK: Jennifer, have you been able to talk to any drone operators who would defend their right to shoot above wildfires like this? MEDINA: I spoke to several drone operators, and interestingly, none of them really defended the right to do this. They all sort of felt like they had worked quite hard to establish a better reputation for drone operators and show that they're responsible actors and they know what they're doing and they're safe. And they refer to people who do something like this as idiots who really tarnish their reputations and put people's lives at risk. One person I spoke with, who's actually a professor of drone journalism, said, look, there is an argument to be made that there's news value and public interest value in this kind of footage, and we should find a way to work out ways that drones can operate. BLOCK: Wait a minute, Jennifer - did you just say professor of drone journalism? MEDINA: I did indeed. BLOCK: That is a field I know nothing about. . . MEDINA: (Laughter). Me neither. BLOCK: . . .

(SOUNDBITE OF COMPUTER BEEPING)SIMON: So do their signature sounds. (SOUNDBITE OF COMPUTER TURNING ON)SIMON: Matt Parker thought that meant losing touch with some of our history. He's created an archive of sound recordings from the historic computers of Bletchley Park, the site where British mathematician scientist spies broke Germany's military codes during World War II. He's worked those sounds into a new series of musical compositions on an album called \"The Imitation Archive. \" Matt Parker joins us from Birmingham, Great Britain. Thanks so much for being with us. MATT PARKER: Thanks for inviting me onto the show. SIMON: Tell us about some of these machines and their sounds that struck you. PARKER: I suppose the - probably one of the most famous machines that's at the National Museum of Computing in Bletchley Park is a machine call Colossus. (SOUNDBITE OF COLOSSUS COMPUTER)PARKER: Colossus is recognized as being the first-ever fully programmable digital computer. It's amazing that it was kept a secret given that it's a massive machine. It's the size of a large hall. And there were several of these in use during the Second World War. They make incredibly loud mechanical sort of crunching sounds with incredibly rhythmic cadence is to them. (SOUNDBITE OF COLOSSUS COMPUTERS)PARKER: And it's amazing that no one ever wanted to make music out of them before, really, because they make such distinctive rhythmic patterns that I just had to work with it. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG)SIMON: How would you react to someone who says that these songs seem to have a kind of brooding quality? PARKER: Well, I suppose it's the way in which that I choose to interpret it. And it's probably a fair enough comment, I suppose. When I thought about the time that I'd spent late at night when the museum was closed, where I sort of could get, you know, good quality clean recordings, it was a very brooding and moody place. And some of the particular machines - particularly these Second World War Heritage machines that are there, you know, they were used in quite moody and broody environments. And so I think it's a fitting way to reflect the experiences that one has inside an early computer hall. So I suppose it's the way I want to interpret these spaces. I think they are a bit menacing. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG)SIMON: Do you hope that by putting these sounds into music, it'll maybe preserve some of our historical appreciation for those sounds and what they mean? PARKER: Yeah, I think it's really important to keep sound archives like this. So \"The Imitation Archive\" is a series of compositions. But it's also - in addition to that, I recorded - I think it's 126 original recordings from the museum, which were then deposited into the British Library sound and vision archive. And so that archive of sounds is there to stay forever in high-resolution audio. When these sorts of machines become obsolete and defunct, over time, the people that are working to keep them running in museum scenarios, they're becoming few and far between. It's a very specialist area. And it's a shame to think that these machines that were designed to perform in a certain way and to deliver a certain function will never be heard again. I kind of think it's really important to be able to kind of bring some of the reality of what these machines were like, to listen to as much as to see in the future. SIMON: Matt Parker, his new musical work is \"The Imitation Archive. \" Thanks so much for being with us. PARKER: Thank you for having me. Cheers.

PARKER: Well, I suppose it's the way in which that I choose to interpret it. And it's probably a fair enough comment, I suppose. When I thought about the time that I'd spent late at night when the museum was closed, where I sort of could get, you know, good quality clean recordings, it was a very brooding and moody place. And some of the particular machines - particularly these Second World War Heritage machines that are there, you know, they were used in quite moody and broody environments. And so I think it's a fitting way to reflect the experiences that one has inside an early computer hall. So I suppose it's the way I want to interpret these spaces. I think they are a bit menacing. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG) SIMON: Do you hope that by putting these sounds into music, it'll maybe preserve some of our historical appreciation for those sounds and what they mean? PARKER: Yeah, I think it's really important to keep sound archives like this. So \"The Imitation Archive\" is a series of compositions. But it's also - in addition to that, I recorded - I think it's 126 original recordings from the museum, which were then deposited into the British Library sound and vision archive. And so that archive of sounds is there to stay forever in high-resolution audio. When these sorts of machines become obsolete and defunct, over time, the people that are working to keep them running in museum scenarios, they're becoming few and far between. It's a very specialist area. And it's a shame to think that these machines that were designed to perform in a certain way and to deliver a certain function will never be heard again. I kind of think it's really important to be able to kind of bring some of the reality of what these machines were like, to listen to as much as to see in the future. SIMON: Matt Parker, his new musical work is \"The Imitation Archive. \" Thanks so much for being with us. PARKER: Thank you for having me.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Four-hundred-and-fifty-three. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Twenty-five. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Time for some number crunching from our data expert, Mona Chalabi of fivethirtyeight. com. She has given us this number of the week. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: Thirty-seven million. MARTIN: That is the estimated number of users of Ashley Madison. It's an online site that makes infidelity as easy as posting an online profile. Last week, hackers said they had stolen data from the company and threatened to release all customer records. The hack made us wonder just how many people out there cheat and what motivates them. Lucky for us, Mona Chalabi is here to sort through the numbers on infidelity. Hey, Mona. MONA CHALABI, BYLINE: Hi, Rachel. MARTIN: All right, well, what do we know about how many people cheat? And is this something people are actually honest about when asked by pollsters or researchers? CHALABI: The most recent research on this suggests that people are actually pretty willing to be honest and confess when they're asked anonymously. In May this year, the polling company YouGov surveyed about a thousand Americans. And they found that 21 percent of men and 19 percent of women admitted that they had cheated on their partners. But it's also worth mentioning that about another 7 percent said they would prefer not to answer the question. So you can read into that what you will. MARTIN: OK, but still, 1 in 5 Americans, that seems like a lot. Does any research out there tell us about who is more likely to cheat and why? CHALABI: It's probably easiest to start off with age because there was a study last year that actually used Ashley Madison data to get at this question. But just to be clear, this wasn't part of the leak. This was just a kind of separate study. And this data was obtained with the consent of Ashley Madison's owners. So instead of looking at age groups, the researchers looked at specific ages, each individual year, and found that men who were nine-enders - that means men who were 29, 39, 49, or 59 - were much more likely to be on the site looking for extramarital affair than people who weren't about to begin a new decade of their lives. Eighteen percent more of them were on the site than what you'd expect by chance alone. It's also worth noting - in fact, I think it's really crucial to note - that dating sites don't verify the age of users. So maybe this data is a little bit flawed if those men were kind of fibbing about their age to just knock themselves down to a decade lower. MARTIN: Yeah, right 'cause that's what we do when we're kind of fudging our age. So it's people on the cusp of some kind of big perceived life change, maybe. CHALABI: Exactly, yeah. MARTIN: How does that break down by gender? CHALABI: When asked, have you thought about cheating, 28 percent of women say yes compared to 41 percent of men. MARTIN: It's more complicate than just age and gender though, right? I mean, I remember you and I talked a while ago about women who earn more than their partners. And you found that men who are financially dependent on these women are more likely to cheat on them. So we know money comes into it as well - other factors, Mona? CHALABI: Yeah. There's definitely quite a few. And we know that personality comes into it a little bit. It's kind of difficult to build up a specific profile of exactly who a cheater is. If that was the case then I think we would find dating a lot easier. But we do have some research on this again. So a 2011 study published in the Archives of Sexual Behavior found about 1 in 5 of the thousand people in heterosexual couples they interviewed had cheated. But what it did was it took a closer look at those individual to see what factors were most likely to predict their sexual infidelity. It found that for both men and women, sexual personality characteristics - so that's things like being adventurous and not having performance anxiety - were far more important than demographic stuff, like marital status or religiosity, when it comes to actually predicting whether or not someone's going to be faithful. MARTIN: OK, so we've been talking about heterosexual couples here. Any research out there about same-sex or bisexual couples? CHALABI: Not much. This is something I run into all the time. So much of the research is just focused on heterosexual couples. But I did find a 2012 study in the Journal of Marital and Family Therapy. And what they did was they looked at the way that people felt about infidelity. And it found that all participants, regardless of sexual orientation - because they did include different couples in there - found that sexual infidelity elicited more distressing feelings actually than emotional infidelity. MARTIN: Emotional infidelity - that brings up another question. Does some of this have to do with how people define cheating, Mona? I mean, does there have to be a sexual relationship to constitute cheating for most people? CHALABI: Not for everyone, actually. And that's what's really, really interesting. There are clear differences between men's and women's perceptions of this. So 76 percent of women, when asked, felt that it was cheating to send flirty messages to someone else. But only 59 percent of men think the same. Now, when it comes to kind of more extreme examples, like having a one-night stand, the genders tend to agree. So 93 percent of women think a one-night stand is cheating, and 91 percent of men think the same. But, what's interesting is actually when it came to being asked, how would you feel if your partner had shared deep, emotional, intimate informational with someone else, people basically felt the same whether that had occurred online or off-line, which is one reason why I'm pretty sure that Ashley Madison's users aren't feeling too great right now that their information is being held by a third party that's threatening to release it. MARTIN: Mona Chalabi of fivethirtyeight. com. Thanks so much, Mona. CHALABI: Thanks, Rachel. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Fifty-two.

Man creates a machine that can think on its own. Machine turns on man. Well, more than a thousand industry researchers and specialists have signed an open letter warning that there's a much more likely problem ahead - an AI arms race, countries weaponizing the technology for high-tech combat. Stephen Hawking, Noam Chomsky and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak are among the signers. A leading force behind the letter is Stuart Russell. He's one of the most prominent researchers in the field of artificial intelligence. I ask him to explain how the autonomous weapons the letter warns against are different from drones. STUART RUSSELL: So a drone is a remotely piloted vehicle. There's a human who is steering it and looking through its camera. The human decides what's a target and whether to release the missile. So an autonomous weapon would be something that's doing all that itself. It's deciding where to go. It's deciding what's a target, and it's deciding who to kill. CORNISH: And in this letter, it says this technology is not decades away. It's years away. In fact, can you give us an example of where it's being used right now? RUSSELL: So there are sentry robots in Korea in the demilitarized zone, and those sentry robots can spot and track a human being for a distance of two miles and can very accurately kill that person with a high-powered rifle. Right now, that machine has two modes. In one, it has to first get human permission to go ahead and kill the person. But if you flip a switch, then it's in automatic mode, and it'll do it by itself. CORNISH: There's an argument here. People have said that essentially, this is a way of reducing casualties or having more precise efforts in combat. And it sounds like, from your letter, that you scientists don't believe that will be the case. RUSSELL: So I think there's really two arguments. One is an engineering argument. Can we make AI weapons that are better than human soldiers at deciding what's a legitimate target? The other point is that even if we do succeed in making these systems more accurate, the problem is that once you have an arms race, then you have millions or even billions of these devices available at very low cost to anyone who wants to buy them. CORNISH: You write in the letter that just as most chemists and biologists have no interest in building chemical or biological weapons, most AI researchers have no interest in building AI weapons. Is that true? I think of science being hand-in-hand with defense. RUSSELL: Clearly, there's a very large number of signatories to the letter. It doesn't take many videos of a flying robot chasing down a human being and killing them for people to find this technology absolutely repulsive and for there to be a very serious backlash against artificial intelligence and robots in general. So I think that the field would much rather focus on the positive uses of artificial intelligence. We can save lives with self-driving cars. We can make people's lives better with personal assistants that are a bit more intelligent than Siri or Cortana. So there are many things we can do other than making better ways to kill people. CORNISH: Is there any way to turn back from this path once we're on it? I mean, is there any way to avoid an AI arms race? RUSSELL: So the way to avoid it is to have a treaty that would ban autonomous weapons. And the United Nations is already working on such a treaty. And countries need to trust each other enough to go ahead with the treaty. And that way, they don't have to worry about other countries getting a strategic advantage over them. CORNISH: You've also said that researchers don't want artificial intelligence to be linked in the minds of the public with violence and with war. And I mention that kind of pop culture cliche. Does it feel like maybe it's a little too late for that? RUSSELL: The movies have done a very good job of connecting robots with violence. It seems like almost every time I talk to a journalist, they publish an article with pictures of \"Terminator\" robots no matter what I talk about, so it's hard to get away from that. But I think people understand the difference between science fiction and reality. And what we want to avoid is that the reality catches up with the science fiction. CORNISH: Stuart Russell - he's director for the Center for Intelligent Systems at UC Berkeley. Thank you so much for speaking with us. RUSSELL: Thank you very much.

ERIC WHITNEY, BYLINE: David Blackburn works for a financial services firm in Jersey City, N. J. He and has his wife both have six-figure incomes, but real estate in the New York City area is so expensive that they have to live kind of far from their jobs. DAVID BLACKBURN: Every day I get up and put on a suit and get on a train, and it takes about an hour door to door, in the crush of people, in the hot, in the cold. It wears on you a little bit. WHITNEY: And once he gets to the office, it's not like he really even has to be there at all. BLACKBURN: Every day I'm working with people in multiple time zones, in multiple countries. So even though I'm physically in the office, I'm essentially telecommuting to where they are. WHITNEY: Blackburn has considered asking if he could do his job from someplace less urban, someplace like Montana. GREG GIANFORTE: Montana is perfect for telecommuting because of the quality of life, because our housing prices in most communities are below the national average. WHITNEY: That's Greg Gianforte, who started a software company in Montana that created hundreds of high-paying jobs. But now he's trying to entice thousands of people who already have good jobs to bring them here and telecommute. GIANFORTE: If a small, rural town in Montana had just five or 10 people move back home, that would be five or 10 homes that either had to be purchased or built. That creates construction jobs. WHITNEY: He's just sent 18,000 glossy brochures to the alums of two universities here, inviting them to, quote, \"come home to Montana. \"GIANFORTE: It's five or 10 additional families that would enroll in the local schools, making the schools more vibrant. It'd be five or 10 families that are buying downtown. WHITNEY: Gianforte's brochures are a naked come-on to overstressed urbanites. There are pictures of mountain lakes and wildlife and Gianforte holding a fat trout he just caught. It includes a guide to getting your boss to say yes to letting you work remotely. There's even a list of telecommuting-friendly employers. Yahoo may have famously cracked down on working from home recently, but health insurance giant Anthem has fully a third of its employees working remotely. The company says that helps them attract top talent, and productivity hasn't suffered. That kind of corporate attitude is getting people excited in towns like Conrad, Mont. , population 2,600. Gianforte came here as part of a tour to pitch his campaign to local chambers of commerce. Vanessa Bucklin, an insurance broker, left with a big stack of Gianforte's brochures. VANESSA BUCKLIN: I just had a 20-year class reunion, and I'm going to mail them out with a handwritten note that said, we'd love to have you back in Conrad. WHITNEY: The come home to Montana tour isn't being warmly received by everyone. Montana's Democratic Party says it's just a thinly veiled publicity stunt before Republican Gianforte announces his candidacy for the 2016 race for governor. Gianforte says it's not but says he is considering a run for governor. Regardless of the politics, stressed-out New Jersey commuter David Blackburn says there's more to pulling up stakes than just convincing his boss to let him do it. BLACKBURN: The other part of it is that my wife also works full time, and I think we have a hard time imagining running a two-career family fully telecommuting or fully remote.

I'm Guy Raz. Jorge Soto grew up in Mexico. His parents are both doctors there, and like doctors anywhere, they work a lot. So when Jorge was a kid, his Aunt Maty was the one who would look after him. JORGE SOTO: So she used to take care of me. We played video games together. She even taught me how to cook. So she was that kind of person. She took care of me whenever I needed. RAZ: Today, Jorge is an engineer. He lives in the Bay Area now. And it was only recently his Aunt Maty was the one who needed taking care of. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SOTO: Almost a year ago, my aunt started suffering back pains. She went to see a doctor, and they told her that it was a normal injury for someone that had been playing tennis for almost 30 years. They recommended her do some therapy. RAZ: That was Jorge on the TED stage in 2014. His aunt, she wasn't suffering from a tennis injury. She had lung cancer. But it would take months and a series of different tests before they even diagnosed it. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SOTO: Her lifestyle was almost free of risk. She never smoked a cigarette. She never drank alcohol, and she had been playing sports for almost half her life. So it was - she didn't fit the profile of a person that you could suspect that has lung cancer. RAZ: Which is why an injury or a nasty infection, at least initially, seemed more likely. SOTO: She also used to volunteer at a hospital. So they actually thought that it was tuberculosis. So they did a study for tuberculosis. It was negative so that was the moment when they decided, OK, let's go biopsy because we have no idea what it is. RAZ: And at this point, when Jorge's aunt got a biopsy, that's when you'd expect things to finally move faster. But, in fact, it was just the opposite. SOTO: Well, Mexico, although it's an emerging economy and we have very sophisticated hospitals in general - still, if she wanted to get her biopsy done, she needed to travel five hours to Mexico City to the closest hospital that could process her biopsy. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SOTO: And two weeks later, the results of the biopsy came back. It was stage three lung cancer. RAZ: And at that stage, stage three, only eight percent of people live beyond five years. Now, the thing is Jorge's aunt wasn't diagnosed any differently in Mexico than she would have been anywhere else. The only difference there was that it took a lot more time. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SOTO: But that process of going back and forth with new tests, different doctor, describing symptoms, discarding diseases over and over was stressful and frustrating. And that is the way cancer diagnoses have been done since the beginning of history. However, today, my aunt, she's fighting bravely and going through this process with a very positive attitude. RAZ: Again, this was Jorge in late 2014 when he gave his TED Talk. SOTO: And one month or so after the TED Talk, the cancer spread in - all over her body, and we spent Christmas and New Year's Eve together, all - the entire family. And she knew what was going to happen, and everybody knew, and we enjoyed our time together. And she was very calm and happy. RAZ: That must have been so hard. SOTO: Yeah. Yeah, it's a very unfair disease. It's very unfair that - both how it's being diagnosed and how it's being treated. RAZ: The tragic irony of this story is that long before his Aunt Maty died of cancer and even during her struggle to get a diagnosis, Jorge Soto was in a lab in Silicon Valley working on an invention to make cancer easier to detect. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SOTO: Today, cancer detection happens mainly when symptoms appear; that is in stage three or four. And I believe that is too late. It is too expensive for our families. It is too expensive for humanity. It not only cost us billions of dollars, but it also cost us the people we love. One out of three people sitting in this audience will be diagnosed with some type of cancer, and one out of four will die because of it. RAZ: So how do we change those numbers? Because the story they now tell is that you or someone close to you will get this disease. So we're going to spend this hour looking at where we are in the fight against cancer, and how a whole new way of thinking about it could change how we treat it, maybe even live with it, more like a chronic disease than a fatal one. SOTO: I think, in general in the next 10 to 15 years, cancer, it will be a very controllable disease. It will be a condition like HIV or diabetes. It is not good news, but it is not tragic news. RAZ: So to get to that point, Jorge Soto and a team of scientists are working on a way to give cancer patients the one thing his aunt didn't have - time. Here's more from Jorge's TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SOTO: Today, the majority of people still don't have access to early cancer detection methods, even though we know that catching cancer early is basically the closest thing we have two a silver bullet cure against it. We know that we can change this in our lifetime, and that is why my team and I have decided to begin this journey; this journey to try to make cancer detection at the early stages easier, cheaper, smarter and more accessible than ever before. The context, of course, is that we're living at a time where technology is disrupting our present at exponential rates. And based on recent scientific discoveries, we believe that we have found a reliable and accurate way of detecting several types of cancer at the very early stages through a blood sample. We do it by detecting a set of very small molecules that secrete freely in our blood called microRNAs. RAZ: So microRNAs - these are basically tiny molecules that are associated with specific cells and tissues in our bodies. Scientists first discovered this in 1993. SOTO: So, for example, there are set of microRNAs that should only be found in the heart, a set of microRNAs that should only be found in the liver and so on. RAZ: And until pretty recently. . . SOTO: . . . That's what we knew. But in 2008. . . RAZ: In 2008, Scientists discovered that damage to specific parts of the body releases specific microRNAs into the bloodstream. SOTO: For example, microRNA-1, that's the heart microRNA. RAZ: If that microRNA pattern is floating around in your blood. . . SOTO: . . . That means that there's a problem with heart, and the heart cells are being broken apart. RAZ: So microRNA is like - it's like this little bubble inside of your bloodstream that's saying wait, I have this information, you may want to know it. SOTO: Yeah. I shouldn't be here. RAZ: But there's a problem with microRNAs. SOTO: You cannot detect them with existing technology. RAZ: At least not easily. SOTO: The technology today that detects microRNAs are either extremely expensive, like a sequencer, and they require highly trained scientists. RAZ: So Jorge and his team are working on a new way to test for microRNAs, these very small biomarkers that could indicate cancer in its early stages. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SOTO: We believe that we have found a way to do so. And this is the first time that we're sharing in public. Let me do a demonstration. RAZ: OK, so just to pause here - what Jorge did on the TED stage was very visual. So I'm just going to interrupt his flow for a moment to describe it. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SOTO: Imagine that next time you go to your doctor and do your next standard blood test. RAZ: So imagine a simple blood test at your next doctor's visit. SOTO: Any neighborhood lab can do it. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SOTO: And puts it in a standardized well plate like this one. RAZ: So you take your blood sample and you drop it into 96 tiny wells on a specially designed plastic lab plate. It's about the size of an iPhone 6 Plus. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SOTO: Each well of these plates. . . RAZ: And each well is coated with a specific biochemical agent. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SOTO: . . . That is looking for a specific microRNA, acting like a trap that closes only when the microRNA is present in the sample. RAZ: The biochemical agents in those traps are specially designed to react in the presence of specific microRNAs. So after you've dropped in the blood sample, you take that plate. . . (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SOTO: You put the plate inside a device like this one. RAZ: He shows a sealed device, it's about the size of a crockpot. SOTO: It's just creating heating conditions and luminosity conditions. RAZ: The conditions for a chemical reaction to begin. And then, a step that makes this technology cheaper and easier than anything out there. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SOTO: And then you can put your smartphone on top of it. A smartphone is a connected computer. And it's also a camera; good enough for our purpose. RAZ: A smartphone sitting on top of the device runs an app. SOTO: That is taking pictures. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SOTO: The smartphone is taking pictures. RAZ: And the smartphone can detect which of those biochemical wells start to glow if specific microRNAs are trapped. SOTO: It takes pictures every minute. (SOUNDBITE OF CAMERA SHUTTER)SOTO: And it's comparing which ones are shining, how much and how fast and sending that information to our servers. RAZ: A smartphone uses cloud data to analyze the photos. There's no highly trained doctor that needs to interpret the data. And it means that this test can go anywhere a smart phone can. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SOTO: This entire process lasts around 60 minutes. But when the process is over, this inside is a real sample where we just detected pancreatic cancer. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: OK, this was amazing to see. It's incredible, but for now, the machine can only test for a few very specific cancers. And then there's another obstacle, which is that microRNAs don't just appear in blood when you have cancer, they can also show up. . . SOTO: If you had, let's say, a hard party last night. RAZ: When you have a hangover. SOTO: You will find the microRNAs circulating. So we need to understand. . . RAZ: Or a broken arm or a cold - microRNAs will be detectable. But Jorge's test is getting better and better at figuring out the difference. And if the tests continue to show encouraging results, it could be a standard part of your annual physical within the next three years. SOTO: And I don't think it will replace 100 percent all the other screening tests that we have today in three years, but it will be much more available. And let's say in the next 10 years, medicine will change forever. It will not be reactive, it will be prevented. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SOTO: Let me say very clearly that we are at the very early stages. But so far, we have been able to successfully identify the microRNA pattern of pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer and hepatic cancer. And currently, we're doing a clinical trial in collaboration with the German Cancer Research Center with 200 women for breast cancer. (APPLAUSE)SOTO: It is single, noninvasive, accurate and affordable test that has the potential to dramatically change how cancer procedures and diagnostics have been done. Since we are looking for the microRNA patterns in your blood at any given time, you don't need to know which cancer you're looking for. You don't need to have symptoms. You only need one milliliter of blood and a relatively simple array of tools. And I am certain that in the very near future, because of this and other breakthroughs that we're seeing every day in life sciences, the way we see cancer will radically change. It will give us a chance of detecting it early, understanding it better and finding a cure. Thank you very much. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: Jorge Soto. He's an early detection cancer engineer. His company is called Miroculus. Their cancer detection technology, by the way, will be made open source. You can see Jorge's talk at ted. com. More ideas about fighting cancer in a moment.

RAZ: A smartphone uses cloud data to analyze the photos. There's no highly trained doctor that needs to interpret the data. And it means that this test can go anywhere a smart phone can. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SOTO: This entire process lasts around 60 minutes. But when the process is over, this inside is a real sample where we just detected pancreatic cancer. (APPLAUSE) RAZ: OK, this was amazing to see. It's incredible, but for now, the machine can only test for a few very specific cancers. And then there's another obstacle, which is that microRNAs don't just appear in blood when you have cancer, they can also show up. . . SOTO: If you had, let's say, a hard party last night. RAZ: When you have a hangover. SOTO: You will find the microRNAs circulating. So we need to understand. . . RAZ: Or a broken arm or a cold - microRNAs will be detectable. But Jorge's test is getting better and better at figuring out the difference. And if the tests continue to show encouraging results, it could be a standard part of your annual physical within the next three years. SOTO: And I don't think it will replace 100 percent all the other screening tests that we have today in three years, but it will be much more available. And let's say in the next 10 years, medicine will change forever. It will not be reactive, it will be prevented. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SOTO: Let me say very clearly that we are at the very early stages. But so far, we have been able to successfully identify the microRNA pattern of pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer and hepatic cancer. And currently, we're doing a clinical trial in collaboration with the German Cancer Research Center with 200 women for breast cancer. (APPLAUSE) SOTO: It is single, noninvasive, accurate and affordable test that has the potential to dramatically change how cancer procedures and diagnostics have been done. Since we are looking for the microRNA patterns in your blood at any given time, you don't need to know which cancer you're looking for. You don't need to have symptoms. You only need one milliliter of blood and a relatively simple array of tools. And I am certain that in the very near future, because of this and other breakthroughs that we're seeing every day in life sciences, the way we see cancer will radically change. It will give us a chance of detecting it early, understanding it better and finding a cure. Thank you very much. (APPLAUSE) RAZ: Jorge Soto. He's an early detection cancer engineer. His company is called Miroculus. Their cancer detection technology, by the way, will be made open source. You can see Jorge's talk at ted. com. More ideas about fighting cancer in a moment.

For some, that included not being able to call 911. It's not exactly clear what caused the incident. As NPR's Laura Sydell reports, state and local authorities don't have much power to find out what happened. LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE: Cell phone service was down in parts of Kentucky and that made it hard for Ashley Johnson (ph) to coordinate childcare. ASHLEY JOHNSON: I was trying to get out of, like, my work computer to get a text from my grandma so she made sure she's had my kids and let her know my phone wasn't working. It was horrible. It was several hours. SYDELL: Authorities say it was around five hours, and it hit every single cell phone provider - Sprint, Verizon AT&T, T-Mobile. Officials in Tennessee and Kentucky both confirmed that the problem could be traced back to ground infrastructure operated by AT&T in Tennessee. Derek Turner, with the nonprofit watchdog group Free Press, says most cell phone providers still have to rely on some older networks. DEREK TURNER: What a lot of people don't realize is that that cell tower connects your calls to a wire, and usually that wire is owned by the legacy monopoly phone company. SYDELL: AT&T had no one available to talk about the problem. In an e-mail, a spokesperson said engineers pinpointed a hardware-related issue. But AT&T is not obligated to explain what happened to state regulators, according to Tim Schwarz, a spokesperson for the Tennessee Regulatory Authority. TIM SCHWARZ: The wireline and wireless service, in particular, is market regulated here in Tennessee, so the TRA, as a utility commission, does not have jurisdiction over these issues. SYDELL: This is also true in Kentucky. Turner, of the Free Press, says that providers have been lobbying for years to get rid of the federal regulations that once covered telephone service.

NPR TV critic Eric Deggans takes a look at how \"The Daily Show\" changed the way we look at politics and the media. ERIC DEGGANS, BYLINE: Robert Barnett is a powerhouse Washington lawyer who sits at the nexus of politics and media. He's brokered everything from President Bill Clinton's book deal to NBC News anchor Brian Williams's move to MSNBC. Many of his high-profile clients have appeared on \"The Daily Show,\" and he laments to its departure. ROBERT BARNETT: It's amazing that this 2016 election will be the first election since Dole-Clinton in 1996 that we haven't had Jon Stewart. DEGGANS: Barnett says, through his satire, Jon Stewart informed Americans about their government and their media. BARNETT: He's more like an H. L. Mencken, someone who causes you to think about serious things but does so in an insightful and entertaining way. DEGGANS: One minute Stewart might stage a debate on the war in Iraq using sound bites from President George W. Bush's first term to counter sound bites from Bush's second term. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE DAILY SHOW\")GEORGE W. BUSH: Saddam Hussein and his sons must leave Iraq within 48 hours. JON STEWART: Wow. Deadlines. Tough talk. Mr. second-term president? BUSH: Doesn't make any sense have a timetable. (LAUGHTER)DEGGANS: Next he might grill President Obama over Democrats' fading electoral chances in 2010. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE DAILY SHOW\")STEWART: You ran on very high rhetoric - hope and change. And the Democrats this year seem to be running on, please, baby, one more chance. BARACK OBAMA: Now. . . (LAUGHTER)LIZZ WINSTEAD: Jon was the voice of the viewer. DEGGANS: \"Daily Show\" co-creator Lizz Winstead says Stewart reflected the frustration of the viewer. WINSTEAD: I think the viewer could be more invested in it because they saw somebody who was speaking for them as they also observe the absurdity of the day. DEGGANS: Winstead helped develop the show in 1996 with original host Craig Kilborn, a former ESPN anchor who read jokes written for him. She left \"The Daily Show\" by the time Stewart succeeded Kilborn in 1999. Winstead said Stewart took control of the writing and sharpened its focus as a news junkie with a nose for hypocrisy. Here he skewers CNBC business commentator Jim Cramer in 2009 for not uncovering the practices that led to the financial crisis. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE DAILY SHOW\")STEWART: You knew what the banks were doing and yet were touting it for months and months. The entire network was. And so now to pretend that this was some sort of crazy, once-in-a-lifetime tsunami that nobody could have seen coming is disingenuous at best. WINSTEAD: Jon Stewart's power is partially because all the other parts of the media have been derelict in actually doing their job. DEGGANS: But some journalists say they haven't earned all the criticism they're getting. CNN anchor Don Lemon is a frequent target. DON LEMON: They are taking short clips and short segments out of hours and hours and hours, and sometimes days and days and weeks, of news coverage. DEGGANS: Lemon was lampooned when he covered a snowstorm in New York from a vehicle dubbed the blizzardmobile. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE DAILY SHOW\")STEWART: Blizzardmobile? (LAUGHTER)STEWART: Settle down Batman, it's a Ford Explorer. (LAUGHTER)DEGGANS: But Lemon resisted the idea that Stewart targeted CNN's journalism. Rather, \"The Daily Show\" took aim at CNN because of its relevance. LEMON: I actually think that Jon Stewart criticizes CNN more because he watches more, and because I think he wants us to be better and I think he likes us. DEGGANS: Tough as it is to be the butt of \"The Daily Show's\" jokes, sometimes writing them can be difficult too. Beth Littleford was on the show from its inception through Stewart's first year. She said working on the show could be hard on women because so few women worked there. BETH LITTLEFORD: I think it was hard on women. I think it was a real revolving door. Women couldn't please him. DEGGANS: Still, she credits Stewart with turning \"The Daily Show\" into a household name. And at the same time, he taught a generation of viewers how to understand the emerging hybrid form of comedy and information. LITTLEFORD: I think it's changed, yeah, the voice of how people talk about things and the things you could put on the air, and the things people understand on the air. They understand satire in a new way, I think. DEGGANS: That is Jon Stewart's most enduring legacy. He showed a nation of viewers who always suspected politicians and media of hypocrisy that they had it right all along. I'm Eric Deggans.

They're at two conferences called Black Hat and DEFCON. And they've spent a lot of time this week talking about consumer devices, how hackers can attack various stuff that you and I buy, from smartphones to cars. To recap, we're joined by NPR technology reporter Aarti Shahani. Hi, Aarti. AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: Hi. RATH: So one of the biggest pieces of news this week came from Google. SHAHANI: Yeah, that's right. The head of Android security, Adrian Ludwig, announced that Google will start doing security updates for its Nexus phones on monthly basis, so not just patches to give nice new app features. He made this announcement because in the last couple weeks, Google's come under some very heavy fire for a big flaw that independent researchers found in the heart of the Android operating system. The flaw would let a hacker take over a phone just by sending a text message. RATH: Wow, that doesn't sound good. SHAHANI: No, very serious, that's right. And a lot of Android users reached out to Google about it. Speaking on stage at Black Hat, Ludwig ended up speaking on behalf of a bunch of other companies that make Android phones, like Samsung and LG and HTC. And he promised that this month, they're all going to roll out a fix for that specific bug. And with a bit of dramatic flair, he called the joint effort the single largest software update the world has ever seen. RATH: So let's turn to cars. I know you spend some time on this. Last month, hackers showed they could remotely take over a Jeep while it was driving on the highway. And Fiat Chrysler also had to recall 1. 4 million cars. SHAHANI: Yeah, I actually got to witness a very awkward moment with the two Jeep hackers. I was about to interview them here outside of a talk when some Fiat Chrysler executives walked by. So everyone stopped and shook hands, but there was not a whole lot of love in the air. And that hack brings to light a big problem for the auto industry. Our cars are increasingly computers on wheels, but most carmakers don't have any system in place to regularly do over-the-air software updates. RATH: So sort of like the way that your iPhone does automatically. SHAHANI: Yeah, exactly. One exception, though, Tesla, the electric car company, does do that. There's another set of hackers who are at DEFCON and showed that they could take control of a Tesla Model S, and the company used its update system to roll out a software patch to all Tesla owners. RATH: Now, I understand these conferences are also huge marketing events for cybersecurity companies who all say they've solved X, Y or Z huge security problem. Do you see any cool solutions this year? SHAHANI: Yeah, you know, one thing I really liked is I came across a company called Saaspass, and they believe that they've solved the problem of passwords, that, as you know, passwords are constantly being stolen and being weak and hard to use. And they've basically turned the smartphone into a verification tool. So if you want to go log into Facebook or your mail or some other password-protected site on your laptop, you can use your phone to scan one of those little black and white square QR codes instead of typing in a bunch of letters and numbers. So the demo is super simple, and I wouldn't be surprised if it takes off. RATH: Any other predictions for this next year based on what you're seeing and hearing there? SHAHANI: Actually, you know, yeah, I was talking to this one guy who pointed out that parents don't really have modern up-to-date tools to track and protect their kids online, right? Make sure that they're safe from cyber bullies and not watching porn and stuff like that. And, you know, a lot of parents think about this stuff. I wouldn't be surprised if in the next year we see security tools that are marketed to parents, much like we've already seen a ton of products for employers to track their employees.

Cats are so ubiquitous. They've become shorthand for the most trivial kind of Internet clickbait. Now, a museum exhibit in New York suggests these feline videos can be more than a waste of time. NPR's Joel Rose has this list of five surprising things about Internet cats. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: Surprising thing number one, Internet cat videos are a great mirror for the rise of online media. CARL GOODMAN: The mirror that we place in front of this history of media on the Internet happens to be a very furry one, using the cat as a subject for investigation. ROSE: Carl Goodman directs the Museum of the Moving Image in Queens. We're standing in the museum's new exhibition called \"How Cats Took Over the Internet,\" which traces the beginnings of user-generated cat video all the way back to the mid-1990s. GOODMAN: From the eureka moment of the webcam which, today, is taken for granted, you know, this very slowly updating live image of something. And there you have what are the first kinds of things people did with that? They trained it on a cat. ROSE: Cats sleeping, cats playing, cats playing the piano, cats contemplating the futility of existence in French. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Speaking French). ROSE: And like other kinds of online media, cat videos have generated slickly marketed celebrities, like Lil Bub and Grumpy Cat. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: And, you know, I joke around like, ha ha, my cat's going to be famous, you know, to my friends, like, as a joke, you know, not really expecting anything to happen. Eventually a photo went viral, as they say. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Look at that. Look at that face. That's how it happened. (LAUGHTER)ROSE: Videos of the celebrity cat Maru jumping into various bags and boxes have been viewed more than 200 million times. But the organizers of this exhibition point out surprising thing number two, cats actually do not dominate the Internet, although curator Jason Eppink says it can seem that way. JASON EPPINK: By most measures, dogs do beat out cats online - not by much. ROSE: Eppink says pets in general account for less than 1 percent of all traffic on YouTube. But surprising thing number three, watching those cat videos may actually be good for you. JESSICA MYRICK: It definitely isn't a waste time. It has psychological consequences. ROSE: Jessica Myrick teaches in the media school at Indiana University. She recently published a paper on cat videos and their effects. MYRICK: After watching these videos, people tended to feel better. They tended to feel more content, you know, more energized, and they felt less anxiety. And other negative emotions were dampened. ROSE: Surprising thing number four, Myrick is not a cat person. She's actually allergic. Jason Eppink, the curator at the Museum of the Moving Image, says he doesn't have a cat either. But Eppink says that's only made him more curious about why people find these videos so interesting. And he thinks it's mostly because of surprising thing number five. What we're really seeing when we watch cat videos is moments that remind us of ourselves. EPPINK: The vast majority of a cat's life is not this, right, it's sleeping or eating or doing things that we, as humans, don't find as interesting. So what ends up bubbling to the top are these specific moments that I think we see ourselves in instead. I think it's that dichotomy that makes them really fascinating. You know, one moment they're just like us, another moment they're like aliens. ROSE: Furry, cute, viral aliens. Joel Rose, NPR News, New York.

It's where Google is and Facebook - America's headquarters for tech giants and startups. Well, now some of tech's hottest companies, like Snapchat and Tinder, are choosing to start and stay in Southern California. It's Silicon Beach, as Ben Bergman reports from member station KPCC. BEN BERGMAN, BYLINE: The headquarters of TrueCar are so close to the beach you can see the waves crashing ashore from the corner office of CEO Scott Painter. SCOTT PAINTER: We leverage everything about Santa Monica and the beach and sort of this is a lifestyle play. And it turns out people who are traditionally thought of as folks that like to be in cold, dark, quiet spaces love ocean view just as much as everybody else. BERGMAN: Those people would be programmers, who, Painter says, are the key to TrueCar's success because the service uses complex algorithms to match auto buyers with dealers. So Painter can dangle the usual stock options and free meals, but he can also offer something more unique. PAINTER: I think people are astonished to see that we have an entire engineering room with a front row of the beach, and those seats are competed for. BERGMAN: Well, how do you decide who sits there? PAINTER: You got to be good. It is a meritocracy in terms of how you get seated. BERGMAN: When people told Painter to move TrueCar's headquarters to Silicon Valley, he ignored them. So did Snapchat's CEO Evan Spiegel, who's all of 25 years old. The Stanford dropout couldn't afford to stay in the Bay Area. Instead, he moved in with his dad in LA. Then he started a mobile messaging service that's now valued at $15 billion. Spiegel told a room full of executives recently it was a difficult decision to keep his company in Venice. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)EVAN SPIEGEL: Once we made the choice and we were, like, you know, we're an LA company - this is where we're going to be, this is our home - it was much easier. BERGMAN: Snapchat started in 2011, which venture capitalist Adam Lilling says was the perfect time. Just a few years before that, he remembers, it was impossible to get top engineers to move to LA. ADAM LILLING: People thought it was career suicide. Nobody - not one person - would move down - no matter what the offer was. BERGMAN: LA startups raised more than $3 billion in 2014 - three times as much as the year before and more than seven times as much as 2010, according to Built in LA, which tracks the area's tech community. Lilling says LA has benefited from being a comparatively affordable place to live. The average home in San Francisco costs more than a million dollars - twice the median in LA. LILLING: I know people that commute up to the Bay from Los Angeles because they prefer a lifestyle living in LA. BERGMAN: Lilling says LA's size and diversity provide a much better laboratory for startups to test new products than Silicon Valley. LILLING: If you look at Los Angeles, you have the representative sampling of America, or sometimes the world. BERGMAN: Everyone we talked to for this story said while LA does have advantages, that doesn't make it a better place to start a company - just a different place. Even Santa Monica-worshiping TrueCar has a sizable R&D office in San Francisco. David Sturtz is a senior vice president there. DAVID STURTZ: Almost any new company of consequence has to be in San Francisco or in Silicon Valley. BERGMAN: Sturtz says he knows that sounds arrogant, but it's the truth. Sturtz visits Santa Monica every few weeks where we met recently. STURTZ: I think we're going to look back many years from now at this being a real renaissance in technology and innovation. And San Francisco and Silicon Valley are really the epicenters of that. I don't get anywhere near the same vibe down here that I get up there. BERGMAN: And so people up there, do you think they look down upon companies that are here a bit? STURTZ: I'm not sure they know there are any companies down here (laughter). BERGMAN: But that's an outdated notion, says venture capitalist Kara Nortman. She grew up in LA, but had always thought of it as just an entertainment town, so she chose to build her career in San Francisco, Seattle and New York. But then, for personal reasons, she moved back in 2007. KARA NORTMAN: And in the beginning I did think about even considering commuting up and taking jobs in the Bay Area. BERGMAN: But Nortman decided to stick around and she started three companies. NORTMAN: You know, a wonderful thing has happened over the last seven years since I've been here which is, you know, you have sort of, I think, the key components coming together, which enables people to grow big, successful, scalable technology companies here. And it's a combination of, you know, leadership, talent and capital. BERGMAN: Eight years later, Nortman is still in LA, and she's glad she stayed. For NPR News, I'm Ben Bergman in Los Angeles.

BLOCK: Well, how did you choose the handle @Alphabet in the first place, back in 2007? ANDRIKANICH: It was pretty easy. When I went to college at Ohio University, I was joining a fraternity and one of the guys said, who is this Chris Andri-alphabet kid? BLOCK: (Laughter).

Lots of advice on Twitter as to what I should do. BLOCK: I'm sure. ANDRIKANICH: (Laughter). I have not heard from anybody regarding the handle. BLOCK: You mentioned that you've been getting all kinds of advice. What kind of advice have you been getting? ANDRIKANICH: It's mostly just, you know, hold out for big money because it's Google. BLOCK: Well, it does raise a question - can you sell your Twitter handle? ANDRIKANICH: Something I need to look into, I guess. BLOCK: And you're taking that advice with a grain of salt?

Yesterday, founder Larry Page announced in a blog post that Google is breaking up into smaller pieces, pieces that can be, in his words, more ambitious. And this new entity has a new name - Alphabet Inc. NPR's Aarti Shahani explains. AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: With Alphabet, you could say, the writing was on the wall. Let's go back to 1998, the year Google was founded. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)LARRY PAGE: We talked to a couple of different people - like four people or something like that - and all the people we talked to were willing to give us money. SHAHANI: That's a young Larry Page in a TV interview, alongside his co-founder Sergey Brin, who recalled one specific investor. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SERGEY BRIN: So he said, you know, I don't want you guys to have to, you know, take too low a valuation or to have to worry too much about these money things right now. Why don't I just write you a check? SHAHANI: And the guy wrote them a check for $100,000 before they even had a bank account. It's a critical lesson in Google's founding story - great ideas need cash, lots of it, fast - even if the idea sounds out there, like in 2000 when Sergey Brin was giving a speech in New York about the so-called mobile revolution. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BRIN: Has anyone here used Google on a mobile phone? SHAHANI: Back when most people didn't have mobile phones, Google had a small research team working on tools to search by voice command. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BRIN: So you can navigate the entire web using speech, fill out forms, do all of those things, and, you know, it's going take engineering, but it will happen. SHAHANI: Lesson number two - futuristic technology is not just fantasy. Alphabet Inc. combines these lessons. It's the umbrella for a bunch of standalone companies with ideas that are, in Page's words, pretty far afield - like contact lenses that read blood-glucose levels, cars that drive themselves, drones that deliver mail. Page is CEO, Brin is president, and they oversee the new division chiefs, write the checks and demand results. The new chief of Google is Sundar Pichai. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SUNDAR PICHAI: Everything we do, we do it at a global scale. SHAHANI: That's Pichai speaking a few months back at a conference in Spain. His new job is to oversee a slimmed-down Google, which includes Chrome, YouTube, Android, the Play Store, Search - basically every Google product you use. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PICHAI: At Google, when we focus on problems, we want to work on things which make a difference in people's lives on a day-to-day basis. SHAHANI: And make sure investors are happy with the results - financial results that is. Google shares will convert to Alphabet shares and continue trading on NASDAQ.

And this new entity has a new name - Alphabet Inc. NPR's Aarti Shahani explains. AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: With Alphabet, you could say, the writing was on the wall. Let's go back to 1998, the year Google was founded. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LARRY PAGE: We talked to a couple of different people - like four people or something like that - and all the people we talked to were willing to give us money. SHAHANI: That's a young Larry Page in a TV interview, alongside his co-founder Sergey Brin, who recalled one specific investor. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SERGEY BRIN: So he said, you know, I don't want you guys to have to, you know, take too low a valuation or to have to worry too much about these money things right now. Why don't I just write you a check? SHAHANI: And the guy wrote them a check for $100,000 before they even had a bank account. It's a critical lesson in Google's founding story - great ideas need cash, lots of it, fast - even if the idea sounds out there, like in 2000 when Sergey Brin was giving a speech in New York about the so-called mobile revolution. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BRIN: Has anyone here used Google on a mobile phone? SHAHANI: Back when most people didn't have mobile phones, Google had a small research team working on tools to search by voice command. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BRIN: So you can navigate the entire web using speech, fill out forms, do all of those things, and, you know, it's going take engineering, but it will happen. SHAHANI: Lesson number two - futuristic technology is not just fantasy. Alphabet Inc. combines these lessons. It's the umbrella for a bunch of standalone companies with ideas that are, in Page's words, pretty far afield - like contact lenses that read blood-glucose levels, cars that drive themselves, drones that deliver mail. Page is CEO, Brin is president, and they oversee the new division chiefs, write the checks and demand results. The new chief of Google is Sundar Pichai. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SUNDAR PICHAI: Everything we do, we do it at a global scale. SHAHANI: That's Pichai speaking a few months back at a conference in Spain. His new job is to oversee a slimmed-down Google, which includes Chrome, YouTube, Android, the Play Store, Search - basically every Google product you use. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PICHAI: At Google, when we focus on problems, we want to work on things which make a difference in people's lives on a day-to-day basis. SHAHANI: And make sure investors are happy with the results - financial results that is. Google shares will convert to Alphabet shares and continue trading on NASDAQ.

I'm assuming you had never run an international movement in your life. NANCY FRATES: (Laughter) No. RAZ: This is Nancy Frates. And the story of how she came to be the voice and the face of a worldwide movement starts with her son Pete, who was a star athlete for as long as Nancy can remember. FRATES: Oh, very early, very early. I was told in fourth grade when he was 10 years old. His gym teacher came up to me and said she had been watching him since he was in first grade, and she said, he's a Division I athlete. RAZ: As Pete got older, autumn meant he was playing football, winter, it was hockey, and in the summer, baseball. FRATES: I was the team captain mother who would run, you know, all the team events. RAZ: Pete did, in fact, play Division I. It was baseball at Boston College. He was a star on the team but not quite good enough to make the major leagues, so eventually, he gave up that dream. And he settled on a corporate job in Boston. FRATES: But Pete was still playing baseball. He was playing in an intercity league in Boston, which is pretty high-level league. And we were still going to baseball games. RAZ: And what happened next, Nancy tells the story from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)FRATES: So it takes me back to the summer of 2011. We're at the playoff game. Pete's at the plate, and a fastball's coming in, and it hits him on the wrist. His wrist went completely limp, like this. So for the next six months, Pete went back to his home in Southie and was going to doctors to see what was wrong with this wrist that never came back. Six months later, in March, he called my husband and I and he said, oh, Mom and Dad, we have a doctor that found a diagnosis for that wrist. You want to come to the doctor's appointment with me? I said, sure, we'll come in. That morning, Pete, John and I all got up, got dressed and got in our cars, walked into the neurologist's office, sat down. Four doctors walk in. And the head neurologist sits down. And he says, well, Pete, we've looken (ph) at all these tests, and I have to tell you, it's not a sprained wrist. It's not a broken wrist. It's not nerve damage in the wrist. It's not an infection. It's not Lyme disease. And there was this deliberate elimination going up. And I was thinking to myself, where is he going with this? Then he put his hands on his knees, and he looked right at my 27-year-old kid and said, I don't know how to tell a 27-year-old this. Pete, you have ALS. ALS? I had had a friend whose 80-year-old father had ALS. I looked at my husband. He looked at me. And then we looked at the doctor. And we said, ALS? OK. What treatment? Let's go. What do we do? Let's go. And he looked at us and said, Mr. and Mrs. Frates, I'm sorry to tell you this, but there's no treatment and there's no cure. We didn't even understand that it had been 75 years since Lou Gehrig and nothing had been done in the progress against ALS. So we all went home. And Jenn and Dan flew home from Wall Street. Andrew came home from Charlestown. And Pete went to BC to pick up his then-girlfriend Julie and brought her home. And six hours later after diagnosis, we're sitting around having a family dinner. And we're having small chat. I don't even remember cooking dinner that night. But then our leader, Pete, set the vision and talked to us just like we were his new team. He said, there will be no wallowing, people. He goes, we're not looking back, we're looking forward. What an amazing opportunity we have to change the world. I'm going to change the face of this unacceptable situation of ALS. We're going to move the needle, and I'm going to get it in front of philanthropists like Bill Gates. And that was it. We were given our directive. RAZ: Within days, Pete's family and friends created a website and a Facebook group. They called it Team Frate Train. And Pete started documenting these moments in his life, like when he proposed to his girlfriend Julie or when they got married and when they were expecting a baby girl. And his family used the page to raise awareness of ALS and also to collect donations for his care. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)FRATES: Uncle Dave, he was the webmaster, Uncle Artie, he was the accountant, Auntie Dana, she was the graphic artist. And my youngest son, Andrew, quit his job, left his apartment in Charlestown and says, I'm going to take care of Pete and be his caregiver. RAZ: All the while this was happening, Pete was getting worse. In most cases, ALS progresses like this. First, you need help walking, then a wheelchair. Eventually, after a year or so, you're unable to move or speak at all. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)FRATES: Today, Pete's completely paralyzed. He can't hold his head up any longer. He's confined to a motorized wheelchair. He can no longer swallow or eat. He has a feeding tube. He can't speak. He talks with eye gazer technology and a speech-generating device. And we're watching his lungs because his diaphragm eventually is going to give out. And then the decision will be made to put him on a ventilator or not. RAZ: So even though Pete was in the middle of this decline, Team Frate Train was building momentum. Pete had more than 4,000 followers on Facebook. Nancy was going to public events, trying to promote awareness of the disease. And she was already starting to make the transition from amateur to professional organizer. And then in the summer of 2014, that big opportunity Pete talked about when he was first diagnosed, the thing that would move the needle, it happened. FRATES: You know, everybody wants to know who put the first bucket over their head. Look, I can't even tell you that. It actually had been around the Internet for months. RAZ: Nancy is talking about the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge. You probably saw it. Maybe you did it. And this is where it started. And it wasn't even for ALS initially, right? FRATES: No, it was for many, many other diseases, nonprofits. And the real story is there was a golfer in Florida. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: . . . The ice bucket challenge. . . FRATES: It came across his feed. His cousin's husband has ALS. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: You're going to donate hundred dollars to the ALS Foundation. FRATES: He sent it up to her in Westchester County, N. Y. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)JEANETTE SENERCHIA: And this is to generate awareness about ALS. FRATES: She did for ALS, Jeanette Senerchia. They were cross-referenced in a mutual feed with Pat Quinn. Now, Pat Quinn was being mentored by Pete Frates. So Pat Quinn called Pete Frates and said, I think we're going to take this. And they grabbed it and made it their own. They became purposeful, and they became strategic. And they said, we're going to do this for ALS. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)RYAN CASALE: This is Ryan Casale (ph), accepting the ice bucket challenge in support of Team Frate Train. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: And to honor Pete Frates. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Pete Frates. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)CASALE: Ah. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Oh. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Laughter). (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)FRATES: By about day four, Uncle Dave, the webmaster, yeah, he isn't on Facebook. And I get a text from him and it says, Nancy, what the hell is going on? Uncle Dave gets a hit every time Pete's website is gone onto, and his phone was blowing up. So we all sat down, and we realized money, money is coming in - how amazing. So we knew awareness would lead to funding. We just didn't know it would only take a couple of days. So we got together, put our best 501(c)(3)s on Pete's website and off we went. RAZ: And that was it. It just kind of snowballed from there. Athletes started picking it up, like Derek Jeter. . . (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)DEREK JETER: (Screaming). RAZ: . . . And LeBron James(SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)LEBRON JAMES: (Screaming). RAZ: Actors. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)JACK BLACK: Hi, I'm Jack Black and. . . RAZ: Emma Stone did it. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)EMMA STONE: And I hereby nominate Bill Murray. . . RAZ: Robert Downey Jr. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)ROBERT DOWNEY JR: (Screaming). RAZ: Justin Timberlake. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE: JT here. RAZ: And Taylor Swift. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)TAYLOR SWIFT: Oh, dear God, we're going to do this. UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: Three, two, one. RAZ: George W. Bush did it. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)GEORGE W. BUSH: And now it's my privilege to challenge my friend Bill Clinton. RAZ: And Bill Gates. . . (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)BILL GATES: I'm going to challenge three more people - Elon Musk, Ryan Seacrest. RAZ: . . . The one person Pete Frates wanted to reach. And within weeks, the ice bucket challenge became one of the biggest and fastest fundraising campaigns in history. It would eventually raise a quarter of a billion dollars for ALS charities. And Pete Frates and his mom, Nancy, they would become the faces of that movement. At what point did you say, this is unbelievable? Like, do you remember just thinking to yourself, this is crazy? FRATES: Yeah, we didn't - to be perfectly honest with you, we didn't have a whole lot of time to do that. This thing happened so fast. And what was going on in my house, of course, is we were trying to keep the motor going with the engagement. RAZ: You knew nothing about this. FRATES: Nothing, nothing. RAZ: Nothing. You have no medical background. You had no fundraising background. Nothing. FRATES: No, but I had a business background. RAZ: Yeah. FRATES: And that's the skill set that we brought to this. We knew we could brand. And we looked at the awareness piece as branding. And we just knew if we tell people the reality of this disease, they'll open their hearts and then they'll open their wallets. Was I a social media whiz? I wasn't even on Facebook. I had to - you know, I had to get on Facebook and learn how to do that. But Pete was the one when this thing happened, he told us, OK this is what I want you to do. And quickly, we picked up on it because it was using marketing skills and merchandising skills and branding skills. Those were very known to us and very comfortable to us. So we just kind of converted it to this new cause that we had. But it was also driven by not a paycheck. It was driven by the love of a child. RAZ: Do you ever, like, step back and think, like, how crazy it is that you went from knowing almost nothing about this disease or about leading a movement or, you know, starting a charity to becoming kind of like the face - like, the mom of ALS research? FRATES: Put a challenge in front of me. Let me educate myself. Let me see what I can lend to it that will help it be productive, proactive. That's how I've kind of lived my whole life. A story that I haven't told often is that I am myself am a cancer survivor. I had cancer at 17. So when you stare down your own mortality at that age, you don't take a whole lot for granted. I've pretty much lived my life like that, and so this was just another piece - but it was my child. RAZ: Do you think, Nancy, that anybody would have the capacity to do what you've done, to be positive and upbeat, to be so forceful? Or do you think that you have a particular drive? FRATES: I think I choose to do this every day. Look, could I roll up in bed and put the covers over my head and cry every day? Absolutely. But taking the easy way out has really never been an option for me. And so I make a choice every morning to live my day in positivity because that's the only way I can help others. RAZ: That's Nancy Frates. Team Frate Train is still fighting for Pete. He recently had to go on a ventilator. His spirits are pretty good, though. He's calling himself the bionic man. The second annual ALS Ice Bucket Challenge is happening now. If you want to find out more, you can go to petefrates. com. And you can also find Nancy's talk at ted. com.

(SOUNDBITE OF AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: You know these guys are saying it's just toys, but these drones we're flying vicinity of GWP. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: All right, what altitude were you guys at? UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: These things were well over 2,000 feet. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: At what altitude would you say that was? UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: I would say probably about a 100 feet below us. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: Medevac cage 1, we almost got hit by a drone just to let you know up here. We didn't see it till it pretty much got right up on us. VIGELAND: Commercial and hobbyist drones have been hailed as a futuristic next step for the use of our airspace. But the head of the Federal Aviation Administration, Michael Huerta, acknowledges they're also a fast-growing and unregulated menace to other aircraft. MICHAEL HUERTA: June of last year, we had 16 reported sightings by pilots of unmanned aircraft operating near airports. June of this year, it was 138. And so clearly, this is increasing at a very dramatic rate. VIGELAND: The FAA is now reviewing potential changes to where and how drones can operate. Huerta says if you plan on flying one, these are the rules. HUERTA: For hobbyists and recreational users, they have the ability to fly as long as they're staying under 400 feet, they're not within five miles of an airport, they're not flying carelessly and recklessly, and they are not flying over large crowds of people. For commercial operators, they need a specific authorization from the FAA. And we work with the industry to issue certificates of authorizations and permits. VIGELAND: But what about the instances where you can't identify who is operating this wayward drone? How do you hold violators accountable when drones don't have, say, what airplanes all have, which is numbers? Should drones be required to have that too? HUERTA: We're certainly looking at that. One of the things that I've asked our industry partners to look at is are there technological solutions that would enable us to be able to tie a particular drone or unmanned aircraft with a specific operator? There's also an active debate taking place when an individual buys a drone that they have to register that they have it, and that might also provide the opportunity to ensure that we're reinforcing the message of what the rules are. VIGELAND: I'm sure you heard about the near collision of the air ambulance in Fresno; the fire crew that was essentially grounded because of a drone. Is there any debate within your agency of whether it's even worth allowing drones at all because right now, it seems not a matter of if there will be a collision, but when? HUERTA: The whole idea of these drones coming into conflict with other aircraft is something that I'm extremely concerned about. And we're looking at two things, first is education. There are a lot of people operating model unmanned aircraft with little or no aviation experience. They're buying them at hobby shops. They're buying them at camera stores. So the whole concept of what are the rules of the air is a very new thing to them. The other half is enforcement. And that has to go hand-in-hand with education. This can range from a warning letter, but it can go all the way up to tens of thousands of dollars for egregious violations. VIGELAND: Are you concerned at all that these regulations are taking too long? Is the FAA behind the curve on this issue? HUERTA: Well, the regulatory process is designed to be slow and deliberate. And so that's why we're putting such an important emphasis on education. I do believe that the majority of people who are flying these things are not setting out to do something that's unsafe. But I also recognize that there are people out there that are very focused on trying to see if they can disrupt operations. And for those people, they need to understand that we will take enforcement action. They're breaking the law. They're putting lives in danger, and that's something that has to stop.

Patty Hsue is an attorney at the FTC who leads that effort. Welcome to the program. PATTY HSUE: Thank you very much for having me. CORNISH: So we heard a little bit about the specifics of how these calls work, but how big is the problem? Can you put a number on the scale of robocalls like this? HSUE: Sure. It's a huge problem from the Federal Trade Commission's perspective. It is the No. 1 consumer complaint that we receive. On average, we receive about 170,000 complaints every single month about robocalls. CORNISH: And we mentioned criminal rings in that story. Do you have any specifics? Are there specific countries, or do you have any more details about the criminals who are behind this? HSUE: I think, from our law enforcement perspective, the calls are coming from anywhere in the world. We do have certain countries that tend to be more prevalent than others, but the reality is, with technology being the way it is, it's very easy to send the calls from anywhere. And we do have a number of scammers that also come from the U. S. as well, which is where we have been able to do fairly effective law enforcement. CORNISH: It seems like the technology is really advanced here. I mean, what is the government doing to try and combat the rising number of these calls? HSUE: We are challenging the public to help create products that allow consumers to protect themselves from these bad actors. In our last challenge, Robocalls: Humanity Strikes Back, we asked the contestants to build something that allows consumers to block the calls on their phones and allows them to forward it to a crowd-sourced honeypot. So it's crowd-sourcing the robocalling information. Now, you may ask why is that last part so important - the call forwarding to a crowd-sourced honeypot. And for us, from a law enforcement perspective, getting that data on those robocallers is actually very useful for our law enforcement efforts. CORNISH: And you called it a crowd-sourced honeypot. HSUE: Yes, I'm calling it a crowd-sourced honeypot because, essentially, it means that the consumers can send us their robocalls. CORNISH: Essentially, consumers send you copies of the calls, and then you look for clues within those calls to figure out where they might be coming from, what industries might be using them and who their customer targets are. HSUE: Potentially. They're all things that we hope will be useful, but until we actually implement it, you know, the sky's the limit at this point. CORNISH: So if you get a call that sounds like fraud, and let's say you don't get it together to send it to the honeypot, what should you do with that call? I mean, is there - do you just hang up? How do you handle it? HSUE: Yes. Our No. 1 consumer tip for consumers, in terms of dealing with robocalls, is to just hang up. We don't want consumers to engage in any way with the robocallers. A lot of times when you get a robocall, you have the option of pressing one for more information or pressing two to ask to be removed from the list. And in either case, pressing one or two basically lets the robocaller know that it's a live person on the other line who's willing to engage, and that could lead to additional robocalls. So our No. 1 tip is just hang up. CORNISH: Patty Hsue - she's an attorney with the Bureau of Consumer Protection at the FTC. Thank you so much for speaking with us. HSUE: Thank you.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SIEGEL: In North Dakota, it is legal for police to arm drones with nonlethal weapons - think pepper spray, for instance, or tear gas. A new state law is on the cutting edge of legislation establishing limits for police use of unmanned aerial systems. It requires police to get warrants to use them for surveillance. And by ruling out arming them with any lethal weapon, it, in effect, OKs the use of nonlethal ones. To better understand all of this, we are going to talk first with the representative who wrote the legislation, Rick Becker, a Republican from Bismarck. Welcome to the program. RICK BECKER: Hi. Thank you very much for having me. SIEGEL: And tell us what was the intent of the bill that you wrote? BECKER: Well, the primary intent was to require law enforcement to obtain a search warrant prior to being able to conduct surveillance on private citizens, and I introduced that in 2013. It failed, and I reintroduced it in 2015. Back in 2013, of course this was very cutting-edge, very new, and so I wanted the bill to be proactive and potentially model legislation for other states. So it did include other things, one of which was the prohibition of weaponizing the drones in any fashion. SIEGEL: And that provision was amended to not ban any weaponization, but to ban the use of lethal weapons as I understand it. BECKER: That's correct. One of the primary reasons the bill failed in 2013 was because of opposition by the law enforcement lobby. And my understanding is when the bill came to the judiciary committee in 2015, law enforcement lobbyists indicated that they would not actively oppose the bill so long as some amendments were included. One of the amendments was to remove the prohibition on nonlethal weapons, and that, in fact, is what was done. SIEGEL: If in fact there's one category of weapons that are lethal and then nonlethal weapons that, in theory, at least, could be affixed to a drone, do you understand what the nonlethal weapons are that would be covered? BECKER: Sure. It's a vast array. It could be a taser, sound cannons, pepper spray, beanbags, rubber bullets. You know, just about anything you can think of can be attached to a drone. You know, the drones vary in size from a small bird up to sort of the 12-foot drones that can have a couple of cannons attached to them. SIEGEL: So I can imagine, if I were a police officer, I would say our SWAT team would be at a great advantage to be able to put a drone over a site and not just a surveil it, but also perhaps gas it, let's say. BECKER: Yes, absolutely. I mean, if one did not take into consideration the concerns for civil liberties and looked only at maximum effectiveness, weapons on drones potentially could be highly effective. SIEGEL: Well, given there being an OK for some weapons on drones that your bill had opposed originally - but you did get a requirement for a warrant before you could surveil a site with a drone - is this bill a victory as it stands? BECKER: Well, I think it's a big victory. Requiring a search warrant for surveillance is huge, and we also got the prohibition of lethal weapons. We now have a law in effect, and I can go back at our next session and try and tweak and get the prohibition of nonlethal weapons back on. And I intend to do that. SIEGEL: That's Rick Becker - Dr. Rick Becker, actually. He's a plastic surgeon in addition to being a Republican state representative from Bismarck, N. D. Thanks for talking with us. BECKER: Yeah. Thank you very much. SIEGEL: A paid lobbyist for the North Dakota Peace Officers Association helped write the change that allows for nonlethal weapons on unmanned aerial systems. Michael Reitan is the president of that organization. He's also the police chief in the city of West Fargo, N. D. Welcome to the program. MICHAEL REITAN: Good afternoon. SIEGEL: Let's deal with this provision about nonlethal weapons or the banning of lethal weapons from drones. When you hear those phrases as a police officer, what practices or potential practices are going through your mind as being affected by that provision? REITAN: Well, talking to law enforcement agencies that have SWAT teams, they felt that there needed to be an ability to deliver nonlethal munitions into certain situations - a barricaded subject - and the possibility of allowing the use of pepper spray to be deployed from a drone. Weapons actually come in three different types of category - lethal, which everyone is familiar with as far as a handgun. Less than lethal are those weapons that fire rubber bullets, beanbags, that type of thing - not meant to be lethal, but they could be. And then there's nonlethal, and we talked about pepper spray. My interpretation of the way the bill is written - when it says lethal weapons are prohibited, it would be both the less lethal and the lethal weapons. SIEGEL: I'd like to hear how you, as a police chief, think about drones. I'm thinking back to - well, it was a very negative reaction, a negative bipartisan reaction when military vehicles appeared in the streets of Ferguson, Mo. , and people talked about the militarization of the police. The drone is a weapon of war. I mean, is it something that continues police forces down the road of being more like part of the armed service? REITAN: And I guess I would argue the point of unmanned aerial systems being weapons of war. There's a recreational vehicle that many in the public have. There are many commercial practices being explored as far as being able to analyze crops, assess damage after disasters. Real estate agents are using them to display homes, so. . . SIEGEL: So you're saying there pervasive. They're used for all - they're used for everything nowadays. REITAN: Well, yes. And certainly, there are many practical, safe, legal things that we can do with drones and not invade the privacy of the individual. SIEGEL: There were headlines that said North Dakota has legalized Taser drones. Are Tasers in the not-so-lethal or nonlethal category? REITAN: Well, they're considered nonlethal. But when you start thinking of the logistics of it, the length of the wire attached to the Taser and especially on a unstable drone platform - practically, I don't see it happening. Really, the focus behind an unmanned aerial system is the ability to search wider areas from a position of advantage. If we have somebody that runs off into a cornfield and hides, we would be able to deploy one of these small drones and quickly fly over the cornfield looking down. And that's true life. SIEGEL: You guys are chasing people through cornfields? REITAN: Yeah. Not that long ago, an individual escaped from a prison transport vehicle, ran into a cornfield, and he was able to avoid capture. Had they been able to use a drone, they would have been able to fly the area. How they caught him was they came in and combined the corn around him so that he ran out of places to hide. SIEGEL: Both a North Dakota problem and a North Dakota solution at the same time. REITAN: There you go. SIEGEL: Michael Reitan, thanks for talking with us today about it.

(SOUNDBITE OF ROBINHOOD AD)UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: You ever think about trading stocks? I mean, you can now, of course. There's always been a cost, usually up to 10 bucks for every single trade. That adds up. No way around it for like people like you and me until now. RATH: This app, Robinhood, is making news because it's a $0 commission stock trading app. Anthony Effinger from Bloomberg Markets has written about Robinhood. He says the app is aimed at millennials. ANTHONY EFFINGER: This a generation that saw the 2008 crisis and the 2009 collapse in stocks and said, you know, no, I'm knowing there. And the two founders of Robinhood were like, well, let's try to get people back into the market. RATH: Now, if they're not charging for trades, how does Robinhood make money? EFFINGER: They're going to charge people to have what's called a margin account where you can borrow from them to buy stock, which is for anybody - anybody, even a big investor - is very dangerous. The second way is they're going to sweep interest off of your cash balances and keep it for themselves. RATH: According to Robinhood, as of last month, users have transacted over $1 billion through its platform. But is it smart to make stock trading as easy as posting a selfie on Instagram? EFFINGER: Portfolios that do best are the ones that people - they buy a bunch of stuff, and they forget about it. They buy bunch of stuff for their 401(k), and they never look at it again, and I've read that story a thousand times in personal finance magazines. This is about trading. The danger is you got this thing in your pocket. You've got a bunch of stocks on there. There's no penalty to buy or sell 'cause there's no commission, so you get a little scared. The market starts going down. What do you do? You bail out, and then it's often hard to get back in. You never want to be a trader. You want to be an investor. And when - the experts I talked to - they were concerned this could create traders, not investors. RATH: But what if you're a market whiz - you know, somebody who really knows things in and out - you know, when to sit - could you make some money with this? EFFINGER: There are so few people who beat the S and P. It's just very, very hard to beat the market. I mean, there's high paid hedge fund managers who make billions who don't beat the market. Look, if you're - if - say, here's an ideal situation. You're a person at a tech company in San Francisco. You're young. You're working there. You've got all your money tied up in stock of this company. You want to diversify. You get the Robinhood app. You can buy some other stocks. And you hold it, and you did that commission-free. That's a victory. If they can convince other people to buy and hold and not trade when they get scared, they might have a winner, but that's a big if, right? RATH: (Laughter). EFFINGER: I mean, it's so tempting to trade if that's in your pocket, and the market's going down 600 points. RATH: It's an app on your phone. I'm not saying that it's like Candy Crush, but you kind of like playing around with these things, right? (LAUGHTER)EFFINGER: Yeah, and I actually think that's a great point because this is - it's real money. Silicon Valley really wants to take the friction out of everything, right? But investing - it turns out a little friction's not a bad thing - something to slow you down and make you take the time to do your research, do your homework and stick with your plan. Speed's not always a great thing. I mean, look at this last two weeks. I mean, the market - you wake up. The market's down a thousand points. You look at your phone. You freak out. You can sell with no cost. But what happened the next day? The market bounced back. You know, most often, these big drops are followed by recoveries. Now, someday, maybe that's not going to be true, but, you know, so far, the track record is otherwise. RATH: That's Anthony Effinger, writer for Bloomberg Markets.

We did this with our friends at WNYC in the name of creativity. Research suggests that boredom fosters creativity, but the challenge was tough. MELISSA GRAY, BYLINE: Well, it didn't go that well, I guess, if the whole point of this was to get me to use my phone less.

And as if it wasn't hard enough, now comes this news. Researchers wrote an algorithm to help a phone figure out when we are bored so it can offer things to do. MARTIN PIELOT: We start using the phone in a different way in certain moments of boredom. CORNISH: This is Martin Pielot of Telefonica Research in Barcelona. PIELOT: We basically can detect when people start killing time with the phone. CORNISH: For example, says Pielot's collegue Nuria Oliver, we might quickly browse a lot of apps. NURIA OLIVER: We go to Twitter, then we go to Facebook. Then we go to you know, some app, then we go to email because we are looking for something interesting. CORNISH: The phone can infer we are bored. It's correct about 83 percent of the time. One test was a BuzzFeed article. Researchers used the algorithm to push an alert with a link. People who seemed bored were more likely to click. You can imagine where some publishers might take this. The phone could become an even more enticing time waster. On the other hand, says Martin Pielot, this can also be used for good. PIELOT: If the phone would literally say, hey, do you really need to open Facebook for the third time now in a row? There's not going to be anything new. CORNISH: Maybe, say the folks at Telefonica Research, when the phone senses boredom, it could urge us to put it down and do something else.

I'm Guy Raz. Over the past few years, corporations wanting to stage manage an announcement. . . . (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE CALL)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Thank you, good afternoon and welcome to the call. RAZ: . . . Have turned to the corporate conference call. This is where reporters can dial in, grab some quotes and write a story. And normally, they are pretty boring. But anyone listening to this call - this is a call convened by Facebook in 2014. (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE CALL)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Joining me on the call today are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook. . . RAZ: Anyone listening heard a pretty pretty amazing prediction. (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE CALL)MARK ZUCKERBERG: Thanks Deborah, and thanks everyone for joining us today. RAZ: A prediction about the future of screens. (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE CALL)ZUCKERBERG: I'm excited to announce that Facebook has reached an agreement to acquire Oculus VR, the leader in virtual reality technology. RAZ: So this is Mark Zuckerberg on this conference call with reporters, announcing that Facebook had bought for $2 billion a company that makes virtual reality headsets. Now, at this point, a lot of Facebook investors were questioning that acquisition. They were asking questions like isn't virtual reality that thing that was supposed to happen back in the '80s that never took off? And so Zuckerberg, on this call, was trying to justify to those investors why his company just spent $2 billion on a technology most people have never seen. And this is what he said. (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE CALL)ZUCKERBERG: The history of our industry is that every 10 or 15 years, there's a new major computing platform, whether it's the PC, the web or now mobile. History suggests that there will be more platforms to come, and that whoever builds and defines these will not only shape all the experiences that our industry built, but also benefit financially and strategically. RAZ: OK, just a pause and translate that. In the past, he's saying, anyone able to get in on the ground floor of new technology platforms like the PC, or the Internet or mobile devices changed the way we live and made their investors a boat-load of money. OK, let's keep listening. (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE CALL)ZUCKERBERG: Mobile is the platform of today. And now we're starting to also get ready for the platforms of tomorrow. To me, by far the most exciting future platform is our own vision or modifying what you see to create augmented and immersive experiences. I believe Oculus can be one of the platforms of the future. RAZ: So basically, this is Mark Zuckerberg in March, 2014 predicting that virtual reality goggles are the next smartphone, the next Internet, the next thing that's going to transform our lives. And quietly over the past few years, a lot of other tech companies - Microsoft, Google, Sony - they've also been betting a lot of money on that same idea. CHRIS MILK: People are looking at this technology, I think, as some people think it's a novelty. Some people think it's a videogame. People are beginning to see it as a possible next step to cinema. I think what we're ultimately talking about is an alternate version of human consciousness. RAZ: This is Chris Milk. He's a filmmaker, whose new company Verse makes virtual reality films. These are films designed to be watched using those virtual reality goggles. Chris has already put out a few early visions of those films which you can watch. . . . MILK: Turn. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Turn what? MILK: Turn your body. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Oh! RAZ: On a simple smartphone app. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Oh, look at that. RAZ: We showed some of those films. . . . UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Oh that's pretty [expletive] cool. RAZ: To people around the NPR office. MILK: Look up, look up. Tilt it up. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: That's cool. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: This is neatUNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Wow. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: Whoa, where did you guys get this? RAZ: Now, it's not what they're looking at that's important, it's. . . . MILK: How. . . . RAZ: How they're seeing it. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #4: What is this? RAZ: Because the image you see changes. . . . UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #5: This is so cool. RAZ: Depending on the direction you point the phone. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: It's totally convincing. RAZ: And it starts to feel as if you're not just watching the screen. . . . UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: Whoa. RAZ: You're actually inside it. (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE CALL)ZUCKERBERG: The incredible thing about the technology is that you feel like you're actually present in another place with other people. It's different from anything I've ever experienced in my life, and many people who try it also say the same thing. RAZ: As we're going to hear on this episode, the technology behind our screens is moving really fast. So fast, in fact, that we sometimes spend more time imagining how our screens will change in the future, than really understanding how our screens are changing us right now. MILK: You are always there. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #6: And it keeps us there. MILK: Even if you're not actually there. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #6: Because it's so good at distracting us. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #7: You can click a button and get a dopamine hit and get some information. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #6: Something is blinking, pay attention. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #7: But it's not satisfying information, most of the time. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #6: Yeah, I try to be healthy about it - I don't want it to dictate my life. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #5: But I think if things continue to go the way that they're going, it's just going to get too much for people. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #6: You know, I spend a lot of time in airports and I look around and everybody, literally - to a person is glued to their. . . . RAZ: There's your phone, right now. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #6: There it is even. . . . RAZ: Right now. . . UNIDENTIFIED MAN #6: You can hear it. . . RAZ: I can hear it - I can hear it buzzing right now. Today on the show, Screen Time - part one of a two-part TED RADIO HOUR looking at this moment in history when we're starting to interact with our screens almost as much or sometimes even more than we do with other humans. Next week, we're going to go inside the screen, a place where a whole other version of you lives like a digital doppelganger which may be more real than the real you. But this week, we're staying mainly outside the screen, and we're going to start to ask what all this screen interaction is doing to us and how we're living more and more of our lives through it. (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE CALL)ZUCKERBERG: Imagine enjoying a courtside seat at a game, studying in a classroom of students and teachers all over the world, consulting with a doctor face-to-face or going shopping in a virtual store where you can touch and explore the product you're interested in, just by putting on goggles your own home. This is really a new social platform. MILK: Often we talk about - are we creating our eventual dystopian future? And if that is the case, and you are listening to this in the future I. . . . RAZ: We're really sorry. MILK: I'm really sorry about that. RAZ: We'll hear more from Chris Milk later on about how virtual reality technology could change how we experience the world around us. But first - what everyday screen technology is changing about us right now. GUY RAZ, HOST:  It's the TED RADIO HOUR from NPR. I'm Guy Raz.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #5: I'm engaging. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: Yep, engage. SINGER: You as a general, you as a president didn't used to be able to watch the battle live. Now you can do that. RAZ: Yeah. I mean, there's that iconic image of, like, the president and his National Security cabinet sitting in the Situation Room, watching that operation to eventually kill Bin Laden. Like, to watch - they're watching that in real time through a screen. SINGER: The things that we once imagined only in science fiction, whether it's the Internet itself, cyberspace, to drones, hybrid warfare, to universal surveillance and observation, the inability to keep secrets - all of these things were imagined in science fiction and have become real. But things don't play out exactly the way that we planned. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: So you just heard Peter mention drones. Long before most of us even knew what they were, before we heard about the U. S. military using them to bomb targets in Pakistan or Yemen, Peter was raising questions about how they're changing war back in 2009 in this TED talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SINGER: Something big is going on in war today and maybe even the history of humanity itself. The U. S. military went into Iraq with a handful of drones in the air. We now have 5,300. One of the people that I recently met with was an Air Force three-star general, and he said, basically, where we're headed very soon is tens of thousands of robots operating in our conflicts. A robots revolution is upon us. Another way of putting this is that mankind's 5,000-year-old monopoly on the fighting of war is breaking down in our very lifetime. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: So Peter, you gave this talk about six years ago, and obviously, a lot of things have changed. Who - I mean, who else is fighting wars like this now? SINGER: So 82 different countries have drone programs today of some way, shape or form. But one of the interesting challenges that maybe looms in the future is, if we were in a conflict with a major state power, each of those sides would look at the dependence that the other has on these technologies, from communications to command-and-control to intelligence - you name it - and they would try and take that away. They would, in essence, notice our dependence on the screen and try and jam or block or warp everything from traffic lights to the engine rooms of Navy ships. RAZ: I wonder if, like, for the people who are actually doing the killing, you know, from far away, like, the drone pilots - I mean, you would think that war would be cleaner, you know, for them somehow. SINGER: But I would argue that it's not clean and easy on the operators, even if they're operating from afar. Drone operators or analysts who are watching this video - even though they're not physically there, we're still seeing them suffer from PTSD or burnout or the like. When you take life, that is a psychological toll. When you see horrible things, whether you see them up close or from afar, it can take a toll. Another part of the explanation may be the disconnect of making these kind of decisions, seeing these sorts of things and, an hour later, standing in line at the Burger King or getting in an argument with your wife about, you know, forgetting to pick up milk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SINGER: The future of war is also going to be a YouTube war. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #6: They're still firing the 203s. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #7: Who is? UNIDENTIFIED MAN #6: These guys right here are firing. . . SINGER: There're several thousand video clips of combat footage from Iraq on YouTube right now. Now, this could be a good thing. It could be building connections between the home front and the warfront as never before. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #8: OK. We're still taking fire from our western flank - RPGs and small arms. SINGER: But inevitably, the ability to download these video clips gives you the ability to turn it into entertainment. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #8: Get across. Go, go, go, go, go. SINGER: This ability to watch war but experience less creates a wrinkle in the public's relationship with war. I think about this with a sports parallel. It's like the difference between watching a NBA game - a professional basketball game on TV where the athletes are tiny figures on the screen and being at that basketball game in person and realizing what somebody 7 feet really does look like. But we have to remember. These are just the clips. They lose the context. They lose the humanity. War just becomes slam dunks and smart bombs. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: You know, Peter, I mean, the thing that's interesting is - and I know this is not, you know, a new question that you've sort of thought about, but it is, to me, a big question, which is, when a country has a capacity to send an unmanned aircraft somewhere to attack something or a person and control that through a screen, it means that making that choice to do that is arguably somewhat easier 'cause you're not risking your own people. You're not risking their lives. SINGER: It used to be that the barriers to war were high. You know, you had to build castles or aircraft carriers. Not anyone could do it. And they were also high in terms of the political decisions that it - was required to take your nation into war - you know, Congress itself voting. What we're seeing now is a lowering of the barriers. RAZ: Yeah. SINGER: We can see this, for example, in the drone war, so to speak, that we've been fighting in Pakistan and Yemen. We've carried out more than 500 airstrikes. These are operations that, if we were talking about man systems, we'd be treating very differently. These are operations that have never been formally voted on by Congress. So the barriers to war have been lowered both through the broader availability of the technologies of war, but also the way that we view war or, even more so, things that are war that we're not willing to call war. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: Peter Warren Singer - he's got a new novel out that touches on a lot of this stuff. It's called \"Ghost Fleet: A Novel Of The Next World War. \" You can see his entire talk at ted. com. GUY RAZ, HOST:  Most of what we've been hearing about so far is how all of this technology is affecting us personally. But screens are also changing the way we think about really big consequential things. When you think about war, how much of it is moving to screens? PETER WARREN SINGER: The experience for a large number of the players, so to speak, in war is happening on screen. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: It's level, actually, and here comes power. RAZ: This is Peter Warren Singer. He wrote a best-selling book about this called \"Wired For War. \" SINGER: When you're talking about an airstrike in a place like Pakistan or alike. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: I got a guy running, throwing a weapon. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Roger that. SINGER: . . . It involves multiple people in multiple locations. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: He threw it off in the field. He's running back to the vehicle. SINGER: It's not the human eye that's typically seeing it. They're seeing it through some kind of surveillance device. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: He's at the vehicle. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Roger. SINGER: That camera might be beaming back to folks in a command and control center. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: Go auto-range on it. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #5: Yeah.

You can write a Facebook post about a bad day or you can put an Instagram photo of a great day, smiling. But the thing is your screen can't really understand how you feel - at least not yet. RANA EL KALIOUBY: I think building machines and devices that can sense your emotions, I think, with that type of technology instead of people, like, emoting these social signals and then they disappear into cyberspace, we have an opportunity to capture them. RAZ: This is Rana el Kaliouby. She's a computer scientist who spent the past few years at MIT's Media Lab. And the idea that our devices could be built to detect our emotions - it came to Rana when she moved from Cairo to Cambridge in the U. K. back in the late 1990s to work on her Ph. D. KALIOUBY: That was the first time I was basically away from home. RAZ: Rana was in England by herself, thousands of miles away from anyone she knew. KALIOUBY: And I was pretty lonely. There were a lot of these days. RAZ: And because she was in a new place where she didn't know anyone, Rana was actually spending most of her time with her laptop, which wasn't much of a friend at all. KALIOUBY: It had absolutely no idea what my emotional state was. And I could be happy or I could be stressed or frustrated, and it would be completely oblivious. RAZ: So Rana's sitting there in England, and she's wondering, how could I fix this? (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)KALIOUBY: What if our devices could sense how we felt and reacted accordingly, just the way an emotionally intelligent friend would? RAZ: Today, more than 15 years after she first asked this question, Rana explained how she's getting closer to the answer. Here she is on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)KALIOUBY: Those questions led me and my team to create technologies that can read and respond to our emotions, and our starting point was the human face. So our human face happens to be one of the most powerful channels that we all use to communicate social and emotional state, everything from enjoyment, surprise, empathy and curiosity. In emotion science, we call each facial muscle movement an action unit. So for example, action unit 12, it is a lip corner pull, which is the main component of a smile. Another example is action unit 4. It's the brow furrow. It's when you draw your eyebrows together and you create all these textures and wrinkles. We don't like them, but it's a strong indicator of a negative emotion. So we have about 45 of these action units, and they combine to express hundreds of emotions. Teaching a computer to read these facial emotions is hard because these action units - they can be fast, they're subtle, and they combine in many different ways. RAZ: So initially, Rana and her team fed tens of thousands of photos of people smiling or frowning into a computer program, so it could learn all these tiny little micro expressions. Today, they have 12 billion examples of those expressions, which makes the technology even better at detecting all the subtleties in our faces. And so what they've done is combine the program with a tiny camera, kind of like the one already built into your smartphone. And during her TED talk, Rana brought up a volunteer. Her name is Chloe (ph). And Ranaa gave Chloe an iPad to hold up in front of her face. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)KALIOUBY: As you can see, the algorithm has essentially found Chloe's face - so it's this white bounding box. And then it identifies the main feature points on your face. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)KALIOUBY: Her eyebrows, her eyes, her mouth and her nose. And it starts tracking how these facial muscles move over time. So, for example, when you smile. . . (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)KALIOUBY: And then, as she smiles - this is a genuine smile, that's great. So you can see the green bar go up as she smiles. Your lip corners move upwards and outwards, and they create these wrinkles around your eyes and your cheeks. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)KALIOUBY: Can you try, like, a subtle smile to see if the computer  can recognize - it does recognize subtle smiles, as well. We've worked really hard to make that happen. And it identifies these things and it says, oh, OK. You're smiling here. And it maps it to an emotional state. RAZ: Once Rana and her team perfect this technology, she imagines all kinds of ways other scientists and engineers could build it into our lives. For example, you could send an email, one day, embedded with data about how you are feeling as you wrote it or what if your phone or your laptop or maybe even the mirror in your bathroom read your face every day? KALIOUBY: And imagine if all these devices talk to each other and they can capture various aspects of your day and your emotions of the day, and we have a baseline for you. So we know what's your norm, and then we also know when you deviate from that norm. So your phone can say, hey, you know, I've noticed that you haven't laughed for the past four days. What's going on? Is there something I can do to help? You know, if it knows your humor profile, for example. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)AZIZ ANSARI: And then I realize, oh, my God, 50 Cent has no idea what a grapefruit is. KALIOUBY: . . . Can find content that is really funny. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)STEVE JOBS: Stay hungry. Stay foolish. KALIOUBY: . . . Or inspiring. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOBS: As you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you. KALIOUBY: And it can suggest five minutes of meditation. RAZ: Or dance music. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KALIOUBY: Or dance music (laughter). RAZ: Yeah. KALIOUBY: Or that, too. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KALIOUBY: So it can do a lot of things once it understands what your patterns are and what your emotions are over time. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)KALIOUBY: I think in five years down the line, all our devices are going to have an emotion chip. And we won't remember what it was like when we couldn't just frown at our device and our device would say, you didn't like that, did you? Imagine if your learning app sensed that you're confused and slowed down or that you're bored so it sped up, just like a great teacher would in a classroom. Emotion-enabled wearable glasses can help individuals who are visually impaired read the faces of others, and it can help individuals on the autism spectrum interpret emotion, something that they really struggle with. What if your wristwatch tracked your mood or your car sensed that you're tired, or perhaps your fridge knows that you're stressed, so it auto-locks to prevent you from binge eating (laughter). I would like that, yeah. (LAUGHTER)KALIOUBY: What if when I was in Cambridge I had access to my real-time emotion stream and I could share that with my family back home in a very natural way, just like I would have if we were all in the same room together? RAZ: How do you imagine all this could, like, change us - right? - because, I mean, I don't know, part of this makes me a little uncomfortable. KALIOUBY: So we're very social animals and social beings. And the only thing we're changing is this paradigm in which we interact with technology, right? We are becoming more and more digital. We're surrounded by a lot more highly-connected, intelligent devices. And I don't think that that's going to change anytime soon. Like, I don't see my daughter suddenly stopping texting. Like, that's going to be very hard (laughter). So I think the solution is not to curb our use of technology but instead embrace it and build empathy into that technology. Like, I think it's important that we learn, as humans, that our emotions continue to matter, even in a digital world. RAZ: That's Rana el Kaliouby. Her company is called Affectiva.

Do you think it's conceivable that we're heading towards a future where most of our lives will be lived digitally? CHRIS MILK: It's certainly not my goal. Although it might look like that sometimes.

So Chris started to design these interactive video installations, these films that he would mount in art museums. And he started to notice something. MILK: I would sit there all day just, like, watching it from a dark corner. RAZ: By it, he means this film he designed. And the way it worked was that a camera would project your shadow onto a bright white wall. But if you moved your arms, your shadow - your actual shadow would grow wings. MILK: And if you flapped them, you actually start flying up into the air and off the screen. RAZ: And Chris would notice that people changed when the screen was more than just a frame on the wall. MILK: What I saw was this very visceral human reaction. People would just lose themselves inside of it. RAZ: So this sparked an idea for him, but also a problem. MILK: The problem was there's just no way to scale something like that. RAZ: Yeah. MILK: Yeah I can fit six people in it at a time. I can build it in another museum simultaneously. And then I've got 12 people in it at a time. I want a million people in it at a time. RAZ: Chris started to think more and more about the limits of the screen and how film hasn't really changed all that much since he was a kid growing up in the 80s. Here's Chris' \"TED Talk\". (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MILK: The film, it's an incredible medium. But essentially, it's the same now as it was then. It's a group of rectangles that are played in a sequence. And we've done incredible things with those rectangles. But I started thinking about - is there a way that I could use modern and developing technologies to tell stories in different ways and tell different kinds of stories that maybe I couldn't tell using the traditional tools of filmmaking that we've been using for a hundred years? But then I started thinking about frames, and what do they represent. And a frame is just a window. I mean, all the media that we watch - television, cinema - they're these windows into these other worlds. And I thought well great, I got you in a frame but I don't want you in the frame, I don't want you in the window, I want you through the window. I want you on the other side in the world, inhabiting the world. So that leads me back to virtual reality. RAZ: OK, so before we talk about Chris' specific role in virtual reality, here's what's going on in that world, generally. This holiday season, and early into next year, a bunch of companies like Sony and Microsoft, Google, HTC and Oculus - that's the company now owned by Facebook - they will all release virtual reality headsets. Basically it's a big pair of goggles with a 3-D screen inside. And along with some hand controllers, you'll be able to play all kinds of video games in a completely new way. That's where most of the focus is - video games. But Chris Milk isn't interested in videogames, he makes movies. And he wants to make movies designed to be watched using these new headsets. And that means changing everything about the way movies are made, starting with the cameras. MILK: The current technology that we're working with and most people are working with is sort of a ball of cameras with a lot of lenses that look in a lot of different directions simultaneously. Then, we go into a postproduction process, and we stitch all those different directions together so that we have one singular sphere where you can look in every direction. RAZ: Which means if, say, the Rolling Stones put one of those cameras on stage with them, you could put on a VR headset and be there with them, too. And from your vantage point on stage, you could turn your head in any direction, and you would see a different part of it. MILK: And when that happens, you get this feeling of what's called presence. RAZ: Yeah. MILK: The way the world moves around you as your physical body moves through it is different than the way that you see a movie or you see a television show which is this thing that's a rectangle and it's on a wall. But virtual reality actually mirrors the way that you see the world in real life. RAZ: So in Chris Milk's TED Talk, he describes how the better this technology gets at making you feel like you're really there, the more powerful and emotional these films will become. And one of those films is already pretty powerful. It's an eight-minute movie Chris described on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MILK: So this film is called \"Clouds Over Sidra\". And it was made in conjunction with our virtual reality company called VRSE and the United Nations and a co-collaborator called Gabo Arora. And we went to a Syrian refugee camp in Jordan and shot the story of a 12-year-old girl there named Sidra. And her and her family fled Syria through the desert into Jordan. And she's been living in this camp for the last year and a half. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"CLOUDS OVER SIDRA\")SIDRA: (Through interpreter) My name is Sidra. I am 12 years old. I am in the fifth grade. I am from Syria. RAZ: So Chris, in this clip, which I guess we should explain that if you watch this in a VR headset, you're basically seeing this girl - she's right in front of you. She's talking to you. She's, like, sitting on the rug on the floor of a - in this dusty, hot building in this refugee camp. MILK: Yeah, and the thing that happens in virtual reality that does not happen in a rectangle on your wall, is you find yourself in the same room as this girl. When you look down, you're sitting on the same earth that she's sitting on. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"CLOUDS OVER SIDRA\")SIDRA: (Through interpreter)I have a big family, three brothers, one is a baby. He cries a lot. MILK: And something changes when that happens. And I can't tell you from a biological level, or a cognitive level what that exactly is, but something definitely changes. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"CLOUDS OVER SIDRA\")SIDRA: (Through interpreter) I like cloudy days, I feel like I am under a cover. RAZ: In this film, you can watch Sidra's friends walking right past you on their way to a temporary school. And when you look at them, they look back at you and smile and wave. Seeing this film in a virtual reality headset is so powerful because it's as if you are there. And Chris knows it, he's already shown the film at places like the World Economic Forum in Davos, to some of the world's most powerful people. And when they watch it, he's seen tears literally stream down their faces as they experience that refugee camp. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MILK: We're working with the United Nations right now to shoot a whole series of these films. We just finished shooting a story in Liberia. And now, we're going to shoot a story in India. And we're taking these films and we're showing them at the United Nations to people that work there and people that are visiting their. And we're showing them to the people that can actually change the lives of the people inside of the films. And that's where I think we just start to scratch the surface of the true power of virtual reality. It's not a videogame peripheral, it connects humans to other humans in a profound way that I've never seen before in any other form of media. And it can change people's perception of each other. RAZ: I mean, it is all those things, right? Like, it is so exciting. And it's also so terrifying because you can imagine that it can change the truth. I mean, people's perceptions can be so affected and moved by an experience in this world that seems so real, that it becomes real, right? Like, you can imagine a - you know, somebody could take this technology and create what seems real, a real version of an idea and convince minds - change minds, and actually create real hatred. MILK: Yeah, you can use film and you can use radio and you can use literature to change minds for the purpose of evil. And you will be able to do it in virtual reality as well. I mean, you can't - would you - let me ask you, let me turn it back on you. Would you say that we shouldn't have literature or we shouldn't have cinema because it can be used for those sort of purposes? RAZ: No, of course not. Right? No, of course not, that's a thing. It's like you can't really fool-proof this stuff. You can't make it impossible for evil people to use. It's just not. . . . MILK: You can't. RAZ: Right? MILK: No, you can't. RAZ: Yeah. MILK: So what I'd say, though - my hope would be that allowing people to have experiences that are impossible in the physical world can be an enlightening, life-changing, transformative experience. I was in Sicily last week, and we were in this little village, in this town square. And there was an elderly Italian couple there. And I had a headset in my backpack. And we asked them if they wanted to try it. They were friendly and smiling and talking to us and we asked them if they wanted to try it. And the man tried it on and came out on the other side with his eyes wide open. And in his broken English, he said that there is lots of very bad things in the world, but this was a good thing. And I hope he's right. RAZ: That's Chris Milk. You can download his company's app VRSE - it's VRSE - to see some of the films we talked about with or without a virtual-reality headset. Now that we've stepped inside the screen, join us next week as we ask what it means for our lives increasingly to be lived there. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALKS)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: I predict that years from now, we'll regard taking away your access to virtual worlds as completely inappropriate. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: What does this really mean? Are we going to be creatures that are going to live differently, breathe differently, love differently? UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: We're creating hundreds of thousands, in not millions of pieces of content that are going to live online long after we're gone. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #5: The way we are defined on the internet, on Google, has become more and more important than who we actually are as people. RAZ: That's next week on the show. Don't miss it. GUY RAZ, HOST:  OK so all this episode, we've been talking about what's happening to us on the real-world side of our screens, like how we interact with them from the outside, but this is a two-parter. And next week on our second episode about Screen Time, we're going to step inside the screen. And we're going to ask a lot more questions about what it means for our lives, more and more to be lived there. So to end this first episode, someone to lead us in. Do you think it's conceivable that we're heading towards a future where most of our lives will be lived digitally? CHRIS MILK: It's certainly not my goal. Although it might look like that sometimes. RAZ: Chris Milk, he's the guy who made those virtual reality films we showed around the office at the beginning of the show. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Wow. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Whoa. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Oh, that's pretty [expletive] cool. RAZ: You remember all that, right? So Chris started his career making music videos for people like Arcade Fire and Kanye West. He did the video for this track. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"TOUCH THE SKY\") KANYE WEST: (Singing) I got to testify. RAZ: But after doing this kind of work for a while, he was looking to try something different, something more meaningful.

This episode, we're looking at the way we interact with our screens and how those interactions might be changing us. So think about the human brain. From a very early age, our brain responds to and is shaped by what we see and what we hear. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: This idea has been studied by a lot of scientists, including this one. DIMITRI CHRISTAKIS: My name's Dimitri Christakis. I'm a pediatrician and epidemiologist and a parent of two teenagers. RAZ: And a few years ago, Dimitri did a study on newborn babies just a day old. And he played them music like this, Mozart. And then he would analyze their breathing. CHRISTAKIS: What we've learned is that babies, even at one day of age, will have discernible changes in the respiratory rate and their breathing depending on what they're hearing. RAZ: So a baby listening to this. . . CHRISTAKIS: You actually will see that their breathing pattern is slow and steady. RAZ: So, like, if you're listening to Mozart, it's like (breathing). CHRISTAKIS: That's about right. RAZ: But in contrast, he says. CHRISTAKIS: If you put on something that has a different - say, Stravinsky. . . (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CHRISTAKIS: . . . With more minor chords. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CHRISTAKIS: Their breathing pattern became more irregular and slightly faster. And then the very interesting thing was at the end of that segment of Stravinsky, we put Mozart back on. Then you see a return to the original breathing pattern. RAZ: They're like, that's more like it. CHRISTAKIS: (Laughter). (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CHRISTAKIS: Now, that isn't to say that one source of music or another is preferable to the baby. RAZ: Yeah. CHRISTAKIS: But what we can say is that they are so attuned to their environment early on that they make such subtle distinctions, even on their very first day of life. RAZ: Now, the idea here is that the way our brains are stimulated matters, especially when we're young and our brains are being shaped by that stimulation. But for most kids, that stimulation is not Mozart. It's not Stravinsky. It's screen time - lots and lots of screen time. Here in the U. S. , for example, the typical preschool child spends about four and a half hours a day in front of the screen. And Dimitri has been researching what that means for those kids and for their future. Here's his TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CHRISTAKIS: Now, we know from decades of research that too little stimulation early on is bad for brain development. But the question we've had at our lab for some time is, what about too much? Is it actually possible to over-stimulate the developing brain or, more appropriately, to inappropriately stimulate the developing brain in ways that are actually not beneficial but harmful? And this is important because we're technologizing childhood today in a way that's unprecedented. In 1970, the average age in which children began to watch television regularly was 4 years. And today, based on research that we've done, it's 4 months. It's not just how early they watch but how much they watch. The typical child before the age of 5 is watching about four and half hours of TV a day. That represents as much as 40 percent of their waking hours. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: I mean, all that screen time, presumably, is cutting down on how often kids are interacting, you know, in the real world. CHRISTAKIS: The simple truth is that we're all what they call digital immigrants. I mean, the incredible thing to me is our children who, if they were born five years ago, didn't know a world where an iPhone didn't exist. And they are digital natives. They don't know of a world that these things didn't exist in, and they're incredibly tethered to them. RAZ: I mean, they're kind of like guinea pigs because most of the way they communicate and see the world will happen through a screen. CHRISTAKIS: You're absolutely right. And, in fact, because I'm asked a lot by parents about the effects of all of these new technologies, what I have to share with them is the fact that science quite literally cannot keep up with the pace of technological advances. So we started studying the iPad and touch screen media about three years ago. We were probably among the first in the country to do it. And it takes a long time to get funding for research, and that's increasingly difficult. And then you have to conduct the experiment themselves and that takes time. And you have to analyze the data and so. . . RAZ: I mean, basically, we don't know. CHRISTAKIS: We know some things. I mean, I don't want to be entirely neolistic. We do know some things. But you're right. In many other ways, we're in the midst of a large uncontrolled experiment on the next generation of children. RAZ: One of those things scientists do know is that not all screens are created equal and not all content is either. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MISTER ROGERS' NEIGHBORHOOD\")FRED ROGERS: Hi, Aud (ph). AUD: Oh, hi, Fred. ROGERS: (Laughter) How are you? AUD: I'm fine, how are you. ROGERS: Good, thanks. I brought my television neighbor to see what a restaurant was like. AUD: Oh, I'm so glad. Can I show you to a table? ROGERS: Certainly. AUD: I'm awfully busy today. One of the waitresses is ill. ROGERS: I see. AUD: So I'm sort of doing double duty. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CHRISTAKIS: Fred Rogers invented reality TV. (LAUGHTER)CHRISTAKIS: He's not credited with it. Actually, it's not reality, right? It's even slower-paced than reality. (LAUGHTER)CHRISTAKIS: The waitress says I'm awfully busy, but she doesn't seem the least bit hurried. (LAUGHTER)CHRISTAKIS: Now, I want to contrast that with \"The Powerpuff Girls Movie,\" the right mix of sugar and spice for a satisfying rush. I don't know how many of you have seen that, but here's a scene from that. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE POWERPUFF GIRLS MOVIE\")CHRISTAKIS: Again, you can see a lot of rapid sequencing. In fact, this was the first movie that was ever rated PG for nonstop, frenetic, animated action. (LAUGHTER)CHRISTAKIS: So you can see that there are very, very real differences in pacing. RAZ: Dimitri says we're just starting to understand how pacing in TV shows could affect the human brain but not just by studying humans. CHRISTAKIS: There are limits to the kinds of experiments that we can even do ethically, which is one of the reasons we started working with mice in the lab, if you can believe it, to try to develop models of media usage that can be studied more robustly. RAZ: You basically - you turn mice cages into TV lounges? CHRISTAKIS: TV lounges, yeah, that's right. That's a very nice way of putting it. RAZ: What it looks like and sounds like to spend your entire mousy childhood watching a big screen TV and what it could mean for us. That's coming up in just a minute. I'm Guy Raz. Stay with us, you're listening to the TED RADIO HOUR from NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: One the show today, Screen Time, a look at how all the screens in our lives are changing us. And just a minute ago, pediatrician and researcher Dimitri Christakis who studies screen time in kids was about to describe an experiment he did with mice. And these were young mice, about 10 days old. And for a month, what ends up being their entire childhood, Dimitri gives them free, unlimited TV. CHRISTAKIS: By having them listen to the cartoon channel and have photo rhythmically activated lights provide visual stimulation to go along with it. (SOUNDBITE OF UNIDENTIFIED TV SHOW)UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) And then that trio went to. . . RAZ: And this is what it's like - bright, multicolored, flashing lights six hours a day. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: This sounds like torture. CHRISTAKIS: It's interesting; when we look at their cortisol levels, there's no physiological signs that this is actually stressful to them. RAZ: Oh. CHRISTAKIS: But it is over stimulating their senses in much the same way television and other screen media do for young children's brains. RAZ: What Dimitri's mouse studies revealed is that the more the mice watched TV, the harder it became for those mice to learn and to stay attentive. So for example, they'd get confused by objects they'd actually seen before, objects they should've learned to recognize already. So when researchers followed up these mouse studies with similar studies in children, comparing kids who, say, watch a lot of \"Mister Rogers\" with kids who watch a lot of \"Powerpuff Girls\" - you can probably guess where this is going - they found pretty similar patterns. CHRISTAKIS: What you see is that educational programs like \"Mister Rogers\" pose no increased risk of attentional problems. Entertainment programs like \"The Powerpuff Girls\" increase the chances by about 60 percent. And violent programming, which I didn't show you, increases it even by more than 100 percent. And violent programs are typically even more rapidly sequenced. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: Do you find that your attention span has been affected since you've been a screen user? CHRISTAKIS: I do think that my attentional capacity has become somewhat diminished. Of course, maybe that has as much to do with aging as anything else. But I worry much more about my children that they are able to stay focused on a task. Many people believe that multitasking and fast-paced world is what we live in and children might as well learn to adapt to it early on. And I don't think that that's true. I certainly don't want people, whether they're CEOs of companies in the future, presidents of industry or even artists or writers, to not be able to stay focused on something. RAZ: Yeah. I remember when my younger son was 2 and we had a PBS program on TV. It was \"Sesame Street. \" And he walked up to the TV and he started swiping right. He just, like, took his finger across the TV. And he - it was just - he couldn't understand why it wasn't reacting to him because to him, like, a screen was this thing that you can just touch and make it do what you want it to do. CHRISTAKIS: That really has been a game changer in the last five years, these interactive screens. And it has given those of us that have researched children and screens real pause. But, you know, the one thing that a child never says - or never thinks if they're preverbal - when they interact with the typical passive media, is I did it. And even the best quality children's shows that tried to engage children, recognizing how important that was to their cognitive and social development, would ask rhetorical questions. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MISTER ROGERS' NEIGHBORHOOD\")ROGERS: It is a beautiful day in this neighborhood. Is it in yours? Have you ever been to a circus? You like to swing? Do you have any idea what might be in this bag? RAZ: Now, as a kid, you could answer Mr. Rogers. You could talk back to him. But you could never affect what happened on the screen. And Dimitri says this is an area where modern screen technology, like touch screens or kids' apps, could actually do something that Mr. Rogers couldn't because by interacting with those screens, kids can say I did it. I made that happen. CHRISTAKIS: Any parent of any child who's had the experience of putting them in a high chair and, let's say, giving them something, either a toy or a piece of fruit or whatever, knows what that child is going to do. They're going to take it and drop it, much to their delight. And they'll be even more delighted when the parent comes and picks it up and puts it back, thus creating kind of an infinite feedback loop. RAZ: Yeah. CHRISTAKIS: Children love - love the fact that they make something happen in the real world. So what do I think? I think that touch screens and particularly high-quality apps are very, very different than passive media. But the challenge is it's not just not all screens are the same. Not all content on screens is the same. RAZ: Dimitri Christakis - he's a pediatrician and researcher at Seattle Children's Hospital. You can check out his talk at ted. npr. org. GUY RAZ, HOST:  On the show today, part one of a two-parter we're calling Screen Time. This episode, we're looking at the way we interact with our screens and how those interactions might be changing us. So think about the human brain. From a very early age, our brain responds to and is shaped by what we see and what we hear. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: This idea has been studied by a lot of scientists, including this one. DIMITRI CHRISTAKIS: My name's Dimitri Christakis. I'm a pediatrician and epidemiologist and a parent of two teenagers. RAZ: And a few years ago, Dimitri did a study on newborn babies just a day old. And he played them music like this, Mozart. And then he would analyze their breathing. CHRISTAKIS: What we've learned is that babies, even at one day of age, will have discernible changes in the respiratory rate and their breathing depending on what they're hearing. RAZ: So a baby listening to this. . . CHRISTAKIS: You actually will see that their breathing pattern is slow and steady. RAZ: So, like, if you're listening to Mozart, it's like (breathing). CHRISTAKIS: That's about right. RAZ: But in contrast, he says. CHRISTAKIS: If you put on something that has a different - say, Stravinsky. . . (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) CHRISTAKIS: . . . With more minor chords. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) CHRISTAKIS: Their breathing pattern became more irregular and slightly faster. And then the very interesting thing was at the end of that segment of Stravinsky, we put Mozart back on. Then you see a return to the original breathing pattern. RAZ: They're like, that's more like it. CHRISTAKIS: (Laughter). (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) CHRISTAKIS: Now, that isn't to say that one source of music or another is preferable to the baby. RAZ: Yeah. CHRISTAKIS: But what we can say is that they are so attuned to their environment early on that they make such subtle distinctions, even on their very first day of life. RAZ: Now, the idea here is that the way our brains are stimulated matters, especially when we're young and our brains are being shaped by that stimulation. But for most kids, that stimulation is not Mozart. It's not Stravinsky. It's screen time - lots and lots of screen time. Here in the U. S. , for example, the typical preschool child spends about four and a half hours a day in front of the screen. And Dimitri has been researching what that means for those kids and for their future. Here's his TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) CHRISTAKIS: Now, we know from decades of research that too little stimulation early on is bad for brain development. But the question we've had at our lab for some time is, what about too much? Is it actually possible to over-stimulate the developing brain or, more appropriately, to inappropriately stimulate the developing brain in ways that are actually not beneficial but harmful? And this is important because we're technologizing childhood today in a way that's unprecedented. In 1970, the average age in which children began to watch television regularly was 4 years. And today, based on research that we've done, it's 4 months. It's not just how early they watch but how much they watch. The typical child before the age of 5 is watching about four and half hours of TV a day. That represents as much as 40 percent of their waking hours. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: I mean, all that screen time, presumably, is cutting down on how often kids are interacting, you know, in the real world. CHRISTAKIS: The simple truth is that we're all what they call digital immigrants. I mean, the incredible thing to me is our children who, if they were born five years ago, didn't know a world where an iPhone didn't exist. And they are digital natives. They don't know of a world that these things didn't exist in, and they're incredibly tethered to them. RAZ: I mean, they're kind of like guinea pigs because most of the way they communicate and see the world will happen through a screen. CHRISTAKIS: You're absolutely right. And, in fact, because I'm asked a lot by parents about the effects of all of these new technologies, what I have to share with them is the fact that science quite literally cannot keep up with the pace of technological advances. So we started studying the iPad and touch screen media about three years ago. We were probably among the first in the country to do it. And it takes a long time to get funding for research, and that's increasingly difficult. And then you have to conduct the experiment themselves and that takes time. And you have to analyze the data and so. . . RAZ: I mean, basically, we don't know. CHRISTAKIS: We know some things. I mean, I don't want to be entirely neolistic. We do know some things. But you're right. In many other ways, we're in the midst of a large uncontrolled experiment on the next generation of children. RAZ: One of those things scientists do know is that not all screens are created equal and not all content is either. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MISTER ROGERS' NEIGHBORHOOD\") FRED ROGERS: Hi, Aud (ph). AUD: Oh, hi, Fred. ROGERS: (Laughter) How are you? AUD: I'm fine, how are you. ROGERS: Good, thanks. I brought my television neighbor to see what a restaurant was like. AUD: Oh, I'm so glad. Can I show you to a table? ROGERS: Certainly. AUD: I'm awfully busy today. One of the waitresses is ill. ROGERS: I see. AUD: So I'm sort of doing double duty. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) CHRISTAKIS: Fred Rogers invented reality TV. (LAUGHTER) CHRISTAKIS: He's not credited with it. Actually, it's not reality, right? It's even slower-paced than reality. (LAUGHTER) CHRISTAKIS: The waitress says I'm awfully busy, but she doesn't seem the least bit hurried. (LAUGHTER) CHRISTAKIS: Now, I want to contrast that with \"The Powerpuff Girls Movie,\" the right mix of sugar and spice for a satisfying rush. I don't know how many of you have seen that, but here's a scene from that. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE POWERPUFF GIRLS MOVIE\") CHRISTAKIS: Again, you can see a lot of rapid sequencing. In fact, this was the first movie that was ever rated PG for nonstop, frenetic, animated action. (LAUGHTER) CHRISTAKIS: So you can see that there are very, very real differences in pacing. RAZ: Dimitri says we're just starting to understand how pacing in TV shows could affect the human brain but not just by studying humans. CHRISTAKIS: There are limits to the kinds of experiments that we can even do ethically, which is one of the reasons we started working with mice in the lab, if you can believe it, to try to develop models of media usage that can be studied more robustly. RAZ: You basically - you turn mice cages into TV lounges? CHRISTAKIS: TV lounges, yeah, that's right. That's a very nice way of putting it. RAZ: What it looks like and sounds like to spend your entire mousy childhood watching a big screen TV and what it could mean for us. That's coming up in just a minute. I'm Guy Raz. Stay with us, you're listening to the TED RADIO HOUR from NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: One the show today, Screen Time, a look at how all the screens in our lives are changing us. And just a minute ago, pediatrician and researcher Dimitri Christakis who studies screen time in kids was about to describe an experiment he did with mice. And these were young mice, about 10 days old. And for a month, what ends up being their entire childhood, Dimitri gives them free, unlimited TV. CHRISTAKIS: By having them listen to the cartoon channel and have photo rhythmically activated lights provide visual stimulation to go along with it. (SOUNDBITE OF UNIDENTIFIED TV SHOW) UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) And then that trio went to. . . RAZ: And this is what it's like - bright, multicolored, flashing lights six hours a day. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: This sounds like torture. CHRISTAKIS: It's interesting; when we look at their cortisol levels, there's no physiological signs that this is actually stressful to them. RAZ: Oh. CHRISTAKIS: But it is over stimulating their senses in much the same way television and other screen media do for young children's brains. RAZ: What Dimitri's mouse studies revealed is that the more the mice watched TV, the harder it became for those mice to learn and to stay attentive. So for example, they'd get confused by objects they'd actually seen before, objects they should've learned to recognize already. So when researchers followed up these mouse studies with similar studies in children, comparing kids who, say, watch a lot of \"Mister Rogers\" with kids who watch a lot of \"Powerpuff Girls\" - you can probably guess where this is going - they found pretty similar patterns. CHRISTAKIS: What you see is that educational programs like \"Mister Rogers\" pose no increased risk of attentional problems. Entertainment programs like \"The Powerpuff Girls\" increase the chances by about 60 percent. And violent programming, which I didn't show you, increases it even by more than 100 percent. And violent programs are typically even more rapidly sequenced. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: Do you find that your attention span has been affected since you've been a screen user? CHRISTAKIS: I do think that my attentional capacity has become somewhat diminished. Of course, maybe that has as much to do with aging as anything else. But I worry much more about my children that they are able to stay focused on a task. Many people believe that multitasking and fast-paced world is what we live in and children might as well learn to adapt to it early on. And I don't think that that's true. I certainly don't want people, whether they're CEOs of companies in the future, presidents of industry or even artists or writers, to not be able to stay focused on something. RAZ: Yeah. I remember when my younger son was 2 and we had a PBS program on TV. It was \"Sesame Street. \" And he walked up to the TV and he started swiping right. He just, like, took his finger across the TV. And he - it was just - he couldn't understand why it wasn't reacting to him because to him, like, a screen was this thing that you can just touch and make it do what you want it to do. CHRISTAKIS: That really has been a game changer in the last five years, these interactive screens. And it has given those of us that have researched children and screens real pause. But, you know, the one thing that a child never says - or never thinks if they're preverbal - when they interact with the typical passive media, is I did it. And even the best quality children's shows that tried to engage children, recognizing how important that was to their cognitive and social development, would ask rhetorical questions.

AMBER CASE: Sounds good. So then you can't pick up all the buzzes and I can't get distracted by my own screen while talking about screens. RAZ: Yeah, exactly. This is Amber Case. She's an anthropologist. Actually, to be precise - and this sounds a little weird, but just bear with me - Amber is a cyborg anthropologist. CASE: That's correct. There is a subfield of the anthropology of science which is the anthropology of cyborgs, and it looks at the relation between humans and technology - how technology affects culture and how things change over time. RAZ: And how technology is such a big part of our lives now. Because Amber says, to a certain extent, we are all becoming cyborgs. She explained that idea from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CASE: You're not Robocop and you're not Terminator, but you're cyborgs every time you look at a computer screen or use one of your cell phone devices. So what's a good definition for cyborg? Well, traditional definition is an organism to which endogenous components have been added for the purpose of adapting to new environments. That came from a 1960 paper on space travel. Because if you think about it, space is pretty awkward. People aren't supposed to be there. But humans are curious and they like to add things to their body so that they can go to the Alps one day and become a fish in the sea the next. So let's look at the concept of traditional anthropology. Somebody goes to another country, says, how fascinating these people are, how interesting their tools are, how curious their culture is. And then they write a paper and maybe a few other anthropologists read it. And we think it's very exotic. Well, what's happening is that we've suddenly found a new species. I, as a cyborg anthropologist, have suddenly said, oh wow, now suddenly now we're a new form of Homo sapiens, and look at these fascinating cultures and look at these curious rituals that everybody's doing around this technology. They're clicking on things and staring at screens. RAZ: In other words, our screens are just another tool in the long line of human inventions that have changed the way we live. So think of stone tools or bronze arrows or the knife. Those tools became so useful they were almost like extensions of our physical selves, almost like another limb. CASE: I mean, a hammer's really an extension of your fist. A knife is really an extension of your tooth. And you can actually make that device, so to speak, outside of yourself. And if it breaks you can just make a new one, whereas, say, if you're a saber-toothed tiger and your tooth breaks, you might not be able to eat something again, right? So having our devices outside of ourselves and being able to kind of switch them out depending on what we needed to do makes us incredibly versatile creatures. RAZ: And not that long after we invented physical tools to extend what our bodies could do, humans came up with mental tools to extend what our brains could. CASE: So we were able to paint on the side of a cave wall, and then that stores mental information outside of ourselves and that allows somebody else in the future to look at that and reabsorb the information back into their brain. RAZ: Yeah. CASE: Then we had papyrus, we had scrolls, paper, the printing press and it allowed for us to have an increase in the ability to take information outside of ourselves and allow somebody to download it back into their brain. But now you have Facebook and Twitter and all of these different social networks, and so we're just information, information, information. But I think that the phones and a lot of these social interfaces are becoming so personal because it's not just a phone - it's kind of a mental exoskeleton. It's an external part of your brain. RAZ: I mean, that's the thing, right? I mean, it isn't just a phone. I mean, through it you have access to an infinite set of ideas. CASE: Yeah, it's really a magic portal that allows you to go into another dimension of space and time. (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE MESSAGE ALERT)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Alert. Your FedEx package was delivered. Saturday, 2 p. m. CASE: I mean, literally you're going to different time zones. . . (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE MESSAGE ALERT)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Reminder. CASE: . . . With the click of a button.

(SOUNDBITE OF PHONE MESSAGE ALERT)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: What time are we meeting for dinner? UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Yep, got it. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: Happy birthday. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #4: Hey, have you left yet? CASE: . . . The people who've left you voicemail. . . UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #5: It's just Grammy. I just wanted to talk to you about something. CASE: . . . That you can't listen to because it's too noisy out. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #5: Nothing important or anything. CASE: You're on the side of the street and there's a truck driving by. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #5: Hope I get to see you then. CASE: I mean, really it's a mobile desktop, and one of the problems is that it really demands all of your attention instead of lets you be human. Like, your primary task as a human should be being human, but when this device demands all of your attention, it can interrupt other primary tasks. For instance, driving or just walking down the street. I mean, we saw the video of the guy who was walking down the street texting and ran into a bear. RAZ: That is, like, right there, the clash of the human dual reality, the imagined reality and the objective reality, right there on his iPhone and crashing into the bear. CASE: Right because walking down the street is often kind of a boring place, and so you can escape from it by going into a different type of place. This virtual reality that we have in our pockets has become often more real, or at least, attracting our attention more. So even though it makes you temporarily superhuman, it actually gets rid of a lot of the other sensory perception that you might need to rely on as an individual in society. RAZ: So if we've outsourced a part of our brain to the device in our pocket, now what? Cyborg anthropologist Amber Case returns in just a minute. Stay with us. I'm Guy Raz. This episode, \"Screen Time. \" You're listening to the TED RADIO HOUR from NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: It's the TED RADIO HOUR from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. Our show today, \"Screen Time: Part One. \" We're looking at how our interaction with screens is changing us, and we were just hearing from anthropologist Amber Case, who studies how our screens increasingly are extensions of ourselves. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CASE: And because of that, you have a second self. RAZ: Here's more from her TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CASE: Whether you like it or not, you're starting to show up online and people are interacting with your second self when you're not there. And suddenly, we have to start to maintain our second self. You have to present yourself in digital life in a similar way that you would in your analog life. So in the same way that you wake up, take a shower and get dressed, you have to learn to do that for your digital self. And the problem is that a lot of people now, especially adolescents, have to go through two adolescences. They have to go through their primary one that's already awkward, and then they have to go through their second self's adolescence. And that's even more awkward because there's an actual kind of history of what they've gone through online. And so what happens is, when we bring all of that into the social space, we end up checking our phones all the time. So we have this sort of thing called ambient intimacy. It's not that we're always connected to everybody, but at any time, we can connect to anyone we want. And so there are some psychological effects that happen with this. What I'm really worried about is that people aren't taking time for mental reflection anymore and that they aren't slowing down and stopping, being around all those people in the room all the time that are trying to compete for their attention. They're not just sitting there. And really, when you have no external input, that is the time when there's a creation of self, when you can try and figure out who you really are. And then once you do that, you can figure out how to present your second self in a legitimate way instead of just dealing with everything as it comes in and, oh, I have to do this, I have to do this and I have to do this. RAZ: Yeah, I mean, I feel like it's also affecting - like, I lose my mind if I'm in a line and for some reason I don't have my smartphone with me. You know what I mean? Have you experienced that? CASE: I experience that all the time. Now, the issue is that a lot of people are using their phone in a supermarket checkout line because as a human in an industrial society, they're put on pause. And the thing that reconnects them to some sort of humanity is to take out their phone. You see people using phones a lot in non-places - something that you don't have any relation or history or identity in. And the phone itself has more relation, history and identity to you than an airport, for instance, or a highway. So you often find people using their phones in these kind of inhuman places in order to get back some of that humanity that's been put on pause. RAZ: So what do you do? I mean, how do you get away from all that? CASE: I like to go on road trips because it's - I like to go on road trips and bring paper maps and turn off my phone because I am forced to be with myself, forced to talk to the person next to me and look outside. It feels really nice afterwards, like when you're a kid and you have to experience real time. Like, you feel like you're a little bit more real again. RAZ: Amber Case, she's a cyborg anthropologist.

So in the same way that you wake up, take a shower and get dressed, you have to learn to do that for your digital self. And the problem is that a lot of people now, especially adolescents, have to go through two adolescences. They have to go through their primary one that's already awkward, and then they have to go through their second self's adolescence. And that's even more awkward because there's an actual kind of history of what they've gone through online. And so what happens is, when we bring all of that into the social space, we end up checking our phones all the time. So we have this sort of thing called ambient intimacy. It's not that we're always connected to everybody, but at any time, we can connect to anyone we want. And so there are some psychological effects that happen with this. What I'm really worried about is that people aren't taking time for mental reflection anymore and that they aren't slowing down and stopping, being around all those people in the room all the time that are trying to compete for their attention. They're not just sitting there. And really, when you have no external input, that is the time when there's a creation of self, when you can try and figure out who you really are. And then once you do that, you can figure out how to present your second self in a legitimate way instead of just dealing with everything as it comes in and, oh, I have to do this, I have to do this and I have to do this. RAZ: Yeah, I mean, I feel like it's also affecting - like, I lose my mind if I'm in a line and for some reason I don't have my smartphone with me. You know what I mean? Have you experienced that? CASE: I experience that all the time. Now, the issue is that a lot of people are using their phone in a supermarket checkout line because as a human in an industrial society, they're put on pause. And the thing that reconnects them to some sort of humanity is to take out their phone. You see people using phones a lot in non-places - something that you don't have any relation or history or identity in. And the phone itself has more relation, history and identity to you than an airport, for instance, or a highway. So you often find people using their phones in these kind of inhuman places in order to get back some of that humanity that's been put on pause. RAZ: So what do you do? I mean, how do you get away from all that? CASE: I like to go on road trips because it's - I like to go on road trips and bring paper maps and turn off my phone because I am forced to be with myself, forced to talk to the person next to me and look outside. It feels really nice afterwards, like when you're a kid and you have to experience real time. Like, you feel like you're a little bit more real again. RAZ: Amber Case, she's a cyborg anthropologist.

But moving from Ireland to Chicago, that's like relocating to another planet. MICHAEL W. CLUNE: I had a very difficult time fitting in when I started elementary school. I had an Irish accent. I wore Irish clothes, Irish fashions. And so learning to deal with other people was a real challenge, one that left me feeling isolated quite a bit. RATH: That's Michael W. Clune. For him, school was cliques and bullies. Home was a refuge for a while until his parents started fighting. CLUNE: When I was 12, my parents divorced, and so the safety net of my childhood, the aspect of my childhood that really was a warm and safe environment shattered at that moment. So that's the basic arc, and it's one, I think, that's shared by, you know, many people who grew up when I did. It's a story that if you just reduce it to bare outlines, you know, it sounds quite stereotypical. RATH: And like many kids who grew up in the '80s, Clune sought refuge in video games. But here's where the stereotype breaks down. He wasn't obsessed with \"Pac-Man\" or \"Mario Bros. \" Clune found his joy in role-playing games like \"Bard's Tale\" and \"Ultima III\"; fantasy worlds with orcs and dragons, spaceships and robots, where hand-eye coordination takes a backseat to thinking and character development. CLUNE: When I sat down to write this book, I really wanted to tell the story of my childhood. But because so much of the stories we tell about our lives involve our relations with other people and because my relations with other people were so complex, I was really - didn't know how to tell that story. And I finally got the idea while I was playing a lot of these games - let me try to explain my childhood or just explore childhood through the lens of these different games. And so in a strange way, my interactions with the games provided a template for my interactions with my childhood friends, family and so forth. RATH: The story of your socialization in this book, it's pretty sad. You're a pretty lonely kid. I mean, do you think that the life that you lived in video games was to the detriment of your social life as a middle schooler? CLUNE: My mother told me early when I was young that what's most meaningful in life are the relations you have with other people. In this book, what I really wanted to explore was the part of life we have - the part of life we live when we're not with other people, the part when we're alone. There's the cliche that we're born and we die alone, and I take that quite seriously. And I believe that our most powerful and profound experiences in many ways are solitary experiences. And I believe the computer games, like literature and like some other devices in my life, were a means of training me for that kind of solitude. RATH: You have another memoir that's been very highly praised, and that was about your battle with heroin addiction. CLUNE: That's right. RATH: This is going to seem awfully glib. Forgive me for asking this, but it's natural to ask if there's some - something in common between addiction and this kind of relationship with videogames you describe in this book. CLUNE: I believe that heroin addiction, for me, and drug addiction was the absolute opposite of the experience I had when playing games. Addiction removes you from any worlds. It present - it completely - it isolates you, but not - it doesn't give you - your isolation has none of the richness of the solitude that I experienced in games. With addiction, I was continually like a rat in a maze trying to capture the very first time I ever had that first hit. With games, the first time I played them was very difficult and awkward. Only gradually, when I mastered their commands, was I able to inhabit that world. And so if with addiction I was trying to continually recapture a first time I never, with games I was exploring a world and exploring myself in a way that I found meaningful, whereas I felt addiction strips my life of all meaning. RATH: There's a reference in the book to you playing games as an adult and also getting kind of absorbed in them. Do you still play, are they still - you still get a kick out of them? CLUNE: I absolutely do. And I'll tell you a story. When I got clean from heroin, which was 14 years ago, I did not play any games for three years. I believe that there may well be a connection between games and addictions, so I stayed away from them. And then I accidentally, more or less, started playing a game about three years after I'd been clean. And it was the best decision I ever made. RATH: What was the game? CLUNE: The game was called \"Call Of Duty. \" It was a sort of World War II or one of these World War II games. And I started playing it, and I was just completely enraptured. And I felt this, you know, sort of feeling of joy and connection, but it wasn't like with addiction. I didn't find myself compulsive. I've never played games for more than an hour or two a day. They've never interfered with my work or my relationship with my significant other or anything like that. They've just been really enriching. So I continue to play games an hour or two a day at this moment. RATH: Michael W. Clune's new book is called \"Game Life. \" It is out this Tuesday. Michael, it's been a real pleasure speaking with you. Thank you. CLUNE: Thank you so much. ARUN RATH, HOST:  As a little kid, moving from one town to another can be difficult.

And this is fully in the wheelhouse of Scott Detrow. He covers campaign tech for us. Scott, welcome back. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Thanks for having me. CORNISH: All right, so debates have been watercooler moments for ages. Social media makes a difference in what way? DETROW: Well, these things have become a lot more interactive. A lot of people watch these debates with their computers out, with their phones out, and they're tweeting and on Facebook the whole time. So they've kind of become tentpole moments for campaigns - something to organize their message around. And they're using this event - as it comes up, as it happens, afterwards - to raise money, to gather information - you know, names, email addresses, social media profiles of likely supporters and also trying to raise their candidates profile and generate some buzz. CORNISH: So they probably want to go viral in a good way - right? - (laughter) in a good way. How do the campaigns go about doing that? DETROW: Well, this has become kind of a near-instantaneous process now. Last month, during the first debate, campaigns were taking moments and instantly repackaging them and pushing them out on their social media platforms. You know, one example - Governor Chris Christie and Senator Rand Paul had a very heated exchange about national security. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CHRIS CHRISTIE: That's a completely ridiculous answer. I want to collect more records from terrorists but less records from other people. How are you supposed to know, Megyn? RAND PAUL: Use the 4th Amendment. CHRISTIE: What're you supposed to - how're you supposed to. . . PAUL: Use the 4th Amendment. CHRISTIE: No. I'll tell you how - look. PAUL: Get a warrant. DETROW: Minutes after this exchange ended, both campaigns had taken the video, uploaded it and were pushing it out on Twitter, on Facebook and using it to try and instantly create that momentum and keep it going. You know, in previous cycles, what soundbites became viral or notable - it was kind of a passive process as far as the campaigns were concerned. Now you see much more of an active attempt to create momentum right away. CORNISH: And of course, they're trying to do it on social media networks like Facebook and Twitter. Are they getting any better at it? DETROW: They have. Campaigns have always been able to target their ads in posts to specific audiences even before this was all online. But that targeting has gotten a lot more advanced even since the last election. Campaigns can target these posts to people by location, age gender. Some campaigns even pay to put their tweets in front of specific reporters who are covering events. And Twitter recently rolled out an advertising feature. It says it can identify who's watching and reacting to specific big events or TV programs. And they do that based on the content and context of users' tweets. CORNISH: You know, you can want buzz. That doesn't mean you're going to get buzz, right? DETROW: Right. CORNISH: Many candidates are learning that right now. Do they really think, say, a Facebook video's going to win them votes? DETROW: I think they're hoping that it can get them noticed. You know, there's 16 Republicans trying to be president right now. It's a fight even get on the campaign stage, let alone be the person who stands out. So they're doing everything they can to try and manufacture that moment of buzz. But you're right. Sometimes it doesn't work.

It relies on layers of computers all over the world to hide the identity of its users. A public library in Lebanon, N. H. , recently added one of its servers to the Tor network. It's believed to be the first U. S. Public Library to do so. Peter Biello of New Hampshire Public Radio sent this report on the local reaction to that move. UNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: (Chanting) Privacy matters. Privacy matters. PETER BIELLO, BYLINE: Outside the Lebanon Public Library yesterday, a group of children held up signs and shouted at passing cars. Their parents and other protesters nearby gathered with the same message. Public libraries should host a Tor relay. About 40 people gathered in the library's basement. ALISON MACRINA: I'm going to tell you a little bit about what Tor does and who uses it and why libraries are the right location for it. So. . . BIELLO: Alison Macrina is with the Library Freedom Project, a group that promotes intellectual freedom at libraries. She says Tor is essentially a web browser, but it's not like the one that came with your PC. MACRINA: Tor works by bouncing your traffic to a network of relays, which is what we asked Kilton Library to run back in July. BIELLO: That made the library one link in the Tor chain. The more links there are worldwide, the stronger the network. After the Kilton Library's relay node went live this summer, the Department of Homeland Security raised concerns with local police. DHS spokesman Shawn Neudauer says while Tor is legal, it enables illegal activity. SHAWN NEUDAUER: Where you would get in trouble is if you're going to use it for illegal purposes such as trading in child pornography or using it to sell drugs or buy drugs. BIELLO: Neudauer says DHS didn't tell library officials to shut off the relay, but they did anyway. Support for the Tor relay at last night's meeting was universal among those who spoke up. They wanted it turned back on because of its legal uses. They argue that Tor can help victims of domestic abuse or people living under oppressive regimes communicate without being monitored. When the library's board decided to turn the relay node back on, everybody cheered. (APPLAUSE)BIELLO: Lee Sussman says he's proud of his town.

BIELLO: Alison Macrina says this decision is a big public statement about freedom. MACRINA: We think that this is going to engender even more support, even more relays. And Kilton is standing at the top of that pyramid, so we're just totally thrilled by this. BIELLO: Both library board members and attendees said they understood the good and bad parts of Tor. But the potential good was too important to ignore. Lebanon's IT librarian, Chuck McAndrew. CHUCK MCANDREW: We know that a lack of privacy and surveillance has a chilling effect on intellectual freedom. We care about the right to read, and in today's digital era, the right to read doesn't just mean physical books on our shelves.

LEAHY: These are ads for daily fantasy websites. This is a new form of fantasy football. They're encouraging you to play an imaginary game and bet real money on the performance of different players. And I want to tell you about this because this has become a big business, and pro sports leagues themselves have become invested in it. INSKEEP: When you say big business, how much money we talking about here? LEAHY: So we're talking about two companies that have become big players. Each says it's raised hundreds of millions of dollars in venture capital funding. They're giving away millions of dollars in prize money, and they're spending hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising. INSKEEP: Kevin, can I mention fantasy sports have been around for a long time? My brother plays them. This doesn't sound that new. LEAHY: Yeah, fantasy sports, in general, has been around. Even before the Internet, people used to grit it out on paper. And traditionally, they would do this among a group of friends or coworkers. And you draft your own team, you pretend that your team includes Andrew Luck or Marshawn Lynch, and then based on how those players do, you accumulate points, and you go head to head with your friend each week. INSKEEP: Oh, I might have players from seven or eight or 10 different NFL teams and pretend they're all on my team. OK. LEAHY: Yes, and you might put a little money on the outcome. INSKEEP: But if this is something people can do among themselves, how are big companies getting in on the action? LEAHY: These websites want to change the way that you play fantasy football. They want you to play a contest not throughout a whole year but over a course of a day or a week or a few hours at a time. And the prize pools are huge. Every weekend, one of these companies, DraftKings, holds a millionaire maker tournament. It's $20 to enter. The company takes a little bit of that entry fee, and you can win a $2 million grand prize. So this is drawing in a lot of people who have played this traditional season-long version of this game. I wanted to talk to one of them, and I reached John Reidy from Denver, Colo. JOHN REIDY: It's just one of those things that if you're already into fantasy sports, you will get hooked immediately because you get to pick something new every week. And I know that's what the commercials say, but it's really true. LEAHY: He had money on the line this past Monday when the Minnesota Vikings played the San Francisco 49ers. But it was not money on the outcome of the game or the point spread. Instead, it's based on how one individual player performs versus how another individual player performs. So we asked John to do some play-by-play of his fantasy game, and I thought we needed a little NFL Films music to kick this off. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)REIDY: So here's one thing I'm sweating out in the late game. I have Adrian Peterson, which I'm not thrilled about, don't really like him as a person, but he's a great fantasy asset. The person that is closest to me in this small tournament has Carlos Hyde. There's 7-point difference. If Carlos Hyde has a better game than Adrian Peterson, then I will probably lose. (SOUNDBITE OF FOOTBALL GAME)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #5: Carlos Hyde, little penetration, boom, another spin move. We've seen power. We've seen acceleration by Carlos Hyde. Welcome to the NFL with Carlos Hyde. REIDY: And I lost, burned by Carlos Hyde, right at the end there. Very frustrating, but the beauty of it is that I can try again next week. LEAHY: And you heard him say next week. That's really the key here. That's the way these companies market themselves, instant cash, instant gratification. INSKEEP: And if you lose, you try again. LEAHY: Yeah. INSKEEP: There must also be some cash and gratification for the companies involved. LEAHY: Yes, I talked to John Ourand. He's media reporter with Sports Business Daily. And he told me DraftKings and FanDuel, the two biggest companies in this market, have spent $500 million on ads on the TV networks this year. JOHN OURAND: That's half a billion dollars from two companies that didn't even exist five years ago. That's unbelievable. LEAHY: So I was wondering how they had all this money for marketing. And here's the thing. Now they're raising venture capital from a lot of names that you might know. OURAND: If you take a look at the list of investors - and let's just say FanDuel - you have the NBA, Google Capital. You have Time Warner, Turner Sports, NBC Sports, Comcast. DraftKings, if you take a look at the sponsorship deals that they've signed with individual teams, you have the Cowboys or the Patriots, the Broncos. And their investors are another's who's who. You have MLB, the NHL, MLS, Major League Soccer. You have big, blue-chip media companies and sports leagues investing in these two companies because they see a lot of potential in daily fantasy. INSKEEP: Woah, woah, woah, so sports leagues and teams, which have long opposed legalizing gambling on sports in any form, are investing in these companies through which people bet. Is this gambling? LEAHY: You are putting up real cash, and you're winning or losing that cash based on how your players perform against another set of players spread throughout several teams. Legally, it's not considered gambling. I called Nigel Eccles. He's the CEO and co-founder of FanDuel, and he said it's a game of skill, not a game of chance. Part of the reason he was able to invent this whole industry is because an exemption in a 2006 law regulating online gambling. NIGEL ECCLES: When Congress sat down to consider what was legal and what was illegal, they clearly made a distinction that fantasy sports was legal. LEAHY: That's true, but here's the thing. When that law was passed in 2006, daily fantasy sports did not exist yet. And now they're big business, but the law is the same. INSKEEP: Well, does the CEO feel at all creepy about taking investments from sports leagues so that people can put money on the line in this way? LEAHY: I asked him about this. ECCLES: No. Really from the start, we felt that it was important that we got to the point where we could have a dialogue with the league. I always felt good that once you understood that this was a really fantasy sports for the next generation that they would get on board with it. And so at a lot of ways, I really thought that it was just a matter of time. INSKEEP: OK, that's what he says, but could fantasy sports betting motivate someone to try to corrupt a real game because they've put a lot of money on the line? LEAHY: And this is what the leagues refer to as the integrity of the game. This would be much harder to pull off in fantasy sports. There's just so many more moving pieces. You've got several players over several different games. You might not know what your opponent's lineup is going to look like. So the league's clearly aren't very worried about the possibility someone might fix a game due to fantasy. INSKEEP: Well, with that said, what makes the leagues willing to run that risk, however small it might be, or even to run the risk of an appearance of some conflict here? LEAHY: Well, I think the leagues know that fantasy players, and especially daily fantasy players, are more engaged than your average fan, and they're also going to watch games that they might not otherwise care about. I don't really have a team that I'm a diehard fan of, but if I have a little money riding on a game, I might be tuning in when I would otherwise be doing something else. INSKEEP: Well, Kevin Leahy, good luck this Sunday. LEAHY: Thank you. INSKEEP: That's MORNING EDITION producer Kevin Leahy. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  We have a story this morning about something stuck in the head of MORNING EDITION producer Kevin Leahy who's with us. Kevin, what is it? KEVIN LEAHY, BYLINE: Steve, it's an ad. Actually, it's a whole bunch of ads, and I hear them all the time, and I think probably a lot of people are hearing them now, especially now that football season has begun. (SOUNDBITE OF ADS) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: On FanDuel, I've won over $62,000. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Try FanDuel today, and we'll match. . . UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: This is DraftKings.

Kate Coyer is with the Center for Media, Data and Society at Central European University in Budapest. KATE COYER: One of the most frustrating things among everything that refugees are facing is the total chaos and confusion about where they're are able to enter, when they're able to enter, when these borders are getting closed, how much the system is changing and the lack of reliable information that people actually have on the ground there. RATH: Coyer has lived in Hungary for seven years, and she's working with digital rights activists to give migrants and refugees better access to information. COYER: Like so many people in Budapest, I was incredibly moved by what was unfolding. And I just couldn't help but observe how many people did have smart phones and how they were trying to charge their phones, trying to find Wi-Fi access. So we bought some 3G mobile hotspots, which, you know, they're smaller than most cell phones, and you load them with the Sim Card, put some data on there, and you can be a walking hotspot. And so you can provide free, open Wi-Fi networks just from having this little device in your pocket or in your bag. Providing internet access was actually easier than trying to provide the capacity for people to charge their phones. Eventually after a couple days, we were able to set up a small booth with some portable battery packs with some USB ends that you could just have people charging their phones there. RATH: So let's talk about how this technology affects the way a refugee crisis happens in 2015. When the migrants are en route, what kind of mobile sites and apps are they using? COYER: I would say first and foremost, people are using communication apps. They're using things like Viber, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Skype. And then I would also add that GPS navigation and Google Maps have been absolutely critical. I met a family from Syria, and they were really anxious about getting on the buses that the Hungarian government was providing. There was a real lack of trust. And so for them, they would rather walk the 120 miles from the border of Serbia to Budapest. And so GPS navigation was the way that they were able to get from one point to another. RATH: Once refugees arrive, local governments and NGOs are trying to make information available to them via app as well, right? COYER: There's definitely some really useful apps that are being created that have information, that have routes in different languages. I just saw something yesterday that had been produced, which was a map that showed some of the known landmines in Croatia and Serbia now that people are being pushed to go through different borders, and that is potentially life-saving information. RATH: Wow. Kate, are you surprised by any of the communication trends you're seeing? Are people using social media or mobile technology in new ways in this crisis? COYER: There is something really distinctive going on with the way that people are able to navigate for themselves more than they would have been able to do in the past. I also think that the smart phone usage is also transforming the way that aid is being delivered. There's a lot of sharing of very explicit information about what donations are needed where, so that a lot of the humanitarian aid and individual donations are really being targeted in ways that, I think, are making some of the aid more effective. I do also think it's important to remember that no single app or technology can give refugees what they most need, which is a safe place to live. But if technology can play a role in making those journeys a bit less precarious and harrowing and help refugees stay connected and have access to reliable and up-to-date information, then they're worth investing in. RATH: Kate Coyer is a professor at the Center for Media, Data and Society at Central European University. Kate, thank you very much. COYER: Thank you so much for having me.

Online gambling - or iGaming, as it's now called - is legal in those states, and the industry may be poised to grow. Several states are considering legalizing it, and now you can ante up using PayPal. Joining me is Sue Schneider. She's editor-at-large for Gaming Law Review and Economics, and she's been an advocate for iGaming since 1995 back when it was known as Internet gambling. Welcome to the show. SUE SCHNEIDER: Thank you. MCEVERS: Paypal's announced that they're now going to allow people to gamble online. Can you explain how important is it that that's going to happen? SCHNEIDER: It is a significant thing here. In the late '90s, this was really the predominant iGaming market. And then with a congressional ban on Internet gambling, particularly through the financial transactions in 2006, that's when you saw things really clamped down on any kind of iGaming in the U. S. So the fact that there are now three licensed states and additional ones considering it and the likes of PayPal getting back into it, it's just signaling some potential for growth in the market here. MCEVERS: Do you feel like PayPal being involved also gives some kind of legitimacy to gaming now? People might be a little less, you know, furtive or shy about doing it online? SCHNEIDER: I think that also helps. You know, it's a situation where because of law enforcement actions, because of offshore operators, people never really knew if they were going to get their money out. So the fact that there are licensed jurisdictions and you see the likes of PayPal does give it more credibility. MCEVERS: I mean, there are opponents to iGaming still though. I mean, there's a bill that's currently in committee in Congress to stop all of iGaming, you know, to restore long-standing U. S. policy that the Wire Act prohibits all forms of Internet gambling. SCHNEIDER: Actually, the irony of that particular piece of legislation is that the proponent behind it is Sheldon Adelson, who owns The Venetian and The Sands in Las Vegas and many operations throughout the U. S. as well as internationally. There are many, many people who feel like he's being a little disingenuous about it because he's apparently doing it, by his statement, that he's trying to keep young people out of Internet gambling. But the controls that are in place for age verification and geolocation to make sure you're in the state where it's legal are much more advanced than, I think, most people give it credit for. MCEVERS: But I mean, some of the other big casinos are actually part of the iGaming industry. Is that right? SCHNEIDER: Yes. You know, if you look at companies like MGM Grand and some of those, they either have been in it, are in now or are looking to enter. You know, they struggle to try to bring millennials and younger players into their casinos, so they realize that this is something that's going to blossom in the future. MCEVERS: I mean, you talk about sort of the business reasons that people have for opposing online gaming. But, you know, there are people who have moral oppositions to it. Well, I mean, it's making it easier basically for people to lose their house if they, you know, play irresponsibly. SCHNEIDER: The moral arguments are something that there's not really a lot that you can say about that. There are opponents out there - Senator Kyl, who's no longer there - was big on, you know, click the mouse; lose your house. MCEVERS: That's Senator Jon Kyl from Arizona. SCHNEIDER: But there are safety measures that can take place in iGaming. There can be loss limits to help protect people against over gambling. There are a variety of controls that can be put in place through electronic means that are actually even more effective than they are in the land-based world. You know, it ultimately gets into a sort of a libertarian argument that if somebody chooses to use their entertainment dollars doing this rather than going to a movie or going to a bar or whatever, should they be allowed to do that?

MCEVERS: I mean, you talk about sort of the business reasons that people have for opposing online gaming. But, you know, there are people who have moral oppositions to it. Well, I mean, it's making it easier basically for people to lose their house if they, you know, play irresponsibly. SCHNEIDER: The moral arguments are something that there's not really a lot that you can say about that. There are opponents out there - Senator Kyl, who's no longer there - was big on, you know, click the mouse; lose your house. MCEVERS: That's Senator Jon Kyl from Arizona. SCHNEIDER: But there are safety measures that can take place in iGaming. There can be loss limits to help protect people against over gambling. There are a variety of controls that can be put in place through electronic means that are actually even more effective than they are in the land-based world. You know, it ultimately gets into a sort of a libertarian argument that if somebody chooses to use their entertainment dollars doing this rather than going to a movie or going to a bar or whatever, should they be allowed to do that? MCEVERS: Sue Schneider - she's the editor-at-large for Gaming Law Review in Economics. Thank you so much. SCHNEIDER: Thank you.", "section": "Technology", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2015 NPR.

That's the debate right now. Apple has weighed in. It now offers ad-blocker apps. Critics say these apps undermine fair business practices. To talk about this, I'm joined by NPR tech reporter Aarti Shahani. And, Aarti, tell us about this decision by Apple. What happened? AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: Well, Apple made a little change that was actually a very big change. With the release of the latest iPhone operating system, iOS 9, Apple said they'd allow ad-blocker apps to be sold in their store. Ad-blockers have already gained a lot of traction on desktops, especially with people who play games online, for example. But it's pretty new to smartphones. So developers heard the call and made some blockers, put them in the market, and they sold a whole lot. In a couple days, apps with names like Purify and Crystal became best-sellers in the App Store. MCEVERS: Oh, OK. So that means consumers like it. I mean, they're responding, and the market is speaking. So what's the problem? SHAHANI: Well, a lot of Internet businesses that we use and rely on every day - they use a so-called freemium model. You pay nothing for an app, but in turn, you're giving your data and/or your eyeballs to advertisers. That's how Google and Facebook work, and it's not how Apple works. And investors at internet companies say mobile advertising is this huge market. One very well-known investor says it's probably worth $25 billion. MCEVERS: Wow. SHAHANI: So if suddenly everyone blocks the ads that are the main source of revenue for companies, companies can't make payroll. They can't develop new tools that we all love, et cetera, et cetera. A writer for the popular blog called \"The Awl\" points it out that if ad-blocking becomes ubiquitous, it would just devastate, you know, just about every professional publication on the Internet. MCEVERS: Right. People who can write articles and get paid for them, right? SHAHANI: That's right. MCEVERS: Yeah. So what are the critics saying, I mean, stop all ad-blocking? SHAHANI: Well, it's more nuanced than that. I mean, this controversy is opening up a bigger conversation about good ads and bad ads. Bad ads, some would argue, are ones that trick you into clicking - make you think you're running an antivirus scan, but really, you're just being redirected to a shopping site or ads that eat up your bandwidth. The company AdBlock Plus, you know, which has skin in the game - they're an ad-blocker - they have a short list for good ads. They say ads should be static, stuff without animation or sound suddenly blaring into your ears, and they should be marked clearly as advertisements. One ad-blocker company decided to pull their app from the Apple Store because they felt they were blocking good ads unfairly and that an all-or-nothing approach isn't OK. MCEVERS: And one more piece of news we should touch on really quickly are - we're seeing news reports that Apple is removing hundreds of apps from its store. What's going on there? SHAHANI: Yeah. And you know, this has nothing to do with ad-blockers. It's a cybersecurity issue. It turns out that apps were infected with malicious software. According to the security firm Palo Alto networks, some malware found in popular Chinese apps could let an attacker steal usernames and passwords. So Apple's announced that it's going to be pulling a bunch of apps. MCEVERS: And that's NPR's Aarti Shahani. Aarti, thanks for joining us. SHAHANI: Thank you.

NPR's Aarti Shahani got to attend one of those meetings and, she reports, a whole lot got lost in translation. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: OK. We're going to start momentarily. AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: At the Microsoft Campus, Building 33, U. S. and Chinese leaders are talking past each other. Wu Hequan, chairman of the Internet Society of China, offers a rosy outlook. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)WU HEQUAN: (Through Interpreter) We have different cultures, but our ideals are the same. SHAHANI: Dean Garfield, president of the U. S. -based Information Technology Industry Coalition, is definitely not so rosy in his remarks. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DEAN GARFIELD: The collective collaboration between the United States and China is, let's say, suboptimal. SHAHANI: Over and over, the Chinese talk about the importance of trusting each other's intentions. The American side keeps sounding distrustful about how open China is or is not to U. S. companies about Chinese nepotism, about Chinese hackers. Again, Dean Garfield. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GARFIELD: If we're going to stick to our talking points and not address those issues, then why be here at all? SHAHANI: They're here because, as participants put it, the U. S. made the Internet, and China is now its biggest market. The cybersecurity tsar of China, a man named Lu Wei, steps to the mic and gives an impassioned speech with some talking points and a parable - a very colorful parable. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)LU WEI: (Through interpreter) Two men are on the same boat, and as they are sailing off, they encounter countless reefs they cannot see. This hardship brings them into a panic. They argue and blame each other. SHAHANI: A thunderstorm hits. The waves get higher. To survive, they need to lower the sails. One man cannot do it alone. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)LU: (Through interpreter) They face the same risk, so they stop all the quarreling. They work together to let down the sail. They arrive at dry land safely and become best friends. SHAHANI: The Chinese burst into applause. (APPLAUSE)SHAHANI: The Americans, less so. When the session ends, delegates from the U. S. and China head into closed-door meetings. Media are not allowed, but two delegates agree to talk with NPR. SPENCER RASCOFF: I think the American business community is a little bit skeptical. SHAHANI: That's Spencer Rascoff, CEO of the online real estate company, zillow. com. He won't get into who said what, but his overall feeling is American companies aren't getting a fair break despite Chinese officials promising reforms. RASCOFF: It's good to hear the Chinese government saying these things, but I'd like to see actions to back them up. SHAHANI: Chinese delegate Zhou Hanhua, a law professor at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences - he feels disappointed, too. The closed-door meetings were full of presentations, not real dialogue. He really wanted to ask his American counterparts. . . ZHOU HANHUA: How to regulate the Internet, especially considering the social media. ISIS used the Internet as the platform to promote the extremist views. SHAHANI: But Zhou's desire to control digital life couldn't be further from the American perspective. No matter the issue on the table, there's a deep cultural disconnect. If this summit is any indicator, it'll be hard for the U. S. and China to have the hard conversations.

We walked around Tomorrowland or rode on the WEDWay PeopleMover. Little electric cars pulled us around the park on overhead tracks. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: A real-life transit concept proposes to take that idea and make it so that individual riders can go wherever they want. It's our subject as we make transportation the focus of a new round of the NPR Cities Project. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Becoming a world-class city. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: We have to find a way to move people a lot more efficiently. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Come. Take a ride of the future. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Want to go for another ride? MONTAGNE: We have a vision for a revolutionary form of public transportation. It's under discussion in Greenville, S. C. , Austin, Texas and Santa Cruz, Calif. The only place in the U. S. that you can ride it now is on the campus of West Virginia University. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Come. Take a ride of the future. But this is not the future. This is the '70s. And you are riding PRT - PRT, personal rapid transit. INSKEEP: This is the '70s. That is a 38-year-old promotional video for the personal rapid transit system in Morgantown, W. V. Cars on a track make nonstop trips to their destinations. Just tell it where you're going, and you're off. PRT is a big idea. And since NPR's Joe Palca is all about big ideas, we asked him to investigate. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: I decided a good way to learn more about PRT was to go to Minneapolis. . . UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: (Over loudspeaker) Green line train to downtown Minneapolis is due in two minutes. PALCA: Where I could meet up with Mike Lester, CEO of Taxi 2000, a company that designs PRT systems. To get to my downtown meeting I took light rail, and my trip turned into an unexpected lesson in why PRT might be a good idea. Things went smoothly at first. But when we got to the West Bank Station, the train stopped and sat. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: (Over loudspeaker) Once again, I apologize for the delay. We are continuing to hold here at this station until further notice. PALCA: Apparently, a train up ahead had struck a car at an intersection. I'm running late for my appointment with Mike Lester. So I abandon the train and get in a cab. (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE RINGING)PALCA: Hello? It's Lester, asking if I'm OK. Hi, I'm fine. But (laughter) there was an accident on the green line. And I had to jump in a taxi to get over to you. The irony here is that one of the advantages of the PRT system Lester wants to build is that it runs on an elevated guideway. So it wouldn't run the risk of hitting cars or pedestrians. And there's the station. I asked Lester to meet me downtown so he could show me some of the advantages of PRT in a crowded urban setting. MIKE LESTER: One of the things I wanted to point out to you is - see the buses? PALCA: Yeah, a lot of buses. LESTER: Empty - but they still need to circulate. PALCA: Lester says in a PRT system, the pods only run when they have passengers. LESTER: One of the benefits of having an elevated system that only moves when somebody's paying is you're not in traffic. And you're not running empty buses. PALCA: Another advantage is the elevated guideway doesn't take up much space. He points to a lamp post. LESTER: That's the post we need, right? And then you come up with a 90 feet piece of guideway. And you set it on the post. PALCA: So you only need a post every 90 feet. And Lester says you can install a PRT system for about a quarter of the cost per mile of a light-rail system. Now, there are a multitude of studies, reports, assessments and reviews of the PRT concept. And many say PRT will relieve traffic congestion and move people efficiently. There have even been a few small systems built. There's one at Heathrow Airport Terminal 5, and there's one at Masdar City in Abu Dhabi. But these are the exceptions. For the most part, PRT has gone nowhere. This hasn't fazed Mike Lester. And he's eager to have me visit Taxi 2000's headquarters so I can see a concrete example of his vision for the future. Headquarters is off a busy road in a small industrial park in the Minneapolis suburb of Fridley. LESTER: This is where we have our full-size operating prototype. PALCA: And Lester wants me to go for a ride on it. To start, Lester hands me a laminated fare card. LESTER: You go up the stairs. There's a station platform when you get into the second level. PALCA: Waiting at the platform is a bright red, tiny pod-like car. LESTER: Walk up. Swipe your card. PALCA: OK. LESTER: And the door will open. PALCA: To the roof and the side just sort of slid back. And what I see is a three-passenger bench. I step in and sit down on the bench. A button over the front window says, go. So I'm going to press go. LESTER: Yes. PALCA: The door slides shut and latches. I'm moving. It's pretty smooth. It's not going very fast, but we're only going about 60 feet I think. And we've arrived. The door glides back, and I step out onto another platform. That's pretty cool. LESTER: There you are, 10 seconds into the future. PALCA: To be honest, I think riding in one of these automated pod cars to work would be kind of fun. So why has PRT failed to catch on? Ken Halverson is chief financial officer for Taxi 2000. He says the company has been getting a lot of inquiries lately. KEN HALVERSON: We've had 40 or 50 cities tell us they would love to be second. But you can't be second until someone steps up to be first. PALCA: Halverson says Greenville, S. C. is seriously considering going first. But they haven't yet figured out who's going to pay for it. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: (Over loudspeaker) Green line train to downtown Saint Paul is due in two minutes. PALCA: To find out why Minnesota never built a PRT system, I jumped back on the green line and headed over to Saint Paul to speak with Tom Sorel. He was formerly the state's commissioner of transportation. He says the state did consider PRT, but there was stiff opposition from backers of buses and light rail. And nothing was ever built. TOM SOREL: I think one of the challenges we've always had with PRT is there's no pot of money where this fits well. And that's just not in Minnesota. It's nationally as well. PALCA: There already are pots of tax money for things like buses and light rail. Sorel says the other problem facing PRT is that the picture of urban transit is changing. Uber and similar services are already here. Driverless cars aren't far off. Sorel wonders if PRT's time has come and gone. SOREL: Because the last thing you want to do is put up some track all over the place and then have it sit there. PALCA: The PRT system in West Virginia is still running. But it didn't kick start the revolution in rapid transit people had hoped for back in 1975. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Personal rapid transit, a ride of the future.

SOREL: Because the last thing you want to do is put up some track all over the place and then have it sit there. PALCA: The PRT system in West Virginia is still running. But it didn't kick start the revolution in rapid transit people had hoped for back in 1975. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Personal rapid transit, a ride of the future.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi flies to California this weekend to court and be courted by America's tech industry leaders. NPR's South Asia correspondent, Julie McCarthy, reports. JULIE MCCARTHY, BYLINE: In his second visit to the United States, India's social media-savvy prime minister meets Silicon Valley. Narendra Modi will hold a town hall with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, dine with Apple's Tim Cook and visit Tesla Energy, headed by electric car innovator Elon Musk. Modi wants the Valley's tech giants to help with his ambitious plan to expand the Internet to all Indians. Foreign Ministry spokesman Vikas Swarup. VIKAS SWARUP: So Prime Minister's visit to California is to see how we can tap into energy, the innovation and, above all, the genius of Silicon Valley and align it with India's own governmental priorities. MCCARTHY: Almost all of the big American technology firms have pioneers of Indian descent. (SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO)SUNDAR PICHAI: It's an honor to be welcoming Prime Minister Modi to Silicon Valley this coming weekend. MCCARTHY: Indian-born Google chief Sundar Pichai took to YouTube this week to say there was no more important role for tech companies today than to help connect India's next billion Internet users. Inexpensive smartphones have introduced millions of Indians to the Internet, and American tech companies looking for a piece of India's digital transformation could offer even cheaper devices, improved connectivity and finance startups in India. NEELAM DEO: What Mr. Modi's going to be trying to do is get a big infusion of investment. That will enable India to move up in the value chain. MCCARTHY: That's Neelam Deo, co-founder of the Mumbai-based think tank Gateway House. Deo cautions that the venture capitalists Modi hopes to woo would want to see market barriers come down, red tape cut as promised and regulations on startups relaxed. She notes the World Bank's ease of doing business index ranks India 142nd in the world. DEO: Mr. Modi is going to have to work hard at persuading corporations that things in India have changed completely - because they haven't. MCCARTHY: But one area that shows particular promise is banking. In India, nearly half of a population has no access to banking services, and mobile technology could drastically improve that. Senior IT executive Manish Sabbharwal says directly depositing welfare subsidies alone would reap huge savings. MANISH SABHARWAL: This innovation of financial inclusion and Silicon Valley and India working together is possibly a game changer for India. MCCARTHY: Thousands of Indian-Americans have clamored to be on hand in San Jose Monday to hear Modi speak, a man who, for many, embodies modernism in their ancient culture. Social entrepreneur Harish Hande says the lesson India needs to learn from Silicon Valley is that without risk there is no innovation. In the Bay Area, he says, 9 out of 10 companies will fail, and that's fine. HARISH HANDE: We are a very risk-averse country. In India, they want 9 out of 10 companies to succeed.

CHARLES LANE, BYLINE: Since the beginning of credit cards, merchants were never liable if a thief used a stolen or counterfeit credit card to shop. The bank issuing the card usually made both the customer and the store whole. But starting Thursday, a subtle shift happens. If retailers don't follow new procedures for credit card security, then they will have to pay for what the thieves steal. BOB GEREKE: It's another thing we have to deal with. You know, there's so many. And this one could be important. LANE: Bob Gereke owns Mud, Sweat and Tears, a pottery studio in New York City. He's pretty on top of all the changes. But he's still not ready. The new cards that are coming have a unique microchip inside that makes them really hard to forge. In Europe, these type of cards are already in widespread use. But in this country, the industry is way behind. To read chip-enabled cards, Gereke will need new equipment. He signed up for a reader earlier this year, but because of unprecedented demand, it won't arrive until December. He says this whole process is frustrating.

Holly Wade is director of policy for the National Federation of Independent Business. She says most businesses don't know this yet. HOLLY WADE: It's frightening for small business owners, thinking that they might be hit with higher costs, more liability in their business and not knowing what they need to do to comply.

For example, the new chip cards will not prevent theft from online retailers who won't be able to use the new readers to check out your card. Also, the new cards don't prevent hackers from stealing credit card data from the computer systems of big companies like Target and Home Depot. But defenders of the new cards say the chips will help a lot. Jason Oxman is CEO of the Electronic Transactions Association.

And then it would be re-punched in order to verify it. RAZ: The company would use math and statistics to model things like freight train schedules and bus routes and stock markets. SHIRLEY: So intellectually demanding that you got this wonderful sense of achievement. RAZ: And what Steve introduced back in the 1960s, aside from the idea that women could actually write code, was that it didn't necessarily matter where you did that work because Steve let the women who worked for her do it from home. SHIRLEY: We used to ask job applicants, do you have access to a telephone? RAZ: In those days, not everyone did. SHIRLEY: I had a party line, which is - sounds rather fun, but it meant that I shared my home telephone with some other poor soul. It was a different world. RAZ: And you were doing this before email, before fax machines, before Skype. SHIRLEY: Well, we did have the simple telephone, and we had the enthusiasm of women being offered something really exciting - not particularly well paid, to be honest, because we were living on a shoestring. But I think it made a lot of other organizations consider whether there were different models of getting work done. RAZ: Steve Shirley managed to build this company at a time when women in the U. K. couldn't even open a bank account without their husband's permission. Here's more of Steve Shirley's story from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SHIRLEY: Let me take you back to the early 1960s. Although women were then coming out of the universities with decent degrees, there was a glass ceiling to our progress. And I'd hit that glass ceiling too often and so started to challenge the conventions of the time, even to the extent of changing my name from Stephanie to Steve in my business development letters so as to get through the door before anyone realized that he was a she. (LAUGHTER)SHIRLEY: I recruited professionally qualified women who'd left the industry on marriage or when their first child was expected and structured them into a home-working organization. And we pioneered the concept of women going back into the workforce after a career break. We disguised the domestic and part-time nature of this stuff by offering fixed prices - one of the very first to do so. We pioneered all sorts of new flexible work methods - job shares, profit sharing - and eventually, the work came in. RAZ: So think of the drive - the chutzpah - this took, right, to have started a business on her dining room table. SHIRLEY: Well, I was described as aggressive and, you know, sort of, a man might be assertive or they'll have gravitas, but I was - I suppose I've always been a bit aggressive. RAZ: And yet, year after year, her company grew. SHIRLEY: So once it was known that I was hiring women to decent, part-time, flexible work opportunities, I had a flood of people coming in. RAZ: And Steve's team of women programmers were able to keep up with the growing demand through the '60s and '70s as more and more companies in the U. K. started to automate their work through computers. SHIRLEY: And it gradually got much more into systems work, business design, choosing equipments, contracts. I did work seven days a week. I did sleep occasionally. I did very little else. So the business began to take off. I love business, really. I mean, because most of my contemporaries are playing bridge or golf, and that's not me. RAZ: It just seems boring to you? SHIRLEY: Irrelevant. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SHIRLEY: When I started my company of women, the men sort of said, how interesting - because it only works because it's small. And later, as it became sizable, they sort of accepted, yes, it is sizable now, but of no strategic interest. And later, when it was a company valued at over $3 billion and I'd made 70 of the staff into millionaires, they sort of said, well-done, Steve. (LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)SHIRLEY: You can always tell ambitious women by the shape of our heads. They're flat on top for being patted patronizingly. (LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)RAZ: When you were at the company and sort of really building that business, what motivated you, what propelled you? SHIRLEY: Again, I think it was a lot of the sort of feminine thing that in having started a company, in no way was I going to fail. So even in the 1970s recession, where we nearly went out of business, I was so proud that women could do this, that in - somehow or other, we stuck in there. I mean, I feel I'm so lucky because I have done what is in me to do. RAZ: But sometimes the will to work hard grows from our hardest experiences, and, in Steve Shirley's case, from her childhood. She wasn't actually born in the U. K. And when she was just 5 years old, as a little girl in Austria, in 1934, the Nazis marched in to occupy her country. And suddenly, Jews like her were in danger. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SHIRLEY: All that I am stems from when I got onto a train in Vienna, part of the kinder transport that saved nearly 10,000 Jewish children from Nazi Europe. I was 5 years old, clutching the hand of my 9-year-old sister, and had very little idea as to what was going on. What is England and why am I going there? I was lucky, and doubly lucky, to be later reunited with my birth parents. But, sadly, I never bonded with them again. But I've done more in the seven decades since that miserable day when my mother put me on the train than I would ever have dreamed possible. I loved England, my adopted country, with a passion that perhaps only someone who has lost their human rights can feel. I decided to make mine a life that was worth saving, and then I just got on with it. RAZ: I mean, this idea that you went through life thinking, I need to make my life a life that was worth saving - that's a huge burden to carry. SHIRLEY: But other people have equal drive as, you know, the musician who is determined to finish up in Wigmore Hall, or the artist who starves in the garage because he's determined to make some wonderful sculpture that nobody else wants. But there's a passion involved in doing a really good, quality piece of work that's better than you've done ever before. This really gives a drive to the individual. It's what makes us human. Animals don't work. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SHIRLEY: It's one thing to have an idea for an enterprise, but as many people in this room will know, making it happen is a very difficult thing. And it demands, really, extraordinary energy, self-belief and determination, the courage to risk family and home, in a 24-by-seven commitment that borders on the obsessive. So it's just as well that I'm a workaholic. I believe in the beauty of work when we do it properly and in humility. Work is not just something I do when I'd rather be doing something else. So what has all that taught me? I learned that tomorrow's never going to be like today and certainly nothing like yesterday. And that made me able to cope with change - indeed, eventually, to welcome change. Though I'm told I'm still very difficult. Thank you very much. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: Dame Stephanie Shirley, or, as everyone calls her today, Steve Shirley. She did all these things, by the way, and raised a child with autism. Steve now spends her time and her considerable wealth on autism-related philanthropy. You can find out more about her and see her full talk at ted. com. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WHISTLE WHILE YOU WORK\")LOUIS ARMSTRONG: (Singing) Whistle while you work. (WHISTLING)ARMSTRONG: (Singing) Put on that grin and start right in to whistle loud and long. Just hum a merry tune. RAZ: Hey, thanks for listening to our show on the meaning of work this week. We'd love to hear from you. If you have any feedback, send us an email at tedradiohour@npr. org. You can follow us on Twitter. That's @TEDRadioHour. And you've been listening to ideas worth spreading, right here on the TED Radio Hour from NPR. GUY RAZ, HOST:   So if seeing results or finding meaning or working collaboratively are all reasons behind why we work, what happens when the entire deck is stacked against you, when it seems like every single force out there is discouraging you from trying? How do you find the motivation to try anyway? So maybe you've heard about the very low numbers of women employed by big tech companies - 16 percent of tech jobs at Microsoft held by women, at Twitter, it's 10 percent, at Google, 17. But when Steve Shirley started a tech company, 100 percent of her employees. . . STEVE SHIRLEY: Oh, yes, indeed. RAZ: . . . Were women. SHIRLEY: It was a very exciting period. RAZ: In fact, Steve Shirley will explain her name in a moment. Steve had vowed from the beginning. . . SHIRLEY: It was a crusade for women. RAZ: . . . That her company would only hire women. SHIRLEY: It was a burning mission to keep it on the road. RAZ: OK, so her name? SHIRLEY: Well, my name is Dame Stephanie Shirley, which sounds very grand. But way back in my past, I shortened my name from that. So really, I'm Steve Shirley. That's how I'm known. RAZ: Everybody calls you Steve? SHIRLEY: Everybody calls me Steve. RAZ: Signing your name Steve instead of Stephanie turned out to be an easier way to get your letters answered in the 1960s because that's when Steve Shirley, as she is still known today, brought work to thousands of women in the U. K. SHIRLEY: We were a very different sort of workplace. RAZ: OK, first, what Steve's company did. SHIRLEY: We would work with pencil and paper. RAZ: It was basically a software company. . . SHIRLEY: And then we would convert it into code. RAZ: . . . Before there were personal computers. SHIRLEY: Which would then be punched onto cards or paper tape.

So let's find out. The first mention of the technology we could find from this program was back in 1984. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: So we went to the archives to listen to a report from then science correspondent Ira Flatow. Here's a bit of it. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #1: I am very pleased to introduce our next guest for you. Today, Beautiful Betty (ph) will sing \"All Of Me. \"BEAUTIFUL BETTY: (Singing) All of me. Why not take all of me? Can't you see?

SIEGEL: Actually, I thought it was a pretty good Lawrence Welk for a robot, anyway. MCEVERS: Again, this was 1984, and Ira Flatow reported on possible uses for machine voices. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)FLATOW: If you want to leave messages for people now, what do you do? You have to call their homes. You have to call their secretaries. Sometimes you get their answering machines. You never know where your message is going to end up. But if you have a message system like the ADF system developed at IBM's Thomas Watson Research Center in Yorktown, N. Y. , you can do this. You dial the person's office. The computer gets on the line and says. . . COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #2: Please key press your last name. John Connor (ph) - please key press your password. MCEVERS: Sounds just like voicemail these days. SIEGEL: Ira's report on computer-generated voices makes clear the basics are still the basics. Each word is constructed by stacking up the building blocks of speech called phonemes. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)FLATOW: Let's synthesize a familiar phrase from scratch as they do at the Watson Research Center in Yorktown, N. Y. We'll begin with just the loudness and timing. Remember; this is just the loudness and timing. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #3: (Unintelligible). FLATOW: Sounds more like Morse code than a phrase. Now we'll add the overall pitch of the sentence. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #3: (Unintelligible). FLATOW: Now one of the most important factors - the resonance made by the vocal track. . . COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #3: (Unintelligible). FLATOW: . . . And some of the formants. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #3: To be or not to be? That is the question. FLATOW: Should be familiar by now. Incidentally, you may think you heard it say the word to or the T. But it didn't, says Thomas. JOHN THOMAS: Your brain did something called phoneme restoration, and you imagined that the ta (ph) was there, but it's really not. FLATOW: OK. Let's put the ta in there. That's a fricative, a hard sound. We'll add a little bit of nasalization. Your nose does influence the sound. And finally, you wind up with a phrase that even Shakespeare might recognize. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #3: To be or not to be? That is the question. SIEGEL: And the answer is that computer-generated speech was very much to be.

He took over the company last year, and ever since, he's been traveling the world, developing a big theory about how to change it. NPR's Aarti Shahani joined him for a day. AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: Before Satya Nadella takes his seat, he eyes my MacBook. I assume he's trying to cheat, have a look at the questions, but, no. SATYA NADELLA: No, no, I'm just looking at - oh, at least you have Excel. That's good. SHAHANI: Nadella has this mildly obsessive reflex to make sure every computer he sees has a trace of his company in it. He spots the Excel icon in my taskbar. Do you approve? NADELLA: It's always good to see icons that I recognize. SHAHANI: The attention to detail surprises me because by now, this man's brain should be total mush. He flew to four countries in four days - Chile, Brazil, Colombia and now Mexico. When you count the time difference. . . NADELLA: We've had these 28, 29-hour days. SHAHANI: Still, the thing he's most proud of. . . NADELLA: All four days, I was able to get up and make sure I was able to run. SHAHANI: CEO Nadella is 6 feet tall but not imposing. He's got a gentle handshake and unusual accessories. When I glance down to see what smartwatch he's wearing, I find instead, tied around each wrist, thin, cream-colored strings. NADELLA: People of the Arajocos community in Columbia, that's where I got these threads from. SHAHANI: An indigenous group from up in the mountains showed Nadella how they use Microsoft to preserve sacred texts on the Internet. And at this little nonprofit we're visiting, two hours outside Mexico City, people with tiny, cash-only businesses are learning to log sales with the help of Office. Nadella is not on a charitable mission for the Gates Foundation. He's scouting for profit. Now that smartphones and Internet access have become so universal, the next billion-dollar idea could come from anywhere. NADELLA: I'm here mostly to make sure that we are learning and we are doing things to drive our growth and participation. SHAHANI: Any CEO of a multinational thinks globally. It's in the job description. But to appreciate how distinct Satya Nadella's global may be, you need to meet the last guy who had his job. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)STEVE BALLMER: How much do you think this advanced operating environment is worth? SHAHANI: This is a completely overwhelming joke sales pitch from the 1980s by Steve Ballmer. When the former chief ran around the world, it was to meet with capital-I important people, Microsoft's big clients. Ballmer was an aggressive, let-me-tell-you-what-you-need kind of guy. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BALLMER: Five-hundred, a thousand? SHAHANI: Nadella has all the trappings of 21st-century CEO. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)NADELLA: Let me start here with a phone. It's actually an iPhone. It's not my phone, but it's an Iphone. SHAHANI: He's on stage trying to convince local developers to make apps for Microsoft, not just Apple or Google. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)NADELLA: I sometimes refer to this as an iPhone-Pro because it's got all of the Microsoft applications on it. (APPLAUSE)SHAHANI: He looks hip, wearing black slacks and a slim button-down shirt - no suit and tie. And one other thing that works for him, people in the audience, like Armando Delgadillo - they can't really make out what Nadella is, racially, ethnically speaking. ARMANDO DELGADILLO: No (laughter). (Through interpreter) No, he's Hindu I think. I'm not sure. I think he's Hindu. He's not the typical American. Satya seems different. SHAHANI: Nadella is different. He grew up in Hyderabad, a city in southern India. His father, it so happens, is far left of center, a Marxist economist, Nadella says. And Nadella's upbringing in a poor country, sometimes it shows. For example. . . NADELLA: There are companies that truly can contribute to the broader growth of the market that they are participating in versus just extracting rent. SHAHANI: Extracting rent, which typically means manipulating government officials to turn a bigger profit, that's a very popular term in the developing world. But by now, Nadella has spent more years at Microsoft than he ever spent back home. And he's adamant his work habits, his judgment, it's all an artifact of what he's learned in the U. S. NADELLA: I'm a story completely of the U. S. SHAHANI: The man he appointed as president of Microsoft disagrees completely and told me Nadella's upbringing outside the U. S. is central, a huge asset. It'll be interesting to see, as his travels continue, how the CEO's story about himself and his company evolves. Aarti Shahani, NPR News, Mexico City. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:  Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was in Mexico last week on a high-profile visit.

SHAHANI: Still, the thing he's most proud of. . . NADELLA: All four days, I was able to get up and make sure I was able to run. SHAHANI: CEO Nadella is 6 feet tall but not imposing. He's got a gentle handshake and unusual accessories. When I glance down to see what smartwatch he's wearing, I find instead, tied around each wrist, thin, cream-colored strings. NADELLA: People of the Arajocos community in Columbia, that's where I got these threads from. SHAHANI: An indigenous group from up in the mountains showed Nadella how they use Microsoft to preserve sacred texts on the Internet. And at this little nonprofit we're visiting, two hours outside Mexico City, people with tiny, cash-only businesses are learning to log sales with the help of Office. Nadella is not on a charitable mission for the Gates Foundation. He's scouting for profit. Now that smartphones and Internet access have become so universal, the next billion-dollar idea could come from anywhere. NADELLA: I'm here mostly to make sure that we are learning and we are doing things to drive our growth and participation. SHAHANI: Any CEO of a multinational thinks globally. It's in the job description. But to appreciate how distinct Satya Nadella's global may be, you need to meet the last guy who had his job. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) STEVE BALLMER: How much do you think this advanced operating environment is worth? SHAHANI: This is a completely overwhelming joke sales pitch from the 1980s by Steve Ballmer. When the former chief ran around the world, it was to meet with capital-I important people, Microsoft's big clients. Ballmer was an aggressive, let-me-tell-you-what-you-need kind of guy. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BALLMER: Five-hundred, a thousand? SHAHANI: Nadella has all the trappings of 21st-century CEO. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NADELLA: Let me start here with a phone. It's actually an iPhone. It's not my phone, but it's an Iphone. SHAHANI: He's on stage trying to convince local developers to make apps for Microsoft, not just Apple or Google. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NADELLA: I sometimes refer to this as an iPhone-Pro because it's got all of the Microsoft applications on it. (APPLAUSE) SHAHANI: He looks hip, wearing black slacks and a slim button-down shirt - no suit and tie. And one other thing that works for him, people in the audience, like Armando Delgadillo - they can't really make out what Nadella is, racially, ethnically speaking. ARMANDO DELGADILLO: No (laughter). (Through interpreter) No, he's Hindu I think. I'm not sure. I think he's Hindu. He's not the typical American. Satya seems different. SHAHANI: Nadella is different. He grew up in Hyderabad, a city in southern India. His father, it so happens, is far left of center, a Marxist economist, Nadella says. And Nadella's upbringing in a poor country, sometimes it shows. For example. . . NADELLA: There are companies that truly can contribute to the broader growth of the market that they are participating in versus just extracting rent. SHAHANI: Extracting rent, which typically means manipulating government officials to turn a bigger profit, that's a very popular term in the developing world. But by now, Nadella has spent more years at Microsoft than he ever spent back home. And he's adamant his work habits, his judgment, it's all an artifact of what he's learned in the U. S. NADELLA: I'm a story completely of the U. S. SHAHANI: The man he appointed as president of Microsoft disagrees completely and told me Nadella's upbringing outside the U. S. is central, a huge asset. It'll be interesting to see, as his travels continue, how the CEO's story about himself and his company evolves.

He's the subject of books, documentaries, even a TV biopic starring Ashton Kutcher. Now he's the title character in a movie that is getting so much buzz that a new theater here in Washington, D. C. , will be playing it on all six of its screens at its grand opening next week. Critic Bob Mondello says the film lives up to the buzz. BOB MONDELLO, BYLINE: You may feel you've been here before - the story of a man who uses technology to bring millions of people together but who can't seem to figure out how to connect with the people who are actually around him. Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin told that story a few years back in his script for the Facebook movie \"The Social Network. \" Now he's got a strikingly different take centered on the guy who put music in your pocket and gave the world a personal computer that said hello, ideas that sounded crazy back when most of what computers did was make spread sheets. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"STEVE JOBS\")MICHAEL FASSBENDER: (As Steve Jobs) What if the computer was a beautiful object, something you want to look at and have in your home? And what if, instead of it being in the right hands, it was in everyone's hands? JEFF DANIELS: (As John Sculley) We'd be talking about the most tectonic shift in the status quo since. . . FASSBENDER: (As Steve Jobs) Ever. MONDELLO: OK, that may be hyperbolic, but give the script credit. It crackles and pops as it chronicles a guy, played intensely by Michael Fassbender, who somehow earns the loyalty of people who look to him for approval and never, ever get it. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"STEVE JOBS\")FASSBENDER: (As Steve Jobs) Last year, Apple lost $1 billion. I don't even know how that's possible. We were less than 90 days from being insolvent. I had three different accountants try to explain it to me. The whole place has to be streamlined. SETH ROGEN: (As Steve Wozniak) Start with two of the accountants. MONDELLO: That's Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak played by an increasingly ticked-off Seth Rogen. And he's hardly the only person Steve Jobs ticks off in the movie. There's the mother of a daughter he refuses to acknowledge, the executives who enable him, the technicians who have to make things actually work - hard feelings every step of the way. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"STEVE JOBS\")MICHAEL STUHLBARG: (As Andy Hertzfeld) It's a system error. FASSBENDER: (As Steve Jobs) Fix it. STUHLBARG: (As Andy Hertzfeld) Fix it? FASSBENDER: (As Steve Jobs) Yeah. STUHLBARG: (As Andy Hertzfeld) We're not a pit crew at Daytona. This can't be fixed in seconds. FASSBENDER: (As Steve Jobs) You didn't have seconds. You had three weeks. The universe was created in a third of that time. STUHLBARG: (As Andy Hertzfeld) Well, someday you'll have to tell us how you did it. MONDELLO: Sorkin and director Danny Boyle give the story a three-act structure, each act playing out in real time - crisis time in the half-hour just before three of those product launches Jobs was so famously good at - first the original Mac, way back in 1984, then the Cube in '88 after Jobs had been fired from Apple and finally, in '98, when they hired him back, the egg-shaped iMac that set Apple on its industry-dominating way. The film's tension comes partly from the terrific performances and partly from juxtaposing Jobs's public and private personas. He could make cheering audiences believe he was changing the world, but backstage was another story. Again, Rogen's Wozniak. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"STEVE JOBS\")ROGEN: (As Steve Wozniak) You can't write code. You're not an engineer. You're not a designer. You can't put a hammer to a nail. I built the circuit board. The graphical interface was stolen from Xerox PARC. Jef Raskin was the leader of the Mac team before you threw him off his own project. Everything - someone else designed the box. So how come, 10 times in a day, I read Steve Jobs is a genius? What do you do? FASSBENDER: (As Steve Jobs) I play the orchestra. MONDELLO: If you have a sharp eye, you'll note a difference in visual texture as the film moves through time. The first section was shot in 16 millimeter, the second in less-grainy 35 millimeter, the third in crystalline high-def, sort of echoing the technical advances Jobs is talking so passionately about and talking and talking in Sorkin's hard-charging, super-articulate and somehow still emotionally resonant way. The film feels so electric while you're watching that it's hard to believe, after two hours, that it doesn't even get to the iPod, let alone the iPhone. Maybe they're leaving themselves room for \"Steve Jobs 2\" - or rather, \"Steve Jobs\" - what would the Apple folks call it? Yosemite and El Capitan are their operating systems. Maybe \"Steve Jobs: Half Dome\" - it'll come out a year from now, cost an extra hundred dollars; the ticket will require a new adapter, and we'll all - millions of us - line up happily to buy it.

The future of transportation is the subject of this round of the NPR Cities Project. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Becoming a world-class city. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Keep the transit system running. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: We have to move people a lot more efficiently. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Come take a ride of the future. MCEVERS: Right now in the 21st century, we rely on networks to get around, networks of roads and railways, networks of power lines and pipelines that provide energy to those roads and railways. And to get where we're going, we rely on all of that infrastructure without even thinking about it. NPR science blogger and University of Rochester astrophysicist Adam Frank has been thinking about it, and he's with us now. Hi Adam. ADAM FRANK, BYLINE: Hi Kelly. MCEVERS: OK so you think a lot about infrastructure. Why should we think a lot about infrastructure? FRANK: Well, there's one basic reason, which is that, you know, there's all the calls to rebuild the infrastructure that we built in the last century because a lot of it is crumbling. But there's even a deeper and more important reason, which is that climate change is basically pushing us to the need to have different ways of getting around, and that means we need to rebuild the networks that you were talking about in order to get that done. MCEVERS: OK. So Adam, where are you exactly? FRANK: So to start with, I'm standing on the Erie Canal Towpath. The canal, right here in front of me, got started here in 1808. Back then this was the cutting edge in transportation. It was how goods and people got moved by barge across New York. But, of course, to do that they had to build the canal first. MCEVERS: OK Adam, it sounds like there's something else there too. FRANK: Yeah. Well, running across the canal is a railroad bridge. That's where I'm standing right now. It's part of the railroad lines that came along though Rochester in the 1800s, and there's a train coming right now. So these trains - like the one that's just running under me - they became the new thing, and the canal became the old thing. And it was these rail networks that became the main way of moving people and goods. But, of course, you couldn't have the rail networks without all of the infrastructure being built underneath it. MCEVERS: OK this sounds like a history lesson - the canals and then the railroads. What else are you looking at, Adam? FRANK: All right. Well, beyond the canal and the railroad, I can see I-390, which is part of the national infrastructure of highways that were built starting in the 1950s. And beyond them, I can see airplanes flying over, and they're landing just beyond the hill at the Rochester International Airport. So you got the canal, the railroad, the highway and airport. And each one is a system, right? It's an infrastructure built at enormous cost out of metal and stone. And each one is a product of enormous human genius, all of them designed to sort of service civilization, move goods and information around as quickly and efficiently as possible. MCEVERS: OK so we started with canals then we went to railroads then we went to highways. I mean, it sounds like we keep - you know, we're keeping up with the times. I mean, what's the problem? FRANK: Yeah. Well, here's the thing, right? We seem to be standing at a pretty singular moment in human history. We've been building these infrastructures, you know, ever since we started building cities 6,000 years ago - canals of ancient Sumer, the roads in ancient Rome, ports in Elizabethan England. Each one came along with - as opportunities, and new technologies appeared. So yeah, our cities, fueled by fossil fuel, are really no different. But now there is something which is different. Now we've realized that, you know, this old infrastructure that we're using -which, you know, helps us get around - is also driving the planet into climate change. We keep burning that fossil fuel because we have this huge infrastructure for transportation built around it. MCEVERS: OK so what would a new infrastructure look like? FRANK: Well, so the thing is, we have to switch infrastructures again. It may seem sort of overwhelming, but on one level - and that's sort of the point of being here today - it's not that big a deal. I'm looking at four different examples of infrastructure we've built in the last 200 years, and we've built them pretty fast. So think about the fact that in 1890, there were no gas stations, and then by 1920, there were gas stations everywhere. We're able to change these infrastructures pretty fast when we need to. And so I think the interesting thing is that this is the first time that we have to think about the planet as a whole, not just efficiency and speed. And, you know, as an astronomer, I think that's pretty cool. MCEVERS: That's astrophysicist Adam Frank. Thanks so much. FRANK: My pleasure.

(SOUNDBITE OF COUGHING)SIEG: This isn't a good day for Atticus, being cradled by his dad, Krys VanSlyke, at Phoenix Children's Hospital. Atticus has been in and out of hospitals for 10 months since he was diagnosed with neuroblastoma at a year old. Krys remembers a moment in that hectic, overwhelming day when a question came up between him and his wife, Melissa, that surprised them both - what are we going to post about this? KRYS VANSLYKE: That's so crazy that that crosses your mind at that moment, but it's like, we know that there's people who are going to want to know what's going onSIEG: And they wanted them to know, even if they didn't know what to sayKRYS VANSLYKE: How do you communicate that? What do you share? SIEG: They're still figuring that out every day on their Facebook group Atticus Updates. Krys and Melissa have to approve each new member, which keeps it small, mostly family, friends and friends of friends. Even with that intimacy, there are still downsides to being public with their pain, like unhelpful comments. Krys says if you know a cancer parent. . . KRYS VANSLYKE: You don't need to bring up a concern about treatment to them because they have already gone through the pain and the anguish of impossible this or that scenarios. SIEG: There's also beauty to sharing online. The page has helped them raise money - tens of thousands of dollars - and also a momentum of hope. Krys says that even if Atticus is having a hard day. . . KRYS VANSLYKE: When he perks up, that's when we're going to take a picture and that's what we're going to share, you know? And we're going to say, today was rough, but he is still a fighter and he's still himself and he's still amazing. SIEG: There's a genuineness to what the VanSlykes are doing, and they're being embraced by a tight-knit, online community. Krys imagines telling Atticus one day about these people who love him. KRYS VANSLYKE: I don't know what that's going to mean for him, but I hope that he lives from a place of gratitude and generosity because of how the community has cared for us in this time. SIEG: But one day after those words, Atticus suddenly stopped breathing. A scan revealed the cancer had completely consumed his brain. He died within hours, a few weeks shy of his second birthday. Hundreds came to the memorial service. In an online video of that day, Mom Melissa smiles and says she's amazed at the hearts her baby touched. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)MELISSA VANSLYKE: Doctors, nurses, lawyers, teachers, coaches, baristas, cousins. SIEG: So many types of people, she says, but their differences don't matter. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)MELISSA VANSLYKE: None of that matters. What brings us all together is that if only for a moment we were able to be united in love for this beautiful boy. SIEG: Online they still are. Atticus's Facebook page has become a living memorial of photos and poems and musical tributes, with new posts every day. For NPR News, I'm Stina Sieg in Phoenix. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  When someone is seriously ill, it happens a lot now that friends and family share updates on their loved one on social media. But when that patient is a child, a child with a life-threatening illness, there are more complicated decisions to make about how much private pain a family should share. Stina Sieg of member station KJZZ in Phoenix brings us this story of one little boy. STINA SIEG, BYLINE: If you see Atticus VanSlyke on YouTube, you see a happy, cuddly toddler loves books, like \"Where's Baby's Birthday Cake? \" (SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO) KRYS VANSLYKE: Is it behind the wrapping paper?

More than half of working people have saved less than $25,000. As part of our series, Your Money and Your Life, NPR's Uri Berliner looks at how some young investors have turned to robo-advisers for help. URI BERLINER, BYLINE: Jesus Adrian Perez is 29, lives in Albuquerque, N. M. , and works as a biometric analyst. He's the first one in his family to graduate from college, and he told me he wants to climb from the working-class to the investment class. JESUS ADRIAN PEREZ: Out of all my whole family, I have the most income. And my parents and my brothers and sisters sometimes do look for me for that, you know. I mean, they need money. Not only do I have to worry about, like, my retirement, but I have to worry about my parents' retirement and my brother and sister, too. BERLINER: Perez is a math and statistics guy who knows what's at stake when lots of charges are tacked on to investments. PEREZ: I hear about investment advisers. Their fees are always really high, and you end up losing a lot of money in the long run. BERLINER: So he signed up with a robo-adviser called WiseBanyan. It's an online financial manager that builds you a portfolio of low-fee funds based on the customer's age, goals and tolerance for risk. All these decisions, they're made by an algorithm, not a broker. Do you feel strange having a robot managing your investments instead of a human being? PEREZ: No, no, I always think robots are better at everything than a human being can do. You know what I mean? They're going to be better at driving cars, identifying diseases. Human error is - human error is a big thing, and they're not greedy. BERLINER: Robo-advisers are significantly less expensive than human ones. The startup WiseBanyan is free. Fees at the largest robo-advisers are a small fraction of those at Wall Street firms and traditional wealth managers. GREG SMITH: People don't realize that the public are being used as pawns in this game where billions of dollars are being extracted out of their pockets. And, you know, 401(k)s are a great example. BERLINER: That's Greg Smith, president of a robo-adviser called Blooom that manages 401(k)s for customers. Smith is a former Goldman Sachs banker with an interesting back story. We'll get to that in a moment. But when it comes to 401(k)s, he says they're needlessly opaque, crammed with high-fee funds that perform poorly. SMITH: The average American household can pay $150,000 in fees into their 401(k)s over the lifetime of their retirement account. BERLINER: The Blooom algorithm hunts for the lowest cost options in a customer's plan. Typically, those are passive index funds. Passive funds automatically mirror a market index. They don't have highly paid managers. They don't try to beat the market. SMITH: After dealing with some of the smartest investors in the world for 11 years, I can conclusively say that I did not see any of them routinely beat the market. BERLINER: In 2012, Smith quit Goldman Sachs and slammed the company in The New York Times. He said Goldman's culture had become warped, and it was taking advantage of clients. According to Goldman, Smith left because he wanted more than a million dollars in salary, about double what he was earning. Now Smith works for a lot less - he calls it a startup salary - from a co-working space in midtown Manhattan. He says it's exciting. Robo- advisers like Blooom are at the birth of something big. SMITH: We think the whole industry is basically stuck in the 1970s. And finance and retirement might be one of the last bastions for the consumer that technology has not really helped at all. BERLINER: Now, this seems like the inevitable moment to say that these robo-advisers will disrupt financial planning. But there's no sign of that happening yet. SEAN MCDERMOTT: By comparison to the established players, it's a very small amount of money we're talking about. BERLINER: Sean McDermott is with the research firm Corporate Insight. He says the thing to watch is this. The use of robo-advisers is trickling up from millennials to older generations. MCDERMOTT: Their parents turn to them to ask for advice about the newest and latest technology that's out there. We don't think it's too large of a leap to say that they've been steering some of their parents into these services. BERLINER: At last count, he says the leading robo-advisers were giving advice on $21 billion in investor assets. And they're growing quickly. Though, to get some perspective, the mutual fund giant Fidelity by itself manages more than $2 trillion. Human, with all their flaws, still rule financial planning. The robots have their work cut out for them. Uri Berliner, NPR News.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Becoming a world-class city. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Keep the transit running. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: We have to move people a lot more efficiently. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Come. Take a ride of the future. GREENE: An industry is emerging around an old kind of urban transportation with a new source of power. Streetcars usually rely on electric wires overhead, but some people think those wires are really ugly. They cost money to put up and maintain. And they can get in the way of firetrucks. The cutting edge of streetcar technology runs without those wires. And we begin with NPR's Franklyn Cater in the nation's capital. FRANKLYN CATER, BYLINE: Here on H Street Northeast in Washington, D. C. , the area is full of new restaurants and bars that occupy brightly painted brick row houses. And there's also a new streetcar line and about 15 feet overhead, a loose web of wires. They're power for the streetcars. DORIAN JONES: It's not an eyesore per se, but now it's, like, really noticeable that you mentioned it. CATER: Do you mind if I ask your name? JONES: Dorian Jones. LETICIA SMITH: Leticia Smith. CATER: What do you think of the overhead wires? SMITH: That's OK. It's just a waste of money. CATER: Years in the making, this line is still being tested. The public can't ride yet, so many people are more worried about the millions spent than they are about wires and aesthetics. But back in 1888, aesthetics were very important to Congress. They saw wires as a threat to the beauty of the nation's capital, and they passed a law, no overhead wires for telegraph, telephone, electric lighting or anything else. So when the city wanted to reintroduce streetcars a few years ago, they started looking at wireless technology. They didn't like what they found, so City Council allowed wires on H Street. A plan to extend this line across town would still require an off-wire solution. But streetcars ran all over this city without wires until 1962. How? To find out, I went to the National Capital Trolley Museum. It's a streetcar geek's dream. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: Watch your step when leaving the car. CATER: You can ride old streetcars, and inside. . . KEN RUCKER: And now we're in Conduit Hall. CATER: Conduit Hall, where museum director Ken Rucker explains how things used to work. They had a conduit, a stick dropped from the car through a slot in the street, picking up power underground. RUCKER: So the 14th streetcar line was powered by the underground conduit. CATER: You would have had to dig a trench to put all of this in. RUCKER: Yes, and that way, we're not upsetting Washington's pristine skies with trolley wire overhead. CATER: Setting that up again would be colossally expensive and, these days, unnecessary. Thanks to the changing automotive industry, there's another option, battery power. To learn about that, we're now a couple hundred miles north of Washington, in the Pennsylvania mountains. MARION VAN FOSSON: Where we're standing right now, we've got overhead cranes and catenary systems to support. . . CATER: I'm with Marion Van Fosson, president of Brookville Equipment Corporation and Joel McNeil, vice president for business development. JOEL MCNEIL: Over here, you'll see the streetcars that we're working on. CATER: Business in off-wire streetcars is good for Brookville. They built cars for a line in Dallas that opened just this year, the first modern-day, off-wire line in the United States. And they're making more. MCNEIL: Two for Dallas and six for Detroit. CATER: Brookville's car is really a hybrid. VAN FOSSON: Prius of the modern streetcar market, right? CATER: (Laughter). Part of the time, it runs on wire. Where wires end, it keeps going, powered by a lithium ion battery. There's hot competition to make streetcars like this. More than a dozen cities have expressed interest in buying them. And though it's a hybrid right now, McNeil says. . . MCNEIL: In five years, it's definitely a possibility to go completely wire-free. CATER: Now, if you want to see an off-wire streetcar with a really fast charging time in action, you can go halfway around the world to China. And while I head back to Washington, here's NPR's Anthony Kuhn to pick up this part of the story. ANTHONY KUHN, BYLINE: These new streetcars glide along the Pearl River in southern Guangzhou city. The first tram line in operation is five miles long in a new up-and-coming urban district. You can't see where the power for these trams comes from unless you know where to look. I'm at a station with Fan Xiaoyun, assistant chief engineer with the Guangzhou Metro. He points to some thin strips of metal up above the streetcars. FAN XIAOYUN: (Through interpreter) You can see that as the train enters the station, it just lightly touches those contact strips. And in 20 seconds, it's fully charged and ready to go to the next station. KUHN: Instead of batteries, the trams have Chinese-made super capacitors. They're charged in the time that it takes passengers to get on and off. Then the streetcars can move at nearly 45 miles an hour. Fan Xiaoyun says that not having to lay cables or electrified rails between stations saves money. XIAOYUN: (Through interpreter) The cost of building this system is between a quarter and a seventh of the cost of building a subway. There's no need to dig tunnels. We just have to modify the street service a bit. KUHN: And they're cheap to run. Fan says that a streetcar carrying more than 300 people can go a kilometer, or six-tenths of a mile, for the equivalent of about 44 cents. Guangzhou city planners are designing an entire new business district around the new tram line. XIAOYUN: (Through interpreter) Right now, you can see that there are no tall buildings here. But this area is now a focus of development. And in about three years, the buildings will be even more dense here than across the river. KUHN: Fan points out that in large cities like Guangzhou, streetcars don't replace subways; they supplement them. They're to get you that last leg of the journey, ideally to take you door-to-door. Fan says that not only can streetcars improve urban transport; they can make cities more clean, livable and fun. The train I'm riding in has a kid-friendly theme with pictures of clowns and circus animals. (SOUNDBITE OF BELL)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Ding dong. KUHN: Passenger Xu Xuejun says taking the streetcars sure beats sitting in traffic or walking through clouds of car exhaust downtown. XU XUEJUN: (Foreign language spoken). KUHN: \"Of course I would like to see these streetcars in my neighborhood, too,\" she says. \"But the city center is too crowded, and I'm afraid it's just not feasible. \" Fan Xiaoyun says the city is exploring the feasibility of extending tram lines into downtown areas. For now, he's got his hands full hosting delegations, from cities around China and the world, lining up to learn more about his city's super capacitor-powered streetcars.

For now, he's got his hands full hosting delegations, from cities around China and the world, lining up to learn more about his city's super capacitor-powered streetcars.

JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: At a rail yard in the Philly suburbs, Larry Charney is standing in the cab of a moving train, overseeing a test. LARRY CHARNEY: You see the signal in front of us is red? BRADY: Charney works for SEPTA, the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority. This train is 40 years old, but it's been updated for the 21st century. Above the metal levers and analog dials near the engineer's head, there's a shiny, new digital display. That's part of SEPTA's Positive Train Control, or PTC system.

The engineer still is in control of the train. BRADY: But if he doesn't do anything, then. . . CHARNEY: If he doesn't do anything, the train will come to a stop, and we'll show you here. He's going to - we're going to try to demonstrate him running by the signal. And the train will automatically be stopped. (SOUNDBITE OF BEEPING)CHARNEY: There's the alert. It's telling him he's going too fast. There's the stop. BRADY: This system cost SEPTA about $328 million. Extend that to all the passenger and freight lines across the country, and you get a sense of the billions of dollars being spent. But the payoff is big, too. PTC could have prevented a 2008 train collision in California that left 25 people dead. It also would have slowed down the fast-moving Amtrak train that derailed earlier this year in Philadelphia, killing eight. Preventing deadly accidents is why Congress passed a law that says, by the end of this year, railroads must have PTC in place or face huge fines.

DAVID LANG: I'd never been inside of a cave at all before this. And they're really, really stark. RAZ: This is David Lang. And for eight months, he and some friends had been preparing to explore this one cave. LANG: It's about six hours north of San Francisco. RAZ: And there's no, like - no one lives around there? There's just like, a - it's like, a place on the map? LANG: It's a - that's a very good way to describe it. It's a place on a map, and that's about all we had, was a map. RAZ: This was back in 2012, but what brought David to that cave, that story began years earlier. David had moved to LA from the Midwest to follow his dream of sailing around the world, even though he'd never even been on a sail boat before. LANG: But I just had this idea that this is something I wanted to do. So I drove out California, begged my way into this job with this sailing school, learned how to sail and ended up teaching sailing lessons and doing sailing trips around the world. It was an exciting four years after college. RAZ: That's cool. So you really know how to sail now? LANG: I do, I know how to sail. I've lived on a boat. . . RAZ: The point is, David was never the kind of guy who was, you know, afraid to knock on doors and say hey, you know, I don't know how to do this, but I want to. Help me out. So a couple years after that - he was still living in LA - David met a guy named Eric Stackpole, and Eric was also looking for some help. LANG: And when I met Eric, the first thing that came out of his mouth. . . RAZ: Yeah. LANG: . . . Was this story of this cave. RAZ: What do you remember about the story? LANG: So the story dated back to the Gold Rush. The story was that there was two Native American men who had robbed this gold-mining operation. And they had made off with about a hundred pounds of gold. So a lot of gold. RAZ: Wow. LANG: And that they were fleeing into the mountains, and the sheriff's posse was on the trail. And they threw the gold into this underwater cave, so it wouldn't weigh them down, so they could get away faster. They ended up getting caught, and the sheriff asked them where they put the gold. And they said they hid it in the Hall City Cave. RAZ: David was instantly in. They were going to find that gold in the Hall City Cave, but they had no idea where it was or how to get there so they just Googled it. LANG: And then we found this story from this treasure hunter online who had found this cave and had tried to get to the bottom and had almost died and had said, I'm never going back to that cave. RAZ: But Eric and David did go to that cave. LANG: And sure enough, you go to the back of this limestone cave and there's this puddle of water. And you shine a light and it just goes down, down, down, down, down and you can't see the bottom of it. RAZ: So there could be, like, a hundred pounds of gold down there underwater. And Eric is like, I want to find it. LANG: He said he's going to find it, but, more importantly, he's going to make this tool to go and find it. RAZ: David would spend the next eight months working with Eric to build that tool. And the tool was an ROV, a remote operated vehicle. These are not new. They're used by oil and gas companies for exploration and construction underwater, but those ROVs cost tens of thousands of dollars. And David and Eric were trying to build one in a garage out of hardware store parts, as David explained on the Ted stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)LANG: So Eric had an initial design idea for a robot, but we didn't have all the parts figured out. So we did what anybody would do in our situation. We asked the Internet for help. More specifically, we created this website, openrov. com and shared our intentions and our plans. For the first few months, it was just Eric and I talking back to each other on the forums. But pretty soon, we started to get feedback from makers and hobbyists and then actually professional ocean engineers who, you know, had some suggestions for what we should do. RAZ: But you knew nothing about, like, computers, or - I guess. . . LANG: Electronics and software. RAZ: . . . Electronics, software? LANG: No, I was not technical at all. RAZ: Like, soldering irons? LANG: Yeah, and I think there's a special magic to not knowing what you're doing and being honest about that. RAZ: What happened when David and his friend simply asked for help was that they didn't just hear from people with great ideas. LANG: It was people who had actually tried something out. They said hey, I just tried this out in my pool or in the ocean near where I live, and it worked. It was better than just getting ideas, it was getting solutions. RAZ: And so after eight months of tinkering on their underwater robot in a garage, prototype after prototype after prototype. . . LANG: It just reached this point where the only thing left to do was to go. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ERIC STACKPOLE: Where are we right now? LANG: Right now we're in the Hall City Cave, kind of near Redding, Calif. It's a cave way up in the Trinity Alps. RAZ: And so on their 21st prototype. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)LANG: That means I've built 20 ROVs before this. I'm perfecting the design almost every time. RAZ: David and what had become a team of friends went back to the Hall City Cave and put their little underwater robot. . . LANG: Like, the size of a toaster oven I would say. RAZ: Equipped with a couple of lights and a small camera tethered to a hundred-foot cable. . . LANG: It was really this. . . RAZ: Into the water. LANG: . . . Moment of pride because it wasn't just that we were exploring the unknown, but we were going there with this tool that we had built. RAZ: In fact, that day David and his friends almost forgot about the gold and why they were there in the first place because what was even more exciting, as their robot moved through the water toward an opening that would take them successfully into the cave itself, was that because of all the people who had helped them get there, they felt like a part of something bigger. LANG: Yes. We sent it down and everyone is kind of collectively holding their breath. It's a very quiet moment where anything can happen. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Slowing the ascent. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: You're going through. You're through. . . UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: (Laughter) That is so cool. All right, I'm making a descent. RAZ: OK, spoiler alert here because David and his partners did not find any gold in that cave. But the open-source model they used to get there left them with a question, a question that would never have been able to ask if they hadn't had help from thousands of people all over the world. LANG: What if there were thousands of these devices and that anybody could, you know, just get online or go and meet people and get sucked into one of these adventures? (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)LANG: So about that time, our little expedition became quite a story, and it got picked up in The New York Times. And we were pretty much just overwhelmed with interest from people who wanted a kit that they could build this ROV themselves. So we decided to put the project on Kickstarter. And when we did, we raised our funding goal in about two hours and all of a sudden had this money to make these kits. But then we had to learn how to make them. I mean, we had to learn small-batch manufacturing. So we quickly learned that our garage was not big enough to hold our growing operation. But we were able to do it. We got all the kits made. Thanks a lot to TechShop, which was a big help to us. And we shipped these kits all over the world. But we're still publishing all the designs online, encouraging anyone to build these themselves. That's the only way that we could have done this. By being open-source, we've created this distributed R-and-D network, and we're moving faster than any venture-backed counterpart. But the actual robot is really only half the story. The real potential, the long-term potential is with this community of DIY ocean explorers that are forming all over the globe. What can we discover when there's thousands of these devices roaming the seas? RAZ: David Lang and his company OpenROV have sold thousands of their open-source ROVs to people all over the world. These things can dive over 300 feet. They shoot high-quality video and they only cost about 900 bucks, which is a fraction of their commercial counterparts. And David says who knows what they could find on a planet that is 70 percent water. LANG: To give you an example, there are about 200 shipwrecks in the San Francisco Bay that have not been discovered. I mean, we've gone off several times, and we go in and look at old maps, try and read old documents at historical societies and try and figure where some of these shipwrecks are. But to go out on the boat and to know that we're looking for this piece of history that no one else has been able to find, that's a feeling that's - oh, it just gets me excited. RAZ: I mean, we're almost - in some ways, we're, like, going back to that age of discovery, where, like, anybody could be a scientist or an explorer or an astronomer because they just went out and did it. And now, like, the tools are available to people, and they're pretty cheap. LANG: I like that. I think you're right. It is this new age of discovery. You have to realize though that, you know, we've been doing this now for four years. And I tell - I still tell this story once in a while of how we got started in the search for gold and Kickstarter and the whole story. And I can't help but giggle when I tell it because it still seems so unbelievable. And the best part about it is that it's not just ours. It's all of these people that are a part of it. And so I always talk about this, that we've created this dream. But it's a collective dream that we're all participating in, that we're all working on together. RAZ: David Lang runs openrov. com. They recently launched a crowdfunded campaign to build a new version of the robot. They needed about 50,000 bucks to start. They raised almost three-quarters of a million. You can see David's short talk at ted. com. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"CAN I GET SOME HELP\")JAMES BROWN: (Singing) There's a whole lot of people standing over there.

How often do you walk in and slow down - really just look at all of the things around you? That's what Alastair Parvin does all the time. He's a designer. ALASTAIR PARVIN: What I'm really interested in is the background stuff, the stuff people take for granted. So I kind of - I find myself walking into a hotel room and looking at the plug sockets and going, that's interesting. Why are the plug sockets here different than somewhere else? How did that come about? RAZ: Do you know what I can't get? I can't get why the hotels don't have plug sockets next to the bed. They have alarm clocks - they have alarm clocks, and how many times have you unplugged the alarm clock to plug your iPhone plug in there? PARVIN: I know, right? RAZ: Right. PARVIN: And the reason why is because what we've always done is we've separated design from the process of making, which, in turn, is separated from the process of use. Ultimately, you've got to put power into the hands of the person who's going to use the thing. RAZ: And Alastair says when that doesn't happen - when the designer and the maker and the user are all in different places not talking to each other, you get designs that don't work. You get ugly buildings that nobody likes or schools that look like prisons - homes and apartment buildings that don't make sense for the people who live in them. And part of the reason for this, says Alastair, is that architecture and design are so centralized. They're anything but open. PARVIN: And there is this kind of myth of the hero individual architect - this kind of genius who produces a sketch and then throws it over a balcony, and it just somehow happens into the world. And I guess locked into that is this idea that, well, we know best - where design and development is something done to people, not done by people. RAZ: Yeah, I mean, you look at most big cities, and it's skyscrapers and huge housing projects and big box doors, and that was just kind of put out there, and we just kind of accept it. PARVIN: Yeah, and actually, we all believe in the idea of democracy, right? And so the irony was that, really, since the Industrial Revolution, we've been bought into these big systems of design and development that were incredibly actually undemocratic. And suddenly, we're moving into a world where potentially that might not be true. RAZ: Alastair picks up that idea from the Ted stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)PARVIN: So the challenge we face is how are we going to build the tools, the infrastructure, and the institutions for architectural social economy? And that began with open-source software, and over the last few years, it's been moving into the physical world with open-source hardware, which are freely shared blueprints that anyone can download and make for themselves. And we were fascinated by what that might mean for architecture. So about a year and a half ago, we started working on a project called WikiHouse. And WikiHouse is an open-source construction system. And the idea is to make it possible for anyone to go online, access a freely-shared library of 3-D models which they can download and adapt. And almost at the click of a switch, it can generate a set of cutting files, which allow them, in effect, to print out the parts in the house using a CNC machine, which is like a large printer that can cut sheets of plywood. And the parts are all numbered, and basically what you end up with is a really big IKEA kit. And it goes together without any bolts. It uses wedge and peg connections, and even the mallets to make it can be provided on the cutting sheets as well. And a team of about two or three people working together can build this. They don't need any traditional construction skills. They don't need a huge array of power tools or anything like that, and what you end up with is just the basic chassis of a house, onto which you can then apply systems like windows and cladding and insulation services based on what's cheap and what's available. Of course, the house is never finished. With a CNC machine, you can make new parts for it over its life or even use it to make the house next door. RAZ: So how could WikiHouse change the way we think about design? Alastair Parvin returns in just a minute to explain. I'm Guy Raz. Our show today - open-source. And you're listening to the TED RADIO HOUR from NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: It's the TED RADIO HOUR from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, Open Source, how sharing ideas in the open can change the way we live. And we were just hearing from Alastair Parvin. He's a designer who co-founded something called WikiHouse. And WikiHouse helps users build a simple house in just a few days anywhere in the world. And when people really start to do this, Alastair says, it will totally upend the way we think about our homes and offices. PARVIN: When an architect is just kind of producing a hundred houses in a week, they don't get to pay attention to every small little detail, whereas the person that lives there lives there for years and weeks and months. And so they'll tweak the house and they will change it, and they will learn how to use it. So that's one of the interesting things about open source design is that you can almost think of it as a way of downloading a piece of design that already has embedded within it thousands of hours' worth of attention. RAZ: Wow. Ultimately the idea is that you want everybody to have power in designing where they live, how their communities are designed, like, that this shouldn't just be something that is handed to them but that everybody has a chance to kind of participate in. PARVIN: Yeah, there's this fantastic quote which we think is from John Maynard Keynes. It's this idea of it's easier to ship recipes than cakes and biscuits. And that's really funny because on one level it's so obviously true. But at the same time, it's not how our whole industrial economy works. Almost our entire 20th century industrial economy was based around almost the exact opposite idea, which is shipping around materials and products. But the moment you could email a recipe to the other side of the world and then fabricate it and replicate it in a tiny workshop or a garage to an extraordinarily high degree of precision, open source became something that could move from the world of code into the world of physical things. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)PARVIN: We and others have built a few prototypes around the world now - and some really interesting lessons here. One of them is that it's always incredibly sociable. People get confused between construction work and having fun. But the principles of openness go right down into the really mundane physical details, like never designing a piece that can't be lifted up, or, when you're designing a piece, make sure you either can't put it in the wrong way around or if you do, it doesn't matter because it's symmetrical. Probably the principle which runs deepest with us is the principle set out by Linus Torvalds, the open source pioneer, which is that idea of be lazy like a fox. Don't reinvent the wheel every time. Take what already works and adapt it for your own needs. We're moving into this future where the factory is everywhere. And, increasingly, that means the design team is everyone. And that really is an industrial revolution. When we think that the major ideological conflicts that we inherited were all based around this question of who should control the means of production. And these technologies are coming back with the solution - actually maybe no one. All of us. RAZ: So this idea of right now you've got all these, like, designers and people coming in and exchanging ideas and thoughts and, is that unusual? I mean, are designers proprietary normally, or are they kind of like, yeah, let's sort of - like, I'll tell you exactly what I'm thinking here? PARVIN: It's - this is really interesting because designers and architects in particular are really taught to think that they are proprietary. But actually the strange thing is, it's not true. And actually, it's never been true. Architecture has always been a big copy and paste function. Why do we think that some of our big grand buildings of the state are neo-classical buildings? They're basically copies of, you know, ancient Greek and ancient Roman architecture. So everything in architecture is a copy. But the problem is that, actually, we've been copying really inefficiently, like, we're really bad at copying. Effectively, architects are resolving the same problems again and again and again. But the moment you open source things - open source is another way of saying that once solved by someone, no problem ever needs to be solved twice. RAZ: Do you know we open sourced the playground in my neighborhood, and what normally would have taken three months took two years? Because it's chaotic, because everybody had a say, everybody was involved with it. You know? So it's also, like - right? It's also a little messy sometimes. PARVIN: I think this also comes down to your - I guess the way that we understand open source. So open source isn't the same as, for example, crowdsourcing ideas. It's not about finding a consensus. It's about giving everybody opportunity. RAZ: Right. PARVIN: Actually the irony is that the one of the reasons why open source is such a successful form of collaboration is that, actually, it's a form of collaboration that requires the least interaction between the collaborators. Like, what you're actually doing when you open source something is bundling a piece of knowledge in such a way that somebody else thousands of miles away, who you've never met and possibly will never even talk to, can take it and find it useful straight away. So there's this paradox because one of the things that makes open source work is that actually it doesn't require us to collaborate. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)PARVIN: We're aware that WikiHouse is a very, very small answer. But it's a small answer to a really, really big question, which is that globally right now the fastest-growing cities are not skyscraper cities. They're self-made cities in one form or another. So if we're serious about problems like climate change, urbanization and health, actually, our existing development models aren't going to do it. How extraordinary would it be though, if collectively we were to develop solutions not just to the problem of structure that we've been working on, but to (unintelligible) infrastructure problems like solar powered air-conditioning, off-grid energy, off-grid sanitation and put them all into a commons where they're owned by everyone, a kind of Wikipedia for stuff? How much would that change the rules? And I think the technology's on our side. If design's great project in the 20th century was the democratization of consumption that was Henry Ford, Levittown, Coca-Cola, IKEA, I think design's great project in the 21st century is the democratization of production. And when it comes to architecture in cities, that really matters. Thank you very much. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: Designer Alastair Parvin. He's the co-founder of WikiHouse. And as you heard him say earlier, people have built hundreds of prototypes around the world. You can find Alastair's entire talk at ted. com. GUY RAZ, HOST:  So how often do you walk into a building - not a fancy building - just an ordinary, you know, normal building. How often do you walk in and slow down - really just look at all of the things around you? That's what Alastair Parvin does all the time. He's a designer. ALASTAIR PARVIN: What I'm really interested in is the background stuff, the stuff people take for granted. So I kind of - I find myself walking into a hotel room and looking at the plug sockets and going, that's interesting. Why are the plug sockets here different than somewhere else? How did that come about? RAZ: Do you know what I can't get? I can't get why the hotels don't have plug sockets next to the bed. They have alarm clocks - they have alarm clocks, and how many times have you unplugged the alarm clock to plug your iPhone plug in there? PARVIN: I know, right? RAZ: Right. PARVIN: And the reason why is because what we've always done is we've separated design from the process of making, which, in turn, is separated from the process of use. Ultimately, you've got to put power into the hands of the person who's going to use the thing.

But what if you could take the principles of open-source and push them out beyond technology? PIA MANCINI: What really appeals to me about the philosophy of open-source is it's allowing for answers to appear in places that you could have never imagined. RAZ: This is Pia Mancini. She's a democracy activist from Argentina. MANCINI: I think it's the potential of open-source - the ability of working in a way that you'll run into untapped potential all the time. RAZ: And Pia wants to tap that potential in our democracies to bring the open-source revolution to government because the whole system, she says, is due for an upgrade. Here's Pia on the Ted stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MANCINI: Let's have a look at some of the characteristics of the system. First of all, the few make daily decisions in name of the many, and the many get to vote once every couple of years. On the second place, the costs of participating in the system are incredibly high. You either have to have a fair bit of money and influence, or you have to devote your entire life to politics. You have to become a party member and slowly start working up the ranks until maybe one day you'll get to sit at a table where the decision is being made. And last but not least, the language of the system - it's incredibly cryptic. It's done for lawyers by lawyers, and no one else can understand. So it's a system where we can choose our authorities, but we are completely left out on how those authorities reach their decisions. Our political system remains the same for the past 200 years and expects us to be contented with being simply passive recipients of a monologue. RAZ: So a few years ago, Pia and some of her activist friends came up with an idea to solve this problem - the problem that democracy is really hard to participate in. And they got this idea while they were on a train in Buenos Aires. MANCINI: I remember we were in the subway in the tube, and everyone is looking at their phones and playing Candy Crush or Angry Birds or something like that. RAZ: Pia and her friends wondered, what if instead of playing iPhone games when we have a free moment - what if we could use those moments to contribute to our democracy? And they answered that question by inventing an app. They called it Democracy OS. MANCINI: So what we did was start with one idea asking citizens to participate in voting and having someone inside Congress voting according to what citizens decided on this online platform. But what we wanted to do with that was to push the boundaries of what was perceived as possible and doable. RAZ: OK, so right now you've got a beta of this, but can you explain how it works? Like I would just pull up on my iPhone, and I would scroll through, and. . . UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: . . . Alaska, new wilderness protection and arctic refuge. . . RAZ: . . . And, like, look at all the different issues being debated? MANCINI: Exactly. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Detroit water affordability bill. RAZ: By the way, this is an actual bill that's been debated on Pia's app. MANCINI: In this issue in particular, I'd like to vote for it myself because I'm very informed about all the complexities of this issue. There is a space for reading exactly the bill that's going to be enacted or that it's been put forward. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: The plan caps your utility payment at 2. 5 percent. . . MANCINI: And then there's a space to debate. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Detroit is in urgent need of water affordability measures. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Thousands have already been shut off. It's time to act. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: Water should be paid for through general taxation and made available to all citizens. MANCINI: And then you vote. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: YesUNIDENTIFIED MAN: Yes. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: No. MANCINI: Or you want to abstain. And so at the end of that process, you'll have a decision being made. RAZ: So in theory, you could stay engaged with issues on your way to work. You could weigh in on the construction of a local park while waiting for coffee. You could talk about a proposed taxing increase while you're at the grocery store. Ideally, Pia wants elected officials to vote the way their constituents vote on the app. So she reached out to some politicians in Buenos Aires where she lived. MANCINI: We said, look, here you have a platform that you can use to build a two-way conversation with your constituencies, and yes, we failed. We failed big-time. We were, you know, sent to play outside like little kids. Amongst other things, we were called naive. And I must be honest. I think, in hindsight, we were because the challenges that we face - they're not technological. They're cultural. So it suddenly became obvious that if we wanted to move forward with this idea, we needed to do it ourselves. And so we took quite a leap of faith, and in August last year, we funded our own political party, el Partido de la Red, or the Net Party, in the city of Buenos Aires. And taking an even bigger leap of faith, we run for elections on October last year, with this idea. If we want to sit in Congress, our candidate - our representatives were always going to vote according to what citizens decided on Democracy OS. It was a very, very bold move for a 2-month-old party in the city of Buenos Aires. But it got attention. We got 22,000 votes. That's 1. 2 percent of the votes. And we came in second for the local options. So even if that wasn't enough to win a seat in Congress, it was enough for us to become part of the conversation. RAZ: Now, of course, Democracy OS is not a perfect idea. If you don't have a critical mass of people using the app, you basically hand over power to the small group that does use it. And then the other problem is that every little vote becomes like a referendum, which, in some ways, makes democracy less functional. And then there's the issue of secrecy. Like, an article of faith in most democracies is the secret ballot - the right to go into a closed booth and secretly make your decision and then walk out. And I wonder if, in a sort of paradoxical way, by being so open, you actually create a slightly less free space - that, you know, the less likely it is that we will say or do what we really want. MANCINI: Yeah - look, it's an extremely valid point, and I think it's worth iterating and prototyping every possible scenario and trying out different arrangements. There is a Korean philosopher, and he wrote this little book called \"The Transparent Society. \" And what he says is that we are so in love with transparency and the idea of, you know, everything being out in the open that we forgot how to trust because in order to trust, you need to have something undercover - right? - because if everything is out there, what's there to trust? But I must say that in our experience, also, the anonymity of certain spaces - even more online - produce a fair amount of trolling and hate speech that hides behind those avatars or those fake names. So I think it's finding a way of striking a balance. RAZ: Do you see open-source democracy as fundamentally changing the nature of democracy or just improving it? MANCINI: I think fundamentally changing it, and the reason is because of the existence of the Internet. And I'm not saying it's going to happen overnight, obviously, but the impact that I think the Internet has is comparable to the impact that the printing press had. And those changes happen when certain barriers are put in place or are lowered. And what the Internet did for us was it lowered a barrier extremely quickly for us. That was the access to information and the access to being able to express ourselves on a regular basis. RAZ: Pia Mancini is the cofounder of the Net Party and one of the developers behind the Democracy OS app. You can see her full talk at ted. com. On the show today, open-source - how sharing ideas is changing the way we live.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Yes UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Yes. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: No. MANCINI: Or you want to abstain. And so at the end of that process, you'll have a decision being made. RAZ: So in theory, you could stay engaged with issues on your way to work. You could weigh in on the construction of a local park while waiting for coffee. You could talk about a proposed taxing increase while you're at the grocery store. Ideally, Pia wants elected officials to vote the way their constituents vote on the app. So she reached out to some politicians in Buenos Aires where she lived. MANCINI: We said, look, here you have a platform that you can use to build a two-way conversation with your constituencies, and yes, we failed. We failed big-time. We were, you know, sent to play outside like little kids. Amongst other things, we were called naive. And I must be honest. I think, in hindsight, we were because the challenges that we face - they're not technological. They're cultural. So it suddenly became obvious that if we wanted to move forward with this idea, we needed to do it ourselves. And so we took quite a leap of faith, and in August last year, we funded our own political party, el Partido de la Red, or the Net Party, in the city of Buenos Aires. And taking an even bigger leap of faith, we run for elections on October last year, with this idea. If we want to sit in Congress, our candidate - our representatives were always going to vote according to what citizens decided on Democracy OS. It was a very, very bold move for a 2-month-old party in the city of Buenos Aires. But it got attention. We got 22,000 votes. That's 1. 2 percent of the votes. And we came in second for the local options. So even if that wasn't enough to win a seat in Congress, it was enough for us to become part of the conversation. RAZ: Now, of course, Democracy OS is not a perfect idea. If you don't have a critical mass of people using the app, you basically hand over power to the small group that does use it. And then the other problem is that every little vote becomes like a referendum, which, in some ways, makes democracy less functional. And then there's the issue of secrecy. Like, an article of faith in most democracies is the secret ballot - the right to go into a closed booth and secretly make your decision and then walk out. And I wonder if, in a sort of paradoxical way, by being so open, you actually create a slightly less free space - that, you know, the less likely it is that we will say or do what we really want. MANCINI: Yeah - look, it's an extremely valid point, and I think it's worth iterating and prototyping every possible scenario and trying out different arrangements. There is a Korean philosopher, and he wrote this little book called \"The Transparent Society. \" And what he says is that we are so in love with transparency and the idea of, you know, everything being out in the open that we forgot how to trust because in order to trust, you need to have something undercover - right? - because if everything is out there, what's there to trust? But I must say that in our experience, also, the anonymity of certain spaces - even more online - produce a fair amount of trolling and hate speech that hides behind those avatars or those fake names. So I think it's finding a way of striking a balance. RAZ: Do you see open-source democracy as fundamentally changing the nature of democracy or just improving it? MANCINI: I think fundamentally changing it, and the reason is because of the existence of the Internet. And I'm not saying it's going to happen overnight, obviously, but the impact that I think the Internet has is comparable to the impact that the printing press had. And those changes happen when certain barriers are put in place or are lowered. And what the Internet did for us was it lowered a barrier extremely quickly for us. That was the access to information and the access to being able to express ourselves on a regular basis.

CLAY SHIRKY: Well, so this is one of the things that often happens with any new pattern. It's almost never a completely new effect. It's some old, small pattern now writ large and fast. RAZ: This is Clay Shirky. He studies how we interact online, and the idea behind open-source - it didn't actually start in the tech world. It dates back to the 17th century in England. SHIRKY: In the early history of the printing press, you start getting magazines and newspapers, and you start getting people really thinking of print as a way that a group can communicate with each other. RAZ: Clay picks up the rest of the story from the Ted stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SHIRKY: This is the cover of Philosophical Transactions, the first scientific journal ever published in English in the middle of the 1600s. And it was created by a group of people who'd been calling themselves the invisible college - a group of natural philosophers who only later would call themselves scientists. And they wanted to improve the way natural philosophers argued with each other. And they needed to do two things for this. They needed openness. They needed to create a norm which said, when you do an experiment, you have to publish not just your claims but how you did the experiment. If you don't tell us how you did it, we won't trust you. But the other thing they needed was speed. They had to quickly synchronize what other natural philosophers knew, otherwise you couldn't get the right kind of argument going. The printing press was clearly the right medium for this, but the book was the wrong tool. It was too slow. And so they invented the scientific journal as a way of synchronizing the argument across the community of natural scientists. RAZ: Now this was a huge shift because here's how things worked before. In the 1600s, if you wanted to be, say, an alchemist, which is an early chemist, you couldn't just pick up a book and figure out how. You had to find an actual alchemist and convince him to take you on as his apprentice. SHIRKY: And you would basically learn only what that alchemist already knew. RAZ: And they were really secretive, right? I mean, people were not sharing information and results and data. SHIRKY: Right. So the alchemists were not only not sharing data like maybe they forgot. They were very explicitly not sharing data as a cultural norm. RAZ: So why did these guys stop working like this? SHIRKY: They decided to stop because they weren't making much progress. They thought they would make more progress by talking to each other, and as the cost of printing and the press fell, suddenly there was this other model where you could say, you know, we could share things with people dozens or hundreds of miles away, and all of a sudden everybody would know the same thing at the same time. And so they switched the cultural norms to say we're all in this together, and we will all together make more progress than if we had just hidden our results. RAZ: Wow. So I mean they basically, you know, invented open-source. SHIRKY: Yeah. So they were one of the first groups to say, we have this new medium. Anybody can join, and there is no center. And we're changing what we're doing because of it. RAZ: Which brings us back to the web and how open-source moved from natural philosophy to the world of technology. So remember that in the early '90s, Tim Berners-Lee was inventing the World Wide Web using an open-source model, and at that time, he was an outlier in the tech world. Most major advances in tech weren't coming from some big, collaborative process without a central authority. They were coming from the top down, and a big reason why is because of programming. And programming is complicated. Here's more from Clay's Ted talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SHIRKY: Programming is a three-way relationship between a programmer, some source code and the computer it's meant to run on. But computers are such famously inflexible interpreters of instructions that it's extraordinarily difficult to write out a set of instructions that the computer knows how to execute. And that's if one person is writing it. Once you get more than one person writing it, it's very easy for any two programmers to overwrite each other's work if they're working on the same file or to send incompatible instructions that simply causes the computer to choke, and this problem grows larger the more programmers are involved. To a first approximation, the problem of managing a large software project is the problem of keeping this social chaos at bay. Now, for decades there has been a canonical solution to this problem which is to use something called a version control system. And a version control system does what it says on the tin. It provides a canonical copy of the software on a server somewhere. The only programmers who can change it are people who've specifically been given permission to access it, and they're only allowed to access the subsection of it that they have permission to change. And when people draw diagrams of version control systems, they look like org charts, and you don't have to squint very hard to see the political ramifications of a system like this. This is feudalism - one owner, many workers. Now, that's fine for the commercial software industry. It really is Microsoft's Office. It's Adobe's Photoshop. The corporation owns the software. The programmers come and go. But there was one programmer who decided that this wasn't the way to work. RAZ: Who that programmer was and his impact on you, me and the rest of the world in a moment. I'm Guy Raz, and you're listening to the TED RADIO HOUR from NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: It's the TED RADIO HOUR from NPR. I'm Guy Raz, and on the show today, ideas about open-source. And just before the break, we were hearing from Clay Shirky about the early days of the open-source movement and one programmer in particular. His name is Linus Torvalds, and at age 22, Linus decided to create a truly open-source operating system, which he called Linux. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SHIRKY: Open-source software - the core promise of the open-source license is that everybody should have access to all the source code all the time. But, of course, this creates the very threat of chaos you have to forestall in order to get anything working. So most open-source projects just held their noses and adopted the feudal management systems. But Torvalds said, no, I'm not going to do that. His point of view on this was very clear. When you adopt a tool, you also adopt the management philosophy embedded in that tool, and he wasn't going to adopt anything that didn't work the way the Linux community worked. This is a tremendously complicated process. This is a tremendously complicated program, and yet, Torvalds ran this, not with automated tools, but out of his email box. People would literally mail him changes that they had agreed on, and he would merge them by hand. Linus was the first person to consciously use the entire world as his potential talent pool. Because by that point - this is the early 1990s - pretty much anyone who had the technical skills needed to contribute to an operating system was also online. RAZ: Yeah, so put this into context. I mean, how big of a deal was this? SHIRKY: So what is really extraordinary about Linux - you know, people think of it as a kind of geek operating system for some desktops and laptops. But what people don't realize is it's the background operating system of every Kindle and Nook in existence. It's the background operating system of every Android phone in existence and almost the entirety of what we call the cloud. Linux has been the thing that enabled those subsequent tools and services to be built. RAZ: And that happened because he basically said, hey, this is what I'm doing. Do you want to check it out? Here's everything that I'm doing. Nothing's a secret. SHIRKY: It's the nothing's-a-secret part because at every moment - and there are - you know, you see this pattern over and over again. When Wi-Fi router manufacturers said we're going to need an operating system to run on this thing, they could write their own and own it. Nobody could copy it, and they wouldn't have to release the source code. But Linux was just sitting there, and it was free. So they adopt it, and routers become a tool that people can write new things on top of. When the people making the Kindle said, you know, we could write a brand-new operating system to run e-books, and it won't work well until the third version, or we - Linux is just sitting there, and it's free. And at every moment it does just enough of what people have wanted it to do that it was worth it to grab it and extend it rather than writing something from scratch. RAZ: When something is open-source, is the result always better? SHIRKY: No. Oh, my God, no. I mean, we know many cases where the results are almost never better - you know, the famous example of open-source novels - the disastrous wiki op-ed that the LA Times tried. But then there are also trade-offs where you have to say this product is better in one way, but worse in another way. So anyone who's used an Android phone and an iPhone is looking at a phone that has been developed on more open-source and more closed-source models. Apple - famously obsessively secretive, famously obsessive about the design of the icons and the uniformity of the behavior of the phone. The pleasure of that phone is quite extraordinary. Android is just a little clunkier. It's more inconsistent. But, number one, Android phones are much cheaper, which means that it is Android and not the iPhone that's bringing the smartphone revolution to the masses, right? It is Android that is responsible for a billion people having access to some sort of smartphone right now. So if your choice is no smartphone at all or an Android, then the open-source world has really made your life considerably better. So the key thing, I think, to understand is where open-source works, it tends to spread - not because it's always perfect, but because it's never so bad that you wouldn't get an advantage from picking it up. Again, this is why Linux got picked up for so many things, not that it was ever perfect for e-books or the cloud or Android phones or any of the rest of it, but because it was cheap enough and good enough that it gave people a boost if they adopted it. RAZ: Clay Shirky writes and teaches about the Internet and society. You can watch all of his talks at ted. com.

I'm Guy Raz. So here's a story. It starts in 1989, and it's about how the Internet as we know it almost didn't exist. TIM BERNERS-LEE: We didn't have, really, the words anyway. People didn't have click and web page. RAZ: This is Tim Berners-Lee. BERNERS-LEE: So I could show them clicking on a link, and they would say, big deal. I've got links on my online documentation. But they'd all lead within same CD-ROM. And you'd say well, imagine if that link could have gone anywhere in the world to any document anywhere. And then they'd say yeah - yeah, right - you know, yeah sure. RAZ: Yeah, right. BERNERS-LEE: So they couldn't imagine it. RAZ: By the way, Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web, which is different from. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: The Internet, the INET, the Net - you've heard of it, but what is it? RAZ: By 1989, the Internet had already been around for about two decades. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Think of the Internet as a network of communication networks. RAZ: Email existed, but not much else. And there wasn't a universal way for computers to access information on other computers. So cut to Tim who was getting really tired of this problem. He was a programmer at the time with CERN, the European physics lab. BERNERS-LEE: The frustration that - you know what? - actually, every time I get a piece of paper on my desk, there is a disk somewhere that's going round and round with that file on it. RAZ: Yeah. BERNERS-LEE: So there was this realization that life could be - that it would be very, very cool if, in fact, all of these documents appeared to be part of one big interconnected mesh. RAZ: So Tim and some colleagues at CERN went to work building a system that would do that - that would make office life easier and data sharing on the Internet possible for anyone, and they called it the World Wide Web. But around the same time - again, this is the early '90s - a similar system was already gaining in popularity, and that system was called Gopher. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: In Gopher space, as it's called, you literally burrow through hierarchies of menus with increasing specificity until you reach your level of interest. RAZ: This is some of the only audio we could find. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Gopher is easy to navigate and easy to browse. RAZ: That even proves gopher was ever a thing. It's a U. S. government training video about the Internet from the early '90s. BERNERS-LEE: Gopher was a campuswide information system from the University of Minnesota. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Watch as we burrow through the BTS gopher site. RAZ: In the early '90s, Gopher was actually taking off faster. . . BERNERS-LEE: . . . Faster. . . RAZ: . . . Than the World Wide Web. . . BERNERS-LEE: . . . If you looked at the traffic on the Internet. . . RAZ: . . . Until the University of Minnesota announced. . . BERNERS-LEE: Just in some cases, if you were running the server - not the client - then maybe, just a very, very small fee. RAZ: The University wanted to charge people to use its system to navigate the Internet. And by charging money, the University had signaled that Gopher would be proprietary, a completely closed system. And this was fundamentally different from Tim's idea for the World Wide Web. BERNERS-LEE: The crucial thing about the World Wide Web actually is the URLs. So for the thing to work, anybody anywhere who ran a computer that had some information which should be available to other people should make up one of these URLs for each document. That is a massive ask. You can't ask that and also ask other things. You can't say, you must use my particular type of computer. You can't say, you must use my particular browser. You can't say, and you must pay me 0. 001 cents per click when everybody clicks on it. RAZ: Which is why the moment the University of Minnesota announced it would charge money for Gopher. . . BERNERS-LEE: At that point, the Gopher traffic on the Internet dropped off. RAZ: Wow. BERNERS-LEE: People came to me and said, Tim, what is the story with the Web? Can we - is this going to happen - is CERN going to do this? RAZ: They wanted to know as the Web was coming into wider use, what assurances did they have that Tim wouldn't do the same thing with the web as the University of Minnesota did with Gopher? So a few weeks later, Tim convinced his bosses at CERN to draft an official announcement. It was signed on April 30, 1993, and the crucial part reads, CERN relinquishes all intellectual property rights to this code for anyone to use. BERNERS-LEE: We will not charge royalties for this basically. RAZ: Wow. BERNERS-LEE: It will be royalty-free. RAZ: You could have decided that you were going to just be proprietary. This is going to make you an incredible fortune, and that was that. And you decided not to do that. BERNERS-LEE: Well, you're making a bit of an assumption there. You're making the assumption that if I had turned around and said, I want the patents on this, and I'll see you later, then you're making the assumption that then it would have taken off to be the huge thing that it is now. RAZ: Yeah. BERNERS-LEE: But that's obviously wrong. There were lots and lots and lots of people doing really cool things on the Internet. RAZ: Yeah. BERNERS-LEE: If it hadn't been open. . . RAZ: It wouldn't have worked. BERNERS-LEE: It wouldn't have taken off. That's the idea. RAZ: Today, we have a phrase for this idea - the idea that creating things freely and in the open sometimes leads to results you never thought possible, and we call it open-source. BERNERS-LEE: And it has to be open. If it hadn't been open, it would have been a walled garden, and the moment you start a walled garden, people look at it, and they say oh, that looks lucrative. We can do that better. And we would have had all these independent system, and those programs wouldn't work together. You wouldn't have been able to follow a link from one to the other. So basically, the Web would never - I don't think it would have got the critical mass. RAZ: On the show today, TED speakers put the idea of open-source to work in the worlds of technology, design, robotics and democracy. And they make the case for why an open-source world is a better world. By the way, you can see all of Tim Berners-Lee's talks on the beginnings of the World Wide Web at ted. com. GUY RAZ, HOST:  It's the TED RADIO HOUR from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. So here's a story. It starts in 1989, and it's about how the Internet as we know it almost didn't exist. TIM BERNERS-LEE: We didn't have, really, the words anyway. People didn't have click and web page. RAZ: This is Tim Berners-Lee. BERNERS-LEE: So I could show them clicking on a link, and they would say, big deal. I've got links on my online documentation. But they'd all lead within same CD-ROM. And you'd say well, imagine if that link could have gone anywhere in the world to any document anywhere. And then they'd say yeah - yeah, right - you know, yeah sure. RAZ: Yeah, right. BERNERS-LEE: So they couldn't imagine it. RAZ: By the way, Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web, which is different from. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN: The Internet, the INET, the Net - you've heard of it, but what is it? RAZ: By 1989, the Internet had already been around for about two decades. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Think of the Internet as a network of communication networks. RAZ: Email existed, but not much else. And there wasn't a universal way for computers to access information on other computers. So cut to Tim who was getting really tired of this problem. He was a programmer at the time with CERN, the European physics lab. BERNERS-LEE: The frustration that - you know what? - actually, every time I get a piece of paper on my desk, there is a disk somewhere that's going round and round with that file on it. RAZ: Yeah. BERNERS-LEE: So there was this realization that life could be - that it would be very, very cool if, in fact, all of these documents appeared to be part of one big interconnected mesh. RAZ: So Tim and some colleagues at CERN went to work building a system that would do that - that would make office life easier and data sharing on the Internet possible for anyone, and they called it the World Wide Web. But around the same time - again, this is the early '90s - a similar system was already gaining in popularity, and that system was called Gopher. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: In Gopher space, as it's called, you literally burrow through hierarchies of menus with increasing specificity until you reach your level of interest. RAZ: This is some of the only audio we could find. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Gopher is easy to navigate and easy to browse. RAZ: That even proves gopher was ever a thing. It's a U. S. government training video about the Internet from the early '90s. BERNERS-LEE: Gopher was a campuswide information system from the University of Minnesota. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Watch as we burrow through the BTS gopher site. RAZ: In the early '90s, Gopher was actually taking off faster. . . BERNERS-LEE: . . . Faster. . . RAZ: . . . Than the World Wide Web. . . BERNERS-LEE: . . . If you looked at the traffic on the Internet. . . RAZ: . . . Until the University of Minnesota announced. . . BERNERS-LEE: Just in some cases, if you were running the server - not the client - then maybe, just a very, very small fee. RAZ: The University wanted to charge people to use its system to navigate the Internet. And by charging money, the University had signaled that Gopher would be proprietary, a completely closed system. And this was fundamentally different from Tim's idea for the World Wide Web. BERNERS-LEE: The crucial thing about the World Wide Web actually is the URLs. So for the thing to work, anybody anywhere who ran a computer that had some information which should be available to other people should make up one of these URLs for each document. That is a massive ask. You can't ask that and also ask other things. You can't say, you must use my particular type of computer. You can't say, you must use my particular browser. You can't say, and you must pay me 0. 001 cents per click when everybody clicks on it. RAZ: Which is why the moment the University of Minnesota announced it would charge money for Gopher. . . BERNERS-LEE: At that point, the Gopher traffic on the Internet dropped off. RAZ: Wow. BERNERS-LEE: People came to me and said, Tim, what is the story with the Web? Can we - is this going to happen - is CERN going to do this? RAZ: They wanted to know as the Web was coming into wider use, what assurances did they have that Tim wouldn't do the same thing with the web as the University of Minnesota did with Gopher? So a few weeks later, Tim convinced his bosses at CERN to draft an official announcement. It was signed on April 30, 1993, and the crucial part reads, CERN relinquishes all intellectual property rights to this code for anyone to use. BERNERS-LEE: We will not charge royalties for this basically. RAZ: Wow. BERNERS-LEE: It will be royalty-free. RAZ: You could have decided that you were going to just be proprietary. This is going to make you an incredible fortune, and that was that. And you decided not to do that. BERNERS-LEE: Well, you're making a bit of an assumption there. You're making the assumption that if I had turned around and said, I want the patents on this, and I'll see you later, then you're making the assumption that then it would have taken off to be the huge thing that it is now. RAZ: Yeah. BERNERS-LEE: But that's obviously wrong. There were lots and lots and lots of people doing really cool things on the Internet. RAZ: Yeah. BERNERS-LEE: If it hadn't been open. . . RAZ: It wouldn't have worked. BERNERS-LEE: It wouldn't have taken off. That's the idea. RAZ: Today, we have a phrase for this idea - the idea that creating things freely and in the open sometimes leads to results you never thought possible, and we call it open-source. BERNERS-LEE: And it has to be open. If it hadn't been open, it would have been a walled garden, and the moment you start a walled garden, people look at it, and they say oh, that looks lucrative. We can do that better. And we would have had all these independent system, and those programs wouldn't work together. You wouldn't have been able to follow a link from one to the other.

Now, if you don't have a Hollywood lighting designer coming over tonight, you might turn that little dial switch on the wall to suggest a little romance - the dimmer switch. From WHYY's The Pulse in Philadelphia, Todd Bookman has the back story to one of the great American inventions. TODD BOOKMAN, BYLINE: Joel Spira's mother was a knockout and this undoubtedly affected the course of his life. SUSAN HAKKARAINEN: He was always very aware of esthetics because his mother was a model in New York City. BOOKMAN: Spira was family to not only lookers but also very successful, driven people. His dad used to frequent speakeasies before gaining a seat on the state liquor board. His father-in-law started an electronics company, then a giant magazine publishing business. HAKKARAINEN: His sister ended up going into the art world and became the number two at the Guggenheim, so there's always been this right brain, left brain, the arts and the sciences in our family very Bauhaus. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)BOOKMAN: This is Joel Spira's daughter Susan Hakkarainen. Her dad earned a physics degree before moving to New York City. It was there in his Manhattan apartment in 1959 where his tinkering would result in the device that forever changed the way humans see each other. It was a new type of transistor that dramatically shrunk the hardware required to lower the lights - the dimmer switch. Spira grabbed a patent and formed Lutron Electronics, which is still based in Coopersburg, Pa. Lutron didn't market the dimmer to electricians or contractors. Instead, Spira wanted to appeal to a different audience - to women, to wives interested in perhaps generating a little extra spice at home. Picture \"Mad Men's\" Betty Draper, bored in the suburbs. The company called its dimmer the Capri. Susan Hakkarainen says every detail of the ad campaign was considered, right down to the packaging. HAKKARAINEN: He was looking for a box that was attractive and he found that a company did an overrun of perfume boxes. This box manufacturer had these beautiful perfume boxes and he said, you know what? I'll take these off your hands. And just print my name on it and these were beautiful boxes when everybody else was doing industrial boxes. BOOKMAN: Along with the nice boxes, he set up displays in New York department stores like E. J. Korvettes, so women could experience the dial for themselves. A side-by-side promotional photo shows a stay-at-home mom sipping coffee under bright lights. But when they get dimmed, out comes a domestic goddess, a half-acre of decolletage on display, her face softly burning with desire. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MICHAEL PESSINA: The theme in the early days was dial romance. BOOKMAN: Michael Pessina is the current president of Lutron. He says the Don Draper-style campaign was built around the idea that kids could still do their homework after school at the dining room table. But once they were safely tucked in, the adults could ponder making more kids at the turn of a knob. PESSINA: 'Cause there's nothing more romantic than that beautiful flicker of a candlelight and the dimming technology could allow that to happen. So any light for any need or any use of the space and the dining room was nice place for that. BOOKMAN: The dimmer's been expanded beyond the dining room and into the living room and eventually the bedroom. It gave these spaces access to the secrets of Hollywood lighting designers. The low light softens hard edges, the wayward hairs, the bags under our eyes. It glances off surfaces rather than spotlighting them. Today, Lutron manufactures thousands of other products and Joel Spira's name is on hundreds of patents. But he'll be forever remembered for the dimmer. In 2010, the original was added to the Smithsonian's collection. Michael Pessina joined Spira at the unveiling. PESSINA: And as they took the shroud off the case, there was one of Alexander Graham Bell's original telegraphs. There was a Thomas Edison lightbulb and there was Joel Spira's light dimmer, first notebook and original prototype. And I looked at him and he couldn't say a word. BOOKMAN: Joel Spira was still the face of the company when he passed away in April of this year at the age of 88. He's survived by his wife of six decades, Ruth, and their three daughters, including Susan. HAKKARAINEN: They were always romantic, and we'd always get from my father - all of us daughters would get chocolates on Valentine's Day from your secret admirer. BOOKMAN: Chocolates, love notes, nicknames - this guy was smooth. And with his invention, the rest of us could feel a little smoother, too. For NPR News, I'm Todd Bookman in Philadelphia.

But when it comes to TV and movies, Cubans have been watching pretty much the same stuff as the rest of us. Nick Miroff is The Washington Post Latin America correspondent. He joins us from Havana. Hi, Nick. Thanks for being with us. NICK MIROFF: My pleasure. Good to be with you, Rachel. MARTIN: How is it that Cubans have been able to watch shows like \"Friends,\" \"Seinfeld,\" all kinds of TV shows that we in the U. S. have been watching for decades? How are they getting access to these shows? MIROFF: Well, it's pretty simple. They just rip them off blatantly. MARTIN: (Laughter). MIROFF: You know, their attitude is that if the United States is going to put a trade embargo on the country and make almost all forms of commerce impossible, then they're just going to help themselves to as much free American media as they want. So the result is that Cuban state television shows American movies and American programming without paying any royalties. And that, I think, it's - you know, in some ways, contributed to a broader culture of piracy and bootlegging. So on the streets of Havana and other Cuban cities, you can get bootleg copies of movies, DVDs, music, video games - that sort of thing. MARTIN: But we find black markets like this in all kinds of developing countries around the world. But you're saying this is government-sanctioned. It's the government that's putting out these shows sometimes on TV? MIROFF: That's right 'cause the government controls the airwaves. And at some point, they realized that if they wanted to get Cubans to watch their programming and absorb some of the political messages that are a big part of what's on state TV, then they have to show stuff that people really wanted to watch. MARTIN: So is this something that U. S. officials are OK with? MIROFF: No, it's not something they're OK with, but it's not a priority either. So when the commerce secretary, Penny Pritzker, was here a couple weeks ago, I asked her if this is one of the things she brought up with them. And she said, no, but that it was on their broader agenda. Cuba has its own complaints about U. S. -patented trademark violation having to do with the appropriation of Cuban tobacco and Havana Club, which is Cuba's most famous rum brand. So the dispute goes both ways. And it's one of these things that's going to have to be worked out as the two countries restore and normalize relations. MARTIN: Is it in some way to the U. S. government's advantage to turn a blind eye because essentially it's kind of an exercise in soft power, that Cubans are absorbing Western culture? And maybe from an American perspective, that's not a bad thing? MIROFF: Yeah, I mean, I think you could make the argument that an episode of \"Friends,\" you know, that shows, you know, happy Americans living prosperous lives and, you know, not looking like somebody who be your enemy, I think that also - you know, that has a very profound psychological and cultural impact, right? So probably, you know, in the long term, that may be one of the reasons why the U. S. doesn't view it as such of a threat. And not to mention the fact that Cuba's such a tiny, relatively small market for, you know, this type of export. MARTIN: Nick Miroff of The Washington Post joining us on the line from Havana.

But even when there's good public transit, there are problems. Buses or trains may not run when you need them, and they might take too long, or stops may not be near your neighborhood. Well, today, we're going to hear how some people think the digital age could change things for the better. It's the latest in the NPR Cities Project. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Becoming a world-class city. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Keep the transit running. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: We have to move people a lot more efficiently. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Come take a ride of the future. SIEGEL: Transit operators, city planners, people in the federal government are all banking on big data to make public transportation more responsive to people's needs. NPR's Franklyn Cater has been exploring that here in Washington, D. C. FRANKLYN CATER, BYLINE: I wanted some examples of the emerging tech industry that's trying to make public transportation better. So for starters, I met up with a guy who's in the business. DAG GOGUE: Hi. I'm Dag Gogue, founder and CEO of Transit Labs based in Washington, D. C. CATER: What do you think? Should we find a bus stop? GOGUE: Yeah. Why don't we try to get on the bus stop by the corner of K and 15th? CATER: Transit Labs is a startup that merges a very analog thing - the act of moving people around town - with a very digital enterprise - data analysis. The basic idea is this. The more information you have about how the system is working, the more you can improve it. GOGUE: This timetable gives you the expected wait time. CATER: Dag Gogue gestures at the Plexiglas wall at this stop. There's a chart that shows different bus routes and times. It's pretty low-tech. It tells riders what the schedule is supposed to be. It says nothing about how far away the next bus really is. But these days, buses are getting higher-tech. Cities can buy them with all kinds of gadgets onboard that generate data. One of those gadgets is called an automatic vehicle locator. GOGUE: You use a combination of geospatial data so AVL - automated vehicle locaters - will give you the position of all the buses you have. . . CATER: The bus transmits its location in real-time. With software, operators can see instantly where buses get bogged down in traffic, and they can make adjustments. That data is also passed on to riders. If you've ever used a smart phone app to check how long it'll be till the next bus, you've received information from an AVL. It's the kind of thing that makes a bus trip more palatable. Instead of looking wistfully down the street hoping to spot the next bus, you can see it on a screen. GOGUE: So here's a local bus. We can hop on it. CATER: OK. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Fort Totten stationCATER: To see that in action, let's head to a different bus stop outside of Washington. MARY LEE KINGSLEY: I wish all bus stops were like this. CATER: Mary Lee Kingsley is waiting on bus route 47 in an office park in Montgomery County, Md. There's a big LED screen at this stop with a map displaying the location of buses and how long they'll take to arrive. This display and the new lighted shelter that we're standing under have convinced Kingsley to start leaving her car at home. KINGSLEY: I'm a fairly recent convert, but like the people who quit smoking and, you know - I'm now so pro-47 bus. It's ridiculous. CATER: This is exactly the kind of rider a transit agency wants. With gas prices down, bus ridership is trending down a bit nationwide according to the American Public Transportation Association. To encourage riders, agencies want to make service as user-friendly as possible, and this big display is more accurate than the one offered on a smart phone. JOHN VAN ECK: It's within 45 seconds. That's exactly where the bus is. CATER: That's John Van Eck. I also met up with him at this stop. He's the director of IT for this bus system, known as RideOn. VAN ECK: And as you see, Bethesda says zero, and that's the 47 Bethesda right now. So it's right on target. CATER: Montgomery County is an early adopter of these screens, and the choice of where to put them as well as where to put a bus shelter, by the way, is also informed by data. VAN ECK: They're picked by the most active bus stops as counted by ridership. Who's getting on and who's getting off at each bus? The ones that have the most - those were the ones that were picked first. CATER: Those numbers - which stops are used most - come from another onboard bus technology. It's called an automated passenger counter. For more on that, let's get back to that busy bus stop at 15th and K in Washington. We got a real line here. ERICA MAZZA: I love how many buses are out here right now - must be that time of day. CATER: Erica Mazza, deputy general manager for the transit agency in Flagstaff, Ariz. , was visiting Washington for a conference and to tell Congress how much agencies like hers need federal money. Her agency is a customer of Transit Labs, and I met with her to ask about this other key reason for generating and tracking all that transit data. MAZZA: Passenger counters are - have become a critical component for what we do. CATER: Flagstaff has had passenger counters on buses for about a year. And Mazza says understanding how many people are getting on and off the bus at which stops helped her agency redirect buses so they're being used more. They're moving more people - 60,00 more riders last year. And that improved performance gets them more support from the federal government. That's huge for an agency in Arizona, one of a few states with no dedicated tax for transit. MAZZA: Really gave us, you know, about 200-extra-thousand dollars in our operating funds this year. CATER: Now, here on K Street, Washington's big-money boulevard, a skeptic might roll eyes at a local official asking for more money to subsidize buses. But transit analyst Dag Gogue says those buses are necessary. GOGUE: Eighty percent of the U. S. population lives in cities, so we have to find a way to move people around more efficiently. Technology is ready, and we hope that in the next few years the quality of public transportation will increase dramatically. CATER: That's the hope, that with urban populations growing, all that granular data adds up to a sharper, big picture getting the buses where they're needed the most. On K Street in Washington, Franklyn Cater for the NPR Cities Project. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:   A city is easier to live in when it's easy to get around. But even when there's good public transit, there are problems. Buses or trains may not run when you need them, and they might take too long, or stops may not be near your neighborhood. Well, today, we're going to hear how some people think the digital age could change things for the better. It's the latest in the NPR Cities Project. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Becoming a world-class city. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Keep the transit running. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: We have to move people a lot more efficiently. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Come take a ride of the future. SIEGEL: Transit operators, city planners, people in the federal government are all banking on big data to make public transportation more responsive to people's needs. NPR's Franklyn Cater has been exploring that here in Washington, D. C. FRANKLYN CATER, BYLINE: I wanted some examples of the emerging tech industry that's trying to make public transportation better. So for starters, I met up with a guy who's in the business. DAG GOGUE: Hi. I'm Dag Gogue, founder and CEO of Transit Labs based in Washington, D. C. CATER: What do you think? Should we find a bus stop? GOGUE: Yeah. Why don't we try to get on the bus stop by the corner of K and 15th? CATER: Transit Labs is a startup that merges a very analog thing - the act of moving people around town - with a very digital enterprise - data analysis. The basic idea is this. The more information you have about how the system is working, the more you can improve it. GOGUE: This timetable gives you the expected wait time. CATER: Dag Gogue gestures at the Plexiglas wall at this stop. There's a chart that shows different bus routes and times. It's pretty low-tech. It tells riders what the schedule is supposed to be. It says nothing about how far away the next bus really is. But these days, buses are getting higher-tech. Cities can buy them with all kinds of gadgets onboard that generate data. One of those gadgets is called an automatic vehicle locator. GOGUE: You use a combination of geospatial data so AVL - automated vehicle locaters - will give you the position of all the buses you have. . . CATER: The bus transmits its location in real-time. With software, operators can see instantly where buses get bogged down in traffic, and they can make adjustments. That data is also passed on to riders. If you've ever used a smart phone app to check how long it'll be till the next bus, you've received information from an AVL. It's the kind of thing that makes a bus trip more palatable. Instead of looking wistfully down the street hoping to spot the next bus, you can see it on a screen. GOGUE: So here's a local bus. We can hop on it. CATER: OK. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Fort Totten station CATER: To see that in action, let's head to a different bus stop outside of Washington. MARY LEE KINGSLEY: I wish all bus stops were like this. CATER: Mary Lee Kingsley is waiting on bus route 47 in an office park in Montgomery County, Md. There's a big LED screen at this stop with a map displaying the location of buses and how long they'll take to arrive. This display and the new lighted shelter that we're standing under have convinced Kingsley to start leaving her car at home. KINGSLEY: I'm a fairly recent convert, but like the people who quit smoking and, you know - I'm now so pro-47 bus. It's ridiculous. CATER: This is exactly the kind of rider a transit agency wants. With gas prices down, bus ridership is trending down a bit nationwide according to the American Public Transportation Association. To encourage riders, agencies want to make service as user-friendly as possible, and this big display is more accurate than the one offered on a smart phone. JOHN VAN ECK: It's within 45 seconds. That's exactly where the bus is. CATER: That's John Van Eck. I also met up with him at this stop. He's the director of IT for this bus system, known as RideOn. VAN ECK: And as you see, Bethesda says zero, and that's the 47 Bethesda right now. So it's right on target. CATER: Montgomery County is an early adopter of these screens, and the choice of where to put them as well as where to put a bus shelter, by the way, is also informed by data. VAN ECK: They're picked by the most active bus stops as counted by ridership. Who's getting on and who's getting off at each bus? The ones that have the most - those were the ones that were picked first. CATER: Those numbers - which stops are used most - come from another onboard bus technology. It's called an automated passenger counter. For more on that, let's get back to that busy bus stop at 15th and K in Washington. We got a real line here. ERICA MAZZA: I love how many buses are out here right now - must be that time of day. CATER: Erica Mazza, deputy general manager for the transit agency in Flagstaff, Ariz. , was visiting Washington for a conference and to tell Congress how much agencies like hers need federal money. Her agency is a customer of Transit Labs, and I met with her to ask about this other key reason for generating and tracking all that transit data. MAZZA: Passenger counters are - have become a critical component for what we do. CATER: Flagstaff has had passenger counters on buses for about a year. And Mazza says understanding how many people are getting on and off the bus at which stops helped her agency redirect buses so they're being used more. They're moving more people - 60,00 more riders last year. And that improved performance gets them more support from the federal government. That's huge for an agency in Arizona, one of a few states with no dedicated tax for transit. MAZZA: Really gave us, you know, about 200-extra-thousand dollars in our operating funds this year. CATER: Now, here on K Street, Washington's big-money boulevard, a skeptic might roll eyes at a local official asking for more money to subsidize buses. But transit analyst Dag Gogue says those buses are necessary. GOGUE: Eighty percent of the U. S. population lives in cities, so we have to find a way to move people around more efficiently. Technology is ready, and we hope that in the next few years the quality of public transportation will increase dramatically. CATER: That's the hope, that with urban populations growing, all that granular data adds up to a sharper, big picture getting the buses where they're needed the most.

You see 10 pedestrians stroll into the street just a few yards ahead of you. The car's going too fast to brake and miss them, so would you steer your car to try to miss them and possibly injure yourself? But if it's a driverless car, would you even get to make that choice? We're going to talk now to somebody who studies some of the ethical questions that are raised by autonomous vehicles. Patrick Lin, associate professor of philosophy at Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo, Calif. , thanks very much for being with us. PATRICK LIN: You're welcome. Glad to be here, Scott. SIMON: There was a survey put up by MIT that asked questions along these lines, right? LIN: Right, right. SIMON: What did you notice in the survey when you looked at it? LIN: Well, you know, so that's not the first survey done on this topic. There have been other surveys. And they had similar results, which is that people are split on the idea of how a driverless or autonomous car should behave. I think the one thing that stood out to me is that there's going to be a lot more work needed in this field here. One problem with surveys is that what people say in surveys isn't necessarily how they would actually choose in real life. SIMON: Yeah. LIN: They might not always know what it is they want. SIMON: Yeah, I mean, 'cause it does seem to me just anecdotally that probably not a month goes by we don't read about some traffic accident where somebody said, you know, I just couldn't stop. They pulled into the lane, they walked across the street. And I must say, as a rule, society doesn't blame them for making an unethical choice to save their own life, even if the crash results in killing others. LIN: Right. If it's a human-driven car, what you have there is just an accident. It's a reflex. Maybe you have bad reflexes. But we understand that that's just a reflex, it's not premeditated. But when you're talking about how we ought to program a robot car, now you're talking about pre-scripting the accident, right? So this is a difference between an accidental accident and a deliberate accident. So there's a big difference there legally and ethically. SIMON: Would somebody get into a driverless car if they thought the algorithms of that car would essentially say, I'm not going to let you run into that school bus and kill people, you're going to die instead? LIN: I think they would. So, for instance, anytime you get in a driven car by someone else, you're at risk. Studies have shown that if you're a human driver and you're about to be in a crash, you're going to reflexively turn away from the crash. This usually means that you expose your passengers to that accident. But that doesn't paralyze us when we step into a car. SIMON: At the same time, though, Professor, I mean, I think it's going to be hard for people to think of an algorithm making that decision for us. LIN: That's right. I mean, it's a weird thing to think about. But that's exactly what we're doing when we're creating robots and artificial intelligence. They're taking over human roles, from being our chauffeur to our stock market trader to our airline pilot to whatever. We've got to do some soul-searching. And then we have to ask, well, should robots and AI mimic humans - do what we do - or should they even do something differently? So robot ethics and human ethics could be two different things. But when we talk about programming cars or making any kind of robots, it's a good exercise in how humans behave and how we ought to behave.

Thanks so much for being with us. JIM STEYER: Great to be here, Scott. SIMON: So what do they watch for nine hours? Or what do they do? STEYER: Well, first of all, the sheer volume is just phenomenal. The idea that nine hours a day, not including time spent in school, is how much time our teens are spending with media and technology just shows you how central it is to their lives. It's really like the air they breathe now. And they do various different kinds of thing. There's not one stereotype of kid. So some are heavy video game players. Some love social media. Others just like to sit back and watch TV or listen to music. But they are doing nine hours a day, on average, of media and technology, and it is really shaping their lives. SIMON: You found that girls spend more time on social media than boys. An interesting subfact, if you will, is that, according to your findings, only about 1 of 3 teenagers who are on social media say that they like it, quote, \"a lot. \"STEYER: That's right, Scott. I think both of those facts are really interesting in terms of this study. First of all, there are stark differences between boys and girls. But the other fact you mention, the fact that only a third of kids like social media, is really startling. It's much more of a utility to them. It's not something like TV or music, that they just love to do and spend time with. It's something they feel they have to do. And I think that's one of most interesting statistics of the entire study. SIMON: What did you find in this survey, Mr. Steyer, that might worry you the most, as a citizen and maybe a parent? STEYER: As the parent of four kids and as a longtime educator, I think that stat that really struck me in a concerning way was the fact that 2 out of 3 students in this massive survey said that they multitask while doing their homework. That means that they are reading Shakespeare, hopefully, but also, at the same time, on their Facebook or Instagram account or Snapchatting or texting with their friends. And the truth is, research from some of my colleagues at Stanford and elsewhere make it clear that you cannot concentrate effectively on two things at once and that multitasking gets in the way of concentration and good study habits. So the fact that 2 out of 3 teens in this country are multitasking while doing their homework is a major message to parents and teachers across the country. SIMON: I'm sorry. I didn't get that last part. I was just posting on Facebook. STEYER: (Laughter) Yes, and I was too busy texting to remember what I actually said to you, Scott. SIMON: (Laughter) Are we being just a little bit fussy because I try to remember that Nancy Hanks told her son Abe Lincoln that he spent too much time with his head in a book? STEYER: So I think what we need to do when we see such a robust study like this is pause, recognize that we are in a new era of childhood and adolescence, and it's up to all of us to try to make this a very positive part of our lives. SIMON: So are ideas like digital cleanses as, maybe, unavailing as trying to diet that way? STEYER: No, I actually think that digital cleanses, or just taking time out away from technology and media, are great things. I mean, one of the clear messages from this study is that parents need to be role models around this. If you're constantly glued to your phone or putting that device in the middle of your dinner table, what kind of message is that sending to your youngster? So I think that, in a funny way, parents have as much to learn from this study as kids do. And it's incumbent upon parents to make sure that smart and thoughtful, balanced use of technology is part of parenting 101 in the decades ahead.

Make-America-great-again hats are among the campaign's major expenses, as a matter of fact. Fans of Ted Cruz get a smartphone app. The Texas senator's campaign is hoping that app will motivate voters to volunteer and also to turn over a lot of personal information. NPR's Scott Detrow reports. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Linda Stickle is a really, really big fan of Ted Cruz. When we meet in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Stickle has a Ted Cruz sticker on her sweater and a Ted Cruz sticker on her phone. And this, she says, is toned down. She's a little tired because the night before, she stayed up to watch Cruz's late-night Senate floor attack on the new budget agreement. LINDA STICKLE: Anybody that knows me knows what I'm going to talk about. DETROW: Stickle is all in as a Cruz volunteer. She's had the senator over to her house for a fundraiser and is the campaign's Jones County chair. These days, a lot of her organizing is done through the campaign's app. Can you show me how it works? STICKLE: Well, I can try (laughter). DETROW: The app has information about upcoming campaign events among other things. But most importantly, the app is designed as a game to keep supporters on Cruz's team. People earn points by signing up to volunteer or donating money. Most of these options allow users like Stickle to share posts on their social networks. STICKLE: So that instantly went to my friends. Every one of my friends sees this, has the ability to share it. DETROW: Stickle swipes over to another screen on the app. So this is your phonebook here. STICKLE: This is my phonebook, actually. Yes, and I can send to them, I support Ted Cruz; I invite you to get on board, tedcruz. org. DETROW: What the Cruz app also does is gather information about people's social networks and friend groups. If a supporter shares their entire phone contact list, they earn 250 points in the app. Donations only get 10 points. CHRIS WILSON: While we don't keep anything that they share, what it does allow us to do is identify, within a person's contact list, those voters who may be part of our core targeting list. DETROW: Chris Wilson is the Cruz campaign's director of research and analytics. He's looking for information - names, addresses, phone numbers - that match up with possible Cruz voters. WILSON: We have scored the entire national voter file in terms of their likelihood to support Ted Cruz. And so if we identify that you have 10 friends in Iowa who are potential Cruz supporters, then we'll ask you to reach out to those people. DETROW: The app also looks for other personal information. It asks users to sign different petitions to get a sense of what issues motivate them. Scoreboards track top point earners. When I meet Linda Stickle, she has about 10,000 points. As active as Stickle is, there's another Iowan out there with more than 50,000. Wait, check that. STICKLE: Oh, she put on a whole bunch more points. She's got 61,000 points. KAY QUIRK: I've been, for the most part, retired. I am on social media every day. DETROW: Meet Kay Quirk, another county chair for Ted Cruz. Quirk is always posting Facebook and Twitter updates. Today, it's a funny picture reminding people about an upcoming debate. QUIRK: If people like that, then I get more points on my Cruz Crew app. I get five points for every like I get. DETROW: Quirk is light-years ahead of every other Iowan who uses Cruz's app, so far ahead that Linda Stickle has given up trying to catch her. In Cedar Rapids, Stickle eyes her closest competition on the Iowa scoreboard. STICKLE: So I would say if I have any competition, I'm going to, like, really work hard to beat Dominic today (laughter). That's my goal. DETROW: A worthy goal, but a goal Stickle says she puts in context. Given the choice between topping the leader board and seeing Ted Cruz in the White House, Stickle says she'd rather see a Cruz victory. Scott Detrow, NPR News.

These days, a lot of her organizing is done through the campaign's app. Can you show me how it works? STICKLE: Well, I can try (laughter). DETROW: The app has information about upcoming campaign events among other things. But most importantly, the app is designed as a game to keep supporters on Cruz's team. People earn points by signing up to volunteer or donating money. Most of these options allow users like Stickle to share posts on their social networks. STICKLE: So that instantly went to my friends. Every one of my friends sees this, has the ability to share it. DETROW: Stickle swipes over to another screen on the app. So this is your phonebook here. STICKLE: This is my phonebook, actually. Yes, and I can send to them, I support Ted Cruz; I invite you to get on board, tedcruz. org. DETROW: What the Cruz app also does is gather information about people's social networks and friend groups. If a supporter shares their entire phone contact list, they earn 250 points in the app. Donations only get 10 points. CHRIS WILSON: While we don't keep anything that they share, what it does allow us to do is identify, within a person's contact list, those voters who may be part of our core targeting list. DETROW: Chris Wilson is the Cruz campaign's director of research and analytics. He's looking for information - names, addresses, phone numbers - that match up with possible Cruz voters. WILSON: We have scored the entire national voter file in terms of their likelihood to support Ted Cruz. And so if we identify that you have 10 friends in Iowa who are potential Cruz supporters, then we'll ask you to reach out to those people. DETROW: The app also looks for other personal information. It asks users to sign different petitions to get a sense of what issues motivate them. Scoreboards track top point earners. When I meet Linda Stickle, she has about 10,000 points. As active as Stickle is, there's another Iowan out there with more than 50,000. Wait, check that. STICKLE: Oh, she put on a whole bunch more points. She's got 61,000 points. KAY QUIRK: I've been, for the most part, retired. I am on social media every day. DETROW: Meet Kay Quirk, another county chair for Ted Cruz. Quirk is always posting Facebook and Twitter updates. Today, it's a funny picture reminding people about an upcoming debate. QUIRK: If people like that, then I get more points on my Cruz Crew app. I get five points for every like I get. DETROW: Quirk is light-years ahead of every other Iowan who uses Cruz's app, so far ahead that Linda Stickle has given up trying to catch her. In Cedar Rapids, Stickle eyes her closest competition on the Iowa scoreboard. STICKLE: So I would say if I have any competition, I'm going to, like, really work hard to beat Dominic today (laughter). That's my goal. DETROW: A worthy goal, but a goal Stickle says she puts in context. Given the choice between topping the leader board and seeing Ted Cruz in the White House, Stickle says she'd rather see a Cruz victory.

It's a question that presidential candidates cannot avoid. NPR's Scott Detrow reports. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: The presidential candidates have mostly stayed away from discussing the NSA's surveillance programs until this week. Speaking to MSNBC, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush called for the repeal of one of the key reforms to happen in the wake of NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden's revelations. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JEB BUSH: I think we need to restore the metadata program, which was part of the Patriot Act, and it expires in the next few months. I think that was a useful tool to keep us safe. DETROW: Bush is talking about an NSA program that sucks up and stores millions of phone records every day. Earlier this year, Congress passed and President Obama signed a new law that will take the data out of the government's hands later this month. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio says that was a mistake. This week, he told a Wall Street Journal forum, the vote should now be a key issue in the Republican primary. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARCO RUBIO: At least two of my colleagues in the Senate aspiring to the presidency, Sen. Cruz in particular, have voted to weaken the U. S. intelligence programs just in the last month and a half. DETROW: Indeed, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz played a big role in the debate over the metadata changes. His office even produced a movie trailer-like video about the new law. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)TED CRUZ: This legislation protects the constitutional rights of privacy under the Fourth Amendment, while maintaining important tools to protect national security and law enforcement. DETROW: Just to be clear, the data will still be collected. But as of November 29, the phone companies will hold onto the information until a judge approves individual requests. STEPHEN VLADECK: The same information is in the same lockbox. Now the government has to get an extra key to open that lockbox. DETROW: Stephen Vladeck teaches national security law at American University. He's not surprised domestic surveillance is becoming a campaign trail topic. Vladeck says it's a natural wedge issue for traditional Republican hawks like Rubio and more libertarian-minded lawmakers like Cruz. On top of that, the law professor says viewpoints naturally shift after attacks like Paris. VLADECK: You know, it's easy when we're years away from particularly serious incidents to look at the Snowden disclosures and to look at the need for tighter reform of what the government's doing in the immediate aftermath of episodes like the Paris attacks. You know, it's completely inevitable that at least some folks are going to call for far greater surveillance authorities. DETROW: This summer, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul dismissed worries about terrorism during a marathon floor speech. RAND PAUL: Some people are so fearful. They're like, how could we get terrorists? We'll be overrun with terrorists, and ISIS will be in every drugstore and in every house in America if we don't get rid of the Constitution, if we don't let the Fourth Amendment lapse.

Did you remember that? Did you even know it existed? The fact is that complaints about unwanted calls are up. Regulators say telemarketing and robocalling top their list of consumer complaints. NPR's Yuki Noguchi explains why it is hard to put an end to unwanted calls. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: David Allred memorizes the numbers of the companies that are annoying him. Apparently, there's a security firm out of Three Rivers, Texas, offering free service if he'll put a sign in his yard. DAVID ALLRED: A company out of Florida comes on the line immediately and says, this is your credit card company. And then they go, oh, there's nothing to be alarmed about. We want to introduce you to this new rate - blah, blah, blah, so forth. I get, you know, a half-a-dozen calls a day - every single day. NOGUCHI: You know, it's funny. I get that same credit card one from Florida. ALLRED: (Laughter). They get around. NOGUCHI: Allred gets these calls on his landline and his cell phone. He thought about getting rid of his landline, but the cell phone reception at his home isn't good. He's complained to the authorities and phone companies to no avail. ALLRED: They're interrupting my day. They're taking my minutes that I'm paying for on my cell phone. If I want to buy you, I'll seek you out. NOGUCHI: Allred is certainly not alone. BIKRAM BANDY: At the FTC, we receive more complaints about Do Not Call and robocalls than anything else. NOGUCHI: Bikram Bandy is coordinator for the Federal Trade Commission's Do Not Call Registry. He says it's illegal for marketers to use auto-dialing systems, whether a consumer is on the registry or not. But there are plenty of scofflaws out there, and it's very difficult for regulators to stop them. Bandy says the ability to make calls over the Internet has made it extremely easy and cheap to place a huge number of calls at once. BANDY: A lot of these illegal telemarketing operations are actually generating their calls from overseas, which makes law enforcement more difficult. It makes it harder for us to track it down. It makes it harder for us to stop it. NOGUCHI: It's also hard because the it you're trying to stop is a moving target. Aaron Foss is founder of Nomorobo, a software company that helps users stop some unwanted calls by blocking suspicious incoming numbers that come in over the Internet. The system also enables users to report those to the FTC. AARON FOSS: Every day, Nomorobo adds over 400 new numbers to the blacklist. NOGUCHI: Scammers can be creative. Foss says, a few months ago, companies started trying something new. FOSS: You'll your own phone number and your own name ringing on your own home phone. NOGUCHI: That not only triggered the recipient to pick up the phone, it also tied their hands in terms of fighting back. FOSS: They can't report that number. You know, nobody's going to report themselves to the FTC. NOGUCHI: Tim Marvin directs endrobocalls. org, a Consumers Union campaign that started in February and has signed up more than half-a-million supporters. TIM MARVIN: We're expecting another uptick in robocalls to cell phones. NOGUCHI: For one thing, political campaigns are allowed to robocall. Secondly, he says, the Budget Act signed into law this month, for example, loosens the law to allow debt collectors to use robocalls to collect on federally backed debt, likes student loans. MARVIN: We really think that phone companies should be stopping this before they get to our phone. We think that they have the ability and the technology to stop these. And we're, frankly, not exactly sure why they won't act to give something customers so clearly want. NOGUCHI: CTIA, an association representing the wireless carriers, said in a statement it is working to stop unwanted calling. It also recommends third-party cell phone apps that block calls.

Who knew they still were? VHS tapes dominated the market from the 1980s until the DVD, and they're now disappearing with downloads. We're joined by Bill Hammack. He's an engineering professor at the University of Illinois and host of the popular YouTube channel, the Engineer Guy. Thanks very much for being with us, Bill. BILL HAMMACK: Glad to be here, Scott. SIMON: Looking back, with your sense of history, why did Beta lose out to VHS? HAMMACK: Well, at first, it's a little bit puzzling. I actually have a Betamax machine in my studio, and it is a beautiful machine. It is heavy. It's very smooth in how it operates, but that's the first part of the problem. At first, the VHS machine was much lighter than the Betamax. The Betamax weighed about 36 pounds, the VHS 29 pounds. And that doesn't sound like a big deal, but when you're mass manufacturing an object, it impacts everything from material costs to assembly time to shipping costs. So at the low end of the market, the VHS machines were cheaper than Sony's Betamax. And second, the earliest Betamax played for only one hour. That's the maximum size of the tape. And from the very beginning, VHS was able to play for two hours, so they could get a whole movie. And then that's where the ultimate killer came in - is Betamax focused its energies on timeshifting. And their ads featured headlines like, watch whatever, whenever. And JVC, the maker of VHS, created relationships with the nascent video rental industry. And as that market grew, the VHS grew. And for a while, you could find both types of cassettes on the shelves, but then VHS just took over. SIMON: There are lots of examples of this sort of thing, isn't there, when there's an emerging technology? It goes in one direction, and then somebody wins and somebody loses. HAMMACK: Yeah, and there's also a lot of cases where these technologies were just a little bit before their time. I mean, one of favorites is the picture phone. It came out from Bell Labs - or Bell Telephone, actually, in the mid-1960s. And if you're a man of my age, you can remember seeing these at the EPCOT Centers and world's fairs. And Bell. . . SIMON: The movie \"Seven Days In May\" made a big. . . HAMMACK: Yes. SIMON: . . . thing of picture phones, yeah. HAMMACK: Yes. Yes, they did (laughter). And that was about - that was exactly about the right era for that. And Bell spent some half billion dollars in order to create an amazing network, where they anticipated that they would have a billion-dollar business by 1980, that they'd have 12 million subscribers by the year 2000. Yet, what happened was 71 people used it in its first year. And then six years later, that fell to zero. But what they did almost brought us the Internet because they had little gadgets on these that you could use 35 mm slides. And a business, a person could show data to another person. And so they came very close to developing the Internet in the late '60s, early '70s. But by 1978, they withdrew the phone, and, you know, it lost a half billion dollars for them. SIMON: I always thought the drawback to the picture phone, as I thought it through, was that you can't be in your underwear and talk on the picture phone. HAMMACK: I think that there is quite a bit of truth to that, in that there had to be a culture that would use it. Now, I do notice now that my sister and I use FaceTime a lot. And it used to be that a video conference was always a by appointment. And usually, you were talking to a boss. But now what I'm noticing is that, culturally, people begin to use it just - my sister will ring on in FaceTime instead of making a phone call. So I think that's changing, but it had not changed at the time at all. SIMON: Yeah. Do think there are any tips as to what makes something click and catch on? And what are some of the drawbacks? HAMMACK: Well, you know, I would like a pithy answer to that. But what I always remind students, when looking at engineering failures, is to remember Tolstoy's - the opening to \"Anna Karenina,\" which is - all happy families are alike, but each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. So when these failures we look for kind of a simple, uniform explanation, but really, what we have to do is, we have to go in and look for a very rich and a very textured story. But in general, if you're going to disrupt the technology, you have to bring in something that is substantially new and different. A favorite example of mine is the Dvorak keyboard. We have a certain keyboard called a QWERTY keyboard. You could look at the upper left-hand corner. There's the five letters - Q, W, E, R, T, Y. I guess that's six letters, isn't it? SIMON: (Laughter). HAMMACK: Right? SIMON: Thanks, professor. HAMMACK: Exactly. But they - there was a man named Dvorak who came up with a different kind of keyboard in a different arrangement. And while it did allow people to type faster, it was only about five or six percent faster. And that's not enough to really displace the technology. SIMON: Yeah. The mood ring I understand was almost something else entirely. HAMMACK: (Laughter) I love the mood ring. In the 1950s, a man named James Fergason came across a kind of liquid crystals that would respond to temperature. And he really wanted to use them to diagnose disease. He'd learned that if you take a thin layer of these liquid crystal and you paint them on the body, you get this very dramatic swirl of colors that reflect the temperatures under the skin. And they could reveal, you know, circulatory problems - hemophilia, arthritis, diabetes. And he even came up with a way to detect breast cancer, but this never really took off. And instead, as you point out, its final use was in the mood ring. SIMON: (Laughter) Oh, my word. HAMMACK: (Laughter). SIMON: Bill Hammack at the University of Illinois, the Engineer Guy on YouTube. Thanks so much for being with us. HAMMACK: Thanks. SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  Sony will stop making Betamax tapes next year. Who knew they still were?

So at the low end of the market, the VHS machines were cheaper than Sony's Betamax. And second, the earliest Betamax played for only one hour. That's the maximum size of the tape. And from the very beginning, VHS was able to play for two hours, so they could get a whole movie. And then that's where the ultimate killer came in - is Betamax focused its energies on timeshifting. And their ads featured headlines like, watch whatever, whenever. And JVC, the maker of VHS, created relationships with the nascent video rental industry. And as that market grew, the VHS grew. And for a while, you could find both types of cassettes on the shelves, but then VHS just took over. SIMON: There are lots of examples of this sort of thing, isn't there, when there's an emerging technology? It goes in one direction, and then somebody wins and somebody loses. HAMMACK: Yeah, and there's also a lot of cases where these technologies were just a little bit before their time. I mean, one of favorites is the picture phone. It came out from Bell Labs - or Bell Telephone, actually, in the mid-1960s. And if you're a man of my age, you can remember seeing these at the EPCOT Centers and world's fairs. And Bell. . . SIMON: The movie \"Seven Days In May\" made a big. . . HAMMACK: Yes. SIMON: . . . thing of picture phones, yeah. HAMMACK: Yes. Yes, they did (laughter). And that was about - that was exactly about the right era for that. And Bell spent some half billion dollars in order to create an amazing network, where they anticipated that they would have a billion-dollar business by 1980, that they'd have 12 million subscribers by the year 2000. Yet, what happened was 71 people used it in its first year. And then six years later, that fell to zero. But what they did almost brought us the Internet because they had little gadgets on these that you could use 35 mm slides. And a business, a person could show data to another person. And so they came very close to developing the Internet in the late '60s, early '70s. But by 1978, they withdrew the phone, and, you know, it lost a half billion dollars for them. SIMON: I always thought the drawback to the picture phone, as I thought it through, was that you can't be in your underwear and talk on the picture phone. HAMMACK: I think that there is quite a bit of truth to that, in that there had to be a culture that would use it. Now, I do notice now that my sister and I use FaceTime a lot. And it used to be that a video conference was always a by appointment. And usually, you were talking to a boss. But now what I'm noticing is that, culturally, people begin to use it just - my sister will ring on in FaceTime instead of making a phone call. So I think that's changing, but it had not changed at the time at all. SIMON: Yeah. Do think there are any tips as to what makes something click and catch on? And what are some of the drawbacks? HAMMACK: Well, you know, I would like a pithy answer to that. But what I always remind students, when looking at engineering failures, is to remember Tolstoy's - the opening to \"Anna Karenina,\" which is - all happy families are alike, but each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. So when these failures we look for kind of a simple, uniform explanation, but really, what we have to do is, we have to go in and look for a very rich and a very textured story. But in general, if you're going to disrupt the technology, you have to bring in something that is substantially new and different. A favorite example of mine is the Dvorak keyboard. We have a certain keyboard called a QWERTY keyboard. You could look at the upper left-hand corner. There's the five letters - Q, W, E, R, T, Y. I guess that's six letters, isn't it? SIMON: (Laughter). HAMMACK: Right? SIMON: Thanks, professor. HAMMACK: Exactly. But they - there was a man named Dvorak who came up with a different kind of keyboard in a different arrangement. And while it did allow people to type faster, it was only about five or six percent faster. And that's not enough to really displace the technology. SIMON: Yeah. The mood ring I understand was almost something else entirely. HAMMACK: (Laughter) I love the mood ring. In the 1950s, a man named James Fergason came across a kind of liquid crystals that would respond to temperature. And he really wanted to use them to diagnose disease. He'd learned that if you take a thin layer of these liquid crystal and you paint them on the body, you get this very dramatic swirl of colors that reflect the temperatures under the skin. And they could reveal, you know, circulatory problems - hemophilia, arthritis, diabetes. And he even came up with a way to detect breast cancer, but this never really took off. And instead, as you point out, its final use was in the mood ring. SIMON: (Laughter) Oh, my word. HAMMACK: (Laughter). SIMON: Bill Hammack at the University of Illinois, the Engineer Guy on YouTube. Thanks so much for being with us. HAMMACK: Thanks.", "section": "Technology", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2015 NPR.  All rights reserved.

That's what NPR's Ina Jaffe discovered at the LA Auto Show, which opened yesterday. Ina covers aging and joins us from time to time for a conversation we call One In Five for the one fifth of Americans who'll be 65 years old or more in just 15 years. She's at the LA Auto Show as we speak. Ina, thanks for being with us. What have you seen? INA JAFFE, BYLINE: Hi, Scott. Well, (laughter) you know, I'm not really much of a car person, but you can relate to that. And so I'm seeing lots of cars in different sizes and shapes and colors, and they're all very, very shiny. Really, you could put on sunglasses. SIMON: At last, an auto reporter I understand. But yes, go ahead. JAFFE: (Laughter) I knew you would. And - but that's why I am here with our colleague Sonari Glinton, who covers the auto industry for NPR. And he's helping me see a little deeper. SIMON: Sonari, thanks for being with us. SONARI GLINTON, BYLINE: Hello. I'm the auto reporter that you won't understand (laughter). SIMON: No, no, no. I always understand you, my friend. You make it comprehensible. You know, we see car ads, and it's usually compelling young people dashing and zooming around lower Manhattan or up the California coast. You wouldn't get the idea that car manufacturers were much interested in older adults, but are they? GLINTON: I mean, they should be because, you know, people who are over 55 account for about 40 percent of new car sales, and what we're really talking about are baby boomers. And baby boomers are the past, present and future of the auto industry because if you're 55, you've still got, you know, a couple two, three cars left in you. And you're probably a high earner, so you can do more. JAFFE: And you know, Scott, you're right. You don't see these drivers in car commercials, and we wanted to know why. So we asked Jeremy Anwyl. He's a former car executive who's now an independent consultant to the industry, and his answer boils down to ageism, including the kind we've all internalized. JEREMY ANWYL: Nobody wants to be known as kind of an old person's car company. It's kind of the marketing kiss of death because consumers don't want to buy an old person's car. It's, like, who would? And yet, older buyers have very specific needs. And I think a challenge for a car company is - how do you, one, design a car that meets those needs and then market it in a way that doesn't actually alienate the very people you're trying to appeal to? SIMON: Ina, what does he mean by specific needs for older drivers? JAFFE: Well, we've seen a lot of catering to that as we've looked around this show, and some of it is deceptively simple. For example, even extending the width of a door a couple of inches and adjusting the height of the seat, it can make it a lot easier for an older person with arthritis to get in and out of the car. But, you know, the same feature can also help out a young woman wearing a pencil skirt and high heels. So this is why designers, and not just the ones in the car industry, call this approach universal design. What helps older people helps a lot of other people, too. SIMON: But Sonari, what about all the high-tech stuff that can madden people when beeps that they don't understand go off? GLINTON: Well, I mean, they do a lot of things to keep us safe, so if you think of, like, all the cool stuff that are in cars, they allow for older drivers to sort of stay in the car more. So if you think of backup cameras and you have a hard time turning your neck, that's a thing - lane assist, which keeps you in your lane; automated parking. There's sonar on the front of many cars that not only can tell you what's ahead of your car, but what's two cars ahead. All these things that help older people also make it just easier for any individual to drive. SIMON: Will older drivers be comfortable using it, or do they have to get acclimated? GLINTON: This is a real problem. Rebecca Lindland - she's a senior analyst with the Kelley Blue Book - she's been driving her mother around who's about 82 years old, and what she says is really important. It's that all those bells and whistles can be a problem for some older drivers. REBECCA LINDLAND: If we're driving and I have to swerve around, the car starts beeping. And she's, like - what is that noise? What is going on there? And so you have to educate them on the warning signals that they're going to receive as they're driving or as they're a passenger because, otherwise, it's just a bunch of bells and whistles. And they don't always know what it means. JAFFE: And you know, Scott, there is a huge incentive for older people to become used to this technology. It's got the potential to make it so much safer for them to drive. It could delay that day where their kids try to make them give up the keys to the car. SIMON: Ina Jaffe covers aging. Sonari Glinton covers the auto industry for NPR. They're both at the LA Auto Show. Thanks very much for joining us. We should do this again. I learned a lot. JAFFE: (Laughter) Thanks, Scott.

Li-Fi, as it's called, was 100 times faster than an average home Wi-Fi connection. We reached Li-Fi's developer, Professor Harald Haas at the University of Edinburgh. HARALD HAAS: Li-Fi works in similar way to Wi-Fi except it doesn't use radio for data communication. It uses LED lights. LED lights are little electronic devices, a little bit like transistors. And it allows us to change the intensity, the brightness of the light, and these changes encode binary information - ones and zero - in a very, very fast, fast manner. SIMON: It's not just Li-Fi's speed that's attractive, but the spaciousness of the light spectrum. The traditional radio wave spectrum is becoming overcrowded with users. Don't we know that? HAAS: We are running into what we call the spectrum crunch. Everyone has observed the terrible slow Wi-Fi in a hotel or in an airport where too many people have to share a limited spectrum. And exactly that shortage is overcome with this really big resource of light. SIMON: There are drawbacks, of course. Light can be blocked. Light waves don't pass through walls, but that might also help make some Li-Fi systems more secure. Besides, light bulbs, which could effectively act as routers, shine just about everywhere. It uses the power and speed of light to carry information. HAAS: Oh, the future is magnificent. If you look into where you have LED lights, you have it in your ceilings, you have it in your cars, you have it in streetlamps, so it's basically turning every LED light into a wireless communication device. SIMON: But what if you like to watch videos in the dark? SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  There's a new way to log onto the Internet if you work in Estonia, and it's as easy as flipping a light switch. Actually, that's how the signals are transmitted, through light. The technology has just been tested in an industrial building in Estonia.

Stephen Carter the Yale law professor and novelist and a columnist for Bloomberg View thinks it might be wise to revive an idea that was dropped more than 10 years ago because of public outrage, the policy analysis market. Note - not board or center - market. Professor Carter joins us from his home Thanks so much for being with us, Stephen. STEPHEN CARTER: It's my pleasure, and Happy Thanksgiving. SIMON: And Happy Thanksgiving to you. This would essentially be an enterprise in which people would put money on terrorist acts. CARTER: Well, you know, the prediction markets - markets like political prediction markets, where people risk money on the presidential election, things like that - have been remarkably successful in many different areas. So a little more than a decade ago, the Defense Department thought the idea - why don't we try to do a prediction market that would include all sorts of measures of international instability? - where there'll be a coup, what government might be at risk, where the economy might fall. And it included questions about terrorism as something we might try to predict. As you said, there was a public outcry. People complained about - this would mean people are earning money from terror attacks. That is, if you bet right in the prediction market, obviously, you'd get a payoff. And so it was dropped. SIMON: Well, how does putting money on the chance of something occurring, a terrorist act, improve somebody's sense of judgment in predicting it? CARTER: One of the theories of prediction markets is that all of us have lots and lots of opinions. We rarely have anything at stake. And so not having anything at stake, we tend to make bad predictions or to stick to our ideological preferences and things like that. There's a lot of evidence that when people actually have something at stake, when there's a payoff that comes as a result of being right, people's judgments over time tend to get better, especially if they're judging short-term events, but often when they're judging long-term events as well. The policy analysis market, as it was planned back in the early 2000s, wasn't going to pay out large sums of money. It was going to give people small sums of money to see whether the market forces the information held by different people being aggregated in the market could serve as a kind of predictive tool to lay alongside all the other predictive tools that people use. SIMON: Who would be participating? CARTER: The idea would be, in the initial effort, involved experts of various kinds who either - they didn't have to be necessarily experts in international relations but certainly experts in a variety of related fields because one of the things that  markets do very, very well is that they rapidly integrate information that's known only to a few people. If you think about the way - it's the reason a bull stock market works. If you and I own shares of a stock, and we notice the stock is dropping suddenly, we might not know why it's dropping. But that's certainly going to affect our judgment whether we should be holding that stock or not. And so it's the same idea that if there are different experts who have different views, especially if you can combine the views in different ways. For example - would a U. S. intervention in this country make a terror attack more likely in that country? - that sort of thing. We can also try to pull those different kinds of information and get interesting results. SIMON: I wonder, though, if the estimations and predictions they were making became known, and I assume in this day and age, they would - wouldn't a terrorist group just follow the markets and choose another option? CARTER: Well, that would be an interesting question. Right now, we make a decision. We say we're going to harden particular targets to make them difficult for terrorists to attack. So yes, terrorists do act rationally and choose another target - they choose a less hardened target. The question is whether it could respond very rapidly to changing information. Large terror attacks take a lot of work and a lot of planning. And if the market predicted a high probability of an attack in a particular place, it's not as though it's a trivial matter for a terror group to suddenly switch all of its resources to another place. I'm not suggesting this would work. It would be a tool that would be used alongside other tools. And I'm just suggesting an experiment to see if it can improve the accuracy of intelligence forecast. SIMON: And what do you say to those people who say - my God, this is hideous? It's blood money. CARTER: It is hideous in a sense. It is. There's no question. I share the revulsion of people who say - but people shouldn't profit from this. On the other hand, if allowing people to profit from this, from making these predictions, improved our ability to predict, then it might be something worth trying because of the lives it would save on the other side.

MARTIN: We wanted to meet the senior producer behind the team that developed the game. Her name is Sigurlina Ingvarsdottir. She works for DICE in Stockholm, Sweden, and we reached her there. Thank you so much, and congratulations, I believe, are in order. SIGURLINA INGVARSDOTTIR: Thank you very much. I'm very pleased to be with you. MARTIN: One of the things about this game, which is the third major release in the game franchise, is that it allows players to customize characters in a way that might not be available in other games. I mean, people can be black or white or young or old, male or female. I wanted to ask how that decision was taken. Was that something that was part of the planning from the beginning, and if so, why? INGVARSDOTTIR: For us, now that we're rebooting the franchise and looking forward, it was important to take notice of the fact that gamers are of both genders, young and old, of every race. And we wanted to make sure that from the get-go we were designing the franchise to be inclusive for everyone. MARTIN: I just was wondering, though, how those discussions took place. Is that just an assumption of your shop - that if you take on a project, that's how it's going to be? Or do you think, frankly - is it because of your leadership as a female lead designer? INGVARSDOTTIR: I think that you could have an easy assumption that that's because of me, but it isn't really, although I strongly support it. My design director of the game - for him, it was always a given that you'd be able to play people of both genders. And, you know, we didn't specify races in the beginning, but that was the next step. And the way that we do it is that we use a technique that's called photogrammetry. So the characters in the game that you can select from - these are actual actors. When we did the casting for it, we decided to make sure that they were as diverse and as different as possible. MARTIN: What was the funnest part about it? INGVARSDOTTIR: I think, for me, being able to go to the Lucasfilm archives at Skywalker Ranch. There's a treasure trove of \"Star Wars\" props and costumes and models that have been used in the original trilogy of movies. One of the things that I've never thought about was how the vision for the universe is creating the unfamiliar out of the eminently familiar. And I think the technology of a lightsaber, as an example - what they did was they took pieces of camera equipment from the '60s and put them together to create these hilts for lightsabers. I think it's really the key to making the universe of \"Star Wars\" so believable and so enchanting. MARTIN: But that sort of goes back to the question that we started with, which is - it's just interesting to a lot of people that these industries that are so forward-looking in some ways seem regressive in terms of their social relations. And I'm just wondering if you feel that what you've achieved in this game will change that dynamic. INGVARSDOTTIR: You know, I've been in the industry now for nine years. And I can see more prominent women throughout different gaming companies reaching higher levels. I can see games starting to feel more diverse in both their subject matters, as well as character creation. It feels like it is changing in a more positive way - not very quickly, but I feel pretty hopeful. And I don't think, you know - although would be nice to feel like, my game is a big contributor to that - but I think it's more emblematic of a bigger change.

NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce wanted to know, how can researchers be so sure of what'll happen that far off in the future? NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: The Earth is big. Its climate is complicated. To understand it, you need something big and complicated. PHIL WEBSTER: OK, so it is very noisy in here. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Phil Webster is taking me into a windowless room full of hulking black monoliths. This is NASA's Center for Climate Simulation in Maryland. WEBSTER: The computers generate a lot of heat, so there's a lot of fans, a lot of cooling and stuff that's in it. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Webster runs this supercomputing center with help from a guy nicknamed in the alpha geek, Dan Duffy. Duffy says these huge black boxes are filled with thousands of computers like the one on your desk at work, all connected to create one massive beast. How powerful is it? DAN DUFFY: If you took everybody on the face of the Earth - all 7. 3, 7. 4 billion people - and you had them multiply two numbers together every single second for 145 hours total. That's what this entire computing center can do in one second. GREENFIELDBOYCE: OK. That is a mind-boggling amount of number crunching. And when this thing runs a climate simulation, it takes months for it to spit out an answer. To find out what exactly is going on inside there, I went to New York City. And if you ever watch the TV show \"Seinfeld,\" you'll know exactly where I am. I'm standing right outside that restaurant, the corner restaurant the gang used to hang out at. Right above this restaurant are the offices of one of the world's foremost climate modelers. Hi there. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Hi. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Is this Goddard Institute for Space Studies? UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Yes. GREENFIELDBOYCE: I'm here to see Gavin Schmidt. The first thing I see in Gavin Schmidt's office is a black board on the wall that's covered with equations. These scientific scribbles were left by the last guy who worked here, a famous climate change researcher named Jim Hansen. For someone like me, it's totally incomprehensible, but this is the language these folks use to talk about everything that makes up our climate. What is a climate model, really? Is it just a bunch of equations? GAVIN SCHMIDT: So the climate model - you're best thinking of it as an encapsulation of all the things that we can go out and measure, right? So we can go and measure how much sunlight reflects off the sea ice. We can go and measure how much water you need to have in the air before you form a cloud. You can go and measure how the winds affect the ocean currents, right? Those are physical processes that we've been observing for hundreds of years. A climate model encapsulates each of those processes, the ones that we think of as being important, and it links them all together. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Researchers created the first primitive models of Earth's climate back in the 1960s on computers that used punch cards. Schmidt says there's now around 30 different groups worldwide doing climate simulations using supercomputers. And the consensus is, if greenhouse gas emissions keep rising, the world will look different. On his desktop computer screen, Schmidt pulls up one graphic of the globe that's color-coded for temperature. I watch it get redder and redder as the years tick up into the future. SCHMIDT: So you're looking at a situation where there's very little ice left in the Arctic. You're looking at temperature changes on land that are the equivalent of, you know, moving south by a couple of thousand miles. So you know, climates of New York would have the climates of Miami. GREENFIELDBOYCE: How confident do you feel about those kinds of predictions? SCHMIDT: That's a great question. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says, well, these simulations are able to basically re-create the Earth's climate as we see it today. SCHMIDT: What you see are patterns in the models that reflect what you see in the real world. We know that we must be getting something fundamentally correct in order for that to happen. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He rattles off a bunch of other reasons to feel confident. Can these models re-create past events like the last Ice Age? SCHMIDT: Yes, they do. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Do models created independently by different groups show similar patterns? SCHMIDT: Yes, they do. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Yes. Do the models make pretty good short-term predictions? Yeah. SCHMIDT: So models have verifiable skill. They're not perfect, but nonetheless, they make useful predictions. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Whether or not the world actually will use them - that's what diplomats are hashing out in Paris right now. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News.

GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says, well, these simulations are able to basically re-create the Earth's climate as we see it today. SCHMIDT: What you see are patterns in the models that reflect what you see in the real world. We know that we must be getting something fundamentally correct in order for that to happen. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He rattles off a bunch of other reasons to feel confident. Can these models re-create past events like the last Ice Age? SCHMIDT: Yes, they do. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Do models created independently by different groups show similar patterns? SCHMIDT: Yes, they do. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Yes. Do the models make pretty good short-term predictions? Yeah. SCHMIDT: So models have verifiable skill. They're not perfect, but nonetheless, they make useful predictions. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Whether or not the world actually will use them - that's what diplomats are hashing out in Paris right now.

First, some energy saving technologies that got attention at this month's Greenbuild International Conference. The massive annual event brings together designers, developers and builders. SIEGEL: Alex Wilson is there every fall. He's the founder of BuildingGreen, a company that's a little like Consumer Reports for the industry. ALEX WILSON: Every year, we present the most exciting new products that are coming along. SIEGEL: Wilson says things that are changing our lives more broadly - digital technology and lithium-ion batteries - are changing the building industry too. MCEVERS: He told our tech editor Franklyn Cater that one of his top 10 products for the coming year is a battery for your house. It can store energy from solar panels. WILSON: The Tesla Powerwall system really revolutionizes battery storage at the home scale. FRANKLYN CATER, BYLINE: Tesla, the car company. WILSON: Tesla, the car company, right, that has revolutionized electric vehicles - they're on track to revolutionize home energy as well so you can, you know, operate a clothes dryer at night or a dishwasher at night with stored electricity. MCEVERS: Wilson says this is big because finding an inexpensive way to store solar energy to use it when it's not sunny has been a challenge for a long time. Tesla system costs about $3,000 and mounts on a wall. SIEGEL: Another product on Wilson's top 10 list may have you rethinking that sweater hanging in your cubicle. It is a lithium-ion-battery-powered, smartphone-operated office chair. The startup that makes it is run by a longtime expert in heating and cooling buildings. PETER RUMSEY: My name is Peter Rumsey, and I'm the founder and CEO of Personal Comfort Systems. The No. 1 complaint of occupants of office buildings is too hot, too cold by far. Ask any building engineer, what - you know, what are people complaining about? SIEGEL: And Rumsey thinks the solution is personalized temperature control through the Hyper Chair. It was invented at UC Berkeley. RUMSEY: We're going to have the chairs take on more of the work of providing heating and cooling because they're battery-powered. They don't affect electricity prices during the day because we can charge them at night when electricity's cheaper. SIEGEL: Rumsey says the long-term plan is an Internet-enabled chair that talks to the building to help heating and cooling run more efficiently.

WEIR: What you're doing is you're learning how to scat. MARTIN: Am I? (Laughter). WEIR: Well, it's like learning a language. If someone said, you know, como se dice or something in a foreign language. . . MARTIN: Yeah. WEIR: You know, you would want to hear that phrase a few times. You'd need to learn to hear the subtlety of the accent of the singer, their word stress, their tone, their inflection. And that's what you're doing with Kate, is you're listening to her and trying to soak in how does she do it. Then you're emulating it. MARTIN: But it's crazy. Like, you're saying made-up words.

And you're right. That actually is one of the classic stumbling blocks for singers when I'm out in the world teaching - because until you can say (scat singing) and have it roll off the tongue easily, then it's a little difficult to get the notes out.

So why not apply for jobs there? Well, increasingly we are. Some recruiters say half or more of their applicants apply for jobs using their smartphones. Mobile recruiting is really becoming a popular new way to tap into the job market. Here's NPR's Yuki Noguchi. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: When Kirk Coleman decided it was time for a new job, he checked his pocket. KIRK COLEMAN: I probably applied for 90 percent of my positions on my mobile device. NOGUCHI: Coleman, who lives in Plano, Texas, says he was fine letting his thumbs do the talking, filling out forms and connecting to his LinkedIn profile. COLEMAN: Being the generation that I am, a millennial, people kind of want it here and now - that's kind of the mentality with this generation. And so it makes sense for employers to kind of cut out some of the flaws and some of the process so people can actually do it from their mobile device. NOGUCHI: Applying for a job has shed some of the old formalities - the resume printed on nice stock paper, for example. Still, using a phone seems fraught with danger. What about the fat-finger problem, I ask Coleman, or the tedium of reading and filling out job applications on a small screen? That doesn't bother him. In fact, he says, he thinks applying for jobs on his cellphone made him more competitive. COLEMAN: It's much easier to hit apply on your cellphone and take 15 minutes and fill out a basic application on your phone than it is to wait to be at home. NOGUCHI: Coleman should know - the job he landed was as a recruiter for a bank. COLEMAN: Within a month of my search, I had three offers, so really it took less than a month from start to finish. NOGUCHI: Craig Fisher is director of talent marketing for CA Technologies. He says the point of having mobile recruitment tools, ones that are streamlined and require minimal clicks, is to make applying for a job easier, more casual and faster. CRAIG FISHER: The candidate experience is now of paramount consideration for employers because it's a candidate-driven market. There's a real war for talent. NOGUCHI: He says more than half of his company's job applicants use their mobile devices. And the cellphone-friendly process has led to an increase in applications overall. This is especially helpful when it comes to filling high-tech positions, where talent is often in short supply. FISHER: The engineers don't have time to talk to 15 recruiters a day. So they may just go online and apply or straight to their phone to look at that job. And if it's easy to apply, then perhaps they'll do it. NOGUCHI: And just as marketers are pushing coupon ads on mobile phones, recruiters are looking to use the same concept to attract job candidates. FISHER: You can actually target marketing and specific jobs to candidates segmented by their various fields of specialty. NOGUCHI: Dan Ryan of talent acquisition firm Ryan Search and Consulting near Nashville says companies who don't use recruitment systems set up for cellphones are lagging behind. He said he uses FaceTime to interview candidates. And while many people are comfortable relying on the cellphone, Ryan acknowledges not everyone is there yet. DAN RYAN: One of the areas where I've specifically seen it be a downside is for boomers or even, you know, on the older side of the boomer generation. If they're not technologically savvy, they're missing out on the opportunity to gain information, gain access in a quicker format than, say, maybe a millennial who's grown up with this kind of technology his or her entire life. NOGUCHI: Ryan himself says it helps him stay in touch with candidates in a more familiar and intimate way than was possible before. RYAN: Ten years ago, using a text to share information with a candidate wasn't something that happened very often. I'm texting with candidates all the time now. NOGUCHI: He says you have to go where the talent, and the times, take you. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News, Washington. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  You know, we shop, we watch TV, we read news on our phones.

NOGUCHI: Craig Fisher is director of talent marketing for CA Technologies. He says the point of having mobile recruitment tools, ones that are streamlined and require minimal clicks, is to make applying for a job easier, more casual and faster. CRAIG FISHER: The candidate experience is now of paramount consideration for employers because it's a candidate-driven market. There's a real war for talent. NOGUCHI: He says more than half of his company's job applicants use their mobile devices. And the cellphone-friendly process has led to an increase in applications overall. This is especially helpful when it comes to filling high-tech positions, where talent is often in short supply. FISHER: The engineers don't have time to talk to 15 recruiters a day. So they may just go online and apply or straight to their phone to look at that job. And if it's easy to apply, then perhaps they'll do it. NOGUCHI: And just as marketers are pushing coupon ads on mobile phones, recruiters are looking to use the same concept to attract job candidates. FISHER: You can actually target marketing and specific jobs to candidates segmented by their various fields of specialty. NOGUCHI: Dan Ryan of talent acquisition firm Ryan Search and Consulting near Nashville says companies who don't use recruitment systems set up for cellphones are lagging behind. He said he uses FaceTime to interview candidates. And while many people are comfortable relying on the cellphone, Ryan acknowledges not everyone is there yet. DAN RYAN: One of the areas where I've specifically seen it be a downside is for boomers or even, you know, on the older side of the boomer generation. If they're not technologically savvy, they're missing out on the opportunity to gain information, gain access in a quicker format than, say, maybe a millennial who's grown up with this kind of technology his or her entire life. NOGUCHI: Ryan himself says it helps him stay in touch with candidates in a more familiar and intimate way than was possible before. RYAN: Ten years ago, using a text to share information with a candidate wasn't something that happened very often. I'm texting with candidates all the time now. NOGUCHI: He says you have to go where the talent, and the times, take you. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News, Washington.", "section": "Business", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2015 NPR.

It's especially hard for women, who outnumber men by that age. The Internet is making things a bit easier, so long as women can navigate a world of new technology and classic scams. NPR's Laura Sydell adds now to our reporting on the changing lives of women. LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE: To find out about life as a single older woman before the Internet, I tapped into the memories of some women at one of San Francisco's senior centers. BOBBIE SMITH: Yeah, I mean, what did you have, bars, churches? KIMBERLY BODFISH: Or fix-ups. LOUISE VOGEL: Churches. BODFISH: Fix-up - have your friends fix up. SMITH: If you had kids, maybe a PTA, I don't know, you know? VOGEL: But it was very limited in the radius of where these people lived. SYDELL: That's Bobbie Smith, Kimberly Bodfish and Louise Vogel - all are single and 65-plus. They think the Internet is swell. BODFISH: I think it's improved life all around. SMITH: Totally, totally. VOGEL: Because we can use it to whatever need we want, whether it is Internet dating or meet-ups. SYDELL: And when it is, Kimberly Bodfish says she discovered what many people already know about dating online. People are a little more generous about themselves in their profiles. BODFISH: And I must have gone on 200 dates. SMITH: What? VOGEL: Wow. BODFISH: Yeah. I would say 95 percent of the men used the dating service to go out and not to have a relationship no matter what they say or not. And most of them, their profile is totally not what they are. SYDELL: It's been a steep learning curve. The Susan Seidelman film \"Boynton Beach Club\" from 2006, which Seidelman's mother helped produce, nails the social scene for older women. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"BOYNTON BEACH CLUB\")UNIDENTIFIED ACTRESS: (As club leader) We have a new member today. I'd like you all to meet Jack. Jack, welcome to the Boynton Beach Bereavement Club. UNIDENTIFIED ACTORS: (As club members) Hi, Jack. (APPLAUSE)SYDELL: Recently widowed character Jack Goodman gets a bit of a pep talk from his pal Harry. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"BOYNTON BEACH CLUB\")JOSEPH BOLOGNA: (As Harry) I've come here for over a year. There's an 8 to 1 women-to-man ratio. I swear to God, I've never been so popular in my life. SYDELL: And while the odds aren't quite that bad for single women over 65, they're close. Women live longer, and so there are simply more of them. And of the men who are still around, 70 percent are married - that's true of only 45 percent of the women, according to data tracked by the AARP. And when older women go looking online, they're more likely to be the targets of Internet scams. I spoke with a retired flight attendant in Georgia who preferred not to use her name because of the delicate nature of her story. She's divorced, in her 60s. Her friends urged her to try the Internet dating site match. com. She got a message from a gentleman who sounded nice. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: And I thought wow, how could one person get so basically lucky, blessed, whatever the term may be, to have found someone so quickly because he definitely came on with all the right words. SYDELL: He sent our subject roses, texted and emailed her constantly. That's part of the Internet that's different. It's easy to feel a sense of intimacy quickly and communication is instant. The man told her he was outside the country, but would be home at Christmas and they would finally meet. But then. . . UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: He had encountered some problems. He was an engineer supposedly in Malaysia, and he said that he had been attacked from the back. Someone had stolen his briefcase and all the cash he had on him. SYDELL: First, he asked her to lend him $5,000 for a ticket home. But he'd also lost his credit cards and needed to borrow money to pay some inspectors on his project. And before she knew it, she was duped into giving him $150,000. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: So immediately when he didn't appear at Christmas - and by the way, I bought him a sweater thinking he was really going to be here - and I don't have to tell you emotionally I started falling apart. SYDELL: The victim is working with federal authorities to catch the culprit. Last year, the FBI received thousands of complaints from women like her. The FBI reports that in 2014 alone, Americans lost over $86 million in online romance scams, 50 million of which came from women over 50. Pepper Schwartz, a professor of sociology at the University of Washington who consults for the AARP says scammers are very skilled at seducing. PEPPER SCHWARTZ: And they'll test the waters to see how lonely, how warm, how open, how generous, how naive - I mean, some of these women, you know, they haven't had a partner since their husband of 50 years - they haven't dated. SYDELL: Schwartz says AARP and law enforcement are working hard to get the word out on these scams. But she thinks it shouldn't deter women from using the Internet for dating. It does increase the odds. And that's why we're not going to end this piece without a happy story. LOLA MCCRACKEN: Women shouldn't be afraid to go on match. com. And yes, you will meet. . . STUART GORDON: Frogs. MCCRACKEN: You'll meet some frogs. But there's a chance you might meet a prince. SYDELL: That's 73-year-old Lola McCracken. And that male voice you heard is 78-year-old Stuart Gordon. They met on match. com. MCCRACKEN: I felt like he was my soul mate, even before we even met. We were corresponding, and that was one of the great advantages I think with meeting online. SYDELL: McCracken, a retired college professor, lived in Atlanta. Gordon, a retired lawyer, lived in Virginia. They are now married. McCracken says we never would have met without the Internet. Laura Sydell, NPR News.

S. Air Force is planning to nearly double the number of pilots who fly drones. Officials say the workload pilots now have is leaving them without enough time for rest or training. NPR's Tom Bowman reports. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE: They're called Predators. The larger ones are named Reapers. For the past 20 years, they've circled the skies over Pakistan and Afghanistan, Iraq, Northern Africa and now Syria. At times, those on the ground can hear a faint sound almost like a distant lawnmower. Sometimes they provide constant surveillance, sending back live video. Mostly, they unleash missiles into terrorist compounds. Now the officer in charge of the Air Combat Command, General Herbert Hawk Carlisle, who flew fighter and cargo aircraft, says it's time to give those drone pilots a rest. GENERAL HERBERT HAWK CARLISLE: We've just been running them so hard. Every single mission those guys go in and fly today is a combat mission. BOWMAN: So General Carlisle says the plan is to double the estimated 700 pilots as well as support personnel. CARLISLE: You know, the term we use in flying is, it's a death spiral. It's - if we just keep burning these folks out and working them six days a week with, you know, very little time off and they're not allowed to go do any other jobs or any other things and they're just doing constant combat missions, we'll lose them. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Morning, Sir. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Morning. How you doing? UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Good. BOWMAN: The pilots actually commute to war, flying the drones from a base in Nevada where the lights of Las Vegas can be seen in the near distance. NPR followed one pilot back in 2007 as he pulled into Creech Air Force Base. The pilots wear flight suits. They settle into a chair in a windowless room. Then they fly the drone half a world away by satellite link. Back then, fighter pilots joked about the Chair Force pilots flying the drones, ask them how many G-forces they pulled. But over the years, the demand for drones has only increased, and the jokes have faded. General Carlisle says a drone's live stream video has helped in humanitarian disasters, helped in fighting wildfires. But for the most part, drones are used in military operations. That's led to criticism from human rights groups about the antiseptic nature of drones, worries about civilian causalities as well as a drone's use in countries like Somalia and Yemen where the U. S. is not engaged in a ground war. Still, General Carlisle says that drones are becoming more and more popular with American combat commanders around the world. CARLISLE: They're in demand across the range of military operations. It's really changed the way of warfare in many ways or certainly the way that we conduct an theater airpower. BOWMAN: The drones now 60 missions around the world each day, and General Carlisle says that number won't change. Only the number of pilots will increase over the next year and half. And the Air Force is exploring plans to base drone pilots overseas. The general says the high demand for drones has led the government to hire civilian contractors to take part in two daily drone operations but only for surveillance, not for bombing. And there are plans for expansion. But General Carlisle says he wants to get the civilians out of any drone operations, saying it's an inherently military mission. CARLISLE: So as I get this program healthy, as I get the enterprise healthy, I would like to move away from contractors doing the missions.

S. technology companies to crack down on terrorists' use of social media. But would they have to roll back the encryption technology that millions of users want to keep their accounts from getting hacked by foreign governments, competitors, strangers and, for that matter, terrorists? Hany Farid co-developed software a few years ago to try to track child pornography. And he says that similar technology could be used to deter terror-related content. He's now chair of the Dartmouth computer science department. Professor Farid joins us from Dartmouth Studios in Hanover. Thanks very much for being with us. HANY FARID: Good to be with you. SIMON: And how would this technology work? FARID: Well, the way the technology worked that we developed for finding and removing child pornography was to actually start with a cache of known child pornography image. And what we understand from the transmission of this material is that the same images, year in and year out, keep getting transmitted. And so we had the idea, well, let's at least stop the transmission of those images. Let's at least stop people transmitting things that we know are bad content. And what we developed is a technology that extracts from a digital image a signature of sorts. We call it photo DNA. And that signature has two very important properties. It is distinct - two different images will not share the same signature. And the signature is stable over the lifetime of the image, the way our DNA is stable as we age, we cut our hair, change out clothes, etc. And that allows us, that when images are being uploaded to, for example, Facebook or to Dropbox or to SkyDrive, to compare against these known bad content and just simply remove and report the offending material. SIMON: How could this technology then be applied to potential terrorism? FARID: Right. So, for example, when, trivially, when images are being shared on social media that are terrorist-related or are known to be part of campaigns to radicalize people, those can be similarly added to the database and be removed. The same holds true for audio recordings. The same holds true for video recordings. I will say, however, though, that technology won't solve all the problems. At the end of the day, you need boots on the ground. You need humans looking at this material once it gets flagged by the technology. SIMON: I wonder about the chances for abuse. And I'm thinking of, let's say, the teenager who has to do a paper on terrorism, and he downloads a picture of ISIS and finds he's targeted by the FBI. FARID: Yeah, that's the right question to ask. And that's always sort of the danger of this type of technology. And that's why I said at the end of the day, somebody has to be looking at the content. There has to be a human in the loop because there are subtleties and nuances to the way this technology is being used. SIMON: And help us understand why technology companies are provisional about encryption. FARID: You know, I can tell you that in our work with the child exploitation images, technology companies were very reluctant. They were reluctant to get into this business of, essentially, what is seen as a law-enforcement issue. And I don't see it that way. I see it as a terms of service agreement. I happen to partner with Microsoft and the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children to develop technology. And Microsoft got to a point where they said these are bad people doing bad things on our network, and we don't want it anymore. So it was really a business decision to remove this type of material, and I think that's what has to happen with technology companies. They have to stop thinking about it as a law-enforcement issue, a national security issue and start thinking of it as a business issue and start thinking of it as that - we do not want people using our networks to radicalize people and incite violence. And I think once you get to that position, you start deploying technology and you start deploying resources in order to remove this type of material.

But the latest \"Star Wars\" movie, \"The Force Awakens\" brings us what might be an even more endearing new droid. NPR's Neda Ulaby and that it will be tells us more about BB-8. NEDA ULABY, BYLINE: All over the country, you can hear arguments like this one between two 7-year-old twins. CECILIA SANDOVAL-STRAUSZ: BB-8. LINCOLN SANDOVAL-STRAUSZ: R2-D2. CECILIA: BB-8. LINCOLN: R2-D2. CECILIA: BB-8. ULABY: These siblings are debating which droid is superior. Neither's seen the movie yet, but Lincoln Sandoval-Strausz staunchly supports the original R2-D2. Sister Cecilia begs to differ. LINCOLN: But R2-D2 can fight. CECILIA: BB-8's cute. BB-8's always awesome. LINCOLN: BB-8's, like, oh, I have to serve you (imitating BB-8). CECILIA: BB-8's cute. MATTHEW DENTON: (Laughter) It is cute, isn't it? ULABY: Meet the two men who built BB-8. Matthew Denton supervised electronic design and development for the movie's characters, and Joshua Lee's a senior animatronic designer. Now some fans mocked when BB-8's images first went public. . . (SOUNDBITE OF \"STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS\" FILM)ULABY: . . . For looking like a soccer ball. And, well, it does. But these days, Denton and Lee have gotten used to people cooing over the droid's soulful giant eye and its sweet round silhouette. JOSHUA LEE: . . . That it's got similar proportions to a baby. DENTON: And it has kind of characterizations of a puppy, like a puppy dog. ULABY: Like a plucky little terrier who's up in everyone's business. BB-8 was first imagined by the film's director. J. J. Abrams says Lee sketched the little droid on a napkin. LEE: Yep, that's correct. And it is a 30-second sketch. ULABY: When they got that sketch, Lee and Denton were asked to devise a robot not dependent on digital effects. Abrams wanted to avoid CGI whenever possible. LEE: We weren't really sure whether it was possible to achieve BB-8 physically. In fact, it was only about with a week to go before filming began that we actually had the physical droids there for J. J. to look at. ULABY: In the movie, BB-8 is a robot on a mission. It's discovered by a girl on a desolate planet.

(SOUNDBITE OF BB-8 DROID)UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) For my family. (SOUNDBITE OF BB-8 DROID)ULABY: It took about a year of testing and building to come up with all of the BB-8s used in the movie, Lee says. LEE: We built seven different versions of BB-8 to get all the shots that we needed to, and they all got nicknames. We had one called The Wiggler. ULABY: The Wiggler was for close-ups. It wiggles around in one place. LEE: . . . Turning its head and tilting its body. DENTON: We had The Bowling Ball. ULABY: That one was literally bowled through shots whenever the droid had to move fast. And when BB-8 had to emote, there was a special puppet version. LEE: . . . Where a puppeteer was physically controlling the puppet through rods and levers. That was incredibly expressive. ULABY: And expensive - those rods and levers had to be digitally removed. And what was its nickname? LEE: It was The Puppet (laughter). Not very original, sorry. ULABY: Imagine if you're Matt Denton, who built BB-8, and your job was to remote control it. Not so fun, he says, on set in Abu Dhabi, where temperatures regularly exceed 120 degrees. DENTON: You couldn't touch your hand on anything. If it was metal, you didn't pick it up when it was in the sun in the desert because you'd burn. And it was like working another planet at times, but I guess that was the point. ULABY: Here's the wildest part. Denton and Lee had a list of things they knew the droid needed to do - speed over sand, navigate through forests, climb down stairs and more. But they never saw a word of the script until the movie started shooting. DENTON: So we didn't know how much BB-8 was in the movie.

And that's what we're exploring today on All Tech Considered. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SHAPIRO: If you were devising a global conspiracy theory about a secret group of people who control the Internet, then ICANN would probably be at the center of it. ICANN is a nonprofit group based in California. It stands for the the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. These are the people who make sure that if you type npr. org into a web browser anywhere in the world, it'll take you to the same page. They are the folks who created . org, . com, . edu and, more recently, . pizza, . shopping and a hundred other variations. Well, the CEO of ICANN, Fadi Chehade, joins us now. Welcome to the program. FADI CHEHADE: Thank you - happy to be here. SHAPIRO: Something that I'm sure you think about everyday but, to be honest, I didn't think about it until I started preparing for this interview is that the Internet is a place we go that is not owned by a company. We don't all start from the same landing spot. We don't all have the same homepage. It's really unusual in that respect. CHEHADE: It is. SHAPIRO: And you're kind of the gatekeeper of that, in a sense. CHEHADE: We are a gatekeeper of one part of the Internet. The Internet has many layers. We're responsible for a layer that keeps it as one Internet because the Internet is not national. It's a transnational resource. It's a resource that does not get built along the nation state lines. And therefore, everything we have in the world to govern ourselves, which is built around the nation state model, is currently challenged by the transnational nature of the Internet. SHAPIRO: And if, in a sense, ICANN is sort of the gatekeeper, what are you deflecting from the gates? What are the negative things that you are trying to hold at bay? CHEHADE: The fragmentation of the Internet. And what does this really mean? It means if you type npr. org in New York, you will get to the NPR server. If you type it, say, in another country, you may end up in a different place. The power of the Internet is that we have the integrity of the identifiers coordinated by ICANN. SHAPIRO: And the reason we want to talk to you today is that ICANN is basically going global in a way that it has not before. Explain, in layman's terms, what exactly is happening. CHEHADE: The U. S. had the vision since the inception of ICANN in the late-'90s that, at some point, this organization should be an organization governed by the world, by businesses, by civil society, technical people, government, all of them together building consensus to govern what we do. That has now come to fruition. The U. S. government decided to end its unique stewardship of our role and to let the world do its job. SHAPIRO: Explain how if the new model of ICANN will have people at the table from Russia and China and Saudi Arabia and many other countries, why can't some of those countries that oppose free expression get together and say, we're going to shift the flow of information slightly in this direction. CHEHADE: Because consensus in our community means they will have to convince everyone else. And at ICANN, everyone else includes all the stakeholders, and it will take a lot more to get that group to go along with one particular harmful strategy or policy that would limit the freedom and the openness of the Internet. SHAPIRO: Well, that makes it sound like harmful or helpful, it would be nearly impossible to get everybody to agree on virtually anything. CHEHADE: Well, in fact, this may be part of the solution - that is, make it difficult for consensus to be built except for things that really are common denominators that allow us to maintain the layer of the internet that ICANN coordinates. SHAPIRO: Do you think this will really happen next year? Your group had a meeting in Dublin this fall and came away with some questions about whether this is really on track. CHEHADE: We are on track, and it seems like we will deliver the final proposal to the U. S. government in January of 2016. SHAPIRO: Are you often told that the wrong person in your job would make an ideal super villain? (Laughter) You know, in the James Bond-type movie, it's, like, the person who keeps the internet whole and intact and accessible and free and coherent. That would be a pretty good super villain for a James Bond film. CHEHADE: I must tell you, the power of the ICANN model is that no one person - not myself, not anyone - has truly the controls that people think anyone shouldn't have. We all agree. No one should have those controls. I am just, frankly, here to ensure the values and the principles we all agree on are maintained. But the decisions must come from the bottom up through a very complex consensus approach, but it's what guarantees that no one has control over a recourse that has become so vital for our lives and our economies. SHAPIRO: That's Fadi Chehade, the CEO of ICANN, the organization that, more or less, organizes and runs the Internet. Thank you very much for talking with us. CHEHADE: Thank you.

Aaron Schachter from WGBH Radio visited a famed music school in Boston where students are learning to make a living from music they will almost never get credit for. AARON SCHACHTER, BYLINE: Chances are you've heard lots of stuff like this in the past few years. . . (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"SERIAL\")SARAH KOENIG: From This American Life and WBEZ Chicago, it's Serial. (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"THE WORLD IN WORDS\")NINA PORZUCKI: Nina Porzucki here, and this is The World in Words. (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"SLUMBER PARTY WITH ALIE AND GEORGIA\")UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Hi, it's Slumber Party with Alie and Georgia. SCHACHTER: Podcasts would sound pretty bland without music. It's evocative and sets a mood. But for the most part the music is meant to be invisible. You won't ever sit down to listen to it or put it on in your car. And chances are you'll never know who composed it. But this kind of music is everywhere. And it's big business. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SCHACHTER: This, for example, may someday be the sound that seduces you into buying a new Hyundai. You can't see the pictures that go with it, but trust me here, the music and images are kind of sexy. Sexy or sad, dramatic or heartfelt, the students in Commercial Writing 450 at Berklee College of Music in Boston already know how to tweak your emotions for films, for commercials, for production libraries - that's where podcast music generally comes from. Going to Berklee is a big deal for a musician. Loads of famous Grammy winners have studied here. But no one I spoke with would admit to thinking about fame. They were too pragmatic for that. ANDREA PEJROLO: Popstars kind of come and go, but the people working for them usually stay. You know, they're always there because they're always needed. SCHACHTER: Andrea Pejrolo is a professor in the Contemporary Writing and Production Department. He says of course his students have the same dreams as musicians everywhere. They do want to be famous. But these days, he says, they don't have to be to make it. PEJROLO: It used to be, you know, to make it in the music industry was like to be the popstar. Now we are surrounded by different type of media. You know, it just became this global thing now that keeps expanding. It's everywhere. SCHACHTER: In addition to film scoring, there's web advertising, lots more TV with lots more commercials, podcasts and video games. And this means there are so many more outlets where you can showcase your music and make money. Podcast music is not a moneymaker, by the way. Folks in the biz think of it kind of like a calling card to attract paying customers. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MERCEDES AVILES: When you make music for a production library, you can just, like, completely let go of it. SCHACHTER: Mercedes Aviles is a violinist majoring in Commercial Writing. AVILES: And so even if you don't like what you produce, as long as it works for that spot you can still get a sense of pride from it, even though it's not for your own personal use. SCHACHTER: Come on, Mercedes, you want to be a popstar, right? AVILES: (Laughter) Maybe. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SCHACHTER: Professor Kurt Biederwolf says not too long ago someone like Aviles probably would have spent a lot of time waiting tables while struggling for stardom. Now, he says, if she nails the commercial writing thing it's all music all the time. KURT BIEDERWOLF: They could do this from their hotel room. They could do this on a bus between gigs or during breaks. And this fits into those gaps in their schedule. SCHACHTER: Berklee is one of the only colleges in the country teaching undergrads to make commercial music. And they're running out of studio space. For NPR News, I'm Aaron Schachter in Boston. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:   With the explosion of podcasts, a new market has been created for music. Aaron Schachter from WGBH Radio visited a famed music school in Boston where students are learning to make a living from music they will almost never get credit for. AARON SCHACHTER, BYLINE: Chances are you've heard lots of stuff like this in the past few years. . . (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"SERIAL\") SARAH KOENIG: From This American Life and WBEZ Chicago, it's Serial. (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"THE WORLD IN WORDS\") NINA PORZUCKI: Nina Porzucki here, and this is The World in Words. (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"SLUMBER PARTY WITH ALIE AND GEORGIA\") UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Hi, it's Slumber Party with Alie and Georgia. SCHACHTER: Podcasts would sound pretty bland without music. It's evocative and sets a mood. But for the most part the music is meant to be invisible. You won't ever sit down to listen to it or put it on in your car. And chances are you'll never know who composed it. But this kind of music is everywhere. And it's big business. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SCHACHTER: This, for example, may someday be the sound that seduces you into buying a new Hyundai. You can't see the pictures that go with it, but trust me here, the music and images are kind of sexy. Sexy or sad, dramatic or heartfelt, the students in Commercial Writing 450 at Berklee College of Music in Boston already know how to tweak your emotions for films, for commercials, for production libraries - that's where podcast music generally comes from. Going to Berklee is a big deal for a musician. Loads of famous Grammy winners have studied here. But no one I spoke with would admit to thinking about fame. They were too pragmatic for that. ANDREA PEJROLO: Popstars kind of come and go, but the people working for them usually stay. You know, they're always there because they're always needed. SCHACHTER: Andrea Pejrolo is a professor in the Contemporary Writing and Production Department. He says of course his students have the same dreams as musicians everywhere. They do want to be famous. But these days, he says, they don't have to be to make it. PEJROLO: It used to be, you know, to make it in the music industry was like to be the popstar. Now we are surrounded by different type of media. You know, it just became this global thing now that keeps expanding. It's everywhere.

What would you think if someone said, well, I'm going to write an encyclopedia with my friends in my spare time? That's what these people are doing, essentially, one individual, one article at a time. They have 80 or 90,000 encyclopedia articles that they're working on. CORNISH: This first mention came almost two years to the day after Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger launched Wikipedia. The idea of a free online encyclopedia had been floating around for a while, and Wikipedia took off unlike anything else of its kind. SIEGEL: Back in 2003, Bruce Perens knew people were just waiting for something like this to come along.

IRA FLATOW: I'm not responsible for what comes up. PERENS: OK, well you'll get an article about NPR. FLATOW: Well, we'll go to the break, and while we're at the break, a lot of people will be able to go to wikipedia. com. We'll melt down the server and see what happens.
