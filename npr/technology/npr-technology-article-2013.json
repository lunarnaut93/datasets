More than 200 million people have put their names in the National Do Not Call Registry, which has been around about a decade. But companies still want the money to be made reaching out to you by phone. And that's today's business Bottom Line. Regardless of the law, pre-recorded robocalls have flooded the country - offering everything from credit cards to new medications. The Federal Trade Commission is seeking solutions, as NPR's Lauren Silverman reports. (SOUNDBITE OF RINGING PHONE)LAUREN SILVERMAN, BYLINE: This is the call interrupting dinners across the nation. RACHEL: Hello, this is Rachel at Cardholder Services, calling in reference to your current credit card account. It is urgent that. . . DAVID VLADECK: All of us have heard this so many times that it's like, you know, nails on a chalkboard for us. SILVERMAN: That's David Vladeck. He's director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. He's been going after the Rachel's of the world for a long time, but says in the past few years the hunt has become much more difficult. VLADECK: These calls are not like the calls we grew up with. They are computer blasted calls that are enabled by the Internet. The dialers are outside the United States generally, and these dialers are capable of blasting out an unfathomable number of telephone calls. SILVERMAN: Last year, the FTC shut down one serial dialer called Asia Pacific. In an 18-month period it made over two and a half billion robocalls in the U. S. VLADECK: Hello? ROBOCALL: Your warrantee extended if it is not already. . . SILVERMAN: The majority of telephone calls that deliver pre-recorded messages trying to sell you something are illegal - and Vladeck says they're not just annoying, they're dangerous. VLADECK: Most of the robocalls we see are for scams that prey on people who are economically vulnerable. SILVERMAN: The FTC does go after and sue dozens of robocall companies every year, but Vladeck admits it isn't enough. Voice Over Internet Protocol, or VOIP, has given robocallers a cheap way to reach tens of millions of American consumers and stay offshore. So the FTC is looking for help. VLADECK: We've offered $50,000 to the individual or small company that presents us with technology that will enable consumers or the telecoms that serve us to block this assault of unwanted robocalls. SILVERMAN: So far, there are over 200 submissions. SHAWN DAVIS: My name is Shawn Davis. I'm 27. SILVERMAN: Shawn Davis is an IT technician in Boise, Idaho. His solution to the robocall problem is called Roboblock Twelve. It's a number verification system that requires callers to type in randomly generated numbers. DAVIS: If they do find a way to get through, and you find out it's an automated solicitor, you just press star 6-6, which is no and it adds them to the block list. SILVERMAN: A lot of submissions use technology to differentiate robots from humans - like those garbled numbers you have to decipher and type in online to prove you're human. But some are less technical. NAOMI WALLS: Turn your phone off or unplug it. SILVERMAN: Meet Naomi Walls. She's from Aurora, Colorado, and says ending robocalls is simple: turn your ringer off, and record this message. WALLS: You have reached the Walls' residence. Due to the number of robocalls I'm receiving, I've turned off my phone so that it won't ring. . . (LAUGHTER)SILVERMAN: That lady laughing is Kara Swisher - co-editor of All Things Digital and one the judges for the robocall competition. KARA SWISHER: OK, all right, I'll look upon it. That's a good solution. Yeah. That's a good solution to a lot of problems in life. SILVERMAN: Swisher won't reveal which ideas she likes so far, but says the winner could get a lot more than money. SWISHER: The people who invest in technology pay attention to all these incubators, all these competitions, all these hack-a-thons, so if there's an excellent solution, someone is going to pick it up. SILVERMAN: You still have about two weeks to submit your idea. Lauren Silverman, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)INSKEEP: It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News.

The search giant avoided any financial penalties, and the FTC's move is widely seen as a victory for Google. NPR's Steve Henn has been following the story and joins us now to fill us in on the details. And, Steve, this investigation has been going on for years. And now that it's over, I mean, how big a victory is it really for Google? STEVE HENN, BYLINE: Well, it's pretty enormous. For Google, the biggest treat to its business was that the FTC might decide to bring a formal antitrust case against Google or attempt to regulate how Google creates and displays its search results. Competitors like Microsoft and Yelp, a site which offers local restaurant reviews, have been arguing for years that Google tweaks its own search results to favor its own products and services. Last year, the FTC's own staff agreed. And they recommended bringing an antitrust case against Google. But today the FTC's commissioners decided to side with the search giant, so that's a pretty huge win. CORNISH: What's been the reaction in the industry? HENN: Well, obviously, Google's pretty pleased, but its competitors are furious. They immediately pointed out that both state attorneys general here in the U. S. and regulators in Europe are still investigating Google's search practices. And the FTC's already taking some heat for this decision. Here's FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz defending the decision at a press conference this afternoon. JON LEIBOWITZ: Many of Google's critics, including many of its competitors, wanted the commission to go further in this investigation and regulate the intricacies of Google's search engine algorithm. The commission exhaustively investigated allegations that Google unfairly manipulated its search engine results to harm its competitors. And today, the commission has voted to close this investigation unanimously. HENN: Leibowitz said commissioners and staff reviewed close to 9 million pages of documents. And while there was some evidence that Google manipulated search results to benefit its own products, he and other commissioners were ultimately convinced Google's primary reason for changing the look and feel of its results was to enhance users' experience. CORNISH: The search was just one part of the FTC's investigation. Did the commission forced Google to make any concessions? HENN: It did. Google made some small voluntary concessions in search and advertising. It promised to make it easier for small businesses to advertise on competing search engines and pledged to stop copying content, or scraping content from other websites without permission, and then using that content in its own local search results. Google also agreed to scale back its patent wars with rivals in the mobile phone industry. Last year when Google bought Motorola, it acquired a host of what are called standards essential patents. These are patents on basic technologies in mobile phones that are necessary for any mobile phone to work. Motorola and Google had refused to license some of these technologies to competitors on reasonable terms, and then they were suing those companies if they used these technologies in mobile phones sold in the U. S. As part of today's agreement, Google has promised to end that practice and drop those lawsuits. CORNISH: NPR's Steve Henn. Steve, thank you for explaining it. HENN: My pleasure.

The app is called RunPee. It began as a website several years ago, and listeners may remember we talked about it then. Now, you can take it with you into the theater. It lets you know when, during any given movie, you can run to the bathroom without missing an important plot point or a key scene. Take, for example, the blockbuster hit \"Titanic. \"(SOUNDBITE OF MOVIE, \"TITANIC\")BLOCK: The app tells you to run around this time in the movie. . . (SOUNDBITE OF MOVIE, \"TITANIC\")BLOCK: Instead of, let's say, this time. . . (SOUNDBITE OF MOVIE, \"TITANIC\")BLOCK: Well, we asked The A. V. Club's Nathan Rabin to do a trial run of RunPee. NATHAN RABIN: And I like to think that I was chosen both because I've been a film critic for about 15 years and I have a bladder of a small girl. BLOCK: He sent us this review. RABIN: So what this application does, and it leans very heavily towards recently released films, is it basically gives you two different pee times when you won't miss anything that they consider essential to the film. They have a brief nuts-and-bolts description of what happens during the times in which they tell you to go and pee, which is useful so you don't think you missed anything. They also have a feature where they describe what happened in the first three minutes of the movie. . . (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RABIN: . . . and it also has a timer so that you can start the timer at the very beginning of the film, and it will go off. I tested out the app by watching the Robert Zemeckis-Denzel Washington movie \"Flight. \"(SOUNDBITE OF MOVIE, \"FLIGHT\")RABIN: And there are things in it that are absolutely crucial. For example, it's a film about plane crash. So, obviously, you wanted to be in the theater when the plane crash happens. (SOUNDBITE OF MOVIE, \"FLIGHT\")RABIN: But what RunPee did was they kind of set two different times when the plot wasn't being forward, nothing terribly exciting was happening. There were kind of these nice little character moments. So one thing that is kind of interesting about RunPee is it's very subjective what is and what is not important. It's very charming. It's very useful, and it's also very much kind of a work in progress, like it's growing, it's evolving, the graphics are very low-fi, but it's very good at telling you what you absolutely can't miss, what you need to see and what is kind of inessential to the movie-going experience. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)BLOCK: That's Nathan Rabin of the entertainment newspaper and website The A. V. Club. He was reviewing the app called RunPee. It tells you the best times to make a run to the bathroom during a movie without missing any important scenes.

Her oldest son, Gregory, had been asking for an iPhone for years. When he turned 13, she finally figured he was ready to handle the responsibility, but the phone came with strings attached - 18 strings, to be exact. Janell wrote up 18 rules to teach her son about using technology responsibly. Some are practical, like turn your phone off after 7:30 p. m. on weeknights. Others are life lessons, like keep your eyes up. See the world happening around you. The rules were a contract that her son had to sign. She posted the contract on her blog, and it went viral. It's been translated into French and Japanese, and sparked a debate over parenting and technology. So we want to know: If you're a parent, how did you decide your kids were ready for smartphones? What did you tell them about using technology responsibly? Call us at 1-800-989-8255. Our email address is talk@npr. org, and you can join the conversation at our website. Go to npr. org and click on TALK OF THE NATION. Janell Burley Hofmann is a writer and blogger at janellburleyhofmann. com. She has five kids. She runs community programming and parenting workshops on Cape Cod, and she joins us by phone from her home in Sandwich, Massachusetts. Janell, thanks for being on the program. JANELL BURLEY HOFMANN: Thanks so much for having me. SHAPIRO: Why did you finally decide to relent and give your son a phone? HOFMANN: Well, in full disclosure. . . (LAUGHTER)HOFMANN: . . . I mean, this isn't very Christmas-y, but we had a free upgrade. (LAUGHTER)HOFMANN: So there was a little practical component to it, too. . . SHAPIRO: Sure. HOFMANN: . . . where he had been asking for a while, and we live in a very close-knit community where in - I just didn't see the need. I work in the community. My husband works in the community. And if he ever needed someone, there are literally thousands of people that he could access and get what he needed. So we're big fans of delaying the technology. We just didn't see the need. And recently, combined with the practicality of a free phone, recently, we saw that - saw some new responsibilities and some new maturity in him. He had been helping me with childcare, with his younger siblings, and he has some more independence. He, you know, takes off for the day and gets pizza with his buddies and those sorts of things. And so it was a combination of a lot of things, and the timing just felt right. And to be totally honest, it was going to be fun to wow him, because at this point. . . (LAUGHTER)HOFMANN: . . . he didn't expect it. He has said in an interview, I can't - it's like beating a dead horse. When my mom says no, she means no. (LAUGHTER)HOFMANN: So it was kind of fun to just surprise him. SHAPIRO: And did you know from the time you decided to get him an iPhone that it was going to come with this set of rules, with a contract that he'd have to sign? HOFMANN: For the most part, in the quiet of the night, I had my own anxieties about giving him this technology that would be the world at his fingertips. And so I - what's in this contract is absolutely nothing that we haven't ever had a discussion about. So it's kind of this living, breathing touch point for us and. . . SHAPIRO: Nothing was new for him. HOFMANN: Yeah. So even when he saw it - so I basically felt compelled to just put everything we've talked about to paper. And so that was kind of my motivation for doing it, and I wanted to do it with some warmth, with some love and with some accountability. It was a combination of all of those things. SHAPIRO: Yeah. The warmth and love come through in rule number one, which is: It is my phone. I bought it. I pay for it. I am loaning it to you. Aren't I the greatest? HOFMANN: That's pretty good, right? I mean, right off the bat, I want him to know how awesome I am. (LAUGHTER)SHAPIRO: And read what comes next in this list. HOFMANN: Sure. So the number two is: I will always know the password. SHAPIRO: And was that immediately obvious to you that this would have to be a requirement if he was going to own a phone? HOFMANN: Yeah. I'm sort of in tune with what, you know, other people are doing, or people with older kids. I'm kind of just been, you know, shadowing their experiences and seeing what's working for them and what doesn't. And not that - like Greg said, my mom's not a creeper, but I think she just wants it, just in case. And so I feel like I'm in tuned with him. And if I need it, I have it. I don't need to see them, you know, sending emoticons, smiley faces to each other back and forth, you know? That's not what my interest is or who danced with who at the dance. That's totally age-appropriate and that's his. But if I do need it, I just wanted to be able to access it. SHAPIRO: Some of the rules in here are things that I could imagine parents would have a hard time talking about with their kids. One of the rules is no porn. Another one is do not send or receive pictures of your private parts or anyone else's private parts. Important things for kids, but not necessarily easy to talk about with parents. HOFMANN: Yeah. To be totally honest, again, this was not new. You know, we've certainly had that pornography discussion and the accessibility of a generation past. You had to sneak a magazine or something like that where you had to really work if you want to see this. Well, now not so much. And so this has been something I just - I don't want you using it for that purpose, right? Like, you are curious human being that's changing. I respect that. But let's just keep the phone usage clean. And basically, that's, you know, he looked at the don't send naked pictures of yourself or receive of other people, and he had a good laugh at that. And that's why I even put in there don't laugh because maybe right now at 13, that seems preposterous. But maybe in college or something after you, you know, had a frat party, I want this, like, little voice in your head to be, like, I remember that contract for my first iPhone. And it's totally, you know, I mean those things. I say, you know, like, it could ruin your life. I mean that. You know, you don't want to be the boy 20 years later that's remembered for that. SHAPIRO: Some of the rules in here seemed applicable to any person of any stage in life. There was one I love, which is rule number 15. Will you read that one? HOFMANN: Absolutely. Let's see. Rule number 15. Download music that is new or classic or different than the millions of your peers that listen to the same exact stuff. Your generation has access to music like never before in history. Take advantage of that gift. Expand your horizons. SHAPIRO: What are you trying to instill in your son here? HOFMANN: Well, I think this was the one that was absolutely not new to him. My husband is a musician. He went to Berklee College of Music. We're constantly, you know, introducing him to what's new and what's old. So I just - I felt like I wanted to show him that I do, too, love this technology. I think it's beautiful. I think we have access to so many things, that, you know, for me, I had to save my money, go buy a CD. But for him, it's right there. It can come, you know, right onto his phone and he can have that. So while you're on the radio, you hear a lot of the same stuff, but it doesn't have to be that way for you. SHAPIRO: Let's take a call from Jennifer in Shaker Heights, Ohio. Hi, Jennifer. JENNIFER: Hi. SHAPIRO: Go ahead. Tell us your story. JENNIFER: So, this could not be more relevant in my life right now because I just purchased an iPad Mini for my 12-year-old and 10-year-old son. And actually, when we got our 12-year-old his first phone, we just got him a like a $25 Flip, which was as much for our convenience as it was for his because he could call me when he was done with soccer practice or whatever. And it was really no problem because he didn't use it to text or anything like that. But these iPad Minis for as wonderful as they are - because they can read books on them and they can draw in different little applications - it really has sort of opened up a big parenting can of worms because I'm questioning all sorts of things. So we read her contract together. SHAPIRO: Oh, so you're familiar with Janell's contract. JENNIFER: Oh, yeah. I saw it on Facebook, and I thought it was fantastic. So that evening, I brought both the boys on the couch and I was like listen to this. We're going to do this. This applies to us, and I want you to hear this. SHAPIRO: That's great. JENNIFER: So, you know, they rolled their eyes especially where she says you may laugh now, but down the road, you're going to think taking a picture of your private parts and sending it to someone is a good idea. SHAPIRO: Sure. JENNIFER: And they did laugh at that. But she's right. I can see this, you know, I can see this, you know, why not go ahead and sort of anticipate all that could go wrong because they need to know that, you know, once you put something in cyberspace, you can't take it back. SHAPIRO: Yeah. Well, Jennifer, let me ask. Was there anything you wanted to add to the list? Does your list have 19 or 20 compared to Janell's 18? JENNIFER: God, that's a good question. No. You know, she really - she did a good job covering it all. Right now, my big dilemma is, you know, fighting with them to get these things turned in by bedtime because their argument is that they need to - they like to read to fall asleep and they need the alarm clock. So actually, on my list of errands today is to buy, like, an - just an old-fashioned, digital or analog alarm clock so that I can at least nip that one in the bud. But the other one that's really hard is monitoring the emails. So in her thing, it says, you know, I will be reviewing your emails. And, you know, I have a hard time at that one because I feel like I need to, but at the same time, their argument to me is - but don't you trust us? You know, you must not trust us, kind of thing. So it's hard. SHAPIRO: OK. Well, Jennifer, thanks for the call. And, Janell, is this the sort of thing you hear a lot? Parents who have picked this up and adopted it for their own kids? HOFMANN: Yeah, absolutely. I was at the Boston Museum of Science with my son's seventh grade class right after this came out. And one of the girls in his class on the field trip came up to me, and she said, hi, Mrs. Hofmann. You don't know me, but my dad said that you really made his life a lot easier, and he just printed your contract and said do what she says. So that was a really cute example of - you can kind of see how it spreads. So certainly some people have sent me amendments or additions to what they thought. It should be 20 points. Certainly the texting and driving, which I kind of see is the golden rule of technology, so I didn't include that also because my son, you know, isn't driving. But absolutely the it-can-wait philosophy, I'm behind that. SHAPIRO: What do you mean when you say the golden rule of technology, the it-can-wait philosophy? HOFMANN: Yes. That you don't need to be texting while you're driving and it's that distracted driving. And just put it away or pull over and just know that it's going to be OK if you don't respond right away. SHAPIRO: Hmm. We have an email here from Jen in Tremont, Illinois, who writes: We took the contract from Janell that you're talking about and adapted it to our family to include all electronics for our son. It was so good that we took the time and went through each line with our 11-year-old son. He laughed at the same places. We added a few other lines and really spent a lot of time talking about all of them, so thank you, Janell, writes Jen. HOFMANN: Oh, it was nice. Yeah. And I think that's true too. I certainly never share this to say this is exactly what every household should be doing. I think what I'm asking, because - is just be in tune with what's happening for your family. So, certainly, you make changes to it. You know, people felt like, oh, for a different gender you might say different things. And, absolutely, I expect that everybody knows what's best for their family. This just happened to work for mine. SHAPIRO: But I understand you've also gotten some negative feedback. HOFMANN: Just a little. (LAUGHTER)SHAPIRO: Well, tell me about that. I mean, what's the criticism? HOFMANN: So the criticism is - some of it was that it's very controlling. You know, that issue of trust that the caller had, too, that don't you trust your child? And also that I've somehow - I humiliated my son because I've shared this contract that was private between us. And they assume that he's being teased or picked on. So there's a few components there that I've got some negative feedback. SHAPIRO: You know, one of the things that really strikes me, though, was the point you made earlier - that nothing in here was new to him, that these were all things you had talked about before. It seems to tie into a broader philosophy of parenting. Can you describe what that philosophy is? HOFMANN: Sure. I think what - some key points in here are, respect yourself, certainly, right? And then respect other people. I trust you enough to give you something that you're going to need to be really responsible with. So there's some responsibility in there. And I think there is that overall message, is, I want you to have that human experience still. Use this beautiful, powerful technology but be in tune with what's going on around you and, you know, stare out a window. . . (LAUGHTER)HOFMANN: . . . let your mind wonder, you know? That kind of stuff is what I really want for him with or without the iPhone. So you can see underneath the surface is about technology, but rooted, it's my parenting style and my love for him. SHAPIRO: We're talking about helping teenagers use technology in a responsible way. And you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. Well, speaking of negative feedback, we have an email here from Arnita(ph) in Minneapolis, who writes: I found this contract to be one of the worst parent-to-child documents ever written. She isn't giving a gift to her child. She is using it to assume the worst. It provides no useful information while underestimating the range and value that access to effective technology has to kids. Janell, care to respond? HOFMANN: Yeah. I think that's an interesting perspective. And certainly, she's not the only person that has that perspective. But I think when I sit with my son and look at his contract, I can just absolutely say, this is something that's working for us. He never saw it as a violation of trust or privacy. And to be totally honest, he keeps saying like, hey, mom, what's all the fuss about, you know? (LAUGHTER)HOFMANN: Because for him, this is his normal. These kinds of discussions, these kind of, you know, creative gesture towards a conversation and expectation is very much part of our daily life. SHAPIRO: I want to talk about the last rule on this list. Will you read number 18? HOFMANN: Absolutely. You will mess up, I will take your phone away. We will sit down and talk about it. You'll start over again. You and I, we are always learning. I am on your team. We are in this together. SHAPIRO: And what are you trying to accomplish through that final rule? HOFMANN: That this list is so imperfect, and I expect that my child is going to make a mistake and - but I want to show him I know he's real human being, and he's going to have human experiences. And that if something does happen, if there was a conversation that he had, that something he felt like, oh, because my mom made list, I can't ever come to her because I violated something on there, I want him to know that he can always come back to me, that the dialogue is always open. SHAPIRO: Yeah. HOFMANN: And I'll help him. SHAPIRO: Yeah. HOFMANN: I will help him navigate whatever waters he gets himself into. SHAPIRO: Let's go to another caller. This is Krista(ph) in Louisville, Kentucky. Hi, Krista. Oh, it looks like we've lost Krista. In that case, we've got Elisa from Elk Grove, California. Hi, Elisa. ELISA: Hi. SHAPIRO: Go ahead. ELISA: I'm 16 years old, and my mom has her own rule. This past summer, she didn't want us being idle and just sitting in our house and playing games and being on the computer all day. This isn't necessarily a smartphone but just in terms of technology. So she change the Wi-Fi password every day, and we wouldn't get it until we've been outside for at least an hour and all our chores were done. SHAPIRO: Oh, that's really smart. HOFMANN: I love that. SHAPIRO: That's Janell saying, I love that, not Elisa saying, I love that. Well, Elisa. . . HOFMANN: I'm sorry. SHAPIRO: . . . as a 16-year olds, do you ever rail against that and think, mom, I just want to use the Wi-Fi. ELISA: Oh, plenty, all the time. But I see - I think it really helps with my younger brother. My younger brothers are only 12 or 13. SHAPIRO: Yeah. ELISA: And this is a really positive for him because he's - I mean, I know we're the same generation, but it just feels like it's so much more prevalent in his life being connected, and I'm not super into being connected all the time with all my friends. But I think it's really good for him to have to go outside and actually do something other than playing games or Facebooking everybody all the time. SHAPIRO: OK. Thanks the call, Elisa. ELISA: Hmm. SHAPIRO: And let's take one, final call. This is Lisa in Hood River, Oregon. Hi, Lisa. LISA: Hi. SHAPIRO: Go ahead. LISA: So - yeah. I had a question for you. I was wondering how you feel about this emerging trend called the technology (unintelligible) are intentionally unplugging some commonly used forms of communication technology? SHAPIRO: Or just shutting it all down from time to time. LISA: Yeah. SHAPIRO: Janell, what do you think about that? HOFMANN: I haven't been - not been brave enough to try it. . . (LAUGHTER)HOFMANN: . . . but I certainly think there's some merit to it. You know, I think you just know, right? Like when you had too many cookies and you get a stomach ache, well, it might be time to back off. So it can - I think sometimes, we're so in it that it can literally make us not feel good. And I've had that experience, obviously, with this whole contract. I've been on my phone and using the technology quite a bit. And I can feel my self needing to detach a little bit from that, you know, in the upcoming weeks. And that's going to be something that I'm going to really have to consider because - especially for children, right? Like - and I think that's the, you know, 7:30 bedtime is - at least, my son is guaranteed a good 10 hours, where he doesn't even have to think about it. It's not on the table. So incorporating into our life where, you know, those - the technology diet that they're calling it, yeah, why not? SHAPIRO: But knowing you need to put it down is sometimes easier than actually putting it down. HOFMANN: Right, right. SHAPIRO: Well, that's Janell Burley Hofmann. She is a writer and blogger at JanellBurleyHofmann. com. She joined us from her home in Sandwich, Massachusetts, to talk about her 18-point smartphone contract that she gave her 13-year-old son, along with the iPhone. Janell, thank you so much for talking with us. HOFMANN: Thank you for having me. SHAPIRO: Tomorrow, Political Junkie Ken Rudin is back with trivia, and newly former Congressman Steve LaTourette on the state of the GOP. This is TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News. I'm Ira Shapiro, in Washington. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:  Now, if you have young kids, you may identify with Janell Burley Hofmann. Her oldest son, Gregory, had been asking for an iPhone for years. When he turned 13, she finally figured he was ready to handle the responsibility, but the phone came with strings attached - 18 strings, to be exact. Janell wrote up 18 rules to teach her son about using technology responsibly. Some are practical, like turn your phone off after 7:30 p. m. on weeknights. Others are life lessons, like keep your eyes up. See the world happening around you. The rules were a contract that her son had to sign. She posted the contract on her blog, and it went viral. It's been translated into French and Japanese, and sparked a debate over parenting and technology. So we want to know: If you're a parent, how did you decide your kids were ready for smartphones? What did you tell them about using technology responsibly? Call us at 1-800-989-8255. Our email address is talk@npr. org, and you can join the conversation at our website. Go to npr. org and click on TALK OF THE NATION. Janell Burley Hofmann is a writer and blogger at janellburleyhofmann. com. She has five kids. She runs community programming and parenting workshops on Cape Cod, and she joins us by phone from her home in Sandwich, Massachusetts. Janell, thanks for being on the program. JANELL BURLEY HOFMANN: Thanks so much for having me. SHAPIRO: Why did you finally decide to relent and give your son a phone? HOFMANN: Well, in full disclosure. . . (LAUGHTER) HOFMANN: . . . I mean, this isn't very Christmas-y, but we had a free upgrade. (LAUGHTER) HOFMANN: So there was a little practical component to it, too. . . SHAPIRO: Sure. HOFMANN: . . . where he had been asking for a while, and we live in a very close-knit community where in - I just didn't see the need. I work in the community. My husband works in the community. And if he ever needed someone, there are literally thousands of people that he could access and get what he needed. So we're big fans of delaying the technology. We just didn't see the need. And recently, combined with the practicality of a free phone, recently, we saw that - saw some new responsibilities and some new maturity in him. He had been helping me with childcare, with his younger siblings, and he has some more independence. He, you know, takes off for the day and gets pizza with his buddies and those sorts of things. And so it was a combination of a lot of things, and the timing just felt right. And to be totally honest, it was going to be fun to wow him, because at this point. . . (LAUGHTER) HOFMANN: . . . he didn't expect it. He has said in an interview, I can't - it's like beating a dead horse. When my mom says no, she means no. (LAUGHTER) HOFMANN: So it was kind of fun to just surprise him. SHAPIRO: And did you know from the time you decided to get him an iPhone that it was going to come with this set of rules, with a contract that he'd have to sign? HOFMANN: For the most part, in the quiet of the night, I had my own anxieties about giving him this technology that would be the world at his fingertips. And so I - what's in this contract is absolutely nothing that we haven't ever had a discussion about. So it's kind of this living, breathing touch point for us and. . . SHAPIRO: Nothing was new for him. HOFMANN: Yeah. So even when he saw it - so I basically felt compelled to just put everything we've talked about to paper. And so that was kind of my motivation for doing it, and I wanted to do it with some warmth, with some love and with some accountability. It was a combination of all of those things. SHAPIRO: Yeah. The warmth and love come through in rule number one, which is: It is my phone. I bought it. I pay for it. I am loaning it to you. Aren't I the greatest? HOFMANN: That's pretty good, right? I mean, right off the bat, I want him to know how awesome I am. (LAUGHTER) SHAPIRO: And read what comes next in this list. HOFMANN: Sure. So the number two is: I will always know the password. SHAPIRO: And was that immediately obvious to you that this would have to be a requirement if he was going to own a phone? HOFMANN: Yeah. I'm sort of in tune with what, you know, other people are doing, or people with older kids. I'm kind of just been, you know, shadowing their experiences and seeing what's working for them and what doesn't. And not that - like Greg said, my mom's not a creeper, but I think she just wants it, just in case. And so I feel like I'm in tuned with him. And if I need it, I have it. I don't need to see them, you know, sending emoticons, smiley faces to each other back and forth, you know? That's not what my interest is or who danced with who at the dance. That's totally age-appropriate and that's his. But if I do need it, I just wanted to be able to access it. SHAPIRO: Some of the rules in here are things that I could imagine parents would have a hard time talking about with their kids. One of the rules is no porn. Another one is do not send or receive pictures of your private parts or anyone else's private parts. Important things for kids, but not necessarily easy to talk about with parents. HOFMANN: Yeah. To be totally honest, again, this was not new. You know, we've certainly had that pornography discussion and the accessibility of a generation past. You had to sneak a magazine or something like that where you had to really work if you want to see this. Well, now not so much. And so this has been something I just - I don't want you using it for that purpose, right? Like, you are curious human being that's changing. I respect that. But let's just keep the phone usage clean. And basically, that's, you know, he looked at the don't send naked pictures of yourself or receive of other people, and he had a good laugh at that. And that's why I even put in there don't laugh because maybe right now at 13, that seems preposterous. But maybe in college or something after you, you know, had a frat party, I want this, like, little voice in your head to be, like, I remember that contract for my first iPhone. And it's totally, you know, I mean those things. I say, you know, like, it could ruin your life. I mean that. You know, you don't want to be the boy 20 years later that's remembered for that. SHAPIRO: Some of the rules in here seemed applicable to any person of any stage in life. There was one I love, which is rule number 15. Will you read that one? HOFMANN: Absolutely. Let's see. Rule number 15. Download music that is new or classic or different than the millions of your peers that listen to the same exact stuff. Your generation has access to music like never before in history. Take advantage of that gift. Expand your horizons. SHAPIRO: What are you trying to instill in your son here? HOFMANN: Well, I think this was the one that was absolutely not new to him. My husband is a musician. He went to Berklee College of Music. We're constantly, you know, introducing him to what's new and what's old. So I just - I felt like I wanted to show him that I do, too, love this technology. I think it's beautiful. I think we have access to so many things, that, you know, for me, I had to save my money, go buy a CD. But for him, it's right there. It can come, you know, right onto his phone and he can have that. So while you're on the radio, you hear a lot of the same stuff, but it doesn't have to be that way for you. SHAPIRO: Let's take a call from Jennifer in Shaker Heights, Ohio. Hi, Jennifer. JENNIFER: Hi. SHAPIRO: Go ahead. Tell us your story. JENNIFER: So, this could not be more relevant in my life right now because I just purchased an iPad Mini for my 12-year-old and 10-year-old son.

And I've had that experience, obviously, with this whole contract. I've been on my phone and using the technology quite a bit. And I can feel my self needing to detach a little bit from that, you know, in the upcoming weeks. And that's going to be something that I'm going to really have to consider because - especially for children, right? Like - and I think that's the, you know, 7:30 bedtime is - at least, my son is guaranteed a good 10 hours, where he doesn't even have to think about it. It's not on the table. So incorporating into our life where, you know, those - the technology diet that they're calling it, yeah, why not? SHAPIRO: But knowing you need to put it down is sometimes easier than actually putting it down. HOFMANN: Right, right. SHAPIRO: Well, that's Janell Burley Hofmann. She is a writer and blogger at JanellBurleyHofmann. com. She joined us from her home in Sandwich, Massachusetts, to talk about her 18-point smartphone contract that she gave her 13-year-old son, along with the iPhone. Janell, thank you so much for talking with us. HOFMANN: Thank you for having me.

The word is hashtag. The symbol for a hashtag looks like the pound sign on your phone. Five years ago, Twitter introduced it as a way to organize tweets and sort through trends. Now, hashtags are everywhere. Movie trailers use them to promote the latest blockbuster, shirts and hats sport the hashtag #YOLO for you only live once. Hashtags even pop up in conversations with friends like hashtag #eyeroll. And here's another example of how hashtags can be used. From our previous segment about weight loss, Audrey Pete tweeted about something Allison Aubrey just said on this program: Fit but fat. #thingsyouneverhearyourdocsay.

Laura, thanks for joining us. LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE: You're welcome. SHAPIRO: Explain to the non-Twitter users out there what a hashtag is, please. SYDELL: All right. well, basically as you said, it is - it's the number sign or the pound sign on your phone and you use that to sort of mark a conversation. So in a very, most basic way, I think this kind of started out where a group of people at an event wanted to say, have a private conversation that everybody - not private, i. e. , the public can see it, but just know what each other were saying about something and they put say, you know, #conferencex2012. . . SHAPIRO: Right. SYDELL: . . for example. And then they would write their tweet. And so you would know by that sign in the front and you can quickly search it. You can see all the things people are saying at your event. SHAPIRO: So when I was reporting on presidential debates during the campaign in the last year, each debate would have a designated hashtag, #debate2012, or whatever it was. And everybody wanting to follow the debate could just follow everything with that hashtag #debate2012. SYDELL: Exactly. And before we came on today, I was asking some of my Twitter followers about hashtags and somebody was saying that, you know, when the election results were coming in, there was a hashtag - I think, it was, you know, #election2012. And they were able - they saw the results first on that. They saw, you know, they said it was also kind of fun to see snarky things people said but you could get this whole sense of what was going on around the country by following this hashtag on Twitter. So it's a great tool, right? So, to have a conversation. SHAPIRO: That's level one, but then you get into a sort of more complicated layers of hashtag uses. It's been used commercially to promote anything and everything now. SYDELL: That is absolutely true. So now, you pretty much don't have a television show that doesn't have hashtags. You know, you might have a show, for example, like \"The Voice,\" right? And people who are fans of - and for people who don't know what \"The Voice\" is, it's basically a competition to see who has the greatest singing voice, and you might have. . . SHAPIRO: Right. It's sort of an off-shoot of \"American Idol\", more or less. SYDELL: Exactly. And, you know, they use it to grade effect, to sort of say, you know, tell us what you think of this voice. And it gets people engaged. I mean, television and Twitter is a big part of it; has become an interactive event where you are tweeting with your friends, tweeting with other viewers, and it's a great way to promote a show and to keep people engaged. You know, there's a hashtag maybe about the show that continues after the show's off the air. So you got your fans engaged even when the show's no longer on air. So it's great for advertising your show. SHAPIRO: And yet, nobody is curating hashtags. Nobody is editing them and saying, oh, this one is in, this one is out, which can lead to some unexpected results. SYDELL: Yes. As a matter of fact, Ari, I think one time, there was somebody - there was some sort of negative things being said about gay people. I think you went on the. . . SHAPIRO: Yeah. So there was this hashtag, #SignsYoSonIsGay, which started out as anti-gay hashtag. SYDELL: Mm-hmm. And then. . . SHAPIRO: And then people started writing things, like hashtag #SignsYoSonIsGay, he's the brave and beloved chaplain of the New York City Fire Department who became the first official casualty of 9/11, or SignsYoSonIsGay, he invented the computer and won World War II by cracking the Nazi ciphers - referring, of course, to Alan Turing. People took over this hashtag and turned into something else. SYDELL: Yeah. So it is completely open. And in that way, it's kind of an amazing dialogue. I mean, I think Twitter is up to 200 million users now, something like that. So you have millions and millions of people who are there who are joining in a conversation. You know, there's an interesting story about a program called \"The Game,\" which was oriented towards African-Americans. And \"The Game\" is about the, you know, downtime for football - for a group of football players, professional football players and their wives. And \"The Game\" was taken off the CW in 2009. And there was, like, a . . . SHAPIRO: That TV network. Yeah. SYDELL: Yeah. And there was revolt on Twitter. And BET picked it up, because they saw all these people on Twitter who were tweeting about \"The Game\" and using a hashtag. And so it actually brought it back on, helped publicize it. The show ended up being the most - the second-most watched show in the network's history. And when people watch \"The Game,\" they, you know, used the hashtag, which just brings me to another point I want to make. You know, in many ways, there are distinct groups that hashtags often kind of elaborate and show. For example, although I think African-Americans are about 12 percent of the population, 25 - around 25 percent of Twitter users are African-American. And there are a lot of conversations going on in distinct communities, like African-Americans, who will use hashtags in oftentimes urban use. They may not have a computer. They have a cell phone, and hashtags are a way to get a whole conversation going. SHAPIRO: We want to hear from about the most successful hashtag you've ever created, or the best one you've stumbled upon. Our number is 1-800-989-8255, or you can email us at talk@npr. org. Let's go to Katie in Edmond, Oklahoma. Hi, Katie. KATIE: Hi. How are you doing? SHAPIRO: Good. Tell us your story. KATIE: Well, yesterday, my roommate and I were cooking some tofu for the first time, and it turned out pretty poorly. It was not good. So we tweeted (technical difficulties). And we said: Am I doing it wrong? And attached a picture of the tofu and hashtagged #tofu, and he ended favoriting it. SHAPIRO: Oh, you tweeted Alton Brown, the Food Network celebrity - I don't know if you'd call him a chef. But he has a show on the Food Network. KATIE: He's on \"Iron Chef\" and \"Good Eats. \"SHAPIRO: And so he favorited your hashtag, #tofu. (LAUGHTER)KATIE: Yup. It's a good way to be in contact with somebody I wouldn't normally have been in contact with. SHAPIRO: Oh, sorry. Go ahead, Laura. SYDELL: I just - did you find out what you did wrong as a result? KATIE: No. He never let me know. (unintelligible) several things. It was not good. SHAPIRO: Thanks for the call, Katie. And, Laura, this is another aspect of Twitter that is - can sort of bring total strangers in contact with massive celebrities or mid-level celebrities, as the case may be. SYDELL: Exactly. You know, and I say as a journalist - and, Ari, I bet you do this, too. I mean, I have - I don't know something, like, 4,000 Twitter followers and I have Facebook friends, and I'll tweet something if I'm looking for a source on something. And, you know, it's great, because people respond and I have conversations with people who I don't know. So you can do that, as well. SHAPIRO: We also have Andy Carvin on the line now. He is NPR senior strategist for social media, and he is an active Twitter user, to say the least. . . ANDY CARVIN, BYLINE: Which to say the least. SHAPIRO: . . . with more than 150,000 tweets to his name. Joining us via Skype, Andy, thanks for being here. CARVIN: Thanks, Ari. Good to be here. SHAPIRO: You have sort of an interesting Twitter case study, as you have curated thousands of tweets about current events, whether it is breaking news in the context of school shootings or the uprisings of the Arab Spring. Describe how you've used hashtags to help cover those stories, and what you've observed. CARVIN: Well, in many cases when news events are bubbling up somewhere, someone on the ground comes up with a hashtag. So, for example, when the Egyptian Revolution was being planned two years ago, they used the hashtag #Jan25 for the date January 25th. It was essentially an opportunity for people to RSVP online for the event. And so for the 18 days of the Egyptian Revolution, you could follow quite closely on the ground in Tahrir Square what was going on with people simply by monitoring the #Jan25 hashtag. At other points in 2011, during the Arab Spring, I would often work with my Twitter followers to identify things that people were finding - like munitions, for example. So sometimes I would send out a picture of a landmine or some other type of munitions that have been founded in Syria or Libra, what have you, and then use the hashtag #IDthis. So people would often reply directly to me using my @acarvin Twitter account. But they didn't have to, because they could have conversations among themselves using the #IDthis hashtag. And doing that, we were actually able to identify the make, model and manufacturer of some of these munitions. SHAPIRO: Wow. But, you know, Andy, I've tried using hashtags in the middle of breaking new situations, and I find so many people are tweeting things to the effect of what's going on with the hashtag of whatever the news event is, which is not especially helpful. How much chaff do you have to sort through to get to wheat? CARVIN: Well, I think one of the problems is we have - it's - we have an abundance of people online so eager to use hashtags that, just as you said, that separating the wheat from the chaff can be difficult. Especially, I've seen when a hashtag starts to trend on Twitter - in other words, it gets listed as one of the top hashtags of that particular moment - you start seeing spam sent to it. You start seeing news organizations pick up on it. For me, the sweet spot for hashtags is when they're just below the radar, so when people who are on the ground, at the location of a breaking news event have started using it among themselves. But once you start seeing it being used by mainstream media or by celebrities, it often goes over this cliff where you're flooded with information. And so I always try to track down the hashtags early on, because there's diminishing returns on them over time. SHAPIRO: Interesting. We have two bits of feedback from listeners that sort of show the enormous range of roles that hashtags can play. First a tweet from L. A. Pierce(ph), who writes: During the Egyptian revolution, I crashed TweetDeck by searching hashtag #egypt. That and hashtag #iranelection were most important to me. And then, on perhaps the other end of the spectrum, Brett(ph) writes: My favorite thing about Twitter is the very active design artist community. One of my favorite hashtags is hashtag #omhg, which stands for oh, my handmade goodness, and it's a hashtag dedicated to helping the handmade community connect and grow. SYDELL: Wow. SHAPIRO: So, Andy, I guess we got the two ends of the spectrum there. CARVIN: Yeah. I'm glad they mentioned the Iran election hashtag, because that was one of the first that really demonstrated the geopolitical consequences of a hashtag, which sounds really strange saying that. But because Iran was shut off so quickly to the outside world as their - the protests spread all over the country back in 2009, following the Iran election hashtag was one of the few ways to see what videos and texts and other things people were circulating from the country. So, for example, that famous awful video of Neda Soltan after she was shot in the head and as she was dying, that circulated worldwide thanks, in part, to the #iranelection hashtag. SHAPIRO: That's Andy Carvin, NPR's senior strategist for our social media desk. Andy, thanks for being with us. CARVIN: Thanks for having me. SHAPIRO: And you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News. Let's go to Alison(ph) in Salt Lake City, Utah. Hi, Alison. ALISON: Hi. SHAPIRO: Tell us your story. ALISON: Yeah. So I work for a national college ministry, InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, and we had a large conference just over the holiday season. There were 16,000 students who came into St. Louis. And we used Twitter this year to really facilitate conversation throughout the conference. SHAPIRO: And how did it work? ALISON: It was great. So we used a hashtag called #U12. The conference was called Urbana, and so because it was 2012, it was #U12. And we started using that the day before the conference, so while students were traveling or tweeting about being excited to come. And it was hugely successful. So people used it throughout the whole conference. We had thousands of tweets that came in with the #U12 hashtag. Our social media team - so we had a team of about 10 people who were tweeting all week long with our Urbana Twitter account. We, I think, tweeted around 3,000 times. And it was a five-day conference. So it was just amazing. We would see real-time responses from students of how they are reacting to certain speakers and talks and kind of what they were thinking, how they would apply the things that they were learning at the conference. SHAPIRO: Great. Thanks for the call, Alison. ALISON: Thank you. SHAPIRO: And, Laura Sydell, one use of the hashtag that is perhaps a little more sophisticated that we haven't discussed is the hashtag that only appears once, in all likelihood, as a comment on the thing that came immediately before it. So. . . SYDELL: Yes, and I think this is sort of more or less pioneered by very creative people. For example, Rosanne Cash - several of my Twitter-user friends said - is one of the best at this. So, for example, just sort of in a quirky way, she'll write, it's raining - it's coming down cats and dogs: hashtag #professionalmeteorologist. So. . . SHAPIRO: Yeah. Or there was an example in a New York Times magazine piece by Julia Turner, who wrote about Lena Dunham, who created the HBO show \"Girls. \" Lena Dunham tweeted: What's my place in it all? Hashtag #questionsevenmymomcantanswer. SYDELL: Right. It's not - you know, chances are, it's not going to take off big. In fact, what's fun about it is that it's a commentary and sort of metadata. SHAPIRO: Yeah. SYDELL: It's sort of saying, like, I'm going to be a non-big thing, so I'm going to use a hashtag. SHAPIRO: Yes. Let's go to Deb in Boulder Colorado. Hi, Deb. DEB: Hi, Ari. How are you? SHAPIRO: Good, thanks. Tell us how you use the hashtag. DEB: Oh, I am addicted to Instagram. And I've lived in some pretty obscure places in the world. SHAPIRO: Instagram, of course, is a photo-sharing app on the iPhones. Yeah. DEB: For photos. Uh-huh. Exactly. And so one night, I was thinking about different places I've lived, and I thought: I wonder if there are any pictures of this little village at the top of the Alps, Leysin, Switzerland. So I hashtagged #Leysin, and sure enough, all the pictures that have been taken of there and that people, you know, preface with their hashtag showed up. And so I got to see my village again. And then I thought, hmm. I wonder - I used to live in a deserted beach in West Africa, in Sierra Leone called Lakka Beach. So. . . SHAPIRO: Sounds like you've had a really interesting life, Deb. DEB: Yeah, I know. (LAUGHTER)DEB: And so I hashtagged #LakkaBeach, and sure enough, all these pictures showed up of Lakka Beach. And then I thought, I wonder if there are pictures from Bhutan. Oh, my gosh, pictures of Bhutan. Then I started to think about places where there's unrest right now, like Syria. Yes, there are pictures of - from Syria. And it - wherever in the world you - well, let me back up and just say, so when I'm sleeping over night, all of these pictures are sort of pouring in from the world that I've selected that I want and the people that I want to follow. And then the first thing I do when I get up in the morning, I reach over for my iPhone and I look at these glorious pictures. . . SHAPIRO: That's a great story, Deb. We're going to have to end on that note. But I appreciate your call. NPR correspondent Laura Sydell also joined us from the San Francisco bureau. Laura, great to talk to you.

SHAPIRO: You have sort of an interesting Twitter case study, as you have curated thousands of tweets about current events, whether it is breaking news in the context of school shootings or the uprisings of the Arab Spring. Describe how you've used hashtags to help cover those stories, and what you've observed. CARVIN: Well, in many cases when news events are bubbling up somewhere, someone on the ground comes up with a hashtag. So, for example, when the Egyptian Revolution was being planned two years ago, they used the hashtag #Jan25 for the date January 25th.

But because Iran was shut off so quickly to the outside world as their - the protests spread all over the country back in 2009, following the Iran election hashtag was one of the few ways to see what videos and texts and other things people were circulating from the country. So, for example, that famous awful video of Neda Soltan after she was shot in the head and as she was dying, that circulated worldwide thanks, in part, to the #iranelection hashtag. SHAPIRO: That's Andy Carvin, NPR's senior strategist for our social media desk. Andy, thanks for being with us. CARVIN: Thanks for having me. SHAPIRO: And you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News. Let's go to Alison(ph) in Salt Lake City, Utah. Hi, Alison. ALISON: Hi. SHAPIRO: Tell us your story. ALISON: Yeah. So I work for a national college ministry, InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, and we had a large conference just over the holiday season. There were 16,000 students who came into St. Louis. And we used Twitter this year to really facilitate conversation throughout the conference. SHAPIRO: And how did it work? ALISON: It was great. So we used a hashtag called #U12. The conference was called Urbana, and so because it was 2012, it was #U12. And we started using that the day before the conference, so while students were traveling or tweeting about being excited to come. And it was hugely successful. So people used it throughout the whole conference. We had thousands of tweets that came in with the #U12 hashtag. Our social media team - so we had a team of about 10 people who were tweeting all week long with our Urbana Twitter account. We, I think, tweeted around 3,000 times. And it was a five-day conference. So it was just amazing. We would see real-time responses from students of how they are reacting to certain speakers and talks and kind of what they were thinking, how they would apply the things that they were learning at the conference. SHAPIRO: Great. Thanks for the call, Alison. ALISON: Thank you. SHAPIRO: And, Laura Sydell, one use of the hashtag that is perhaps a little more sophisticated that we haven't discussed is the hashtag that only appears once, in all likelihood, as a comment on the thing that came immediately before it. So. . . SYDELL: Yes, and I think this is sort of more or less pioneered by very creative people. For example, Rosanne Cash - several of my Twitter-user friends said - is one of the best at this. So, for example, just sort of in a quirky way, she'll write, it's raining - it's coming down cats and dogs: hashtag #professionalmeteorologist. So. . . SHAPIRO: Yeah. Or there was an example in a New York Times magazine piece by Julia Turner, who wrote about Lena Dunham, who created the HBO show \"Girls. \" Lena Dunham tweeted: What's my place in it all? Hashtag #questionsevenmymomcantanswer. SYDELL: Right. It's not - you know, chances are, it's not going to take off big. In fact, what's fun about it is that it's a commentary and sort of metadata. SHAPIRO: Yeah. SYDELL: It's sort of saying, like, I'm going to be a non-big thing, so I'm going to use a hashtag. SHAPIRO: Yes. Let's go to Deb in Boulder Colorado. Hi, Deb. DEB: Hi, Ari. How are you? SHAPIRO: Good, thanks. Tell us how you use the hashtag. DEB: Oh, I am addicted to Instagram. And I've lived in some pretty obscure places in the world. SHAPIRO: Instagram, of course, is a photo-sharing app on the iPhones. Yeah. DEB: For photos. Uh-huh. Exactly. And so one night, I was thinking about different places I've lived, and I thought: I wonder if there are any pictures of this little village at the top of the Alps, Leysin, Switzerland. So I hashtagged #Leysin, and sure enough, all the pictures that have been taken of there and that people, you know, preface with their hashtag showed up. And so I got to see my village again. And then I thought, hmm. I wonder - I used to live in a deserted beach in West Africa, in Sierra Leone called Lakka Beach. So. . . SHAPIRO: Sounds like you've had a really interesting life, Deb. DEB: Yeah, I know. (LAUGHTER) DEB: And so I hashtagged #LakkaBeach, and sure enough, all these pictures showed up of Lakka Beach. And then I thought, I wonder if there are pictures from Bhutan. Oh, my gosh, pictures of Bhutan. Then I started to think about places where there's unrest right now, like Syria. Yes, there are pictures of - from Syria. And it - wherever in the world you - well, let me back up and just say, so when I'm sleeping over night, all of these pictures are sort of pouring in from the world that I've selected that I want and the people that I want to follow. And then the first thing I do when I get up in the morning, I reach over for my iPhone and I look at these glorious pictures. . . SHAPIRO: That's a great story, Deb. We're going to have to end on that note. But I appreciate your call. NPR correspondent Laura Sydell also joined us from the San Francisco bureau. Laura, great to talk to you. Thanks for being with us. SYDELL: It was my pleasure. SHAPIRO: And we spoke with Andy Carvin, NPR's senior strategist for the social media desk who joined us via Skype.

There, more and more devices are coming with built-in computer chips and sensors. And as NPR's Steve Henn reports from CES, that's bound to change how we interact with the machines around us. STEVE HENN, BYLINE: I was walking down a hallway yesterday at the Renaissance Hotel here, and this tiny little robot scooted out to meet me. It's sort of like a gosling, a little baby gosling that imprints or a puppy dog. Is that the idea? Oh, my God. (LAUGHTER)HENN: It's following me. Now, if I just walk away, do I get to keep the robot? Without me doing anything, this robot named Turtle attached to me. It followed me through the crowed hallway, just me, no one else. It didn't get confused. He only loves me. I stopped walking, and Turtle came up and nudged my foot. You start to feel protective. ANDREA TUNBRIDGE: Yeah. It's like they're a little pet, and it's just a piece of plastic. HENN: He just drove over my foot. Andrea Tunbridge works for PrimeSense. This company doesn't make the robot, but PrimeSense makes the 3-D sensors which allow Turtle to see, navigate in space and ultimately recognize my particular gait. Basically, PrimeSense makes Turtle's eyes. YANIV VAKRAT: It requires actually quite a bit of work. HENN: Yaniv Vakrat is an executive VP at PrimeSense. VAKRAT: You know, our regular cameras can see the world in two dimensions and can capture the color and the image. What PrimeSense has done is essentially turn that into a three-dimensional view which is the way we actually see the world as human beings. HENN: PrimeSense's cameras have already been built into Microsoft's Kinect for the Xbox. That videogame controller allows you to play games and control your TV with gestures, but Vakrat believes games just scratch the surface of what these cameras can do. VAKRAT: And we believe that it's as revolutionary as anything that you've seen because it really is changing the way machines perceive their environment. HENN: Later this year, PrimeSense will begin selling a new 3-D sensor to gadget makers. It's smaller than my pinky and will cost less than a third of what the first-generation sensors cost. It's little enough to be built into tablets or smartphones, really almost anything you can imagine. Attach one to a projector, like a television projector. . . VAKRAT: And we've turned what is essentially a wall, right, into an interactive screen. HENN: The wall - just a regular wall - becomes a giant touch-screen that works like the screen on your smartphone or tablet. And when these sensors are built into tablets and phones, it suddenly becomes possible to create detailed, accurate 3-D models of your house just by walking through and filming your home with a mobile device. You could take that model with you when you go shopping for a couch. You could send it to a 3-D printer and create a dollhouse for your kid, or you could play a videogame where the digital monsters you're fighting are running around your living room. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEOGAME)HENN: And big businesses are eyeing this technology too. RAUL VERANO: OK. We're Shopperception. We provide retail analytics. HENN: Raul Verano is the CEO of Shopperception. His company is mounting PrimeSense cameras in supermarkets. So if you're standing in the cereal aisle, he'll know when you reach for a box, and he'll know which box you're reaching for. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Wait. Did you try this cereal instead? It's 50 percent off. HENN: So you reach for the Apple Jacks, and your mobile device, as you reach for it, deliver an ad for a different cereal. VERANO: Yeah, exactly because, for example, Wal-Mart would be very interested in doing that because they take a higher margin from the Apple Blasts. HENN: From the generic? VERANO: Exactly. HENN: Retailers are not doing anything like that yet, but right now, the biggest consumer products companies in the world spend millions every year sending researchers to supermarkets to track consumer choices. These cameras could automate all of that, and already, one of the world's biggest beverage companies has signed a deal to test them. Steve Henn, NPR News, Las Vegas.

I'm Audie Cornish. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: And I'm Melissa Block. 2012 was the year of mobile commerce. That's according to some tech analysts. That means consumers weren't just browsing on their smartphones and tablets. As NPR's Laura Sydell reports, they were typing in their credit card numbers and hitting buy. LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE: They knew it would happen eventually, says Clark Frederick of the research firm eMarketer, and last year, Frederick says consumers made the leap to mobile in record numbers. CLARK FREDERICK: Mobile commerce went from a negligible portion of retail ecommerce sales a couple years ago to 11 percent in 2012, which is substantial. SYDELL: Frederick says last year consumers hit the buy button on mobile devices to the tune of $25 billion. Part of the reason there was so much growth is that a lot more people have iPads, Kindles and other tablet computers. FREDERICK: People like shopping on tablets. Tablets have a high-resolution display, fingertip browsibility, instant power on, and it makes them ideal devices for shopping. SYDELL: Amazon has been a real leader in the mobile market. Its Kindle was the first tablet computer to excite consumers, though the original only made it easy to buy books. But now, the Kindle makes it easy to buy everything on the Amazon site from books to shoes, and Amazon has apps for iPads, iPhones, Android phones. SAM HALL: Matter of fact, our goal is for someone to go from wanting something to buying it in under 30 seconds. SYDELL: That's Sam Hall, who is the vice president of mobile shopping at Amazon. Hall says Amazon saw a big uptick in purchases made on mobile devices this past holiday season. He thinks mobile devices have changed the idea of what it means to go shopping. HALL: Shopping doesn't need to be a single event where I'm sitting in front of my P. C. or going to a store. I can buy a gift for someone wherever I am. I can be in line at Starbucks. I can be in a boring meeting. I can be sitting on the couch. SYDELL: Big companies like Amazon enjoy a large advantage in that they have the resources to make their mobile shopping experience easy. Andrew Gazdecki, the CEO of Bizness Apps, which helps build shopping apps, says small business are realizing they need to invest in mobile. ANDREW GAZDECKI: If they don't have a mobile experience, there've been studies that show that customers will bounce over to competitors' websites. SYDELL: Gazdecki says ease of use is crucial to success. He says everyone from restaurants to jewelry stores are getting into the mobile game.

The smooth loading of video clips, though, is not just important to viewers. As NPR's Sami Yenigun reports, video providers also see it as critical. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)SAMI YENIGUN, BYLINE: You may have heard this one already. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)YENIGUN: You're showing a friend some hilarious video that you found online. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)YENIGUN: And right before you get the punchline. . . (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)YENIGUN: A little loading dial pops up in the middle of the screen. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)YENIGUN: Buffering kills comedic timing, and according to a study published by UMass professor Ramesh Sitaraman, it kills attention spans too. RAMESH SITARAMAN: What we found was that people are pretty patient for up to two seconds. YENIGUN: That's a really nice way of saying people are pretty impatient. SITARAMAN: If you start out with, say, 100 users, if the video hasn't started in five seconds, about one-quarter of those viewers are gone, and if the video doesn't start up in 10 seconds, almost half the viewers are gone. YENIGUN: If a video doesn't load in time, people get frustrated and click away. This may not come as a shock, but until now it hadn't come as an empirically supported fact either. SITARAMAN: This is really the first large-scale study of this kind, that tries to relate video-streaming quality to viewer behavior. YENIGUN: And when Professor Sitaraman says large scale, he means it. The study looked at close to 6. 7 million viewers who watched almost 23 million videos played. So how long is too long? Depends on the device. SITARAMAN: We found that people who had a lot of connectivity had also a lot of expectation potentially, and so they abandoned much sooner. YENIGUN: For about half of the people who used a high speed fiber optic connection, five seconds is too long to wait. Mobile users will wait longer. For a business that serves an ad base of 800 million people a month, every second counts. The more users that click away, the bigger the problem. ANDY BERKHEIMER: When we started to look into this problem, we found that kind of the existing player we had was not up to the task. YENIGUN: That's Andy Berkheimer, engineering manager for YouTube. For the past two years, his team has been working on a project that makes sure your knock-knock jokes are delivered without the pauses. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)BERKHEIMER: And so we had to rewrite our entire player to give us more flexibility in how we handled network conditions. YENIGUN: The need for flexibility has to do with bandwidth. Think of streaming video as being like a stream of liquid information. Bandwidth is the size of the pipe. No matter where you are, no matter what type of device you're using, no matter what type of network you're on - at any time while you're watching a video, bandwidth can change. So if that bandwidth, or pipe, constricts too much. . . (SOUNDBITE OF WATER)YENIGUN: . . . the video stops playing. Here's how YouTube is solving this problem. They chop the video into a bunch of tiny pieces. From moment to moment, depending on how much bandwidth is available, they swap these pieces in and out as the video streams. So if there's a ton of bandwidth, a high definition piece flows down the pipe, but if that pipe constricts, even for a second, a lower quality piece is swapped in. SITARAMAN: And that way we can keep the data flowing uninterrupted, and we can choose a quality level that is right for the bandwidth conditions at that moment. YENIGUN: And less load time means more video, more eyeballs, and more money for ads. But what's the cost? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)YENIGUN: Some films aren't always seen in their best light. For example, filmmaker Gregory Wilson just used state of the art camera equipment to film a Cheetah running full speed in super-slow motion. HD captures every stunning detail of the cat's fluid motion. But when you watch it online, who knows how it will look. GREGORY WILSON: I would hope that, you know, the quality could be the best that it could be and be more on par with what I had originally captured. YENIGUN: But since businesses need that video to run no matter what it looks like, the rest of us will likely see grainy cheetahs rather than stuttering punch lines. Sami Yenigun, NPR News.

And here is the sound of a car approaching. (SOUNDBITE OF CAR)SIEGEL: Now here's the sound of a hybrid approaching and going past us. That was a pretty subtle sound. And the problem for people who are blind is that the hybrid is the motorized equivalent of a pair of sneakers. BLOCK: Well, for the first time, on Monday, the Transportation Department proposed minimum sound standards for hybrid and electric vehicles. Cyclists and pedestrians, especially those who are visually impaired, have little warning of an approaching vehicle with a silent engine. So, the National Highway Safety Administration posted some possible sounds to its website, such as this. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SOUND)BLOCK: And this. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SOUND)BLOCK: And this. . .

STEVE HENN, BYLINE: The Internet isn't just for people anymore. What began as a way for human beings to communicate using computers, smartphones or tablets has evolved into a network that's connecting more and more machines to each other. And the machines have a lot to say. Meet Ivee. JONATHON NOSTRANT: Hello, Ivy. (SOUNDBITE OF BEEPING)HENN: That's Jonathon Nostrant, the founder and CEO of the company that makes Ivee. NOSTRANT: What's the weather in London on Saturday? IVEE: Saturday in London, the temperature will be 34 degrees. You can expect partly cloudy skies mid-morning. HENN: Ivee is a next generation alarm clock. NOSTRANT: So we started making voice-activated talking alarm clocks. And basically what we found is that people like to talk to devices. The biggest benefit with our products today is that they can set the time of the alarm, but tomorrow they're going to be able to do so much more. HENN: Say you're chilly. Just tell Ivee to turn up the heat. IVEE: OK. I've set your thermostat to 73. HENN: Sensors that can connect to the Net are already embedded in some thermostats, scales, door locks, light switches, windows, and even some sprinkler systems.

NOSTRANT: Instead of taking your phone out of your pocket, sliding over the bar, hitting the app to get in the app, going to the button, selecting the lights on and off, why not just say, hello, Ivee, turn the lights on? HENN: The thing is, Ivee is just one of dozens of different companies which are competing to get the smart home to actually work. There are crowd-funded start-ups like Smart Things. There are security companies, like ADT and Alarm. com. Even giant telecoms like Verizon - all want to sell you something to help you connect every little appliance you own to the Net. There's even one very big hardware store getting into this act: Lowe's. KEVIN MARR: My name's Kevin Marr and my title VP of Smart Home for Lowe's. HENN: When did Lowe's decide that it needed a VP for Smart Home? How long have you had this job? MARR: Exactly a year - just a little over a year, but. . . HENN: Marr has been building connected gadgets for so-called smart homes for more than a decade. MARR: You walk out to your car and frankly everything in your car works, interacts with each other. You've got central locking, electric windows. The door locks when you turn the ignition on. You know, there's a logic to the way all these things work. HENN: In the home, Marr says, these same kinds of technologies could help save energy and water. They can make your home safer. They could even send you a text if an elderly parent doesn't get up and fire up the coffee maker at the usual time. MARR: Everything but everything is going to be connected to the Internet. HENN: And a lot of good could come of that, so Lowe's created a simple control system called Iris you can install yourself, that can talk to almost any connected appliance Lowe's sells. In the past, companies built different kinds of sensors into products and all these little gizmos couldn't talk to each other. MARR: And that's the advantage we have at Lowe's. We sell this stuff and we can talk with our vendors and we can say, look, guys, I want you to make it so that when it connects, it connects this way. HENN: And if you're an executive at, say, Pella Windows or Whirlpool, when Lowe's calls, you take the call.

More than 156,000 salespeople, electronics buyers, electronics enthusiasts, and a number of reporters descended on the city to gawk at acres and acres - at the latest shiny gadgets. NPR's Steve Henn was there to gawk, too. Thanks for joining us, Steve. STEVE HENN, BYLINE: Oh, my pleasure. SIMON: Now, I understand - for the first time in a decade, Microsoft didn't have a booth. Now, Apple - famously - doesn't attend this show; neither do Amazon or Google. Can you really have a consumer electronics show without those companies, after all, who pioneered so many products? HENN: Yeah, I think you can. Obviously, there was a lot of talk before the show, about the fact that they wouldn't be there. But I think for most people, when we got there, they weren't really missed, you know. And actually, hundreds of executives from those firms were in Las Vegas; checking out the technologies that other little companies were building, and thinking about how they could incorporate them into their next gadget. Here's Jason Mendleson. He's a venture capitalist, based in Boulder, who I ran into on the show floor. JASON MENDLESON: I've absolutely been amazed at - couple things. One, startups are here, finally. Five years ago, there were none. Now, there are companies here that are the next big companies, that folks like me - venture capitalists - can come see, meet. HENN: So the most interesting stuff at CES - at least, for me - is almost never a new product that's being released by some big giant. You know, sometimes when a big firm gives you a peek inside what they're working on, in a lab, that can be fascinating. But I've always really loved finding the quirky, little firms that are doing new, interesting stuff. And I think the folks who organize CES have finally realized that those innovative, little firms are actually one of the big reasons people come. SIMON: You have a favorite? HENN: One that I saw - right before I left - was pretty great. It was called Lapka. And lapka is, apparently, the Russian word for rabbit food. And traditionally, I guess, you'd carry a little bit of this around in your pocket, for protection. Their product is a set of beautifully crafted environmental sensors. They're actually made from wood and an ivory-colored plastic. And they kind of reminded me of a high-tech set of worry beads. But the string on the beads is a plug you can connect to your iPhone. So one of the sensors is a tiny probe you can poke into food - like an apple - and it will measure the nitrates, and tell you whether or not that apple is organic. (LAUGHTER)HENN: Another sensor measures electromagnetic fields. There's one for radiation; one for temperature and humidity. So  if you have a baby, there's a setting to tell you the ideal temperature for your child to take a nap. SIMON: Steve, I guarantee you, that's not what parents do. HENN: I'm thinking that their market is for the overprotected first parent. Your second child, not so much. (LAUGHTER)SIMON: Steve Henn, NPR's tech correspondent. Thanks so much.

He was a computer prodigy and an activist, who committed suicide on Friday. He was only 26. Swartz is being memorialized as the leader of the free culture movement, which believes in an open Internet where all information is accessible. We wanted to know more about the movement, so we contacted Declan McCullagh. He's the chief political correspondent at CNet. Welcome to the program, Declan. DECLAN MCCULLAGH: Hi there. It's a pleasure to be here. CORNISH: So who - and how and what gave birth to the free culture movement? MCCULLAGH: The free culture movement really stemmed out of a hacker culture from a generation or more ago. And I'm not talking hacker culture as in, we'll break into things; we'll disrupt things; we'll destroy things. This is the original meaning of the word hacker; and this is a desire to learn more about things; to almost liberate knowledge, maybe it lot stand in the way, maybe they don't, but the quest is not a malicious one. It's doing what they think is best for society. CORNISH: And Aaron Swartz may not have been a household name, but there are some other free culture adherents out there who are well-known for being very aggressive, such as WikiLeaks and the hacker group Anonymous, right? MCCULLAGH: That's right. And those are kind of the pointed end of the free culture movement, but there are folks who are much more mainstream. I mean, Larry Lessig, the author and the law professor, would be one of them; Richard Stallman, who gave birth to the term free software, who coined the term, free as in freedom, not free as in no cost. There's a little bit - might have that as well. And so there are - this is the culmination of decades of work by a lot of folks straddling the line between hackerdom and law and politics. CORNISH: And Aaron Swartz was a sort of leading advocate and voice for this. In 2008, Swartz wrote something he called the \"Guerilla Open Access Manifesto,\" and in it, he was addressing students, librarians and scientists in this way. He said: You get to feed at this banquet of knowledge while the rest of the world is locked out, but you need not. Indeed, morally, you cannot keep this privilege for yourselves. You have a duty to share it with the world. And he saw this cause as civil disobedience essentially, right? MCCULLAGH: I think that's right, and that's what he did when trying to do it, what in his terms would have been to liberate knowledge, liberate data, especially data that taxpayers have already paid for. He downloaded a large percentage of federal court decisions that are available for a fee through the PACER federal court website with the intent to make those available to the public at no cost instead of charging 10 cents a page, which is what the federal courts like to do, which is well above what they need to do to break even. And he was trying the same thing. This was what he was accused of doing when he was at Harvard and set up a computer allegedly in a wiring closet at MIT to download large portions of the JSTOR database where academics publish their articles. His idea is that these should be available to the public. CORNISH: And as you mentioned, because of his actions, Swartz was about to be the subject of a federal trial. He was facing up to 35 years in prison. This really put him at the center of this debate about information and free information. But who was winning that debate? I mean, was it the hacktivists? Was it the companies and the government? MCCULLAGH: The debate has been going on for I can think offhand at least 15 years, but it really depends. It's a battle of offense and defense. The high-water mark perhaps for the open culture movement was when they defeated the Stop Online Piracy Act last year. It was just a year ago, in fact, next week. You had corporations coming together with activists and academics saying this bill that Hollywood wanted that would force allegedly infringing copyright, infringing websites to disappear from the Internet. That went too far. And they won. Hollywood was put on the defensive. The law went away - the proposed law. And we have - it has not resurfaced since then. CORNISH: Already, there's an outpouring online about Aaron Swartz, including professors who are actually tweeting their scholarly articles as a sort of protest. They're tweeting free links, essentially, to their work. Could you see a day when the ideas of the free culture movement are essentially mainstream in the U. S. ? MCCULLAGH: It's a generational thing. If you talk to students, undergraduate students, they're much more willing to be part of this movement. They understand it. They've grown up with it in part. But it's going to take some time. I mean, it's really - when the folks in their teens and 20s get into positions of power in their 30s and 40s. CORNISH: Declan McCullagh, he's the chief political correspondent at CNet. Declan, thank you for speaking with us. MCCULLAGH: Thanks for having me on today. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  We're going to follow up now on a tech story that erupted over the weekend, after news of the death of Aaron Swartz. He was a computer prodigy and an activist, who committed suicide on Friday. He was only 26. Swartz is being memorialized as the leader of the free culture movement, which believes in an open Internet where all information is accessible. We wanted to know more about the movement, so we contacted Declan McCullagh. He's the chief political correspondent at CNet. Welcome to the program, Declan. DECLAN MCCULLAGH: Hi there. It's a pleasure to be here. CORNISH: So who - and how and what gave birth to the free culture movement? MCCULLAGH: The free culture movement really stemmed out of a hacker culture from a generation or more ago. And I'm not talking hacker culture as in, we'll break into things; we'll disrupt things; we'll destroy things. This is the original meaning of the word hacker; and this is a desire to learn more about things; to almost liberate knowledge, maybe it lot stand in the way, maybe they don't, but the quest is not a malicious one. It's doing what they think is best for society. CORNISH: And Aaron Swartz may not have been a household name, but there are some other free culture adherents out there who are well-known for being very aggressive, such as WikiLeaks and the hacker group Anonymous, right? MCCULLAGH: That's right. And those are kind of the pointed end of the free culture movement, but there are folks who are much more mainstream. I mean, Larry Lessig, the author and the law professor, would be one of them; Richard Stallman, who gave birth to the term free software, who coined the term, free as in freedom, not free as in no cost. There's a little bit - might have that as well. And so there are - this is the culmination of decades of work by a lot of folks straddling the line between hackerdom and law and politics. CORNISH: And Aaron Swartz was a sort of leading advocate and voice for this. In 2008, Swartz wrote something he called the \"Guerilla Open Access Manifesto,\" and in it, he was addressing students, librarians and scientists in this way. He said: You get to feed at this banquet of knowledge while the rest of the world is locked out, but you need not. Indeed, morally, you cannot keep this privilege for yourselves. You have a duty to share it with the world. And he saw this cause as civil disobedience essentially, right? MCCULLAGH: I think that's right, and that's what he did when trying to do it, what in his terms would have been to liberate knowledge, liberate data, especially data that taxpayers have already paid for. He downloaded a large percentage of federal court decisions that are available for a fee through the PACER federal court website with the intent to make those available to the public at no cost instead of charging 10 cents a page, which is what the federal courts like to do, which is well above what they need to do to break even. And he was trying the same thing. This was what he was accused of doing when he was at Harvard and set up a computer allegedly in a wiring closet at MIT to download large portions of the JSTOR database where academics publish their articles. His idea is that these should be available to the public. CORNISH: And as you mentioned, because of his actions, Swartz was about to be the subject of a federal trial. He was facing up to 35 years in prison. This really put him at the center of this debate about information and free information. But who was winning that debate? I mean, was it the hacktivists? Was it the companies and the government? MCCULLAGH: The debate has been going on for I can think offhand at least 15 years, but it really depends. It's a battle of offense and defense. The high-water mark perhaps for the open culture movement was when they defeated the Stop Online Piracy Act last year. It was just a year ago, in fact, next week. You had corporations coming together with activists and academics saying this bill that Hollywood wanted that would force allegedly infringing copyright, infringing websites to disappear from the Internet. That went too far. And they won. Hollywood was put on the defensive. The law went away - the proposed law. And we have - it has not resurfaced since then.

I'm Audie Cornish. And it's time now for All Tech Considered. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CORNISH: We're going to start things off today talking about a tech convergence between Silicon Valley and Detroit's auto industry. For many drivers, the apps available inside new cars are becoming just as important as what's under the hood. That trend can be seen at this year's North American International Auto Show. The show kicks off this week, and NPR's Sonari Glinton is in Detroit and joins us now. Hey there, Sonari. SONARI GLINTON, BYLINE: Hey, Audie. CORNISH: So tell me, what are the big tech advances that you're seeing in Detroit this year? GLINTON: Well, being a radio dude, one of the big ones is that Pandora, which is an Internet radio app, announced deals to go directly into cars, so we're going to see Internet radio in cars soon. That's a big deal. But moving beyond, you know, our radio world and into the tech here, I think the most important things are autonomy and electricity. Cadillac is introducing an electric plug-in car, and you really can't exaggerate how important fuel economy is. By 2025, we're going to have to get to 55 miles a gallon, and fuel standards are pushing every single part of the car from the wheels to the seats. Everyone is pushing to get this higher fuel economy. And then this really awesome thing is that Audi and Toyota especially are making inroads into bringing us driverless cars, you know, cars that drive themselves. CORNISH: And we hear so much about driverless cars, but how far away are we from actually seeing one on the showroom floor? GLINTON: We're pretty far. I mean, a lot of cars have features that have some autonomy, you know, park assist, then lane assist where, you know, that's all there. But Audi, which is a subsidiary of Volkswagen, just got the go-ahead to get driverless cars on the street. And Toyota announced that it's going to be doing research into autonomous vehicles. So when you have the two of the three biggest car companies in the world that are getting behind autonomy, that means that, you know, these companies don't do vanity projects so that means they're serious about them. But the real roadblocks ahead for autonomy is really you and me and the legal system. You know, if you get into an accident with a car that was driverless, well, who's to blame and, you know, who gets insured? And there's going to be a time, some time in the future where we're going to have regular drivers and autonomous vehicles, and that is going to be a really, really difficult time, and we haven't even touched on any of those issues. And all of the car companies and the governments and local governments are going to have to deal with that before we get driverless cars out there. But the technology is coming. It's, you know, we have to get behind that. CORNISH: That's NPR's Sonari Glinton at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. Sonari, thank you. GLINTON: It's great to be here.

How'd you sleep? How far did you get in that one book? Those questions were all, at one point, pretty general questions - no longer, though. I don't answer: good, I slept well and about halfway. I say I did 1. 9 miles in 27 minutes. I got four hours of deep REM-cycle sleep, and I'm 64 percent finished with that book. New apps and gadgets allow us to keep track of every minute detail of our daily movements and activities. It's a practice known as self-tracking to find out quantified selves. So, self-trackers out there, we want to hear from you. What have you learned by tracking your self? Give us a call. Our number is 800-989-8255. Our email address is talk@npr. org. And you can join the conversation at our website. Go to npr. org, and click on TALK OF THE NATION. Holly Finn joins us now. She's a columnist for the Wall Street Journal. In her weekly \"Marvels\" column, she writes about how science and technology are changing our lives. She joins us from member station KQED in San Francisco. Holly, thanks so much for being on the program. HOLLY FINN: Hi, Celeste. Nice to be here. HEADLEE: You use a self-tracker, right? FINN: I do. I just signed up. (LAUGHTER)HEADLEE: How did you sleep last night? FINN: I can tell you exactly. I slept eight hours and 21 minutes, six and a half of which were deep sleep, and only one and a half of which were light sleep. And I fell asleep in 26 minutes, and I woke up zero times. HEADLEE: So what. . . FINN: I'm quite proud. (LAUGHTER)HEADLEE: What does this tell you? How does this - how does that actually help you, having that knowledge? FINN: Yeah. To me, I think the thing is it's the nuanced knowledge that's interesting, knowing that I slept eight hours. I could have slept eight crappy hours, and I would feel crappy and not understand why. Today, I can understand precisely why. Most of that - if it was light sleep, then there's my reason, and therefore I can slightly adjust, one hopes, my behavior towards others based on the fact that I'm a little peaky today. HEADLEE: So what does this term, the quantified self? Is it just. . . FINN: Yeah. HEADLEE: . . . you know, completely, you know, anal attention to every single thing that we do, every breath we take? FINN: I think it can be as pedantic as you make it, really. The term quantified self was coined by a couple of journalists five years ago, a couple of Wired journalists. It's not a new notion, but they put a term to it. This has been around for literally hundreds and hundreds of years. In the 1600s, a man called Sanctorius of Padua, who was a researcher into metabolism, actually worked in what he called a weighing chair, which weighed everything that he ate, everything that came into his body and everything that left his body. . . HEADLEE: Oh, yeah. (unintelligible)FINN: . . . because he was attached to a calibrated scale, you know. So this isn't brand-new knowledge. Clearly, if he'd, you know, he'd gotten out of the chair, maybe he wouldn't have studied it so much. But it's not a brand-new science. It's just that technology has supercharged it. HEADLEE: Well, I mean, I have to say, I'm a self-tracker myself. I use two of them. I use a BodyMedia armband, and then I also have the Nike FuelBand. . . FINN: Yeah. HEADLEE: . . . partially because I'm training for some bike races. And it's helpful. . . FINN: Yes. . . . information to me. Yes. HEADLEE: What are the most popular - I mean, are most people going as detailed as I? Or are there - people just kind of sticking their toes in? FINN: I think there's such a spectrum, certainly, for folks like you, the kind of - the athletic tracking and the ability to magnify performance. That - I mean, that's hugely valuable, just giving you the knowledge in what areas, what sort of things you can tweak in order to do better. But the spectrum runs for - from everything from something recently introduced at CES last week in Vegas, the Happy Fork, which is a fork that actually tracks how much you eat and buzzes if it feels like you're eating too much. For me, something like that has crossed the line from helpful to slightly judgmental. I don't want to worry what my utensils think of me. But on the other end of the spectrum, our health giving apps and devices - things like, for instance, an asthma inhaler that is fitted with a GPS so that every time a person or, for instance, a child has an asthma attack, it logs where and when and possibly what air conditions, et cetera, are in place at the time. And over, you know, you can track that and see trends, and that's pretty interesting. HEADLEE: And the CES you're talking about is the Consumer Electronics Show that happens every January in Las Vegas. But, I mean, the thing that's amazing to me is that one of the reasons there's so much research going into this and so many products is it - it's making money. I mean, people are buying this. There's tons of people using their iPhones, their Androids to lose weight - to keep track of everything they do. FINN: Well, that's actually how - I actually started - I made a bet last summer with a friend that whoever - whichever of us lost 15 pounds first got a free dinner anywhere in the world. And I'm not a competitive person, like, athletically, but I like my dinner and I respect a bet. So I signed on to something called MyFitnessPal, a free app, on my iPhone, which logs your food and literally the first day I was on it, I ran out of allotted calories by 1:30 PM, which told me. . . HEADLEE: Oh, wow. Kind of an eye opener. FINN: Yes, told me something about my eating habits, and I've now - it told me yesterday I'd logged on for 160 days in a row, and I've lost 20 pounds. And it was incredibly helpful as, what I call a personal lie detection device. We're in this universe of social media and self-branding and a little bit of posturing, I think we can all agree. (LAUGHTER)FINN: And these devices actually help us not lie to ourselves, and I imagine that that might help us not lie to each other as well. HEADLEE: Well, we're going to talk more about that in a moment. But let me read a couple of emails from listeners. This is Linda in Portland, who says, I've learned I don't get nearly enough sleep during my workweek by using my favorite app, Sleep Cycle. I also use an app to map my exercise. And then Gayle in Buffalo, New York, writes, I've been using Fitbit for a year, have increased my steps from 5,000 to 13,000 a day and now climb 30 flights of stairs daily as a goal when I use to avoid wherever I could. I'm 69, I found that I can do a lot more than I thought possible to keep fit. And if you are a self-tracker of any kind out there, we want to hear from you. What have you learned? Our number is 800-989-8255, or you can email us like they did at talk@npr. org. This concept of honesty is really interesting to me. I just read the research that said dieting by Twitter is more effective than regular dieting. You can do everything else the same, but if you're tweeting about your weight loss, you'll lose more. FINN: Yeah. That makes sense to me. Again, I think it's probably universal and it's probably timeless. But given that we have these tools at our fingertips now, we carry our phones with us wherever we go, we're always logged in, why not use that for good as well as possibly less good? And I think the peer pressure can also be a positive as well as a negative. HEADLEE: And you're not lying about it. FINN: Yes, essentially. HEADLEE: And yet, Holly, and yet isn't it also part of sort of the vanity of the human condition? Aren't we completely self-absorbed enough already? FINN: I think that it's a really, really good question. If you go back and look at, as I did, Gary Wolf was one of the journalists who coined this term quantified self. He gave a TED talk about it a couple of years back. And it was fascinating that he listed his caffeine intake, his sleep, all the data, his heart rate - that he's self-tracking had provided. And then he felt he had to say, quote, \"and my score on the narcissism personality index is a reassuring . 31. \"(LAUGHTER)FINN: . . . as if to make sure we all understood that this wasn't about that. I think, again, it's probably a self-selecting device. If you tend towards narcissism, it will make you more narcissistic. If not, however, I think insight into self can lead to insight into others. I spoke to Yves Behar who's the designer of the Jawbone Up, which is what I wear and I'm fascinated by. And he made the point that actually if you are, like he is, a person who runs a company and you notice, given your sleep last night, you're a little tired and slower today and perhaps you haven't taken the right number of steps, you look around your office - same is true for everyone else - you might have meetings. You might get everyone out for lunch. HEADLEE: Oh, interesting. FINN: And so it could be slightly more broad than just benefiting you. HEADLEE: Well, let's take a couple of calls. So here's Annemarie(ph) in Weddington, North Carolina. And, Annemarie, you're actually a fitness trainer, so this is - seems to be very useful. ANNEMARIE: Absolutely. 100 percent. HEADLEE: How do you use it? ANNEMARIE: Yeah. Well, I use it mostly to track rides - and I do a lot of rides and runs with beginners as a triathlon training coach. So I try to really encourage them to use it as a motivational tool, you know, see how far you can go and also a lot of these new entries coming, how many calories I've burned anytime that I'm training for something like a marathon or triathlon. But I also tell them use it to also, in some ways, let your self off the hook. I know that it seems counterintuitive, but I work with a lot of cyclists and runners that are incredibly motivated and often push themselves to injury, or push themselves past what they need to. So I say use that heart rate monitor as a way to also let you back off. So if you're feeling bad, you're in mile 18, you know, and you see that your heart rate is a little high, back off. Don't push through that. There's no need for that. You know, you want to live to fight another day. I really use it, also, as a tool to allow people to back off from exercise when they need to. HEADLEE: OK. Thank you very much. That's Annemarie, calling from North Carolina. And we also have a call from Bryan(ph) in Cincinnati, Ohio. And, Bryan, you're a physician? BRYAN: Yeah, a psychiatrist actually (unintelligible) psychiatrist and. . . HEADLEE: And you use a pedometer. BRYAN: Yeah, it sounds kind of pedestrian with all these quantifiable devices. But I asked my - my New Year's resolution was - I'm not overweight, I'm thin and I'm very active, but I don't like to sit at work. And I'm trying to encourage my patients not to be sedentary. So I asked my kids, where's that pedometer that I used to have years ago? And they said, Dad, you don't need a pedometer. Just get an app on your iPhone. So I did that, and the last few weeks I've been standing at work and on a portable stair-stepper, which I've jerry-rigged in such a way that I can have a desk that's elevated and I can enter data as I interview patients. And I take my patients for a walks to try to show them that human beings are, by nature, on-the-go and it's more healthy to be moving around. Even with kids with ADHD, I, you know, encourage them to move and to be active so that - I think it's therapeutic. But then I set example in the office. HEADLEE: Well, that is Dr. Bryan in Cincinnati, Ohio with a little helpful advice for anybody. And we're speaking with Holly Finn who's a columnist for The Wall Street Journal. What's the danger here? I mean, besides becoming narcissistic, I guess, if you have a tendency - can you just become too focused on this? FINN: Sure. It's interesting, though, the callers, both of them were talking about slight changes. . . HEADLEE: Yeah. FINN: Which I think is one of the keys here. Everyone who talks about changing your life, talks about doing it in tiny steps - that, first of all, is what I think the quantified self is about, slight modifications. But I think if I could see a danger - and I'm a big fan of this and I tend to think on the positive in general - but I think if there is a danger, it's who owns this data, who'd you give your data to, who do you share it with? And as we've all learned, in the last few years, we need to be slightly more careful than perhaps we have been. We get so excited about all - the potential of stuff like this that we need to understand - for instance, insurance companies. I'm sure they'd be particularly interested in how many steps we take, the asthma, you know, inhaler, you know, I mentioned or, you know heart rate information, blood glucose levels. All of those things are so personal, I think - I can speak for myself, I certainly wouldn't share this with any - I don't share my data publicly, and I don't share. . . HEADLEE: I'm sure many people don't want to share that either.

HEADLEE: OK. The Jawbone Up. There's tons of them up there, Holly, thank you so much. FINN: Thank you. Pleasure to be here. HEADLEE: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. CELESTE HEADLEE, HOST:  So, how was your workout? How'd you sleep? How far did you get in that one book? Those questions were all, at one point, pretty general questions - no longer, though. I don't answer: good, I slept well and about halfway. I say I did 1. 9 miles in 27 minutes. I got four hours of deep REM-cycle sleep, and I'm 64 percent finished with that book. New apps and gadgets allow us to keep track of every minute detail of our daily movements and activities. It's a practice known as self-tracking to find out quantified selves. So, self-trackers out there, we want to hear from you. What have you learned by tracking your self? Give us a call. Our number is 800-989-8255. Our email address is talk@npr. org. And you can join the conversation at our website. Go to npr. org, and click on TALK OF THE NATION. Holly Finn joins us now. She's a columnist for the Wall Street Journal. In her weekly \"Marvels\" column, she writes about how science and technology are changing our lives. She joins us from member station KQED in San Francisco. Holly, thanks so much for being on the program. HOLLY FINN: Hi, Celeste. Nice to be here. HEADLEE: You use a self-tracker, right? FINN: I do. I just signed up. (LAUGHTER) HEADLEE: How did you sleep last night? FINN: I can tell you exactly. I slept eight hours and 21 minutes, six and a half of which were deep sleep, and only one and a half of which were light sleep. And I fell asleep in 26 minutes, and I woke up zero times. HEADLEE: So what. . . FINN: I'm quite proud. (LAUGHTER) HEADLEE: What does this tell you? How does this - how does that actually help you, having that knowledge? FINN: Yeah. To me, I think the thing is it's the nuanced knowledge that's interesting, knowing that I slept eight hours. I could have slept eight crappy hours, and I would feel crappy and not understand why. Today, I can understand precisely why. Most of that - if it was light sleep, then there's my reason, and therefore I can slightly adjust, one hopes, my behavior towards others based on the fact that I'm a little peaky today. HEADLEE: So what does this term, the quantified self? Is it just. . . FINN: Yeah. HEADLEE: . . . you know, completely, you know, anal attention to every single thing that we do, every breath we take? FINN: I think it can be as pedantic as you make it, really. The term quantified self was coined by a couple of journalists five years ago, a couple of Wired journalists. It's not a new notion, but they put a term to it. This has been around for literally hundreds and hundreds of years. In the 1600s, a man called Sanctorius of Padua, who was a researcher into metabolism, actually worked in what he called a weighing chair, which weighed everything that he ate, everything that came into his body and everything that left his body. . . HEADLEE: Oh, yeah. (unintelligible) FINN: . . . because he was attached to a calibrated scale, you know. So this isn't brand-new knowledge. Clearly, if he'd, you know, he'd gotten out of the chair, maybe he wouldn't have studied it so much. But it's not a brand-new science. It's just that technology has supercharged it. HEADLEE: Well, I mean, I have to say, I'm a self-tracker myself. I use two of them. I use a BodyMedia armband, and then I also have the Nike FuelBand. . . FINN: Yeah. HEADLEE: . . . partially because I'm training for some bike races. And it's helpful. . . FINN: Yes. . . . information to me. Yes. HEADLEE: What are the most popular - I mean, are most people going as detailed as I? Or are there - people just kind of sticking their toes in? FINN: I think there's such a spectrum, certainly, for folks like you, the kind of - the athletic tracking and the ability to magnify performance. That - I mean, that's hugely valuable, just giving you the knowledge in what areas, what sort of things you can tweak in order to do better. But the spectrum runs for - from everything from something recently introduced at CES last week in Vegas, the Happy Fork, which is a fork that actually tracks how much you eat and buzzes if it feels like you're eating too much. For me, something like that has crossed the line from helpful to slightly judgmental. I don't want to worry what my utensils think of me. But on the other end of the spectrum, our health giving apps and devices - things like, for instance, an asthma inhaler that is fitted with a GPS so that every time a person or, for instance, a child has an asthma attack, it logs where and when and possibly what air conditions, et cetera, are in place at the time. And over, you know, you can track that and see trends, and that's pretty interesting. HEADLEE: And the CES you're talking about is the Consumer Electronics Show that happens every January in Las Vegas. But, I mean, the thing that's amazing to me is that one of the reasons there's so much research going into this and so many products is it - it's making money. I mean, people are buying this. There's tons of people using their iPhones, their Androids to lose weight - to keep track of everything they do. FINN: Well, that's actually how - I actually started - I made a bet last summer with a friend that whoever - whichever of us lost 15 pounds first got a free dinner anywhere in the world. And I'm not a competitive person, like, athletically, but I like my dinner and I respect a bet. So I signed on to something called MyFitnessPal, a free app, on my iPhone, which logs your food and literally the first day I was on it, I ran out of allotted calories by 1:30 PM, which told me. . . HEADLEE: Oh, wow. Kind of an eye opener. FINN: Yes, told me something about my eating habits, and I've now - it told me yesterday I'd logged on for 160 days in a row, and I've lost 20 pounds. And it was incredibly helpful as, what I call a personal lie detection device. We're in this universe of social media and self-branding and a little bit of posturing, I think we can all agree. (LAUGHTER) FINN: And these devices actually help us not lie to ourselves, and I imagine that that might help us not lie to each other as well. HEADLEE: Well, we're going to talk more about that in a moment. But let me read a couple of emails from listeners. This is Linda in Portland, who says, I've learned I don't get nearly enough sleep during my workweek by using my favorite app, Sleep Cycle. I also use an app to map my exercise. And then Gayle in Buffalo, New York, writes, I've been using Fitbit for a year, have increased my steps from 5,000 to 13,000 a day and now climb 30 flights of stairs daily as a goal when I use to avoid wherever I could. I'm 69, I found that I can do a lot more than I thought possible to keep fit. And if you are a self-tracker of any kind out there, we want to hear from you. What have you learned? Our number is 800-989-8255, or you can email us like they did at talk@npr. org. This concept of honesty is really interesting to me. I just read the research that said dieting by Twitter is more effective than regular dieting. You can do everything else the same, but if you're tweeting about your weight loss, you'll lose more. FINN: Yeah. That makes sense to me. Again, I think it's probably universal and it's probably timeless. But given that we have these tools at our fingertips now, we carry our phones with us wherever we go, we're always logged in, why not use that for good as well as possibly less good? And I think the peer pressure can also be a positive as well as a negative. HEADLEE: And you're not lying about it. FINN: Yes, essentially. HEADLEE: And yet, Holly, and yet isn't it also part of sort of the vanity of the human condition? Aren't we completely self-absorbed enough already? FINN: I think that it's a really, really good question. If you go back and look at, as I did, Gary Wolf was one of the journalists who coined this term quantified self. He gave a TED talk about it a couple of years back. And it was fascinating that he listed his caffeine intake, his sleep, all the data, his heart rate - that he's self-tracking had provided. And then he felt he had to say, quote, \"and my score on the narcissism personality index is a reassuring . 31. \" (LAUGHTER) FINN: . . . as if to make sure we all understood that this wasn't about that. I think, again, it's probably a self-selecting device. If you tend towards narcissism, it will make you more narcissistic. If not, however, I think insight into self can lead to insight into others. I spoke to Yves Behar who's the designer of the Jawbone Up, which is what I wear and I'm fascinated by. And he made the point that actually if you are, like he is, a person who runs a company and you notice, given your sleep last night, you're a little tired and slower today and perhaps you haven't taken the right number of steps, you look around your office - same is true for everyone else - you might have meetings. You might get everyone out for lunch. HEADLEE: Oh, interesting. FINN: And so it could be slightly more broad than just benefiting you. HEADLEE: Well, let's take a couple of calls. So here's Annemarie(ph) in Weddington, North Carolina. And, Annemarie, you're actually a fitness trainer, so this is - seems to be very useful. ANNEMARIE: Absolutely. 100 percent. HEADLEE: How do you use it? ANNEMARIE: Yeah. Well, I use it mostly to track rides - and I do a lot of rides and runs with beginners as a triathlon training coach. So I try to really encourage them to use it as a motivational tool, you know, see how far you can go and also a lot of these new entries coming, how many calories I've burned anytime that I'm training for something like a marathon or triathlon. But I also tell them use it to also, in some ways, let your self off the hook. I know that it seems counterintuitive, but I work with a lot of cyclists and runners that are incredibly motivated and often push themselves to injury, or push themselves past what they need to. So I say use that heart rate monitor as a way to also let you back off. So if you're feeling bad, you're in mile 18, you know, and you see that your heart rate is a little high, back off. Don't push through that. There's no need for that. You know, you want to live to fight another day. I really use it, also, as a tool to allow people to back off from exercise when they need to. HEADLEE: OK. Thank you very much. That's Annemarie, calling from North Carolina. And we also have a call from Bryan(ph) in Cincinnati, Ohio. And, Bryan, you're a physician? BRYAN: Yeah, a psychiatrist actually (unintelligible) psychiatrist and. . . HEADLEE: And you use a pedometer. BRYAN: Yeah, it sounds kind of pedestrian with all these quantifiable devices. But I asked my - my New Year's resolution was - I'm not overweight, I'm thin and I'm very active, but I don't like to sit at work. And I'm trying to encourage my patients not to be sedentary. So I asked my kids, where's that pedometer that I used to have years ago? And they said, Dad, you don't need a pedometer. Just get an app on your iPhone. So I did that, and the last few weeks I've been standing at work and on a portable stair-stepper, which I've jerry-rigged in such a way that I can have a desk that's elevated and I can enter data as I interview patients. And I take my patients for a walks to try to show them that human beings are, by nature, on-the-go and it's more healthy to be moving around. Even with kids with ADHD, I, you know, encourage them to move and to be active so that - I think it's therapeutic. But then I set example in the office. HEADLEE: Well, that is Dr. Bryan in Cincinnati, Ohio with a little helpful advice for anybody. And we're speaking with Holly Finn who's a columnist for The Wall Street Journal. What's the danger here? I mean, besides becoming narcissistic, I guess, if you have a tendency - can you just become too focused on this? FINN: Sure. It's interesting, though, the callers, both of them were talking about slight changes. . . HEADLEE: Yeah. FINN: Which I think is one of the keys here.

I'm Flora Lichtman, filling in for Ira Flatow today. Solar, wind, geothermal - now there's a new renewable energy source to add to that list. It's free, completely reliable and totally unlimited: the force of gravity. Two British designers have invented a lamp that runs on gravity alone. Their GravityLight - yes, that's its name, aptly named - uses, you guessed it, the pull of gravity on a weight to generate up to 30 minutes of light. To turn the lamp on, you lift a weighted bag up, and voila, as the bag slowly descends, LED illumination. So how does this work?  How hard is it to make?  My next guest is here to tell us. Martin Riddiford is one of the inventors of the GravityLight and founder of the design company Therefore. He joins me by phone from London, England. Welcome to the program. MARTIN RIDDIFORD: Hi, Flora. LICHTMAN: Hi. Tell us what this GravityLight looks like, and then take us under the hood and tell us how it works. RIDDIFORD: OK. So GravityLight is a project which we started because we were working with a charity trying to find an alternative to kerosene lamps for the developing world. And we were working with solar power at the time, and we were doing a lamp which used LED bulbs and a battery. And we - you had to charge it through solar panels. And we found out that the cost of the unit was too expensive for people in Africa to buy, because they have very, very limited finances. And there's no micro-financing in Africa. So the lowest possible BOM cost, or purchase cost, was absolutely essential in the project. So we came out of a meeting when we presented our - the latest work we'd done with the battery-powered device, and thought, we've got to find a cheaper way of doing this. LICHTMAN: Now, how did you come up with the idea of - how did gravity come to mind? RIDDIFORD: Well, we realized that there were two components, the LED and the battery, and, obviously, the means of charging it. And - but there are various means of charging devices like this, with hand cranks and things like that. But they generally always involve a battery, and we were trying to think of a way of getting rid of the battery. And this is where the gravity side came in. So we envisaged this scenario where you lift the weights, as you say, the heaviest weight you can lift, about 10 kilograms or 20 pounds, as high as you can lift it, about six foot. And then you let it go, and this device releases the bag very slowly and powers a generator to create a very small amount of electricity, but enough electricity to give you sufficient light - well, more light than a kerosene lamp would give you. LICHTMAN: So no battery required. It's just a teeny, tiny generator. RIDDIFORD: Exactly. And that's one of the interesting things, because not only is it - can it create light, obviously, but because it's a generator, we can potentially charge batteries and things like that. But in a very - very, very slowly, which is important to realize. This isn't a way of generating large amounts of electricity, but because the developments of LEDs and electronics make power consumption less and less over time, then this kind of project becomes more and more worthwhile, because we can do more and more with the small amount of power that we create. LICHTMAN: And how much power are you creating? RIDDIFORD: Well, we call the project Deciwatt, which basically tells you how much power it's creating. So depending. . . LICHTMAN: So a tenth of a watt then, is that right?  Just for people. . . RIDDIFORD: A tenth of a watt, yes. So depending on how fast you let the weight travel down depends on how much light - how much - sorry, how much energy you get out of it. So the prototypes that we built generate between 30 milliwatts and half a watt. And we've got a variable drive on the end, which allows us to change from the very low power condition, where we're just able to light an LED and use it as a nightlight kind of thing. And then we can, as I say, generate half a watt for more of the sort of battery charging things that we're experimenting with. LICHTMAN: Well, I guess our bright light - it's like a built-in dimmer. RIDDIFORD: Sort of thing, yeah. They - one of the things that we discovered fairly early on was that the whole rig is a bit counterintuitive. So if you were imagining that you were going to increase the heat on a fire, you would chuck another log on, and you'd expect the log to last longer and also to give you more heat. The trouble with the GravityLight is that you - if you put more weight on it, it descends faster, so it lasts less time. But it doesn't necessarily light the LED much lighter because it's all about the efficiency curve of the LED. LICHTMAN: Ah. So it's hard to scale up. You're not going to run a toaster off of this if you have a really heavy light, necessarily. RIDDIFORD: No. It's really suited at this kind of deciwatt range. I mean, lots of people have said, oh, yeah, you know, I want to hang it from my, you know, third story. But the other part of what we're trying to do here, which is what makes it interesting, is that other systems - like a hand-cranked torch, or whatever - requires the user to invest quite a lot of time in doing the rewinding. So the joy of this system is that one very swift operation, three seconds or so, gives you 30 minutes of light. So there's a big payback for a very short period. LICHTMAN: How much does it cost to make? RIDDIFORD: Well, currently, the costings for the first prototype at about 5,000 units is about $6. 50.  But we've got various - a couple of bearings in there that we hope to not need in the future. And we, you know, we're obviously not using much buying power in terms of buying the LED and the motor. So what we're trying to do is to trial a thousand of these units in Africa and get all the feedback we can from how people use them, how high they hang them, how much light they need. Do they have it turned to the dimmest or the brightest?  What else do they want to do with it? We put a couple of terminals on the outside as a sort of open-source hacking kind of facility, so that you can attach other things to it.  So you can attach, for instance, a radio to it and run a radio perfectly satisfactorily from it.  You can attach a task light from it and use it for, sort of, desk reading.  And as I say, you can charge batteries from it.  So part of the trial that we're planning on doing in the next six months, we're going to build some of these accessories and give them to people and find out how they use them and how they get on. LICHTMAN: You know, I know this isn't meant as a way to replace kerosene lamps, but I can imagine a market here where electricity is available, too.  Have you ever thought of doing something like the TOMS model, the TOMS Shoes, where you buy one and they donate a pair, as well? RIDDIFORD: Well, interestingly, we've been developing this for a number of years as a sort of skunkworks project after we did this project with our charity. And we got to a point where we've got these prototypes working, and we want to tool up and make enough units to go and distribute around the world to get the feedback that we need. And we decided to use a crowdfunding campaign to do that, and we had terrific success there. Over a period of a month or so, we've raised hundreds of thousands of dollars, which enables us to pay for the tooling, but also to do research and other things with it. But the other side of crowdfunding, which is wonderful, is that we've connected with a whole bunch of people around the world - firstly, a whole bunch of really generous Americans. American people probably account for 50 percent of the funders for our enterprise. And then we've connected with a whole bunch of people in developing countries who are wanting to distribute or help us do this research, or they're charities, or whatever. So we've got a really good spread of contacts through this, and a number of the American people who've funded us have said, well, you know, we live in Canada or northern America and we've got - you know, we do a lot of outdoor stuff. We'd love one of these, you know, for camping or in our hut or whatever in the wilderness. So we're going to send a whole bunch of units out to people and see what happens. Sorry, the crowdfunding thing that I was talking about, we did a buy one for yourself, and then gift one to - for this trial. So - and that's the way that we would probably sell it in the West, is to do exactly that kind of thing, which I think people buy into very well. LICHTMAN: Is your design company working on any other gravity-power applications? RIDDIFORD: Well, we're currently - because now we've got the funding to do it, we're exploring lots of other opportunities. And we've got this internal development group who are currently looking at where those opportunities might take us. And we have sort of an ambition that we could potentially have a battery-less system for getting on the Internet, but it's obviously a long shot. And we need to do the research to find out whether we can do that within the power budget that we have. But the notion is that we could - one of our clients is Inmarsat, who do stationary satellites. And we want to try and engage with them to see whether we can do a receiver for broadcast satellite information which runs at this kind of very low level. And if we can, then it would be great to imagine that we could, say, download a Wikipedia page with a device without batteries. So that's a long-term goal, which may or may not be achievable, but it's - you know, we're setting our sights high. (LAUGHTER)LICHTMAN: Absolutely. It's exciting to think about. Well, good luck to you. RIDDIFORD: OK. Well, thank you very much. LICHTMAN: Thank you for coming on. Martin Riddiford is the founder of the design company Therefore and one of the inventors of the GravityLight. Stay with us, because our next segment is something that I think is on the minds of many people this season. It's the flu virus. We're talking about its preferred habitat, how it travels, and how to stay - how to outsmart it. Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LICHTMAN: This is SCIENCE FRIDAY, from NPR.

So the joy of this system is that one very swift operation, three seconds or so, gives you 30 minutes of light. So there's a big payback for a very short period. LICHTMAN: How much does it cost to make? RIDDIFORD: Well, currently, the costings for the first prototype at about 5,000 units is about $6. 50.  But we've got various - a couple of bearings in there that we hope to not need in the future. And we, you know, we're obviously not using much buying power in terms of buying the LED and the motor. So what we're trying to do is to trial a thousand of these units in Africa and get all the feedback we can from how people use them, how high they hang them, how much light they need. Do they have it turned to the dimmest or the brightest?  What else do they want to do with it? We put a couple of terminals on the outside as a sort of open-source hacking kind of facility, so that you can attach other things to it.  So you can attach, for instance, a radio to it and run a radio perfectly satisfactorily from it.  You can attach a task light from it and use it for, sort of, desk reading.  And as I say, you can charge batteries from it.  So part of the trial that we're planning on doing in the next six months, we're going to build some of these accessories and give them to people and find out how they use them and how they get on. LICHTMAN: You know, I know this isn't meant as a way to replace kerosene lamps, but I can imagine a market here where electricity is available, too.  Have you ever thought of doing something like the TOMS model, the TOMS Shoes, where you buy one and they donate a pair, as well? RIDDIFORD: Well, interestingly, we've been developing this for a number of years as a sort of skunkworks project after we did this project with our charity. And we got to a point where we've got these prototypes working, and we want to tool up and make enough units to go and distribute around the world to get the feedback that we need. And we decided to use a crowdfunding campaign to do that, and we had terrific success there. Over a period of a month or so, we've raised hundreds of thousands of dollars, which enables us to pay for the tooling, but also to do research and other things with it. But the other side of crowdfunding, which is wonderful, is that we've connected with a whole bunch of people around the world - firstly, a whole bunch of really generous Americans. American people probably account for 50 percent of the funders for our enterprise. And then we've connected with a whole bunch of people in developing countries who are wanting to distribute or help us do this research, or they're charities, or whatever. So we've got a really good spread of contacts through this, and a number of the American people who've funded us have said, well, you know, we live in Canada or northern America and we've got - you know, we do a lot of outdoor stuff. We'd love one of these, you know, for camping or in our hut or whatever in the wilderness. So we're going to send a whole bunch of units out to people and see what happens. Sorry, the crowdfunding thing that I was talking about, we did a buy one for yourself, and then gift one to - for this trial. So - and that's the way that we would probably sell it in the West, is to do exactly that kind of thing, which I think people buy into very well. LICHTMAN: Is your design company working on any other gravity-power applications? RIDDIFORD: Well, we're currently - because now we've got the funding to do it, we're exploring lots of other opportunities. And we've got this internal development group who are currently looking at where those opportunities might take us. And we have sort of an ambition that we could potentially have a battery-less system for getting on the Internet, but it's obviously a long shot. And we need to do the research to find out whether we can do that within the power budget that we have. But the notion is that we could - one of our clients is Inmarsat, who do stationary satellites. And we want to try and engage with them to see whether we can do a receiver for broadcast satellite information which runs at this kind of very low level. And if we can, then it would be great to imagine that we could, say, download a Wikipedia page with a device without batteries. So that's a long-term goal, which may or may not be achievable, but it's - you know, we're setting our sights high. (LAUGHTER) LICHTMAN: Absolutely. It's exciting to think about. Well, good luck to you. RIDDIFORD: OK. Well, thank you very much. LICHTMAN: Thank you for coming on. Martin Riddiford is the founder of the design company Therefore and one of the inventors of the GravityLight. Stay with us, because our next segment is something that I think is on the minds of many people this season. It's the flu virus. We're talking about its preferred habitat, how it travels, and how to stay - how to outsmart it. Stay with us.

He's a director of consumer privacy for the nonprofit Center of Democracy and Technology. He likes the app's features but not its terms of service. That link - the one most users probably ignore - takes you to a document on the committee's website, and it's the website that opens up a loophole for Brookman.

SALINAS: The Presidential Inaugural Committee would not comment publicly, but it did defend its app in a statement, saying it had no way to collect emails, names or other personal information. It also defended the terms of service on its website, saying it's appropriate for a president's inaugural committee to support and reflect their party's ideals and causes.

SIEGEL: But Mega's 50 gigabytes of free storage is more space than services such as Dropbox currently offer.

And a small contingent of Western bloggers is scrutinizing the satellite images, trying to map the camps and look for new detail. Curtis Melvin is among them. He started the website North Korean Economy Watch. Thanks for coming in. CURTIS MELVIN: Hi, how are you doing? BLOCK: You have a recent discovery based on new Google Earth images, a possible new camp. What did you see that struck you? MELVIN: So in January, Google uploaded lots of new satellite imagery from all over North Korea. And I have the ambition to go through all of it and check for what's new, things that have changed, look for developments within the country. And a colleague of mine contacted me and asked me a question about Camp 18 because there is actually a debate as to whether Camp 18 has been closed. BLOCK: These numbered camps, who numbers the camps? Where do these numbers come from? MELVIN: Those would be set by the Ministry for State Security in North Korea, essentially the KGB of North Korea. And as I began to look around Camp 18 and Camp 14, which are right next to each other, I noticed a new security perimeter had gone up approximately 20 kilometers in circumference next to the existing Camp 14. BLOCK: How could you tell? What did the perimeter look like? MELVIN: Well, in the past, in 2006, when we had the last available satellite image of the location, there is no security perimeter at all. There's a village there, there's a coalmine that had fallen into disuse. And with the new satellite imagery, we can see where they've actually carved out a clearing, making a very visible straight lines with positions for guard posts stationed at regular intervals. BLOCK: Can you see a detail as granular as, say, there are guard houses along this perimeter? What does it look like? How can you tell? MELVIN: Yes. Little squares. The big tell is, one, they're right up next to the border. Two, they're identical all the way around, for the most part. BLOCK: When you and other people who are studying these images try to corroborate them, what do you do to try to flesh out what you're seeing in these images? MELVIN: Initially, the hard work was done by the Committee For Human Rights in North Korea in 2003 because when they published the initial reports with the satellite imagery, then we had a base to work from. And so - in North Korea, they tend to do everything the same way. And once you know what a particular kind of place looks like in North Korea, it's very easy to spot that same kind of thing. BLOCK: What tells you this is a camp? MELVIN: Oh, it's a security perimeter guarding nothing in particular except what appears to be a regular village. Most of the factories, military factories in North Korea have walls on them. A lot of them even have guard turrets on them. But there's something going on inside that's very obvious that they're protecting. And in the case of these labor camps, there's nothing inside. You see regular houses, maybe some fish ponds or something like that there. But there's nothing that tells you there's anything special or horrible about it. But ultimately for me to be convinced, we have to have eyewitness accounts. BLOCK: And by eyewitness accounts, you're talking about defectors, people who had been in North Korea, in many - some of them in these camps who have managed to get out. MELVIN: Or have had relatives who have been put in there or had experience dealing with some of the guards or might have been guards. BLOCK: How would those accounts back up what you see in these images, exactly? MELVIN: Well, if they can describe the place- which has been done many times in the past - they can usually describe the area without looking at a satellite image and then there's an amazing overlap between what they describe and draw, physically draw, with the satellite imagery. And that's been done a number of times. I actually identified a regular prison that someone had testified about this place and drawn a picture of it. And I was actually able to look at the satellite imagery on Google Earth and match the hand drawing with the satellite pictures. BLOCK: Lined up? MELVIN: Yeah. BLOCK: You devote a lot of time to poring over these images and trying to figure out just what's going in North Korea. Why do you do it? What keeps you going? MELVIN: At this point, North Korea is a very exciting country because it's undergone a radical amount of change in the last 10 years. And satellite imagery is one of the few ways that we can get eyes on the ground in North Korea because there's simply no other way to visualize or brings these things to bare in the West.

The 787, as a class of airplanes, is now grounded worldwide. And at a briefing yesterday, the head of the National Transportation Safety Board warned it could be a long time before the plane is cleared to fly. NPR's Wendy Kaufman reports. WENDY KAUFMAN, BYLINE: Thus far, investigators from the NTSB have looked at the charred remains of the battery and the electrical system with CT scans. They've taken component pieces apart and used sophisticated technology to examine and test them. They've pored over documents, but they still don't know all that much about the sequence of events that produced a battery fire so intense that it took firefighters more than an hour and a half to extinguish it. Still, the chairman of the safety board, Deborah Hersman left no doubt that her agency intended to find the root cause. DEBORAH HERSMAN: We do not expect to see fire events onboard aircrafts. This is a very serious air safety concern and we are all responding to try to address what happened, why it happened and to make sure that the aircraft that fly are safe. KAUFMAN: The battery involved was a 63-pound lithium ion battery. Lithium ion batteries are known to catch fire and the FAA imposed special conditions on Boeing's use of the battery. Extra safety measures were required. Nevertheless, there was what investigators describe as a thermal runaway inside the battery. That's an uncontrolled chemical reaction between the electrolytes and the electrodes. Also inside the battery, investigators found evidence of high current damage from a short circuit. Aviation safety expert Hans Weber offers some possible explanations. HANS WEBER: It could have been started within the battery due to, for example, a manufacturing defect. It could have been the circuitry that protects the battery against overcharging or excessive discharging and things of that nature. It could have been something else in the electronics control circuitry. KAUFMAN: The NTSB will be probing other areas, too. One big one: how did the Federal Aviation Administration go about approving or certifying this new and highly innovative airplane? Here's what the Safety Board's Hersman wants to know. HERSMAN: Were those safety certification standards adhered to and then the question of were they appropriate. We will be working very closely with a number of groups, including the FAA and Boeing as we collect that information and evaluate the analysis and the risk assessments that were done. KAUFMAN: The NTSB says it will also be exploring safety concerns raised by more than one whistleblower. In addition, investigators are working with a team in Japan probing the cause of a severe battery failure on another 787. With no clear answers or even great clues, the Safety Board's investigation into the Boston fire will likely take some time. And once the cause is known, Boeing will have to come up with a fix and the FAA will have to test and approve it. Aviation analyst Scott Hamilton warns that Boeing's 787s could remain grounded indefinitely. SCOTT HAMILTON: Indefinite is indefinite. Whether that's two months, three months, six months, we don't know, but it's not going to be back in the air any time soon. KAUFMAN: Last night, Boeing said it's continuing to work tirelessly on the problem and is assisting investigations in the U. S. and in Japan. The airplane-maker added that it deeply regrets the impact this is having on its airline customers and their passengers. What Boeing didn't say was that it deeply regrets what all this has done to its reputation and that of its flagship airplane. Wendy Kaufman, NPR News, Seattle.

Today, we begin a three-part series looking at how young people are interacting online. And let's just admit it. Often, when the subject comes up, it's in a negative way, focusing on online bullying or hacking or even the new phrase many of us just learned, catfishing, where someone lures someone into an online relationship under false pretenses. But there's more to it than that. So we've decided to take a step back and, over the next three days, we are going to be focusing on social media and kids. It's a short series we are calling Social Me. We are going to look at the kinds of apps young people are buying and using, how they're developing online identities and how they're using social media for their own education. We are going to start today with a look at online identities. Our guide for this series is Rey Junco. He is a faculty associate at the Harvard Berkman Center for Internet and Society. Rey, welcome back. Thanks so much for joining us once again. REY JUNCO: Thanks, Michel. It's great to be here. MARTIN: And, as I mentioned, we often hear about the negatives of online anonymity, but I understand that your research actually points to some positives, so why don't we start there? JUNCO: Sure. When you hear about it in the media, you often hear about the online disinhibition effect, although most people don't call it that, which basically means that people perceive this level of anonymity because they're behind a computer screen, and it's often associated with cyber-bullying. However, my research has shown that online disinhibition can be a positive factor for online interactions. So, for example, it allows introverted students to make interpersonal connections that they might not have made because of, you know, their shyness or the ways they interact in the offline world, and those online interactions translate to offline interactions. MARTIN: Could you give an example of that? Because I think a lot of people have had the experience of maybe having some difficulty communicating with a teenager in their house and then when the student goes off to college, for example, and they find themselves emailing each other, things get easier, you know, somehow because you don't have all that face-to-face tension. Right? So can you think of an example, just from your own experience teaching, where the kind of online interaction just made things easier for a student? JUNCO: One example was when I first started teaching and way, way back in the day when people used AOL Instant Messenger a lot, I would put my AOL IM screen name on my syllabi, and I would let students know, if they had any questions about the class, that they could feel free and pop in to AOL IM and ask me questions. And there was this one student who was very shy, very reserved, very introverted in class and then he would message me from time to time and just, you know, like a little message here or there, like basic questions about the course, not really anything about, you know, any kind of interpersonal interaction or anything like that. And what I saw is that, over time, this same student then was able to bring questions into the class. And that was one of the early instances of me seeing that. And then, over time, not only did I see more examples of individual students, but I've conducted research where we've seen this at the group level. So students who we interact with online, for instance, on Twitter, are much more engaged in a classroom and they're building more of a community in the classroom than students who aren't engaging that way through social media. And it's very clear and we have data to show that those online interactions lead to more positive classroom interactions. MARTIN: Why is it, though, that so much of what we hear about the disinhibition, as you put it, of the online identity is so negative and hurtful? I mean, we hear about - you know, forgive me, parents, I'll just say it - slut-shaming. We hear about, you know, people using their online identities to pick on kids, around all kinds of things, especially bullying, posting, you know, just really hurtful things about each other online. Why is that so much what we hear about and why do they do it at all? Why do they do that at all? JUNCO: I think the first part is we hear a lot more about that because - well, it's newsworthy. It's what people want to hear. It gets hits to websites. It gets viewership to news programs. It sells magazines, if people are still buying magazines. MARTIN: OK. But, to be fair, Rey, the fact is kids have taken their own lives because of what they've experienced in this realm, so they're - you know. . . JUNCO: Sure. MARTIN: There have been really harmful consequences to kids - what they've experienced online, so I don't think - that's not made up, but. . . JUNCO: Absolutely. I'm not trying to minimize that one bit. The other part of my answer is that kids can be mean. The teenage years are a very difficult time, developmentally. Teens are struggling with acceptance of themselves and often shaming and bullying others as a way to compare themselves to another and feel, quote, unquote, \"better than. \" It can often sometimes be a way to fit in with their peers, as well, if that's a socially acceptable behavior in their peer group. Teens don't have as strongly developed superegos as most adults - at least, we hope most adults - and they also reflect what they see in society. MARTIN: I think a lot of parents, a lot of caregivers, a lot of teachers are really concerned that the things that kids are posting online will haunt them later on in their adult lives. I mean, do you think that that's true? JUNCO: Absolutely. That's exactly where we are right now in our society because people who are making evaluations of youth for jobs and for admissions to colleges and for admissions to grad school didn't grow up in such a digitally-enabled social milieu. So I think it's very important for us to talk with our children about what they're posting online and for them to be aware of that. But I think it's also very important that, as a society, we think about how we want to treat those instances of things that youth may post because they don't know any better, or because it's a mistake. I mean, think about all the mistakes you made and that you chalk up to developmental mistakes. Right? And you think back and you're like, wow, that was really embarrassing. And, hopefully, you learned something from that. But imagine if that same mistake was out there for anybody to see if they Googled your name. And so, if you have a name like Bob Smith, you're probably OK. But, if you have a name like Rey Junco, then that's going to pop up and that's going to stay with you forever. MARTIN: Rey Junco is a faculty associate at the Harvard Berkman Center for Internet and Society. He joined us from WPSU at Penn State University. Rey Junco, thank you so much for joining us. JUNCO: You're welcome, Michel. Any time. MARTIN: Please join us tomorrow, when Rey will be talking about a way to use the Internet to enhance your children's education.

In a first, Google has posted its policies for when it gives up your information to the government. As NPR's Martin Kaste reports, that's part of a broader company strategy to push for tougher privacy laws. MARTIN KASTE, BYLINE: Tech companies don't usually like to dwell on the subject of the authorities looking at your stuff, but that's exactly what Google Senior VP and Chief Legal Officer David Drummond is doing in a special Frequently Asked Questions page posted today. DAVID DRUMMOND: The new thing is that we're actually sort of saying in a granular way, you know, product by product, how it is that we handle the requests. KASTE: The company has posted the information for the four Google products that attract the most requests from police. For Google Voice, for instance, you can look up what the police would need to listen in to your voice mails. It says they need a search warrant, which means they'd first have to show a judge probable cause of a crime. Police face less of a challenge, though, to find out who owns a particular Gmail address. All that takes is a subpoena. No probable cause required, and often, no judge. CHRIS HOOFNAGLE: Most companies are very secretive about civil and law enforcement requests for user data. KASTE: Chris Hoofnagle specializes in privacy issues at Berkeley Law. He says companies usually prefer to preserve some wiggle room in how they respond to law enforcement. HOOFNAGLE: Google is going out on a limb here because by making these statements they might be creating customer expectations that certain process will be followed when their data is revealed to law enforcement. KASTE: Or maybe Google is looking for a little cover. For the past few years, the company has maintained that, broadly speaking, online content should always require a warrant. But that's not clear in federal law. Posting these policies may make it easier for the company to resist pressure from a government agency that might be looking for quiet cooperation, and it also buttresses Google's longstanding lobbying campaign to put explicit warrant protection into federal law. Most of the industry thinks tougher privacy law would be good for business, especially in cloud-based services. And Senior VP Drummond says, yes, Google is trying to build some public support here. DRUMMOND: As life moves more and more online and life becomes, you know, more digital, we want to make sure that users don't lose protections that they had in the analog world. KASTE: Google has also started breaking down the government requests it gets according to type. For instance, we now know that 22 percent of the requests are warrants, which would indicate that about one-fifth of the time, agencies are asking for content; they want to read someone's words or listen to someone's voice. But other details are still tantalizingly absent here, such as the types of crimes being investigated. Drummond says Google still can't tell us whether fraud cases generate more requests than, say, national security. DRUMMOND: When we were coming up with this that was something I had sort of been hoping we'd be able to do. The problem is, in the vast majority of cases, we don't know. Right? And the government is not required to sort of tell us what they're investigating. KASTE: But while that mystery remains, Google's statistics indicate that it is pushing back a little more. Two years ago, it said no to the requests just 6 percent of the time, now that number is up to 12 percent. Martin Kaste, NPR News.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: The government has installed more than 20 million cameras across a country where a decade ago there were only a few. Officials say these cameras help to combat crime and maintain, as they put it, social stability. MONTAGNE: That's one way of saying shutting up critics, using cameras and other technology to monitor and intimidate dissidents. And looking ahead, human rights activists worry that even more surveillance will erode the freedom of ordinary people. NPR's Frank Langfitt has the first of two stories from Shanghai in today's Business Bottom Line. FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: If you want to visit Li Tiantian, the human rights lawyer in Shanghai, go at night and use a grove of trees behind her apartment building as cover. After a bowl of steamed dumplings, Li will tell you to turn off your cell and put it in another room. LI TIANTIAN: (Through translator) People with technological know-how all said that cops can use cell phones to monitor people, track your location, even use cell phones as a listening device. So people have reached a consensus that when we chat together, we put cell phones away. LANGFITT: Sound paranoid? It isn't. Chinese state security agents have privately confirmed they can turn cell phones into listening devices. Li says they also eavesdrop on her conversations to track her movements and arrest her. TIANTIAN: (Through translator) One morning, when I was going to a court hearing, I called a gypsy cab. Police found out through the telephone that the car was coming into my compound. Then they waited there to catch me. LANGFITT: But what really made Li angry was when agents invaded her private life. In 2011 they showed her boyfriend photos of other men she'd been involved with. They wanted him to watch videotapes of her entering hotels with them. The goal: force her to leave Shanghai and return to Western China. TIANTIAN: (Through translator) They think I'm a politically sensitive character, speaking out, meeting journalists and netizens, criticizing the government.  They hope I go back home to Xinjiang. What they can do is destroy my life. So they asked my boyfriend to break up with me. LANGFITT: He hasn't yet, but he's feeling the heat. The government has already stripped Li of her lawyer's license. When I asked to interview her boyfriend on tape, he refused, fearing he could lose his job too. The couple argues. (SOUNDBITE OF CROSSTALK)LANGFITT: Li says this is the true face of the Communist Party - a regime that uses surveillance to crush its critics. TIANTIAN: (Through translator) Many people have been deceived by the government. They think this government is OK and it wouldn't do such dirty, disgusting and shameless things. I feel they are all like poisonous snakes. I fear them and hate them. LANGFITT: In 2005, China began building a massive surveillance system called Skynet. The government put cameras along streets, on public buses and outside the homes of dissidents. After uprisings in the western regions of Xinjiang and Tibet, officials also put cameras in mosques and temples. In recent years the city of Chongqing set a goal of installing half a million cameras. Police there boasted that during Chinese New Year 2010 their surveillance apparatus identified 4,000 undesirables who'd entered town. According to the Chinese magazine SWeekly, the police department confronted most of them within six hours and forced them to leave. NICHOLAS BEQUELIN: I'm Nicholas Bequelin. I'm a researcher in Beijing, Hong Kong for Human Rights Watch. LANGFITT: Bequelin says the implications are ominous. BEQUELIN: The greatest fear is that the state uses its surveillance and monitoring technology to curtail the modest freedoms that Chinese citizens enjoy today. LANGFITT: He says the Communist Party's ultimate goal is highly accurate facial-recognition technology. BEQUELIN: And that would be a complete game changer. LANGFITT: Because the government could visually track critics in real time. BEQUELIN: And of course prevent the emergence of any challenge to the party in the short and long term. LANGFITT: China already uses facial recognition in places like immigration checkpoints. Bo Zhang, who follows China's surveillance camera market for IMS Research, says facial recognition is much less effective on the street. BO ZHANG: Frankly, the technology is not as good as described in the movies. It's not that easy to find the people in crowds because the facial recognition technology highly relies on the backgrounds and the, you know, the light. LANGFITT: And, Zhang says, the government still has to knit together the country's disparate surveillance networks into one all-seeing eye. ZHANG: They want to see everywhere, definitely. But so far it's still taking time to do. LANGFITT: As elsewhere, surveillance has many positive uses in China. Shanghai police say video cameras helped them catch more than 6,000 suspects in 2010, but they refuse to discuss those successes with NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF NEWS BROADCAST)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Speaking foreign language)LANGFITT: This news report shows how police in Chongqing used a series of surveillance cameras to identify a serial killer, analyze his habits, track his movements, and ultimately kill him. The volume of surveillance cameras on a Shanghai street can be overwhelming at times. Right now I'm on Nanjing Road. It's a big shopping street in Shanghai about half a block from the NPR office, and I'm going to count the cameras. Looking at a bank right here and there's one, two, three cameras here. Next to it is a driveway with one, two, three, four cameras. Another driveway across the street has a couple of cameras, and then I can see another two cameras on top of lampposts. Despite the density, many ordinary Chinese are unfazed by all the surveillance. Liao Guosheng sells shoes and hats from a three-wheel bicycle. He says the cameras deter shoplifters. LIAO GUOSHENG: (Speaking foreign language)LANGFITT: Before, when I parked my tricycle in neighborhoods, thieves always stole things, he said. Now they rarely steal. I feel a sense of safety. Others, though, feel a sense of dread. Last year, Beijing's China University of Politics and Law installed cameras in classrooms. Officials said it was to prevent cheating. Professors didn't believe them. Liu Xin teaches administrative law. She thinks the school plans to target teachers who might criticize China's current system in front of students. LIU XIN: (Through translator) Because things are recorded, once they suspect certain teachers are problematic or their words and behavior are inappropriate, they can find the recordings and that means they've found evidence. LANGFITT: She says cameras will intimidate professors and undermine learning. XIN: (Through translator) Who dares to speak freely and who dares to speak their minds? Then people would think their classes don't need to have outside ideas in them. They can just read off textbooks. I think teachers will lose interest and students will lose interest as well. LANGFITT: The Ministry of Education refused NPR's request for an interview and insisted the cameras are just to deter cheating. Bo Zhang, the analyst, estimates there are now about 30 million cameras operating in China, one for every 43 citizens. He expects camera sales to grow 20 percent annually over the next five years.

It's the latest in our series of conversations around social media and young people. It's a short series we're calling Social Me. Yesterday we talked about the ways young people are exploring different online identities. We talked about the fact that there could be a positive side to that, as well as the negative side that we hear so much about. Today we want to look at how websites kids visit and the apps that they download could be used to enhance their educations. To tell us more about that, we're joined once again by Rey Junco. He is a faculty associate at Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet and Society. Rey Junco, welcome back. Thanks for joining us once again. REY JUNCO: Thanks for having me back, Michel. MARTIN: Now, there's a technical term for what we're talking about here. Learning analytics. In layman's terms, what are learning analytics? JUNCO: Well, learning analytics is the use of student-produced data to predict outcomes and tailor education, so it's often thought of as a practical application of big data in education. So in other words, it's collecting large amounts of data to identify patterns that will help tailor education more precisely for each child. So if you think about how a website like Amazon. com knows the kinds of things you like based on your shopping habits, imagine the same thing for education. So I think of learning analytics as the ultimate formative assessment. We're always talking in education about how formative assessments are very important. It's important to assess frequently and to make adjustments. We've got data well before a student will flunk a first exam or a quiz and so we can make some predictions about the things that they're doing and how we might intervene before we get to that point. And so, for instance, in college, you might be taking a class where there are only three exams and then a final, and so it's very important to identify what some of these risk factors are and we can do that with learning analytics. MARTIN: Are educators doing this now? JUNCO: Not much. There are some applications that are collecting data. Generally, what you see is learning analytics applied to course management systems and course management systems is basically just a fancy way of saying an online discussion board and they are looking at how many times a student will respond, how - to a discussion - how quickly they respond to a discussion, how often they log on. So just very, very basic levels of data that they're looking at, and so the predictive models are not as accurate as they could be. MARTIN: What is your research in this area about? JUNCO: I think we could be doing so much more with learning analytics, so for instance, students are providing a lot of what I call trace data, so data on their use of technologies, data that they leave behind just by the nature of what they do every day, so their Facebook use and their Twitter and their Instagram use and their mobile phone use. So some of my research has already shown that we can use things like how much time students spend on Facebook and what they do on Facebook to predict academic outcomes. So I'm actually engaged in a project right now where I'm collecting trace data on college students to create more precise, predictive models, and then with more data comes the ability to be more precise and to tailor better interventions to help support students. MARTIN: Is there anything that just - forgive me for using this term - regular people could do to use this kind of data now? For example, I mean, you know, you often see these days people who, you know, are privileged enough to be able to have like a tablet, computer or, you know, even a smartphone. I mean, you see people waiting in line. You see people at the grocery store. A kid gets antsy. What do people do? They pull out their phone or they pull out a tablet, they hand it to the child, who can play and entertain himself or herself for quite some time. There are all kinds of apps out there that kids are already attracted to. Some of them they're finding on their own or they're finding out about from their friends. Is there anything, you think, that people could do on their own to use this time more productively? JUNCO: Sure. Well, there are two things. MARTIN: Without being corny about it. I mean obviously, you know, the kiss of death is the educational app, educational software. You know perfectly well your kid's going to run screaming from that. JUNCO: Well, certainly that would be great. The learning analytics kind of process takes some resources, so typical apps don't have any kind of learning analytics integration. However, there are consumer level applications and services that let you monitor what you do online, and we know from other areas - so, for instance, there is this, you know, movement about collecting a lot of information about yourself, the quantified self movement. Right? And so how many steps you walk every day using something like the Fitbit or the Nike FuelBand to check in on how well you're doing towards your fitness goals. And we know from the research that the act of monitoring and tracking your own behavior changes your behavior, so just the act of monitoring changes your behavior. So there are some consumer applications out there that you can sign up for. You can install software on your computer. You can install software on your cell phone and it gives you a report at the end of the day and it says this is how you used your time. And some of these will say here is how much time you spent in unproductive activities and here is how much time you spent in productive activities. MARTIN: Is there any sign that kids like this too? I mean I think that people who just heard what you said, you know, with the pedometer, some companies even giving them to their employees now to urge them to, you know, walk more during the day, or those FitBands or those wristbands that people have bought. A lot of people, I'm sure, got those for holiday presents. Is there any sign that kids like those too, that kids respond to those too? JUNCO: To things like the Nike FuelBand and Fitbit. . . MARTIN: Yeah, yeah. JUNCO: . . . and things like that? MARTIN: Yeah. JUNCO: You know, I haven't seen any research on that. MARTIN: Well, here's an area for you. JUNCO: Yes. And actually I'm thinking about it from a more learning analytics perspective, not from the quantified self and the health data perspective, but just finding out how amenable they are to learning analytics. MARTIN: See, I've given you a new idea. JUNCO: Yes, you have. Thanks, Michel. MARTIN: Rey Junco is a faculty associate at the Harvard Berkman Center for Internet and Society. He joined us from WPSU at Penn State University. Rey Junco, thanks for joining us. JUNCO: Sure. Thank you for having me.

So I'm actually engaged in a project right now where I'm collecting trace data on college students to create more precise, predictive models, and then with more data comes the ability to be more precise and to tailor better interventions to help support students. MARTIN: Is there anything that just - forgive me for using this term - regular people could do to use this kind of data now? For example, I mean, you know, you often see these days people who, you know, are privileged enough to be able to have like a tablet, computer or, you know, even a smartphone. I mean, you see people waiting in line. You see people at the grocery store. A kid gets antsy. What do people do? They pull out their phone or they pull out a tablet, they hand it to the child, who can play and entertain himself or herself for quite some time. There are all kinds of apps out there that kids are already attracted to. Some of them they're finding on their own or they're finding out about from their friends. Is there anything, you think, that people could do on their own to use this time more productively? JUNCO: Sure. Well, there are two things. MARTIN: Without being corny about it. I mean obviously, you know, the kiss of death is the educational app, educational software. You know perfectly well your kid's going to run screaming from that. JUNCO: Well, certainly that would be great. The learning analytics kind of process takes some resources, so typical apps don't have any kind of learning analytics integration. However, there are consumer level applications and services that let you monitor what you do online, and we know from other areas - so, for instance, there is this, you know, movement about collecting a lot of information about yourself, the quantified self movement. Right? And so how many steps you walk every day using something like the Fitbit or the Nike FuelBand to check in on how well you're doing towards your fitness goals. And we know from the research that the act of monitoring and tracking your own behavior changes your behavior, so just the act of monitoring changes your behavior. So there are some consumer applications out there that you can sign up for. You can install software on your computer. You can install software on your cell phone and it gives you a report at the end of the day and it says this is how you used your time. And some of these will say here is how much time you spent in unproductive activities and here is how much time you spent in productive activities. MARTIN: Is there any sign that kids like this too? I mean I think that people who just heard what you said, you know, with the pedometer, some companies even giving them to their employees now to urge them to, you know, walk more during the day, or those FitBands or those wristbands that people have bought. A lot of people, I'm sure, got those for holiday presents. Is there any sign that kids like those too, that kids respond to those too? JUNCO: To things like the Nike FuelBand and Fitbit. . . MARTIN: Yeah, yeah. JUNCO: . . . and things like that? MARTIN: Yeah. JUNCO: You know, I haven't seen any research on that. MARTIN: Well, here's an area for you. JUNCO: Yes. And actually I'm thinking about it from a more learning analytics perspective, not from the quantified self and the health data perspective, but just finding out how amenable they are to learning analytics. MARTIN: See, I've given you a new idea. JUNCO: Yes, you have. Thanks, Michel. MARTIN: Rey Junco is a faculty associate at the Harvard Berkman Center for Internet and Society. He joined us from WPSU at Penn State University. Rey Junco, thanks for joining us. JUNCO: Sure. Thank you for having me. MARTIN: Tomorrow, we'll be talking about an issue that many parents are concerned about - and teachers. How children are protected or are not protected by digital privacy laws.

BRENDA SALINAS, BYLINE: If you want to be let in on a military secret, go to YouTube and search for Sock Bun. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEOS)SALINAS: That last blogger is a woman named Dolly Marie Spice. She's a senior airman in the Air Force Reserves, so she knows from experience that women in uniform need sturdy hairstyles that can be executed quickly and neatly. When she first enlisted, she was looking for a little advice and not just about hair styles. She turned to YouTube and even there, her search turned up empty. : I had a hard time finding a lot of stuff on YouTube, especially women. You know, from women maybe fresh out of basic training, that was hard to come by. SALINAS: So she started blogging about her own experiences. So far, she has made 30 videos where she talks to her 2,000 followers. Usually, when recruits want to find out what life in the military is really going to be like, they go to their recruiter. But women who are signing up face different challenges, have different questions and men don't always have the answers. SERGEANT BRIDGET JACKSON: Kids of today, they want to go in depth. SALINAS: That's Sergeant Bridget Jackson. She's works in an Army recruiting station in Largo, Maryland. All the female recruits in the area get forwarded to her. JACKSON: They want to know how do I feel about leaving my family; are we able to wash our hair and take a shower. And I don't know what myths they heard of but they want to know, as a female, if I'm out there in Afghanistan, am I out there in the middle of nowhere not taking a shower. SALINAS: Her newest recruit, Erica Mason, has those doubts, too, though she's not completely uninitiated; she comes from a military family and she did Junior ROTC. That means she's ready for the culture shock. But she'll be away from her two kids for 17 weeks. When she talks to her husband, a retired Marine, there are things he just doesn't understand. ERICA MASON: I always tell him, you know, you went in right after high school. You had no family. You've never left, you know, kids that you gave birth to or your spouse. That's pretty much like nothing that anybody can understand, unless you went through it and you're a mom and you left your kids for boot camp or you left, you know, for deployment or something. Nobody understands. SALINAS: Sergeant Jackson, her recruiter, understands. She was a single mom when she deployed. Now she talks to her recruits about everything, from how she used to get her nails done on base in Afghanistan to how she advanced in her military career. The men in her recruiting office can't do what she does. JACKSON: I'm a hot commodity. SALINAS: How many female recruiters does the Army have? JACKSON: Not enough, I can tell you that. I'm not sure about the numbers but for our company, our company has over 40 soldiers. Out of the 40, as of last week, it was only three of us. SALINAS: That means most women have men for recruiters. So when they want advice from women already in the military, they go online. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)SALINAS: Dolly Marie isn't the only blogger on YouTube. There are more than 20 others like her.

Yesterday on this program we heard how the Communist Party in China is using tens of millions of surveillance cameras to monitor the country and spy on some citizens. Today we hear about how some Chinese are spying on each other. We meet a man who got a unique view of China after spending a year sweeping homes and offices for secret listening devices and cameras. NPR's Frank Langfitt reports. FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: Qi Hong is a former journalist from East China's Shandong province. He began doing counter-surveillance work on the side a couple of years ago. It started with a friend, a local official whose wife suspected he was having an affair. Qi's buddy couldn't figure out how his wife knew details of his private conversations. QI HONG: (Through translator) His wife knew things that he said in his car and his office, including conversations over the telephone. Sometimes, when they quarreled, his wife would bring up some of these things. LANGFITT: So Qi asked another friend, who owned bug-detecting equipment, to help. QI: (Through translator) This friend discovered a listening device under the official's car seat. In his office he discovered a tiny hidden camera on the bookshelf. We were both shocked. It dawned on us, in recent years this sort of thing was happening a lot in China. LANGFITT: Qi bought some bug-detecting equipment himself. And over the next year, he says, he helped more than a hundred friends find more than 300 surveillance devices. Bugs are illegal in China, but easy to buy. You can find bugs hidden in pens, buttons, eyeglasses, USB drives and power strips. Qi found surveillance cameras planted in some pretty personal places. QI: (Through translator) They generally aim at people's beds and where they shower. They want to know your secrets, your private life. LANGFITT: Adultery is rampant in urban China. Qi says many people were bugged by suspicious wives or mistresses. In other cases, though, he said government officials spied on each other. Qi said when officials realized they were under surveillance, they panicked, fearing colleagues had captured them taking payoffs. QI: (Through translator) People had heart attacks. They were extremely scared, frightened, sweating all over with panicky looks on their faces. They were speechless. LANGFITT: Lu Su, an official in Qi's home province of Shandong, may have had the same reaction this month. A hidden camera video surfaced on China's Internet showing Lu at his desk. He appears to take a gift card, a common form for bribes here, from a visitor. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)LU SU: (Speaking foreign language)LANGFITT: No problem. No problem. I will certainly provide good service, Lu says. Lu has since been suspended from his job. And spying isn't just a threat to low level officials. Last year the New York Times reported that one reason former Politburo member Bo Xilai was taken into custody was because he wiretapped Hu Jintao, chairman of the Communist Party. Qi Hong says Chinese officials spy on each another because there is so little trust and so much to be gained politically and financially. He says sometimes they spy because they want a piece of the action. QI: (Through translator) You may get some illegal benefits. I want them too. But you don't want to share with me. When I find out your vulnerability, I will subtly suggest problems you have and you will panic. A very good option is for you to share some of the benefits and we become the same. LANGFITT: Qi says distrust is so deep, he's seen officials hug each other when greeting. QI: (Through translator) This is not Chinese etiquette, but why did Chinese officials import it? The reality is they use the legitimate hugging and intimacy to pat down each other to check if the other person is carrying a listening device. LANGFITT: Qi and I met in the back room of a restaurant. He's a big guy, well over six feet, with a lazy eye. Qi showed me some of his equipment. He unwrapped a machine about the size of an iPad, but much thicker. Okay, so he's taking out a really cool device out of a plastic case and it's called a wireless camera hunter. It has a video monitor and three antennae to detect wireless signals. It costs nearly $1,600. QI: (Through translator) If this room were installed with bugs and they were working, then images they took would appear on this screen and we would see them clearly. This is scanning various frequencies. LANGFITT: After talking to Mr. Qi, I came down to this electronics market in Shanghai and I picked up a detector that should be able to find hidden bugs as well as hidden cameras. It cost just about 35 bucks, and now I'm going to try it out. Okay. So I'm in the office of some people I know who are concerned about cameras and they are concerned about listening devices. And I'm going to go hunting. I turned off office equipment and turn on the device, which buzzes when it picks up wireless signals emitted by bugs. (SOUNDBITE OF BUZZING)LANGFITT: Fax machine. That's telephone. Let's go over here. No, that fax machine is clean. Another telephone in another office is clearly - you can hear it yourself. It's clearly bugged. Distrust is a growth market in China, and it's made Wei Wenjun a busy man. Wei's worked as a detective in Shanghai for two decades. I met him at a tea house. He wore a black cap, black leather jacket, and spoke through nicotine-stained teeth. Of his some 2,000 cases, Wei says 80 percent focused on infidelity. His nickname? WEI WENJUN: (Speaking foreign language)LANGFITT: The mistress. WEI: (Speaking foreign language)LANGFITT: Recently the government's been cracking down on detectives, enforcing a new law against illegally obtaining personal information. Scores of detectives have been arrested. Officials say they are trying to protect citizens' privacy. Wei says they are also trying to protect themselves. WEI: (Through translator) Our profession is seen as a serious concern by China's high-level officials. Mistresses are what corrupt officials are most afraid of. That's the weakest link in their defense system. LANGFITT: Wei says the volume of surveillance, infidelity and distrust are a sign of the times. He sees it as a natural result of the country's rush into capitalism, with no moral framework to guide its people. WEI: (Through translator) The Chinese lost their belief system. The Chinese completely lost their souls. LANGFITT: Qi Hong, the bug detector, feels much the same way. After a year helping people find surveillance devices, Qi quit. He found the process and its implications depressing. I felt very stressed and in pain, he said. I'd seen so many strange phenomena and illegal things. Frank Langfitt, NPR News, Shanghai. RENEE MONTAGE, HOST: You wouldn't need a secret camera to notice how bad the pollution is in many parts of China. In major cities like Beijing, visibility can be so bad, residents can see only a couple of hundred yards ahead. That smog has sent a record number of people to hospitals. It's forced airlines to cancel flights and highways to close. INSKEEP: And China's government has warned people to stay inside, even as it has downplayed the problem, insisting it's just fog. Now a high-level official admits something needs to be done. The premier, Wen Jiabao, is calling for certain and effective steps to cut pollution, which suggests that pollution is now seen as not just a public health issue but a political problem as well. MONTAGE: Yesterday, a prominent anti-pollution activist conducted a poll on one of China's popular social media sites. Within hours, tens of thousands had weighed in in support of a national air quality law. One blogger chimed in that anyone who doesn't want an air quality law is either a major polluter or a creature that doesn't breathe. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Okay.

Earlier this week, we heard about how kids could benefit from developing their online identities and how educators can use data about social media to help shape better lessons. But, today, we're going to explore a potential downside of social media for children and ask whether digital privacy protection is keeping up with the growth of technology. Rey Junco is a faculty associate at Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet and Society. Earlier, he joined Michel Martin to discuss the issue. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: Rey, welcome back. Thanks for joining us once again. REY JUNCO: Hi, Michel. Awesome to be here. MARTIN: Rey, you know, often, if you ever log on to a site that's meant for kids or if you log on to a game or you try to download a game or something that's meant for kids, you'll see that it'll say, well, are you 13 or older? Do you have your parent's permission? Is that all because of the Children's Online Protection Act, or COPA? Is that what that's all about? JUNCO: Yes. That's correct. That's from COPA. MARTIN: Could you just briefly give us an idea of what kinds of protections children are supposed to have online now? And I understand that they recently changed, but just tell us what kinds of protections, sort of, in general terms, kids are supposed to have when they go online. JUNCO: In general, the idea behind COPA was to protect children online and to keep their information private, to keep bad actors from getting their information and to keep them from being marketed to in ways that are hyper-charged, basically, by technology. MARTIN: You know, one of the things that I think a lot of privacy advocates have talked about is that, you know, Americans are kind of funny when it comes to privacy. On the one hand, Americans are very adamant about their right to privacy. On the other hand, people routinely give away all kinds of information, like about how much money they make, about their - you know, their race, what they're going to buy, their, sort of, shopping habits. Do you find that people are more vigilant when it comes to their kids or are they still kind of lax in actually giving away information, even if they don't necessarily want people to have it? JUNCO: You know, I think there is an interesting catch 22 here, just like you've identified, that there's research - for instance, there was a recent Pew Internet and American Life Project Berkman Center survey of parents who have teenagers and 81 percent of the parents of teens who go online say they are concerned about how much information advertisers can learn about their child's online behavior. Sixty-nine percent of parents of online teens are concerned about how their child's online activity might affect their future academic or employment opportunities. Yet, one of the reasons why the changes occurred in COPA was because there was all of this other data collection that was happening that most people weren't really attuned to. And I think that was one of the big stories when we talked about this that last time, was that people didn't really get that these apps were tracking kids in these ways. MARTIN: I thought you had some research on this point, about how kids themselves view online privacy. JUNCO: Well, youth are much savvier about their online privacy than most adults give them credit for. So research on their online behavior shows that they adjust privacy settings and behave in ways that show that they're very aware of privacy issues. But the research is mostly conducted on teenagers and not on younger children, and it's mostly conducted on teenagers using specific sites, like Facebook and MySpace. And some of the things that happen with other kinds of tracking are well beyond typical privacy concerns of parents, but also of youth. MARTIN: What advice do you have for parents and caregivers going forward and teens themselves, for that matter, who are listening to this conversation? And, you know, you want to go online. You want to experience what's out there, but you don't necessarily want your personal information being sort of tracked forever. Is there anything you should be particularly aware of? Is there really anything you can do? JUNCO: One of my favorite plug-ins for my browser is Do Not Track Plus, which sits in your browser and doesn't allow you to be tracked across websites and blocks these queries about your personal information and about what sites you're visiting and about your behavior in order to serve up different kinds of advertisement to you. MARTIN: So, looking ahead, are there other policy changes that you would like to see made to address this? JUNCO: Well, the problem with the current rules is that they can't foresee all of the applications right now, plus they can't foresee all of the applications in the future. So, for me, it's more of a process issue because, before the rules were updated, we saw that developers for apps for kids were collecting information without providing notice. They used a - you know, basically, a loophole in COPA that didn't cover a new technology, such as mobile devices. And I use, \"new,\" in air quotes because, I mean, mobile technologies obviously aren't new to us, but they're new to COPA because COPA's been around for so long. So part of the problem is that the current models of making money online involves a system by which a website is touted as free, but then data is harvested and used for advertising in ways that we would consider an unacceptable privacy breach for our children. I would consider them an unacceptable privacy breach for all of us. But such a popular business model doesn't really mesh well with protecting privacy, so I don't think that there are going to be static rules that are going to hold for very long periods of time, given the rapid advances in technology that we see, but I think it's important to have a process by which the FTC can continually make and enforce updates. MARTIN: Before we let you go, Rey, over the course of the last days, as we've said, we've talked a couple of things. We've talked about the online identities question. I mean, you know, the idea of anonymity online has gotten a really bad rap, particularly when it comes to kids, and you've pointed out how that can actually be a positive thing, in some ways. You've talked about the fact that, you know, online use can be constructive. It can help people figure out how kids can learn better if they use that information, you know, properly. And, today, of course, we talked about, you know, the privacy question. When you think, sort of, overall, about the way our young people are interacting with technology, with the Internet, are you mostly excited or are you fearful in some ways? JUNCO: Well, I'm actually optimistic about it. I'm often told that I'm too optimistic, which is kind of funny because I don't really consider myself an optimist. I consider myself a realist and, sometimes, at least to me, that comes off as being pretty negative about the future. But I think that these technologies really hold such promise for education, for interpersonal interactions, for exploring things about ourselves, our identities, our psychological makeup that we've never been able to do before with other kinds of tools. And I think it allows us for some really neat and expansive ways to grow and develop and so I'm talking about youth here, but I'm also talking about adults, as well, and I think I'm really optimistic about it. MARTIN: Rey Junco is a faculty associate at the Harvard Berkman Center for Internet and Society. He joined us from WPSU at Penn State University. Thank you so much for joining us. JUNCO: Thanks a lot, Michel. MARTIN: If you missed any of our previous conversations in our Social Me series, please go to our website and check it out. Go to NPR. org, click on the Programs tab and then on TELL ME MORE. CELESTE HEADLEE, HOST:  We return now to TELL ME MORE's Social Me series, looking at how young people are interacting online. Earlier this week, we heard about how kids could benefit from developing their online identities and how educators can use data about social media to help shape better lessons. But, today, we're going to explore a potential downside of social media for children and ask whether digital privacy protection is keeping up with the growth of technology. Rey Junco is a faculty associate at Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet and Society. Earlier, he joined Michel Martin to discuss the issue. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Rey, welcome back. Thanks for joining us once again. REY JUNCO: Hi, Michel. Awesome to be here. MARTIN: Rey, you know, often, if you ever log on to a site that's meant for kids or if you log on to a game or you try to download a game or something that's meant for kids, you'll see that it'll say, well, are you 13 or older? Do you have your parent's permission? Is that all because of the Children's Online Protection Act, or COPA? Is that what that's all about? JUNCO: Yes. That's correct. That's from COPA. MARTIN: Could you just briefly give us an idea of what kinds of protections children are supposed to have online now? And I understand that they recently changed, but just tell us what kinds of protections, sort of, in general terms, kids are supposed to have when they go online. JUNCO: In general, the idea behind COPA was to protect children online and to keep their information private, to keep bad actors from getting their information and to keep them from being marketed to in ways that are hyper-charged, basically, by technology. MARTIN: You know, one of the things that I think a lot of privacy advocates have talked about is that, you know, Americans are kind of funny when it comes to privacy. On the one hand, Americans are very adamant about their right to privacy. On the other hand, people routinely give away all kinds of information, like about how much money they make, about their - you know, their race, what they're going to buy, their, sort of, shopping habits. Do you find that people are more vigilant when it comes to their kids or are they still kind of lax in actually giving away information, even if they don't necessarily want people to have it? JUNCO: You know, I think there is an interesting catch 22 here, just like you've identified, that there's research - for instance, there was a recent Pew Internet and American Life Project Berkman Center survey of parents who have teenagers and 81 percent of the parents of teens who go online say they are concerned about how much information advertisers can learn about their child's online behavior. Sixty-nine percent of parents of online teens are concerned about how their child's online activity might affect their future academic or employment opportunities. Yet, one of the reasons why the changes occurred in COPA was because there was all of this other data collection that was happening that most people weren't really attuned to. And I think that was one of the big stories when we talked about this that last time, was that people didn't really get that these apps were tracking kids in these ways. MARTIN: I thought you had some research on this point, about how kids themselves view online privacy. JUNCO: Well, youth are much savvier about their online privacy than most adults give them credit for. So research on their online behavior shows that they adjust privacy settings and behave in ways that show that they're very aware of privacy issues. But the research is mostly conducted on teenagers and not on younger children, and it's mostly conducted on teenagers using specific sites, like Facebook and MySpace. And some of the things that happen with other kinds of tracking are well beyond typical privacy concerns of parents, but also of youth. MARTIN: What advice do you have for parents and caregivers going forward and teens themselves, for that matter, who are listening to this conversation? And, you know, you want to go online. You want to experience what's out there, but you don't necessarily want your personal information being sort of tracked forever. Is there anything you should be particularly aware of?

When you read a news article online, how much attention do you pay to the comments that follow at the bottom? What about how many times the story has been re-tweeted or how many Facebook likes it has? Do you pay attention to those? A recent piece published in the journal Science found that all of these things can influence how readers feel about a topic, even if they don't realize it. So how does the online environment impact the public's perception of science? Can just the tone of the comments sway people's opinions about an article on, say, stem cells, climate change, even nanotechnology? Are comments sections still effective ways to spark discussions, or are they now breeding grounds for misinformation, and we've all seen how online trolls work. In fact, we put this question out this week on our Twitter: Does moderating comments violate freedom of speech? And can such discussion of the question on our website, responses - you can see that discussion, and they were overwhelmingly in favor of moderating comments. That's what our Twitter audience thought when we put that out earlier in the week. So we're going to talk about what some of the pitfalls of communicating science online are, and how can we avoid them and deal with them in the new normal about how science is published online and what's going on there. Let me introduce my guests. Dominique Brossard is lead author of the Science paper, which was titled \"Science, New Media and the Public. \" She is a professor at the Department of Life Science Communication at the University of Madison - University of Wisconsin in Madison, and she joins us from Madison. Welcome to the program. DOMINIQUE BROSSARD: Thank you. FLATOW: You're welcome. Bora Zivkovic is the blog editor at Scientific American and organizer of the ScienceOnline Conference, which is going on right now in Raleigh, North Carolina. He joins us by phone from the conference. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. BORA ZIVKOVIC: Great to be there, thank you. FLATOW: Thank you. John Hawks is a science blogger and associate professor of anthropology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He joins us from Salt Lake City. Welcome to the program. JOHN HAWKS: Thanks. FLATOW: Dr. Brossard, tell us a bit about your piece in Science. Apart from the content of the article itself, what kinds of things did you find that could influence readers' opinions? Tell us what you studied. BROSSARD: Well, we've been interested for quite a long time, let's say two or three years here at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, investigating the effect of the online context for public perception of science. We have noticed that indeed people are moving from traditional outlets to actually rely much more on online environments to find out about science, let's say through searching or, you know, going to blogs and not going to traditional, mainstream newspaper outlets. So the question remained, though: What type of effects do those new environments have, you know, on public perception of science and public understanding of science? And one of the things that we know that are very different in that online environment are those comments that people post on blogs or the potential likes, you know, that people put on their Facebook to show that they appreciate a particular piece or the number of ways people tweet about a particular topic. But however, there is really not much as far as in people evidence showing us how much this impacts how people feel about science. So basically there was a starting point. It's like how can we rely on social science to help us understand how these new media environments will influence the public about, you know, that (unintelligible) science in the United States. And what can we do to actually offer the best possible environment for this audience to interact with the scientific content in a productive way? And the study that you mentioned that called, you know, for a lot of attention around the online environment lately was that particular study that looked at the tone of comments. What happened when people are rude, you know, following a story that otherwise is very well-written? And we chose the topic of nanotechnology because like a lot of new, emerging technology, new scientific topics, this is relatively unknown for the vast majority of the American public. So what happened when you find a story well-written, by a good science writer, that actually is followed by comments that may not be always extremely polite? So if you did a study, randomly assigned people to different conditions, some people saw polite comments, other people saw the same comments but just, you know, with rude language such as idiot, et cetera. And what we found is that people that were exposed to those rude comments tend to become polarized about the issue that was covering the story, which was nanotechnology. So basically just being exposed to rude comments, even if the content of the comments themselves was the same, made people react differently to the content of the story. So the question is therefore: What do we do, right, to encourage better understanding? FLATOW: Do you have a suggestion? BROSSARD: Well, I mean, and that's interesting because, you know, like my colleagues who are practicing bloggers and extremely fruitful doing so, that are on the show tonight, today, can actually tell us what they think. But what we can, you know, basically say is that right now, you know, it's much more the choice of the blogger himself or herself to decide how to manage those comments and not a lot of empirical evidence as far as how to do so. What our study suggests is that indeed even, you know, slightly rude comments because, I mean, we were not even investigating trolling, we were not investigating, you know, how disruptive behavior, which obviously from a common-sense perspective, you know, everybody would take out from their comments thread, right. We're just showing, like, people that were getting a little bit, you know, into the discussion so much as to say you idiot, I think you should think like me, or obviously there are, you know, benefits related to this, you know, this technology. FLATOW: So even the tamer comments were influencing how people thought about the research? BROSSARD: Exactly. So it was - that's the thing, and that's where, you know, when you asked me what we should do, I think obviously we should get rid of anything that's not polite, That doesn't follow civil discourse. And then we should, you know, discuss what does it mean to have a civil discussion online. What are the social norms that we strive to establish in this environment, such as we have social norm, let's say, in - at the dinner table, right, where some things are, you know, implicitly not allowed because it's not something that should be, you know, considered polite. What is a polite, you know, behavior in the online environment? And I think we haven't yet decided what are those social norms. FLATOW: Now we're going to talk about it. That's what we're talking about this hour. I want to get into that and other issues. Dominique Brossard, how do you deal with it? And I know you've been very vocal on the Internet in the last few weeks about - I'm sorry, Bora, how do you deal with it on your website? ZIVKOVIC: Well, my website is hosted on Scientific American. So it is traditional media, which has a reputation and a brand as, you know, a 167-year-old magazine. So I cannot treat it exactly the same as I would me, you know, personal blog, kept completely independently somewhere there. So I need to keep always in mind that our site is an educational site where people come through searches or recommendations to learn about science. And so this kind of discourse in comments is very important for me, and the study was very insightful to me that just the tone of comments can skew how our readers are learning about science because stuff that goes on our site is vetted in some way that it is corrected. It is accurate science. And so the idea that commenters may skew that is something that makes me nervous as an editor of our blogs. FLATOW: So do you believe that they should be moderated, these blogs? ZIVKOVIC: Yes, I think the ideas about comment amelioration have changed over the past, you know, 10 or 15 years, that these things exist online. In the beginning, I think there was the idea that this should be a free forum. And now there are so many free fora out there that I don't think a site like Scientific American should provide a free form for everything and everybody and all kinds of online fights to happen in our comments because I think the free speech applies to the Web as a whole, not to any particular site. And I think the host of the site has to keep in mind what is the goal of the site, what is the reason why the site exists. If it's educational, then these kinds of comments need to go. And it's perfectly OK. It's perfectly legal to do it. So I think we need to have our readers in mind first and act appropriately. FLATOW: John Hawks, you're a science blogger and a scientist, a professor of anthropology. You have definite opinions about this also, don't you? HAWKS: Absolutely. I started blogging nine years ago, and when I started, I didn't have tenure. And so I was very nervous about, you know, putting my opinions out there and having people read them who might evaluate me. And so I sort of developed a voice that allowed me to be able to be critical of scientific research studies without being polarizing. And I think one of the interesting things about what Dominique is finding with online forums is that the scientific literature is sort of like this. You know, it has these interactions. People submit comments to journals. Sometimes they put a lot of fire and personal invective into them, and it has always polarized the kind of work that I'm involved with. Our research is in human evolution and genetics, and there are some big personalities in that field and some strong feelings. And you see people publish letters to the editor, and it just drives you crazy sometimes. FLATOW: So you don't allow any comments on your site. HAWKS: Yeah, I began - I began my site without comments. I could just see that it really took a lot of effort to create a community where you had people able to be confident that they could write what they were thinking and not be trolled and not have a lot of rudeness, you know, put on them. So I began without comments. I experimented from time to time, you know, allowing comments on certain things. And I just have to say it is an enormous amount of work to look through what people are publishing and try to really encourage that community to build. So I admire people who are able to do that online. FLATOW: If they want to troll or get rude, start your own blog is basically what you're saying, stay off of mine. HAWKS: Yeah, I started my own blog. Yeah, exactly. You know, I pay for my server. I have my own independent site. And if somebody wants to criticize me, they're welcome to. If they - if I write something that they don't like, they can send me a letter, and I will be happy to publish their thoughts about it. But the reality is that if somebody just wants to hang around and lob comments on things, I would rather that they spent the effort to build their own reputation that gave people a reason to listen to what they had to say. FLATOW: All right, we'll take a short break, we'll come back and talk lots more about this. I'm sure you have a lot of questions. My guests are Dominique Brossard, Bora Zivkovic and John Hawks. Stay with us. We'll be right back after this break. Don't go away. 1-800-989-8255 is our number, and you can tweet us @scifri, @-S-C-I-F-R-I. I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)FLATOW: This is SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour about the impact of the Internet and bloggers and commentaries on how the public perceives science. My guests are Dominique Brossard, professor in the Department of Life Sciences - Life Sciences Communication at the University of Wisconsin in Madison; Bora Zivkovic, blog editor at Scientific American and organizer of the ScienceOnline Conference that's going on this week; John Hawks, science blogger, associate professor of anthropology at the  University of Wisconsin in Madison. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. Does science, technology, health, medicine occupy a special niche in reporting and the way that commentaries and commenting should be handled on a website, as opposed to entertainment, even politics? You know people are going to badmouth and do all kinds of stuff there, but it might be - and that doesn't matter on those kinds of sites. Does it matter more, Bora, on a science site, where the research itself, if I read Dominique's research - her file, her piece that she published - is actually distorted, gets to be distorted by listening to the commentaries? ZIVKOVIC: I agree. Maybe it's my bias because I come from science, and I'm now in the media. I think that when it comes to science, health and technology, this is less the matter of opinion and more or less of, well, what are the data saying about it. So I think the - kind of the he-said-she-said type of journalism is probably the least prominent now in science reporting, compared to, you know, political or others - but also because science bloggers bring expertise. Many of them are working scientists or used to be working scientists. They are kind of the area of reporting or area in the media which was the first to, kind of, breach that wall, you know, the old war between journalism bloggers. I think journalism bloggers are now one and the same and working together and teaching each other and learning from each other and, kind of, together building this new ecosystem for online media reporting. And, you know, we are here today at NC State campus with 450 people who are on the cutting edge of that, and it's really hard to say who is a blogger, who is a journalist, who is something else. Everybody is wearing multiple hats and seeing the things from all the angles. So I think the science writers and journalists and science bloggers are - have been working together now for several years to improve the overall level and quality of science coverage, online and in other outlets. And one of the first things to go is to assign equal - let's say an equal truth value to all the opinions that are out there, because there are data that support a particular statement and no data that are supporting the opposite statement. So why let the opposite statement even go there. That can be in the politics section or when you're discussing ideology or why people believe weird things. But when you're straight-out science reporting, there's really no need to include or allow inclusion of opinions that are completely unscientific. FLATOW: But we live in an age, at least in the United States, where some people, now, in the last few years, possibly politically oriented, say that, you know, science is just another matter of opinion, you know. ZIVKOVIC: Yeah, that's their opinion. That doesn't mean that opinion is correct, either. Because unlike other opinions, scientific opinion has to be backed up by empirical information, by empirical data, and it's a self-correcting - at least long-term - self-correcting endeavor. So an individual scientist may have biases or opinions, but science as a whole is a way of knowledge that actually is trying to represent nature as it really is. FLATOW: John Hawks, how do you feel about this? HAWKS: You know, I'm an American. I'm skeptical of people that have a lot of power. I don't think that we are spending our science dollars in the most efficient way in lots of respects. But I understand, as a scientist, that skepticism is important to science. And you have to play at a very high level of knowledge, of understanding what data are, of understanding what scientific methods are and how they work in order to make scientific progress. There is a reason why we attribute an authority to scientists who have spent the time to understand an issue and are reporting to the best of their ability the data that they see relative to that issue. And I think that there's a misunderstanding of science, that somehow scientists are human - that's true - but then that somehow makes science just a matter of their opinion. In fact, their opinion can't last in science unless it comports with what the data are showing us. And. . . FLATOW: Let me - I'm sorry. BROSSARD: Can. . . ? FLATOW: Go ahead, Dominique. BROSSARD: Yes, so just to represent it again, I'm coming from a social science perspective that look at how scientific information is processed, by say, the (unintelligible). And I think we need to keep in mind that no - to some extent no reporting is unbiased. I mean, no - like everything that is written about science, or anything else, will be processed by audiences in the context of their own value predisposition, the context of what we call the perceptual filter that help them make sense of that information. So when the Scientific American blogs about a particular issue, the readers will interpret the information, even if it's presented in the most objective possible way, in light of what they already have stored in their memory that helps them make sense of that information. So when we get back to what we want to accomplish with scientific reporting, which I think is at the core of the matter here. If we want to enlighten, you know, let's say, the vast majority of the American public - and you all mentioned, and some people in the United States may think that scientists, you know, information is just an opinion - well, if you want to change this, my question is how do we do that. And what I'm concerned about is that by that heavy emphasis on science blogging by scientists, that at the end of the day will mostly be read by a population of people that are already interested in science, that already are, you know, the audience that doesn't have that, let's say, that, you know, like, subjective view of science. Are we missing the boat, to some extent? The mainstream news outlet, where you have science that's reported in the middle of other type of issues, may be the way to reach that - those audiences. And our research has shown that indeed, the people that do go to the Internet to look for information about science, tend to be more educated, and slightly more males do so, than the general audience. So, you know, like on the one hand, indeed, you know, like science bloggers are doing a great job. They have their blogs. They try to be as, you know, respectful of science as an enterprise as possible. But on the other hand, are we still replacing on the Internet, you know, what we have seen happen before with science museums, for example, science museums where you have already interested audiences that go there, you know, to find out more about science. But basically they are not the one who would need it the most. FLATOW: Let's go the phones, 1-800-989-8255. Nina(ph) in Santa Cruz, hi Nina. NINA: Hi there, good morning. I'd like to ask the panel of what their opinion of what they think about Yelp? Yelp is a little different in that they mostly make money off of the negative review. Because when you get a negative review as a business, you have to sort of rally the troops, as it were. You have to get everybody from your mom and your brother, your customers to respond to the negative reviews because ordinarily, people don't write a good reviews. They want to go someplace to complain. You know, Yelp is a giant complaint board. So I'm wondering what your panel thinks about this conflict of interest and how it's affecting online reviews. FLATOW: All right, thanks for calling, Nina. That brings us - I'm glad Nina brought that up. She was reading my mind because I was reading today that Google has submitted an antitrust proposal to the EU because Google has been sued a couple of times - I think, at least once by the United States, it's dropped that suit and won that suit, Google did - about the fact that they massage - and maybe Yelp does the same thing - the accusation that when you Google something, they massage the kind of information they want to send you back for their own purposes. And you may not find what you're looking for. HAWKS: That's what I found very interesting about Dominique's publication is that they really thought about the way that how we find information online, how Google is giving us search results, is changing the way that people are actually learning about scientific topics. And I know that people hit my blog from Google, and it's completely things that I would never predict that I turn out to be what they find. And sometimes, the things that I'm most committed to, that I'm really the world expert on, I'm not on the top page of Google rankings. So it is really becoming a matter of algorithms how we discover things. BROSSARD: Yeah, exactly, John, you couldn't have put it better, and this is something we saw most particularly in the context of nanotechnology when we try - when we tracked the keywords that people were using to search, you know, the issue of nanotechnology. And then, you know, we looked at the content they were likely to find, and we saw that, indeed, they were most likely to find content really to help even if at the start - as a starting point, they were looking for something (unintelligible) the nanotechnology and the environment. So sophisticated algorithm that are based on volume of keyword searchers that are based on things like how often, you know, a specific story is forward through email, how many links you have on your website, et cetera. And honestly, we - hard to have access to the actual algorithm. We try to do that because it's constantly revisited to be able to reflect, you know, basically try to guess what people are looking for. And I think in the context of science, this is really problematic, because let's say going back to that issue of nanotechnology, it could be any issue, even evolution if you wanted to be more broader and, you know, something that more social implications right now. But basically, we may give like a false perception of all the dimensions that can be attached to an issue by, you know, like letting those searchers govern to some extent the public discourse. It seems that basically, you know, people like you, John and Bora, that are doing the best you can to enlighten the public with really sound information about science. You have less power, let's say, than the algorithm behind Google. FLATOW: Yeah. That's for sure. Let's go to Paul in Panama City, Florida. Hi, Paul. PAUL: Hey. Thanks for taking my call. FLATOW: Go ahead. PAUL: I just wanted to say I rarely comment on any pieces that I read. But in my general Internet usage, if I'm not specifically researching something, when I come across a video or a piece that has the comments disabled, I just make it a habit, you know, eight or nine times out of 10 I just ignore it, and there's two reasons for it. First, I'm an adult, you know, I'm able to discern the intentions of the trolls and people who oppose whatever they're commenting on. And, you know, that can help me make my own decision. The second, and more importantly, if you're willing to post an opinion, a belief, a statement, work, research, whatever, and you're not willing to discuss it, there's something in that that's visceral that just makes me not want to engage. And, you know, it's hard to explain but. . . FLATOW: Well, let me have you talk. . . PAUL: . . . what sounds like (unintelligible). FLATOW: Well, let me have you talk to John Hawks who doesn't allow anybody to comment on his. . . (LAUGHTER)FLATOW: . . . website. John? HAWKS: Well, I completely understand that attitude. You know, I want to see what the diversity of people think, but there's a lot of information sources out there where you can find out that diversity and (unintelligible). (LAUGHTER)PAUL: Right. When I'm looking for - when I'm looking specifically at researching, I'll ignore that rule. But I mean your point earlier about trolls leaching off the reputations of, you know, the people they're commenting against, I mean that's very well taken. But I really believe that most people are intelligent enough to look past the trolls and to the deeper issue. FLATOW: Well, we all hope so, Paul. (LAUGHTER)FLATOW: Thank you very much. PAUL: Thank you. FLATOW: Our number, 1-800-989-8255. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. I'm Ira Flatow here with Dominique Brossard, Bora Zivkovic and John Hawks. You can also tweet us, @scifri, S-C-I-F-R-I. I'm going to read a couple of the tweets that came in. CGino(ph) says: When it comes to science and tech, it's less a matter of an opinion than when it comes to - I imagine - other things. All kinds of stuff like that. Can I ask the panel about crowd funding for research? What do we think about that? Crowd funding for research. ZIVKOVIC: I really, really like this idea, especially with the new - kind of new world of science funding where the reduction of funds, there's a lot of researchers looking for money and less and less money for it. So I'm looking with great interest at all the new endeavors for people for doing crowd funding. There's three or four organizations or companies now that are organizing or coordinating crowd funding. For now, those are not going to be $5 million grants. People are asking for, you know, several thousand dollars for small projects that can be pilot projects that can then be turned into bigger grants for NIH or NSF funding. But what I find very interesting about it is in order to crowd fund even, you know, several hundred dollars, one has to actually engage with potential donors which are the anonymous public. So you can't just write the grant proposal or, you know, make a video and put it online and hope that people will drop, you know, $5 for your project. You have to actually actively engage with them in order to sell them on the idea that they should fund your project. You have to promise them that once you get funded and do the project, they'll be the first to know, maybe get something extra out of it for some extra reputation for funding a project that worked out well. So it's a very, very nascent field. It really started just within the last year or two. It's very, very interesting to watch how that is going to change the way researchers are interacting with the public if the public is directly funding them from their own pockets out of their own choices what they want to fund. FLATOW: Quick question before we go to the break from James(ph) in Phoenix. Hi, James. Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my call. Mm-hmm. JAMES: I understand the opposition, the comments and posts, and both sides are very interesting. However, my question about bad info. I've been doing some research on vaccinations, and it seems I cannot find a story on that, where there's somebody trying to say that, you know, they've just proven vaccine, autism today where conversations don't take that corner. So this essentially becomes a political debate, not related to science. I'm wondering if what the panel thoughts were on some kind of editorial discretion and the likes. FLATOW: How would the. . . ZIVKOVIC: I would say it really depends on the site. And there are bloggers who focus on this particular issue, and they actually provide a forum for discussing this and providing all the necessary information to counter those claims. A site like Scientific America has to be much more careful about it because all the comments are - that are published on Scientific American are published on Scientific American. So it is as if we did it, so we have to be a little bit more careful what kind of information to allow and then how to counter it the best way so people - the 90 percent who never comment, the onlookers, the readers get the right message in the end and I understand that people are coming to every news piece with their own preconception. . . FLATOW: All rightZIVKOVIC: . . . with their own worldviews. But over time, people do change their minds. Nobody is changing their mind immediately. FLATOW: All right, Bora. I got to interrupt though. We'll take a break and we'll pick this up right after the break. So stay with us. We'll be right back. I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)FLATOW: This is SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour about the Internet impacts public perception to science and scientific research. Our number is 1-800-989-8255. Let's go in the few we have left to Phil(ph) in Rochester, New York - in New Rochelle. I'm sorry. Phil in New Rochelle, welcome. BILL: Yeah. Hi, Ira, only it's Bill(ph). I see a lot of people in blogs that make scientific comments. They're a complete balderdash. I saw one this morning where a fellow said that it was the coldest ever in Alaska, minus Haiti. That proves it there's no such thing as global warming. And you see so many of these things, and they all support each other. And I'm starting to think of it as a superstition. And I wonder - I liked to hear Professor Brossard's comment on that. BROSSARD: Well, I mean, you raise a good point, which is that people will comment on and, you know, and try to portray their opinions about something. And I think these sort of question, what do you do with these kind of comments? And I think what would be important to keep in mind is that in this case, the person who's reporting, the blogger, may have an opportunity by interjecting in the discussion, within the comment and thread, to, you know, bring the discussion to a point where people realize that this is something that shouldn't be taken into account. So I'm - to be honest, like a proponent of the blogger, be more, you know, involved in the moderation by reacting, redeem the comments thread. And I realize that it's also not possible because of the volume of the comments themselves. FLATOW: Good point. BROSSARD: But on the other hand, research shows that discussion does increase learning. So, you know, like if you have a text and people discuss it afterwards, you know, that increase the potential for people to learn about it. So how can we do that in a conservatively way on line? FLATOW: Bora, how do you do the - do you just block the blogger or do you use that, as a Dominique is suggesting, as a teaching moment? ZIVKOVIC: I agree with Dominique completely. And in the piece I wrote last week about this topic, that was kind of the main point I was making, that the most important part of moderation of comments is for the author of the piece to show up. And often just by the fact that the author showed up, the tone changes. People say, oh, this is actually not just a, you know, a bathroom wall. This is actually somebody's place and somebody's watching and moderating and - their discussion and leading the discussion. And suddenly, people tone down. And many people who are coming in just to, you know, troll for ideology careers may decide not to join in because they sense it is a more controlled environment. And then those debates can happen, and it can be very constructive and very instructive and educational for the onlookers. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. That's a good point. Let's go to Derrick(ph) in Fort Myers, Florida. Hi, Derrick. DERRICK: Hi. How are you doing? FLATOW: Hi there. You're on. DERRICK: Hello? FLATOW: Derrick, you're there. Can you hear us? DERRICK: Yeah, I'm here. FLATOW: Turn your radio off. I can hear you. Yeah. Go ahead. DERRICK: Well, I just - I wanted to say that I worked for Detroit Free Press as a writer for 23 years. And we went through the system where we allowed readers to comment on every story. I mean, our names and emails and phone numbers were on the bottom of every story. It got to the point where it was so toxic, the commentary, that we finally switched to a system where they could no longer be anonymous. They had to sign on through a Facebook system. And that got rid, I would say, of 90 some odd percent of the real masochists because a lot of these people, you know, I mean, they're cowards. And they were just looking for a place to sit and throw bombs. And when they could no longer do that, you know, from behind a screen of anonymity, it made a huge change. FLATOW: Interesting. ZIVKOVIC: I would like. . . HAWKS: We. . . ZIVKOVIC: . . . to respond to this, just that it's a very important distinction between anonymous and pseudo-anonymous. BROSSARD: Yeah. ZIVKOVIC: A heading, a consistent pseudonym is very important for people who, maybe because where they work or who they are, would not otherwise be able to inject very important information into the conversation because of the fear of reprisal. On the other hand, I've seen people very proudly writing very noxious things under their own names. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dominique, did you want to jump in there? BROSSARD: Well, I mean, I think the caller brings a good point. I think it is easier for people, you know, like they're not tying up their name to be ruined in their own environment. But I think we should also bring back the discussion to what our piece was trying to show, that it's not - we're not talking about, you know, like outrageous trolling online. We were talking about where do we draw that fine line into, like, what's acceptable or not? And I think, you know, common sense would say, let's get rid of people that are not, like, let's get rid of feelings, let's get rid of comments that are not following the topic of discussion. Like, you know, like, if we're talking about nanotechnology and you have a climate change denier or, you know, comment that shows up. Obviously, we shouldn't leave that and also people that are outrageously rude. But how can we, you know, make sure that we do leave things that are constructive but are not disruptive of the discussion? And that's the thing that I think we need to really ponder as we're developing into this online world. We don't have enough evidence right now to actually say what's the best way to go. We need more research on a whole (unintelligible) crowd of funding, you know, some research that would allow us to develop guidelines that everybody can use. And I think this is really something that we should think about. FLATOW: And you've got the last - and she has the last word today. I'm sorry we have to let it go.

IRA FLATOW, HOST:  This is SCIENCE FRIDAY, I'm Ira Flatow. When you read a news article online, how much attention do you pay to the comments that follow at the bottom? What about how many times the story has been re-tweeted or how many Facebook likes it has? Do you pay attention to those? A recent piece published in the journal Science found that all of these things can influence how readers feel about a topic, even if they don't realize it. So how does the online environment impact the public's perception of science? Can just the tone of the comments sway people's opinions about an article on, say, stem cells, climate change, even nanotechnology? Are comments sections still effective ways to spark discussions, or are they now breeding grounds for misinformation, and we've all seen how online trolls work. In fact, we put this question out this week on our Twitter: Does moderating comments violate freedom of speech? And can such discussion of the question on our website, responses - you can see that discussion, and they were overwhelmingly in favor of moderating comments. That's what our Twitter audience thought when we put that out earlier in the week. So we're going to talk about what some of the pitfalls of communicating science online are, and how can we avoid them and deal with them in the new normal about how science is published online and what's going on there. Let me introduce my guests. Dominique Brossard is lead author of the Science paper, which was titled \"Science, New Media and the Public. \" She is a professor at the Department of Life Science Communication at the University of Madison - University of Wisconsin in Madison, and she joins us from Madison. Welcome to the program. DOMINIQUE BROSSARD: Thank you. FLATOW: You're welcome. Bora Zivkovic is the blog editor at Scientific American and organizer of the ScienceOnline Conference, which is going on right now in Raleigh, North Carolina. He joins us by phone from the conference. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. BORA ZIVKOVIC: Great to be there, thank you. FLATOW: Thank you. John Hawks is a science blogger and associate professor of anthropology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He joins us from Salt Lake City. Welcome to the program. JOHN HAWKS: Thanks. FLATOW: Dr. Brossard, tell us a bit about your piece in Science. Apart from the content of the article itself, what kinds of things did you find that could influence readers' opinions? Tell us what you studied. BROSSARD: Well, we've been interested for quite a long time, let's say two or three years here at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, investigating the effect of the online context for public perception of science. We have noticed that indeed people are moving from traditional outlets to actually rely much more on online environments to find out about science, let's say through searching or, you know, going to blogs and not going to traditional, mainstream newspaper outlets. So the question remained, though: What type of effects do those new environments have, you know, on public perception of science and public understanding of science? And one of the things that we know that are very different in that online environment are those comments that people post on blogs or the potential likes, you know, that people put on their Facebook to show that they appreciate a particular piece or the number of ways people tweet about a particular topic. But however, there is really not much as far as in people evidence showing us how much this impacts how people feel about science. So basically there was a starting point. It's like how can we rely on social science to help us understand how these new media environments will influence the public about, you know, that (unintelligible) science in the United States. And what can we do to actually offer the best possible environment for this audience to interact with the scientific content in a productive way? And the study that you mentioned that called, you know, for a lot of attention around the online environment lately was that particular study that looked at the tone of comments. What happened when people are rude, you know, following a story that otherwise is very well-written? And we chose the topic of nanotechnology because like a lot of new, emerging technology, new scientific topics, this is relatively unknown for the vast majority of the American public. So what happened when you find a story well-written, by a good science writer, that actually is followed by comments that may not be always extremely polite? So if you did a study, randomly assigned people to different conditions, some people saw polite comments, other people saw the same comments but just, you know, with rude language such as idiot, et cetera. And what we found is that people that were exposed to those rude comments tend to become polarized about the issue that was covering the story, which was nanotechnology. So basically just being exposed to rude comments, even if the content of the comments themselves was the same, made people react differently to the content of the story. So the question is therefore: What do we do, right, to encourage better understanding? FLATOW: Do you have a suggestion? BROSSARD: Well, I mean, and that's interesting because, you know, like my colleagues who are practicing bloggers and extremely fruitful doing so, that are on the show tonight, today, can actually tell us what they think. But what we can, you know, basically say is that right now, you know, it's much more the choice of the blogger himself or herself to decide how to manage those comments and not a lot of empirical evidence as far as how to do so. What our study suggests is that indeed even, you know, slightly rude comments because, I mean, we were not even investigating trolling, we were not investigating, you know, how disruptive behavior, which obviously from a common-sense perspective, you know, everybody would take out from their comments thread, right. We're just showing, like, people that were getting a little bit, you know, into the discussion so much as to say you idiot, I think you should think like me, or obviously there are, you know, benefits related to this, you know, this technology. FLATOW: So even the tamer comments were influencing how people thought about the research? BROSSARD: Exactly. So it was - that's the thing, and that's where, you know, when you asked me what we should do, I think obviously we should get rid of anything that's not polite, That doesn't follow civil discourse. And then we should, you know, discuss what does it mean to have a civil discussion online. What are the social norms that we strive to establish in this environment, such as we have social norm, let's say, in - at the dinner table, right, where some things are, you know, implicitly not allowed because it's not something that should be, you know, considered polite. What is a polite, you know, behavior in the online environment? And I think we haven't yet decided what are those social norms. FLATOW: Now we're going to talk about it. That's what we're talking about this hour. I want to get into that and other issues. Dominique Brossard, how do you deal with it? And I know you've been very vocal on the Internet in the last few weeks about - I'm sorry, Bora, how do you deal with it on your website? ZIVKOVIC: Well, my website is hosted on Scientific American. So it is traditional media, which has a reputation and a brand as, you know, a 167-year-old magazine. So I cannot treat it exactly the same as I would me, you know, personal blog, kept completely independently somewhere there. So I need to keep always in mind that our site is an educational site where people come through searches or recommendations to learn about science. And so this kind of discourse in comments is very important for me, and the study was very insightful to me that just the tone of comments can skew how our readers are learning about science because stuff that goes on our site is vetted in some way that it is corrected. It is accurate science. And so the idea that commenters may skew that is something that makes me nervous as an editor of our blogs. FLATOW: So do you believe that they should be moderated, these blogs? ZIVKOVIC: Yes, I think the ideas about comment amelioration have changed over the past, you know, 10 or 15 years, that these things exist online. In the beginning, I think there was the idea that this should be a free forum. And now there are so many free fora out there that I don't think a site like Scientific American should provide a free form for everything and everybody and all kinds of online fights to happen in our comments because I think the free speech applies to the Web as a whole, not to any particular site. And I think the host of the site has to keep in mind what is the goal of the site, what is the reason why the site exists. If it's educational, then these kinds of comments need to go. And it's perfectly OK. It's perfectly legal to do it. So I think we need to have our readers in mind first and act appropriately. FLATOW: John Hawks, you're a science blogger and a scientist, a professor of anthropology. You have definite opinions about this also, don't you? HAWKS: Absolutely. I started blogging nine years ago, and when I started, I didn't have tenure. And so I was very nervous about, you know, putting my opinions out there and having people read them who might evaluate me. And so I sort of developed a voice that allowed me to be able to be critical of scientific research studies without being polarizing. And I think one of the interesting things about what Dominique is finding with online forums is that the scientific literature is sort of like this. You know, it has these interactions. People submit comments to journals. Sometimes they put a lot of fire and personal invective into them, and it has always polarized the kind of work that I'm involved with. Our research is in human evolution and genetics, and there are some big personalities in that field and some strong feelings. And you see people publish letters to the editor, and it just drives you crazy sometimes. FLATOW: So you don't allow any comments on your site. HAWKS: Yeah, I began - I began my site without comments. I could just see that it really took a lot of effort to create a community where you had people able to be confident that they could write what they were thinking and not be trolled and not have a lot of rudeness, you know, put on them. So I began without comments. I experimented from time to time, you know, allowing comments on certain things. And I just have to say it is an enormous amount of work to look through what people are publishing and try to really encourage that community to build. So I admire people who are able to do that online. FLATOW: If they want to troll or get rude, start your own blog is basically what you're saying, stay off of mine. HAWKS: Yeah, I started my own blog. Yeah, exactly. You know, I pay for my server. I have my own independent site. And if somebody wants to criticize me, they're welcome to. If they - if I write something that they don't like, they can send me a letter, and I will be happy to publish their thoughts about it. But the reality is that if somebody just wants to hang around and lob comments on things, I would rather that they spent the effort to build their own reputation that gave people a reason to listen to what they had to say. FLATOW: All right, we'll take a short break, we'll come back and talk lots more about this. I'm sure you have a lot of questions. My guests are Dominique Brossard, Bora Zivkovic and John Hawks. Stay with us. We'll be right back after this break. Don't go away. 1-800-989-8255 is our number, and you can tweet us @scifri, @-S-C-I-F-R-I. I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FLATOW: This is SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour about the impact of the Internet and bloggers and commentaries on how the public perceives science. My guests are Dominique Brossard, professor in the Department of Life Sciences - Life Sciences Communication at the University of Wisconsin in Madison; Bora Zivkovic, blog editor at Scientific American and organizer of the ScienceOnline Conference that's going on this week; John Hawks, science blogger, associate professor of anthropology at the  University of Wisconsin in Madison. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. Does science, technology, health, medicine occupy a special niche in reporting and the way that commentaries and commenting should be handled on a website, as opposed to entertainment, even politics? You know people are going to badmouth and do all kinds of stuff there, but it might be - and that doesn't matter on those kinds of sites. Does it matter more, Bora, on a science site, where the research itself, if I read Dominique's research - her file, her piece that she published - is actually distorted, gets to be distorted by listening to the commentaries? ZIVKOVIC: I agree. Maybe it's my bias because I come from science, and I'm now in the media. I think that when it comes to science, health and technology, this is less the matter of opinion and more or less of, well, what are the data saying about it. So I think the - kind of the he-said-she-said type of journalism is probably the least prominent now in science reporting, compared to, you know, political or others - but also because science bloggers bring expertise. Many of them are working scientists or used to be working scientists. They are kind of the area of reporting or area in the media which was the first to, kind of, breach that wall, you know, the old war between journalism bloggers. I think journalism bloggers are now one and the same and working together and teaching each other and learning from each other and, kind of, together building this new ecosystem for online media reporting. And, you know, we are here today at NC State campus with 450 people who are on the cutting edge of that, and it's really hard to say who is a blogger, who is a journalist, who is something else. Everybody is wearing multiple hats and seeing the things from all the angles. So I think the science writers and journalists and science bloggers are - have been working together now for several years to improve the overall level and quality of science coverage, online and in other outlets. And one of the first things to go is to assign equal - let's say an equal truth value to all the opinions that are out there, because there are data that support a particular statement and no data that are supporting the opposite statement. So why let the opposite statement even go there. That can be in the politics section or when you're discussing ideology or why people believe weird things. But when you're straight-out science reporting, there's really no need to include or allow inclusion of opinions that are completely unscientific. FLATOW: But we live in an age, at least in the United States, where some people, now, in the last few years, possibly politically oriented, say that, you know, science is just another matter of opinion, you know. ZIVKOVIC: Yeah, that's their opinion. That doesn't mean that opinion is correct, either. Because unlike other opinions, scientific opinion has to be backed up by empirical information, by empirical data, and it's a self-correcting - at least long-term - self-correcting endeavor. So an individual scientist may have biases or opinions, but science as a whole is a way of knowledge that actually is trying to represent nature as it really is. FLATOW: John Hawks, how do you feel about this? HAWKS: You know, I'm an American. I'm skeptical of people that have a lot of power. I don't think that we are spending our science dollars in the most efficient way in lots of respects. But I understand, as a scientist, that skepticism is important to science. And you have to play at a very high level of knowledge, of understanding what data are, of understanding what scientific methods are and how they work in order to make scientific progress. There is a reason why we attribute an authority to scientists who have spent the time to understand an issue and are reporting to the best of their ability the data that they see relative to that issue. And I think that there's a misunderstanding of science, that somehow scientists are human - that's true - but then that somehow makes science just a matter of their opinion. In fact, their opinion can't last in science unless it comports with what the data are showing us. And. . . FLATOW: Let me - I'm sorry. BROSSARD: Can. . . ? FLATOW: Go ahead, Dominique. BROSSARD: Yes, so just to represent it again, I'm coming from a social science perspective that look at how scientific information is processed, by say, the (unintelligible). And I think we need to keep in mind that no - to some extent no reporting is unbiased. I mean, no - like everything that is written about science, or anything else, will be processed by audiences in the context of their own value predisposition, the context of what we call the perceptual filter that help them make sense of that information. So when the Scientific American blogs about a particular issue, the readers will interpret the information, even if it's presented in the most objective possible way, in light of what they already have stored in their memory that helps them make sense of that information. So when we get back to what we want to accomplish with scientific reporting, which I think is at the core of the matter here. If we want to enlighten, you know, let's say, the vast majority of the American public - and you all mentioned, and some people in the United States may think that scientists, you know, information is just an opinion - well, if you want to change this, my question is how do we do that. And what I'm concerned about is that by that heavy emphasis on science blogging by scientists, that at the end of the day will mostly be read by a population of people that are already interested in science, that already are, you know, the audience that doesn't have that, let's say, that, you know, like, subjective view of science. Are we missing the boat, to some extent? The mainstream news outlet, where you have science that's reported in the middle of other type of issues, may be the way to reach that - those audiences. And our research has shown that indeed, the people that do go to the Internet to look for information about science, tend to be more educated, and slightly more males do so, than the general audience. So, you know, like on the one hand, indeed, you know, like science bloggers are doing a great job. They have their blogs. They try to be as, you know, respectful of science as an enterprise as possible. But on the other hand, are we still replacing on the Internet, you know, what we have seen happen before with science museums, for example, science museums where you have already interested audiences that go there, you know, to find out more about science. But basically they are not the one who would need it the most. FLATOW: Let's go the phones, 1-800-989-8255. Nina(ph) in Santa Cruz, hi Nina. NINA: Hi there, good morning. I'd like to ask the panel of what their opinion of what they think about Yelp? Yelp is a little different in that they mostly make money off of the negative review. Because when you get a negative review as a business, you have to sort of rally the troops, as it were. You have to get everybody from your mom and your brother, your customers to respond to the negative reviews because ordinarily, people don't write a good reviews. They want to go someplace to complain. You know, Yelp is a giant complaint board. So I'm wondering what your panel thinks about this conflict of interest and how it's affecting online reviews. FLATOW: All right, thanks for calling, Nina. That brings us - I'm glad Nina brought that up. She was reading my mind because I was reading today that Google has submitted an antitrust proposal to the EU because Google has been sued a couple of times - I think, at least once by the United States, it's dropped that suit and won that suit, Google did - about the fact that they massage - and maybe Yelp does the same thing - the accusation that when you Google something, they massage the kind of information they want to send you back for their own purposes. And you may not find what you're looking for. HAWKS: That's what I found very interesting about Dominique's publication is that they really thought about the way that how we find information online, how Google is giving us search results, is changing the way that people are actually learning about scientific topics. And I know that people hit my blog from Google, and it's completely things that I would never predict that I turn out to be what they find. And sometimes, the things that I'm most committed to, that I'm really the world expert on, I'm not on the top page of Google rankings. So it is really becoming a matter of algorithms how we discover things. BROSSARD: Yeah, exactly, John, you couldn't have put it better, and this is something we saw most particularly in the context of nanotechnology when we try - when we tracked the keywords that people were using to search, you know, the issue of nanotechnology. And then, you know, we looked at the content they were likely to find, and we saw that, indeed, they were most likely to find content really to help even if at the start - as a starting point, they were looking for something (unintelligible) the nanotechnology and the environment. So sophisticated algorithm that are based on volume of keyword searchers that are based on things like how often, you know, a specific story is forward through email, how many links you have on your website, et cetera. And honestly, we - hard to have access to the actual algorithm. We try to do that because it's constantly revisited to be able to reflect, you know, basically try to guess what people are looking for. And I think in the context of science, this is really problematic, because let's say going back to that issue of nanotechnology, it could be any issue, even evolution if you wanted to be more broader and, you know, something that more social implications right now. But basically, we may give like a false perception of all the dimensions that can be attached to an issue by, you know, like letting those searchers govern to some extent the public discourse. It seems that basically, you know, people like you, John and Bora, that are doing the best you can to enlighten the public with really sound information about science. You have less power, let's say, than the algorithm behind Google. FLATOW: Yeah. That's for sure. Let's go to Paul in Panama City, Florida. Hi, Paul. PAUL: Hey. Thanks for taking my call. FLATOW: Go ahead. PAUL: I just wanted to say I rarely comment on any pieces that I read. But in my general Internet usage, if I'm not specifically researching something, when I come across a video or a piece that has the comments disabled, I just make it a habit, you know, eight or nine times out of 10 I just ignore it, and there's two reasons for it. First, I'm an adult, you know, I'm able to discern the intentions of the trolls and people who oppose whatever they're commenting on. And, you know, that can help me make my own decision. The second, and more importantly, if you're willing to post an opinion, a belief, a statement, work, research, whatever, and you're not willing to discuss it, there's something in that that's visceral that just makes me not want to engage. And, you know, it's hard to explain but. . . FLATOW: Well, let me have you talk. . . PAUL: . . . what sounds like (unintelligible). FLATOW: Well, let me have you talk to John Hawks who doesn't allow anybody to comment on his. . . (LAUGHTER) FLATOW: . . . website. John? HAWKS: Well, I completely understand that attitude. You know, I want to see what the diversity of people think, but there's a lot of information sources out there where you can find out that diversity and (unintelligible). (LAUGHTER) PAUL: Right. When I'm looking for - when I'm looking specifically at researching, I'll ignore that rule. But I mean your point earlier about trolls leaching off the reputations of, you know, the people they're commenting against, I mean that's very well taken. But I really believe that most people are intelligent enough to look past the trolls and to the deeper issue. FLATOW: Well, we all hope so, Paul. (LAUGHTER) FLATOW: Thank you very much. PAUL: Thank you. FLATOW: Our number, 1-800-989-8255. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. I'm Ira Flatow here with Dominique Brossard, Bora Zivkovic and John Hawks. You can also tweet us, @scifri, S-C-I-F-R-I. I'm going to read a couple of the tweets that came in. CGino(ph) says: When it comes to science and tech, it's less a matter of an opinion than when it comes to - I imagine - other things. All kinds of stuff like that. Can I ask the panel about crowd funding for research? What do we think about that? Crowd funding for research. ZIVKOVIC: I really, really like this idea, especially with the new - kind of new world of science funding where the reduction of funds, there's a lot of researchers looking for money and less and less money for it. So I'm looking with great interest at all the new endeavors for people for doing crowd funding. There's three or four organizations or companies now that are organizing or coordinating crowd funding. For now, those are not going to be $5 million grants. People are asking for, you know, several thousand dollars for small projects that can be pilot projects that can then be turned into bigger grants for NIH or NSF funding. But what I find very interesting about it is in order to crowd fund even, you know, several hundred dollars, one has to actually engage with potential donors which are the anonymous public. So you can't just write the grant proposal or, you know, make a video and put it online and hope that people will drop, you know, $5 for your project. You have to actually actively engage with them in order to sell them on the idea that they should fund your project. You have to promise them that once you get funded and do the project, they'll be the first to know, maybe get something extra out of it for some extra reputation for funding a project that worked out well. So it's a very, very nascent field. It really started just within the last year or two. It's very, very interesting to watch how that is going to change the way researchers are interacting with the public if the public is directly funding them from their own pockets out of their own choices what they want to fund. FLATOW: Quick question before we go to the break from James(ph) in Phoenix. Hi, James. Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my call. Mm-hmm. JAMES: I understand the opposition, the comments and posts, and both sides are very interesting. However, my question about bad info. I've been doing some research on vaccinations, and it seems I cannot find a story on that, where there's somebody trying to say that, you know, they've just proven vaccine, autism today where conversations don't take that corner. So this essentially becomes a political debate, not related to science. I'm wondering if what the panel thoughts were on some kind of editorial discretion and the likes. FLATOW: How would the. . . ZIVKOVIC: I would say it really depends on the site. And there are bloggers who focus on this particular issue, and they actually provide a forum for discussing this and providing all the necessary information to counter those claims. A site like Scientific America has to be much more careful about it because all the comments are - that are published on Scientific American are published on Scientific American. So it is as if we did it, so we have to be a little bit more careful what kind of information to allow and then how to counter it the best way so people - the 90 percent who never comment, the onlookers, the readers get the right message in the end and I understand that people are coming to every news piece with their own preconception. . . FLATOW: All right ZIVKOVIC: . . . with their own worldviews. But over time, people do change their minds. Nobody is changing their mind immediately. FLATOW: All right, Bora. I got to interrupt though. We'll take a break and we'll pick this up right after the break. So stay with us. We'll be right back. I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FLATOW: This is SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour about the Internet impacts public perception to science and scientific research. Our number is 1-800-989-8255. Let's go in the few we have left to Phil(ph) in Rochester, New York - in New Rochelle. I'm sorry. Phil in New Rochelle, welcome. BILL: Yeah. Hi, Ira, only it's Bill(ph). I see a lot of people in blogs that make scientific comments. They're a complete balderdash. I saw one this morning where a fellow said that it was the coldest ever in Alaska, minus Haiti. That proves it there's no such thing as global warming. And you see so many of these things, and they all support each other. And I'm starting to think of it as a superstition. And I wonder - I liked to hear Professor Brossard's comment on that. BROSSARD: Well, I mean, you raise a good point, which is that people will comment on and, you know, and try to portray their opinions about something. And I think these sort of question, what do you do with these kind of comments? And I think what would be important to keep in mind is that in this case, the person who's reporting, the blogger, may have an opportunity by interjecting in the discussion, within the comment and thread, to, you know, bring the discussion to a point where people realize that this is something that shouldn't be taken into account. So I'm - to be honest, like a proponent of the blogger, be more, you know, involved in the moderation by reacting, redeem the comments thread. And I realize that it's also not possible because of the volume of the comments themselves. FLATOW: Good point. BROSSARD: But on the other hand, research shows that discussion does increase learning. So, you know, like if you have a text and people discuss it afterwards, you know, that increase the potential for people to learn about it. So how can we do that in a conservatively way on line? FLATOW: Bora, how do you do the - do you just block the blogger or do you use that, as a Dominique is suggesting, as a teaching moment? ZIVKOVIC: I agree with Dominique completely. And in the piece I wrote last week about this topic, that was kind of the main point I was making, that the most important part of moderation of comments is for the author of the piece to show up. And often just by the fact that the author showed up, the tone changes. People say, oh, this is actually not just a, you know, a bathroom wall. This is actually somebody's place and somebody's watching and moderating and - their discussion and leading the discussion. And suddenly, people tone down. And many people who are coming in just to, you know, troll for ideology careers may decide not to join in because they sense it is a more controlled environment. And then those debates can happen, and it can be very constructive and very instructive and educational for the onlookers. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. That's a good point. Let's go to Derrick(ph) in Fort Myers, Florida. Hi, Derrick. DERRICK: Hi. How are you doing? FLATOW: Hi there. You're on. DERRICK: Hello? FLATOW: Derrick, you're there. Can you hear us? DERRICK: Yeah, I'm here. FLATOW: Turn your radio off. I can hear you. Yeah. Go ahead. DERRICK: Well, I just - I wanted to say that I worked for Detroit Free Press as a writer for 23 years. And we went through the system where we allowed readers to comment on every story. I mean, our names and emails and phone numbers were on the bottom of every story. It got to the point where it was so toxic, the commentary, that we finally switched to a system where they could no longer be anonymous. They had to sign on through a Facebook system. And that got rid, I would say, of 90 some odd percent of the real masochists because a lot of these people, you know, I mean, they're cowards. And they were just looking for a place to sit and throw bombs. And when they could no longer do that, you know, from behind a screen of anonymity, it made a huge change. FLATOW: Interesting. ZIVKOVIC: I would like. . . HAWKS: We. . . ZIVKOVIC: . . . to respond to this, just that it's a very important distinction between anonymous and pseudo-anonymous. BROSSARD: Yeah. ZIVKOVIC: A heading, a consistent pseudonym is very important for people who, maybe because where they work or who they are, would not otherwise be able to inject very important information into the conversation because of the fear of reprisal. On the other hand, I've seen people very proudly writing very noxious things under their own names. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dominique, did you want to jump in there? BROSSARD: Well, I mean, I think the caller brings a good point. I think it is easier for people, you know, like they're not tying up their name to be ruined in their own environment. But I think we should also bring back the discussion to what our piece was trying to show, that it's not - we're not talking about, you know, like outrageous trolling online. We were talking about where do we draw that fine line into, like, what's acceptable or not? And I think, you know, common sense would say, let's get rid of people that are not, like, let's get rid of feelings, let's get rid of comments that are not following the topic of discussion. Like, you know, like, if we're talking about nanotechnology and you have a climate change denier or, you know, comment that shows up. Obviously, we shouldn't leave that and also people that are outrageously rude. But how can we, you know, make sure that we do leave things that are constructive but are not disruptive of the discussion? And that's the thing that I think we need to really ponder as we're developing into this online world. We don't have enough evidence right now to actually say what's the best way to go. We need more research on a whole (unintelligible) crowd of funding, you know, some research that would allow us to develop guidelines that everybody can use. And I think this is really something that we should think about. FLATOW: And you've got the last - and she has the last word today. I'm sorry we have to let it go. Dominique Brossard is professor in the department of life science communications at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. Bora Zivkovic is the blog editor at Scientific American and the organizer of the ScienceOnline conference, big conference which are going on right now in Raleigh, North Carolina. Bora writes at A Blog Around The Clock. And John Hawks is a science blogger and associate professor of anthropology at the University of Wisconsin in Madison.

President Obama talks about both very often. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: We have doubled our use of renewable energy and thousands of Americans have jobs today building wind turbines and long-lasting batteries. SIEGEL: Well, last week, I visited a Massachusetts factory that doesn't build wind turbines or batteries, but it does make a product that is arguably a force for sustainability. Nearly 40 Americans assemble that product and it's an interesting case study in innovation. It's a hand dryer. It's made by Excel Dryer of East Longmeadow, Massachusetts, a company that Denis Gagnon bought in the 1990s. By 1997, Gagnon knew that Excel had a problem. DENIS GAGNON: We had an experienced and dedicated workforce. We built a quality product. We had an excellent reputation for customer service and we had a product that people hated to use. SIEGEL: Drying your hands took 35 to 40 seconds. By that time, lots of people with wet hands had either wiped them on their clothes or grabbed a paper towel. Well, luckily for Gagnon, a firm called Invent Resources promised a marriage made if not in heaven, at least within Massachusetts. RICHARD PAVELLE: We called ourselves Invention Upon Demand. SIEGEL: Richard Pavelle was one of four scientists, three of them out of MIT, men who had done serious physics and applied mathematics who would work with companies on ideas for new products, all kinds of products. By the '90s, Pavelle had patented a putter with a big sweet spot. His idea for a hair dryer that blew dry air had failed to win over Conair. So he had a related idea, a dry air hand dryer. PAVELLE: It's clear that the use of very dry air can absorb more moisture than the ambient air. And the use of shaped nozzles to better focus an air stream can help in the drying of hands and use in. . . SIEGEL: Pavelle, the scientist-turned-inventor, phoned Gagnon, the entrepreneur. GAGNON: It was clear in my mind that the hand dryer of the 21st century better dry your hands quickly. And if they could figure out a way to get there, I was all for proceeding. SIEGEL: Mind you, Richard Pavelle and his colleagues had already run their idea for a faster hand dryer past World Dryer, which was the colossus in the field, the GM of hand dryers, and they'd been rejected. But when they invited Denis Gagnon to a brainstorming session, the Excel owner accepted. GAGNON: And they would be at one after another at the chalkboard screaming at each other in Yiddish and arguing how to design this or do that. And just left there thinking, you know what? These guys are probably smart enough to help us figure out a way to do this. SIEGEL: The scientists determined that the old hand dryers wasted 90 percent of the energy going into them. A new hand dryer had to be more efficient. Excel's own Tom Koetsch went to the milling machine and cut prototype after prototype. Richard Pavelle recalls that the problem was balancing the unbearable noise of the machine against its drying power. How fast could you dry your hands with a machine that didn't make you flee the washroom deafened by the experience? PAVELLE: We were shooting for 10 seconds. SIEGEL: Ten seconds to dry your hands. PAVELLE: That was our goal. I don't think we ever achieved that goal, but we got down to certainly under 15 seconds. SIEGEL: After three and a half years, Excel got it down to 12 seconds. Denis Gagnon had borrowed against his home and his life insurance, from associates and relatives. He was tapped out at the bank. But his risk had paid off. His company had a revolutionary machine in the works, the Xlerator, which Excel took to trade shows. GAGNON: Literally, I had to coax people out of the aisles to come try our hand dryers. I hate hand dryers. Why do I want to try your stupid hand dryer for? So we'd get them up to the Xlerator and they'd put their hands under and you could see the expression in their face. There was a real wow factor to it. It's like, oh, this works. SIEGEL: It may still have been loud, but it actually dried your hands. Gagnon says sales for the family-owned company have gone up more than 10 percent every year for the past decade. In East Longmeadow, 38 people assemble the dryers in a remarkably un-automated plant. GAGNON: What we're doing here, we're making our optic sensor. SIEGEL: The circuit boards are attached by workers armed with power screwdrivers. Denis Gagnon says the components and machinery they use are to the greatest extent possible American. Today, Excel competes with other hand dryer manufacturers. Dyson, the British vacuum cleaner company, followed Excel with the Airblade. That's the dryer that you dip your hands into. World Dryer eventually came out with its own high-speed hand dryer. And there are others. But the real competition remains, paper towels. George Campbell, who used to work for Dyson, now sells hand dryers of all brands through his Chicago company NetDryers. Using government data, they tried to measure the potential market for hand dryers. GEORGE CAMPBELL: And we came up with a number that there's roughly 30 million bathrooms away from home in the United States - ballpark, give or take. Paper towels alone, without hand dryers, are probably in around 90 to 95 percent of those bathrooms. SIEGEL: That would mean that there are well over 25 million bathrooms that are potential hand dryer installations. The argument for the product is twofold, as Campbell tells it. First, it's cheap. Hand dryers are low maintenance machines and they don't require someone to stock clean towels and cart away used ones. An Xlerator is especially cheap; the basic model costs all of $400. Second is the sustainability argument. That 12 seconds of drying time uses some electricity. But Campbell quotes research from MIT - research the Dyson actually commissioned - that makes paper towels out to be the real energy guzzlers. CAMPBELL: If you measure the weight of the carbon it takes to make the paper - manufacture it, deliver it with the vehicles back and forth, dispose of it by vehicles back and forth - the actual weight of the carbon footprint of a paper towel is four times the weight of the towel itself. SIEGEL: So, the hand dryer makers claimed to be the rare manufacturers who are both green and cheap. And they have big designs on what Campbell calls The Bathroom Away From Home. Back at Excel's plant in Massachusetts, Denis Gagnon's son, and Excel Vice President Bill Gagnon, treated me to a glimpse of the future. BILL GAGNON: OK. Well, you're going to see something that not a lot of people have seen back here. SIEGEL: In their R&D room, there's a model of the sink that made its debut before Christmas. It's in the ladies' room near the shoe department of the flagship Macy's in Manhattan. It's a trough. And at each position there are what appeared to be three nozzles. Put your hands under the one on the left and a sensor dispenses soap. The one in the middle dispenses water the same way. And on the right is the nozzle of the Xlerator, the rest of it is tucked underneath out of sight(SOUNDBITE OF HAND DRYER)SIEGEL: Oh. GAGNON: So you get a personalized, proper hand washing without having to move. SIEGEL: There are some who argue against hand dryers. The paper towel industry points to studies that find that they blow germs around. The hand dryer people cite a Mayo Clinic study that suggests the question of germs is answered by how you wash, not how you dry. As I asked Campbell, there's also the fact that when I spilled coffee on my desk, I can't say: Help, bring me the hand dryer. And Campbell told me what he says he tells prospective buyers of higher dryers. GAGNON: They don't open a door, shut a sink, clean your face, dry a spill. They're had dryers. That's what they do. They're now doing it well. And they're doing it with low energy, and they're doing it in a way that people - a lot of people do enjoy. SIEGEL: So here's a question about hand dryers. If an American entrepreneur, an American shop of inventors, and a skilled American workforce can think up and manufacture a very successful appliance - one that is globally competitive, by the way. Excel says it has 800 Xlerators at London's Heathrow airport alone. Why is it that the motor inside the Xlerator, perhaps not the brains, but the guts of the thing is made in Asia? We'll address that question tomorrow. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: You're listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News.

PETER KENYON, BYLINE: When the ayatollah got a Facebook page in mid-December, Iranians sat up and blinked. Some thought it was a fake, finding it hard to believe that Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei would be using a technology that his own government blocks. A State Department spokeswoman skeptically wondered how many likes it would attract. But some of Khamenei's supporters quickly rallied behind the move, which first came to light in a reference on - you guessed it - the ayatollah's Twitter account. For a time, Iran's millions of computer users allowed themselves to hope that it might lead to an unblocking of Facebook and other social media sites. Not so. They still have to pick the government's cyber locks to access the latest thoughts from their own leader. Of course, that's not the only site Iranians want to visit, and that's what has the authorities worried. After security forces crushed massive street protests following the controversial 2009 elections, activists took their dissent to the virtual world where they now find themselves under increasingly aggressive attack. REZA GHAZI NOURI: The fight in the online space is not over. KENYON: Reza Ghazi Nouri is an activist who fled to Turkey when he was threatened with years in prison for his support of pro-reform candidates. His research into Iran's Internet and social networking communities shows the increasing ability of government cyber police units to learn the identities of online writers, some of whom are then arrested, interrogated and tortured. One brutal example came last November. A blogger named Sattar Beheshti was arrested for critical comments posted on Facebook. His death in custody after allegedly being tortured provoked international condemnation. Still, Nouri believes it had the desired chilling effect. NOURI: Because when you torture somebody to death for blogging and writing in Facebook, you're not just killing him, you're oppressing and frightening millions of other people. KENYON: Security analyst Theodore Karasik at the Dubai-based Institute for Near East and Gulf Military Analysis says after being caught off guard by the huge protests of 2009, the government has gotten much more savvy at stifling dissent online as well as in the streets. THEODORE KARASIK: It's not unusual for someone to get followed or to conduct their Internet or social media sessions in another house or another location that they think is secure when in fact it really isn't. Indeed, there is a crackdown ongoing and will probably even get worse with the development of an Iran-only Internet. KENYON: Technology analysts have debated Tehran's effort to seal off the country from the World Wide Web. Karasik sides with those who believe it can be done, while others doubt that a hermetic cyber seal could be maintained. There are tools, such as VPN's, or virtual private networks, that allow Iranians to disguise their computer's identity. But according to activist Reza Nouri, some of the cheapest VPN's on the Iranian market are supplied by the revolutionary guard itself and provide no protection whatsoever. The crucial obstacle at the moment, he says, is organizing. NOURI: The problem is that you can have safe communications with two, three or four people. But when you try to organize an event, you have to communicate with thousands of people. So that's not working. KENYON: The increased pressure has caused many opposition supporters to deactivate their Facebook accounts. Still, the authorities are preparing for a spike in activism as the June presidential contest approaches. Nouri says if the international community really wants to help pro-democracy forces in Iran, it should invest in internet freedom there. Meanwhile, the Ayatollah's Facebook page seems to be thriving. As of late January it had been liked nearly 30,000 times. Peter Kenyon, NPR News, Istanbul. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  Iran has one of the highest percentages of Internet access in the Middle East.

I'm Audie Cornish. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: I'm Robert Siegel. And it's time now for All Tech Considered. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SIEGEL: First up, our look ahead at the week's tech news, and we're going to focus on Colorado, where lawmakers will begin debating a bill that would allow driverless cars in the state. NPR's Laura Sydell joins me now to talk about it. And, Laura, Colorado is one of several states to take up legislation on driverless cars. Why now? LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE: Well, Google has been a leader on this one. And the company actually built a prototype and has been pushing lawmakers around the country to make it possible to legally take these cars on the road. California was the first to take up legislation on this, but we also have Nevada and Florida. SIEGEL: But aren't we still many years away from a viable driverless car? SYDELL: In fact, Google has actually said these cars are about a decade away from really being affordable and ready for the average consumer. I should note that some form of driverless car was first predicted in 1940, Robert. However, Google is really putting a lot of energy, research and money into it. So in this instance, we may be closer than we were in 1940. SIEGEL: Well, why is Google so invested in this? SYDELL: Good question. There's some speculation that Google actually wants to build cars and get into the car business. But if you ask Google, it says, hey, we're trying to do good for humanity. And the idea of a driverless car may make some of us a little squeamish, i. e. , me. The truth is that they may actually be much safer than having you or me behind the wheel. According to most surveys, the vast majority - and I'm talking more than 90 percent of all accidents are caused by human error. A car driven by a computer will have, shall we say, much better access to all the information about traffic that our brains can't process. So it'll be able to carefully measure how close you are to the car in front of you and behind you. The National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration is actually planning to do more research on this, but the head of the agency, David Strickland, says that these cars hold great promise for reduced crashes. SIEGEL: Now, would the Colorado law, say, let you actually therefore text and drive at the same time since the car is doing the driving? SYDELL: Yes. SIEGEL: Yeah. SYDELL: Yes. You can do it legally, at least according to The Denver Post. They've reported that the Colorado law would indeed allow you to text while you let your car do the driving. And to be clear, though, you will still have to have a license. SIEGEL: This could be terrible. Could you watch television while you're driving instead of being limited to radio? SYDELL: Yeah, you're right. It could be terrible. In fact, I think you could. SIEGEL: Is Google the only company that's actually working on driverless cars this seriously? SYDELL: No, no. Actually in the past year, for example, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Audi and Toyota debuted their newest autonomous cars, and the Audi model had the ability to park itself inside a multi-storey garage. But I think what you're going to see is degrees of computer control of our cars. But the truth is, every major auto manufacturer is currently working on some version of a driverless car. SIEGEL: OK.

I'm Michel Martin. Coming up, millions of Americans sat down to watch the Super Bowl last night and you can admit it. We know you wanted to see the ads. We'll be checking in with TV critic Eric Deggans about the ads that hit or missed or pushed some people's buttons, not in a good way. That's coming up. But first, today we begin a series to observe Black History Month, and this year we decided to speak with African-Americans on the cutting edge. For our series this month we are going to speak with innovators who have excelled in science, technology, engineering and math, the so-called stem fields, and we begin today with pilot and educator Barrington Irving. He set a world record in 2007 at the age of 23. He was both the youngest person and the first black man to fly around the world alone. Here he is talking about that trip at a 2011 TED conference in Miami. BARRINGTON IRVING: My airplane, due to a downdraft, descended from 20,000 feet to 9,200 feet. Now, two things happened in that moment. The first thing that happened was, of course, I did the right thing. I added full power, was able to climb out. The second thing that happened in that moment was that I needed an extra set of underwear. MARTIN: Now, at the ripe old age of 29, he has recently been recognized by National Geographic as an emerging explorer. His latest mission is building a flying classroom to give kids the experience of seeing mathematics in action. And Barrington Irving joins us now from Miami member station WLRN. Welcome. Thanks so much for joining us. IRVING: Oh man, I'm just so excited to be on this with you. MARTIN: Well, thank you. Let's just start with the idea and then you can talk about the inspiration to do what you did. IRVING: Well, my parents. . . MARTIN: You didn't have a private plane in the driveway? IRVING: Oh, no. We weren't blessed with a private plane in the driveway. We certainly came from humble beginnings. Family moved here from Jamaica at the age of six. My introduction to aviation was actually random. My parents had a small Bible book store and one day during off season while I was playing football, this gentleman walks into the store dressed in this pilot's uniform and says to me, hey, son, have you ever thought about becoming a pilot? And I immediately just said to him, I don't think I'm smart enough to do it. And he then said to me, oh, you know, if I can do it, you can do it. Then I asked him how much money he made and after he answered that question, I took an interest in aviation and interest turned into passion and here I am today. MARTIN: That's all you needed to hear, huh? IRVING: Yeah. MARTIN: Well, you know, flying can be quite expensive. No disrespect to the military, but that's one reason why a number of people join the military, but you didn't want to wait for that. In fact, you weren't even old enough to join the military at a time when you started trying to learn how to fly. How did you do it? IRVING: I purchased - I saved up my lunch money and skipped out on meals. My parents didn't know this. They would kill me. But was able to buy a $40 software made by Microsoft Flight Simulator and on that software, although it was virtual - man, I was able to fly anywhere in the world and simulate certain weather conditions, and that really kept my interest for quite some time until I graduated high school and was able to work hard and afford flight lessons. MARTIN: How did you actually figure out where to go to get flight lessons? IRVING: Actually, you'll be amazed at a number of resources out there, as it relates to how to get involved in flight training. For me, it's kind of funny. I'll never forget. We were just so poor and it's kind of embarrassing to say, but I'll say it, anyway. There was a company who had a free six month magazine subscription, you know, and it really talks about aviation and different career opportunities, and I couldn't afford, you know, anything beyond six months. So the first six months, my name was Barrington Irving and then the next six months it was Irving Barrington and then six months after that it was something else. But, you know, I was just hungry. You know, I was hungry to learn and I was willing to work hard. MARTIN: How did the idea of flying solo around the world take hold? IRVING: When I turned 21 years of age, as a black man that really meant something to me. And I'll never forget asking myself the question, what's one thing I can do, whether I live or die, that would be worth something? And I'll never forget. The idea hit me of, you know, what if I did a flight around the world? And the idea was great, but the next two and a half years I faced rejection after rejection and my mental perspective honestly was - what do I have to lose? I had plenty of friends who didn't make it or they got locked up. It's kind of interesting, you know, and to this day and age I wear a brown flight suit and I've seen others in brown suits, you know, that says Miami Dade County Corrections Department, so it's - for me, in wanting to fly around the world, it was just solely to inspire others. MARTIN: The fact is it took you, you know, two and a half years. You faced more than 50 rejections for sponsorships before you were finally able to convince several manufacturers to donate individual components. You took off - if I have this right - with - I'm not laughing. It's just hard to envision, because I'm a mother too, and I'm thinking how I would feel if this was my son. No weather radar, no de-icing system, and $30 in your pocket. IRVING: Yup. MARTIN: And when you landed, what did you see? IRVING: I come back and land and I just literally see thousands of people at the airport waving banners and signs and congratulating me, and even the ones who tried to discourage me or I knew they were expecting me to come back in a casket - fighting to shake my hand and to congratulate me. But what stuck out to me even more was just the amount of students that we had following me online and blogging (unintelligible) which was over 300,000 kids. And you know, I'll never forget that moment. When I departed out of Miami, I only had $30 in my pocket and I'm reading banners and signs that says, Go Barrington Go, and I'm wondering to myself, where am I going? I only have $30 in my pocket, but sure enough, sure enough, by the time I made my first stop, Miami fundraised close to $100,000 and the further I kept on going, the more money was raised. MARTIN: Well, what are you up to now? What are you trying to do now? You've got a number of educational programs that you are involved in. Tell me a little bit about those. IRVING: Yeah. So the past few years for me since flying around the world have certainly been interesting. I've pretty much transitioned from being a pilot to also becoming an educator, and one of the first projects I tested was our build and soar program, where we challenge 60 kids from failing high schools in Miami to build an aircraft from scratch, and not only build it from scratch but I put my life on the line to fly it for its first flight. A number of those students have gone on to college. A number of them have gotten degrees in various fields. I mean there's one young lady, Baccari, who - at the time of that project, she couldn't point out a sixteenth of an inch on a ruler and now she is on a full scholarship as a math major at Duke University. MARTIN: Tell me about the flying classroom. IRVING: We're creating a real life magic school bus by transforming a $5 million private aircraft donated by the Beechcraft Corporation into the world's first flying classroom. So what does that mean? MARTIN: Hold on. For people who aren't familiar with - who don't have kids, the magic school bus is a series of books where the school bus magically takes kids on all kinds of adventures where they understand, you know, things like the rain forest, the core of the Earth, the environment, stuff like that. IRVING: Yeah. And. . . MARTIN: And this is a real life one. IRVING: Yeah. Now we've figured out a way to do it in real life, where we will utilize this flying aircraft and be able to not only communicate with classrooms from the air, but we're traveling all seven continents, where we'll conduct various expeditions. It could be around geothermal energy, biodiversity, innovations in technology, but we're doing it in a way where students actually control the results of every mission. From the meals I eat to the experiments that's conducted and the data and research that's collected, it's all done by the students virtually, and I'm just fulfilling the actions that they choose. MARTIN: And when will this start? IRVING: This will start September of 2014 and we're just very excited to be able to collaborate with so many individuals and corporations to create Classroom in the Sky. MARTIN: What do you think this means? What do you think is the lesson here? IRVING: It's interesting because the problem that we face in this country as it relates to STEMs - you know, science, technology, engineering and math - is a national problem. We need as many bodies that we can find to become the next leaders in those areas. And I found working with all types of students, this nation faces an even bigger problem. Our problem is the students of today are simply unmotivated, regardless of background or economic status, and I think what we're doing in education - we want to be the best, but we're afraid to challenge our kids to be the best. And that's where I put forth with action with some of the projects that we're doing. I don't say we're going to do something and expect our students to fail. Failure certainly isn't an option, whether it's building a plane or having kids as young as eight years old building a car faster than a Ferrari. We have to put tangible challenges with real finish lines in front of these kids' faces because when a child has the opportunity to do those types of projects or anything hands-on or skills-based, they're not looking at - oh, I have to learn the math and science and algebra and chemistry and physics and so forth behind doing some of these things. They're looking at the finish line. MARTIN: Barrington Irving is a pilot and educator who set a world record as the youngest person and the first black man to fly around the world alone. He spoke with us from WLRN in Miami. Barrington Irving, thank you so much for joining us. Congratulations, and we can't wait to see what you do next. IRVING: All right. Take care.

When I departed out of Miami, I only had $30 in my pocket and I'm reading banners and signs that says, Go Barrington Go, and I'm wondering to myself, where am I going? I only have $30 in my pocket, but sure enough, sure enough, by the time I made my first stop, Miami fundraised close to $100,000 and the further I kept on going, the more money was raised. MARTIN: Well, what are you up to now? What are you trying to do now? You've got a number of educational programs that you are involved in. Tell me a little bit about those. IRVING: Yeah. So the past few years for me since flying around the world have certainly been interesting. I've pretty much transitioned from being a pilot to also becoming an educator, and one of the first projects I tested was our build and soar program, where we challenge 60 kids from failing high schools in Miami to build an aircraft from scratch, and not only build it from scratch but I put my life on the line to fly it for its first flight. A number of those students have gone on to college. A number of them have gotten degrees in various fields. I mean there's one young lady, Baccari, who - at the time of that project, she couldn't point out a sixteenth of an inch on a ruler and now she is on a full scholarship as a math major at Duke University. MARTIN: Tell me about the flying classroom. IRVING: We're creating a real life magic school bus by transforming a $5 million private aircraft donated by the Beechcraft Corporation into the world's first flying classroom. So what does that mean? MARTIN: Hold on. For people who aren't familiar with - who don't have kids, the magic school bus is a series of books where the school bus magically takes kids on all kinds of adventures where they understand, you know, things like the rain forest, the core of the Earth, the environment, stuff like that. IRVING: Yeah. And. . . MARTIN: And this is a real life one. IRVING: Yeah. Now we've figured out a way to do it in real life, where we will utilize this flying aircraft and be able to not only communicate with classrooms from the air, but we're traveling all seven continents, where we'll conduct various expeditions. It could be around geothermal energy, biodiversity, innovations in technology, but we're doing it in a way where students actually control the results of every mission. From the meals I eat to the experiments that's conducted and the data and research that's collected, it's all done by the students virtually, and I'm just fulfilling the actions that they choose. MARTIN: And when will this start? IRVING: This will start September of 2014 and we're just very excited to be able to collaborate with so many individuals and corporations to create Classroom in the Sky. MARTIN: What do you think this means? What do you think is the lesson here? IRVING: It's interesting because the problem that we face in this country as it relates to STEMs - you know, science, technology, engineering and math - is a national problem. We need as many bodies that we can find to become the next leaders in those areas. And I found working with all types of students, this nation faces an even bigger problem. Our problem is the students of today are simply unmotivated, regardless of background or economic status, and I think what we're doing in education - we want to be the best, but we're afraid to challenge our kids to be the best. And that's where I put forth with action with some of the projects that we're doing. I don't say we're going to do something and expect our students to fail. Failure certainly isn't an option, whether it's building a plane or having kids as young as eight years old building a car faster than a Ferrari. We have to put tangible challenges with real finish lines in front of these kids' faces because when a child has the opportunity to do those types of projects or anything hands-on or skills-based, they're not looking at - oh, I have to learn the math and science and algebra and chemistry and physics and so forth behind doing some of these things. They're looking at the finish line. MARTIN: Barrington Irving is a pilot and educator who set a world record as the youngest person and the first black man to fly around the world alone. He spoke with us from WLRN in Miami. Barrington Irving, thank you so much for joining us. Congratulations, and we can't wait to see what you do next. IRVING: All right.

Well now, there's a new path. LAUREN WOLFE: I'm Lauren Wolfe, and I'm the director of the Women's Media Center's Women Under Siege Project. And we are live-tracking how sexualized violence is being used in Syria. CORNISH: Live tracking. That means the Women Under Siege website keeps an up-to-date tally. The incidents of sexual violence are represented by dots on a map. The larger the dot, the more reports of rape. What's truly new here is the data - information collected through crowd sourcing, reports on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube from inside the country. As NPR's Deborah Amos reports from New York, that data is then analyzed by public health researchers at Columbia University. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Foreign language spoken)DEBORAH AMOS, BYLINE: This is the testimony of a rape victim in Syria she posted online. And what is her story? JACKIE BLACHMAN-FORSHAY: She came home and was attacked by five Syrian soldiers while her son was forced to watch. AMOS: Jackie Blachman-Forshay, a graduate student, transcribes these accounts with a team of Arabic translators. BLACHMAN-FORSHAY: This, for example, is a soldier - a former soldier saying that he raped women in custody. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Foreign language spoken)BLACHMAN-FORSHAY: He received orders from the army general to rape women, and he did so along with three other men, and this happened at a university in Aleppo. AMOS: It's all part of the detailed research for the Women Under Siege Project. BLACHMAN-FORSHAY: At this point, I've watched anything that has to do with rape in Syria that's on YouTube, I've seen. AMOS: Every report is coded by perpetrator, by date and mapped by location. KARESTAN KOENEN: Our team - Jackie and the translators, who remain anonymous - they're really engaged in the heartbreaking work of engaging with this incredibly traumatic material. AMOS: That's Karestan Koenen, an associate professor of epidemiology at Columbia. She joined the project to add rigorous academic standards. But even so, she's challenging traditional public health research methods. KOENEN: Yes. (LAUGHTER)KOENEN: Yes. So we are pushing boundaries. AMOS: Pushing boundaries because her team uses crowd sourcing to document a crisis happening now rather than waiting to interview the victims. KOENEN: Because waiting until after a conflict is over to collect this data has all kinds of problems, including the fact that we know many of the victims will be dead and never have the opportunity to speak. AMOS: And so this is the first conflict that this data has been collected in real time? KOENEN: To my knowledge, yes. AMOS: There's another member of the team who plays an important role. (SOUNDBITE OF TELEPHONE RINGING)AMOS: John Page, a self-described numbers cruncher, works for a high-tech company in Virginia. He volunteers his expertise for Women Under Siege. KOENEN: Hey, John. It's Karestan. Jackie is here too. AMOS: They talk over Page's most recent findings. JOHN PAGE: We've been trying to slice this a few ways, just in terms of potential targeting of women and how it might vary by area and by cause. AMOS: Page also analyzes data for a website called Syria Tracker that documents deaths in Syria. PAGE: One of the neighborhoods had a death rate for women of 38 percent. KOENEN: Wow. OK. AMOS: It's a signal to check the database to see if there's a correlation. Koenen has already drawn some conclusions, that sexual violence is widespread in Syria, and the victims are not only women. KOENEN: We also see a significant proportion of male reports of sexualized violence. And we also see that a higher proportion are involved multiple attackers, suggesting that the sexualized violence is going along with other atrocities in Syria. AMOS: In the refugee camps across Syria's borders, the harrowing accounts of women and girls echo these findings. The majority cite sexual violence as the reason for fleeing the country. But even so, an accurate accounting is still not possible. The social stigma for acknowledging rape is still too great in this conservative culture. LUCAS DIXON: I'm Lucas Dixon, a research fellow at the University of Edinburgh. AMOS: Dixon, who studies social media, says getting data through crowd sourcing is still controversial - how to verify sources, how to ensure a representative sample? But still, there's value in the data. DIXON: This is what's really new in terms of the story that can be told by crowd sourcing. It can give you the overview picture; it can connect the dots. It can then inform you in ways that weren't possible before. AMOS: Projects like Women Under Siege are breaking new ground, he says, challenging what we can know and how quickly we can know it.

I'm Neal Conan. And now, a look beyond Baltimore and Beyonce to the enduring possibilities of an ephemeral event. When the lights went out at Superdome on Sunday, Twitter lit up. Advertising teams from several companies tried to capitalize with instant ads. Like many of the regular ads, almost of these flopped, but one produced an idea that people are still buzzing about, Oreo cookies. If you work in the ad business, how does social media changed the game? Give us a call, 800-989-8255. Email: talk@npr. org. Bob Dorfman is executive creative director of Baker Street Advertising in San Francisco and joins us from his officer there. Good of you to be with us today. BOB DORFMAN: Thank you, Neal. Good to talk to you. CONAN: So for anybody who's out there who did not see this ad, paint us a picture. What happened? DORFMAN: Well, the blackout happened, first of all. And, obviously, there's a large following on Twitter and everybody's tweeting about it. And Oreo, who had their digital team, you know, at the ready, they're mobilized, they created a little ad that said, you know, power out? No problem. And there was a little, you know, almost like a print ad image, but they posted it on Twitter. It said, you can still dunk in the dark, with a picture of an Oreo cookie kind of surrounded by darkness. Again a clever little way of capturing, you know, the moment, what's going on and in a live activity, which is what's happening, what Twitter is all about. And it was fun, it was clever, it was playful, and it was, you know, attracted a lot of attention. And it's kind of, you know, the beginning of a new trend, I think, that we'll be seeing a lot more of. CONAN: It turned out, there were other companies who had their teams at the ready as well. DORFMAN: Yeah. I think Audi did. We did something, talking about the LED lights on their car, kind of, poking fun a little bit at the fact that this is the Mercedes-Benz superdome. . . (LAUGHTER)DORFMAN: And there was a blackout. CONAN: OK. DORFMAN: Which also, again, a very clever competitive way of, you know, using Twitter. So - and there were a couple other companies that did similar things. I think nothing really have the attention that Oreo did, and that's probably because maybe it was, you know, the product is a little bit more of a fun product. It's less serious. It's just a cookie. So they didn't have to be as serious about it or didn't look as, kind of, mean or nasty or anything. It was just a fun, little way of pitching their product. CONAN: But it - I had not thought that advertise, you know, the ads we see during the Super Bowl, these are crafted months in advance, cast with a care that you put into a major motion picture, orchestrated, all that sort of stuff. They spent $3. 5 million. The buzz is all about something Oreo did on the whim of the moment. DORFMAN: Yeah. And that's what's interesting. You know, Oreo also had a commercial during the game and it was, you know, a very effective and fun commercial set up in a library where everybody is going crazy over whether you like the cream or the cookie. And it was really their tweet that got a little bit more attention, you know, and is still getting talked about more than their commercial, I think. And, again, it's - and sort of a new way of advertising. And the challenge here, obviously, is, you've got to be ready, you've got to make quick decisions. This was a, you know, you had a 30-minute blackout during the game. They pretty much came up with this idea and got it out and online in five minutes. So you've got to have all your marketing people who are the decision-makers, all your tech people, everybody in a room together watching the event and kind of at the ready for any kind of situation where something might pop up that you can take advantage. CONAN: There goes the idea of going over to the boss' house to - for the Super Bowl party. DORFMAN: Yeah. That's true. (LAUGHTER)DORFMAN: It kind of turns their bow into a working session. CONAN: It sort of does. And you got to do it fast because that's a 34-minute blackout. If you can do it in 35 minutes, you're too late. DORFMAN: You're too late. Exactly. And it also presents problems, too, because you have to act fast, but it also presents the - the problem of acting too rashly. You know, if you come out with something that's, you know, obviously, Super Bowl commercials are researched and over thought and thunk again and, oh, you know, every - so many people get their hands on them before they're finished. It's very hard to do something that's, you know, that's going to cause problems. But when you only have, you know, a few minutes to come up with an idea, there is the chance that, you know, something is going to offend somebody in some way. So you have to be a little bit more careful, and you have to make sure that you've got, you know, all the people, the big decision makers, the people responsible making, you know, making the call to do it so that, you know, there won't be any problems down the road if there are issues. CONAN: You're right. There is a possibility for - just as there is for that buzzy moment there is for that buzzy-for-the-wrong-reason moment. DORFMAN: Exactly. CONAN: Yeah. And the next - this is coming off something that is - it's one of those rare moments in American life these days where just about everybody in the country is gathered around a screen somewhere watching the Super Bowl. There aren't too many of those moments. DORFMAN: No, there aren't. And, you know, everybody talks now about the second screen. So, you know, Twitter - somebody joked that Twitter is really just, you know, a bunch of people sitting around watching TV and commenting on it. And this whole second screen phenomenon is, you know, referring to people using social media on the computer, on Twitter, on Facebook while they're watching an event, you know, unfold on TV. And it - when you have these big live events, it does present that opportunity for a, you know, social community to comment on the event. It's - obviously the Super Bowl is the big one. I think you'll be seeing more of this happen during the Academy Awards telecast, which is also another big event for advertisers. Any kind of live sporting events, you know, I suppose any live political events, any sort of newsy events that bring big collective crowds to social media, I think that will all draw this type of advertising. CONAN: And how do they get people to see it though? I mean, I assume they have a list of people who, for some reason or other, have signed on to like Oreos or follow Oreos. But that's probably a fairly limited. . . DORFMAN: That would be a - that's the big challenge. You know, a lot of this is coming down to hashtags, you know, putting the. . . CONAN: Could've been a blackout hashtag or something. DORFMAN: . . . hashtag at the end of your message so that it does get people who are looking at that same topic collectively. And then it's also just, you know, word of mouth and, you know, people, you know, sending it out to other people and retweeting and retweeting, and then that just multiplies. CONAN: And the delight of it is other than whatever overtime you were paying that creative crew to sit around and watch the Super Bowl in the office, it was free. DORFMAN: Yes. Absolutely free, did not cost a dime except, yeah, again, except for the hours that those people are spending watching the game together and working. CONAN: We'd like to hear from others of you who work in the advertising business. How is social media changing the game? 800-989-8255. Email: talk@npr. org. Mike's on the line with us from Boston. MIKE: Hi. How are you? CONAN: I'm good. Thanks. MIKE: Good. Yeah. I run a number of social media teams. I work on the agency side with a number of big clients. And I actually just want to back up real quick. In regards to kind of the Oreo example, one of the, I think, really important things you kind of pull out from that is that they have 31 million fans just waiting for messaging, right? So these are people who already signed up, that clicked like on their Facebook page. So when we start to talk about it really not costing much to do. It doesn't. But there still is kind of this initial cost to acquiring kind of this fan base that then you can activate at kind of a moment's notice when you want to. So I just think that's kind of just important kind of point to pull out. CONAN: Well, also they have the, as you say, the advantage of, you know, all these people waiting around for 34 minutes for something to do. MIKE: Yeah. Absolutely right. And so I think, you know, one of the real challenges, and you guys kind of touched some of them a moment ago, is kind of operationalizing(ph) agility. When you have somebody like Oreo who has both an agency partner and they have a client, on both sides you're going to have lawyers that are going to be assessing the risk associated with saying what you're about to say, and that can get very, very difficult trying to get, you know, kind of two legal teams, a client and a creative team and then kind of a social media strategist all get on the same page. And Oreo does it very well. But from an organizational standpoint, that's a huge shift in terms of kind of agency relationships. That's taking a long time for a lot of clients to kind of get on board. DORFMAN: That usually takes weeks, you know, to do that kind of thing, if not months. And to do that in real time is, you know, pretty ridiculously difficult. CONAN: So, Mike, do you expect to - suddenly you're going to be working on Oscar night? MIKE: Oh, yeah. Thankfully, we have a couple of great clients that we always kind of plan for this sort of thing. And, you know, we did something during the blackout that was one of, you know, our most highly-engaged with pieces of content in the past year. But, yeah, like, these are the kind of (unintelligible) which you get into when you start to get into social medias and kind of. . . CONAN: You say we always do. How long have you always been doing this? (LAUGHTER)MIKE: Well, we've been doing this for about two years with kind of the majority of our clients. And it's certainly evolved, you know, since we first kind of started using engagements and, like, you know, both sides of the people are learning kind of every day as to how to, you know, continue to refine what we do. But it's really clear that this is, you know, not something that's going away, so making kind of an early investment issue kind of ahead of the game, you know, as we move forward. CONAN: All right. Well, thanks very much, Mike. Appreciate the phone call. MIKE: Thank you very much. CONAN: And as we talk, Bob Dorfman, clearly, that's - people - this is brand new. This is - he's been doing two years. DORFMAN: Yeah. That's the thing. It's kind of funny that this has been going on, but it's sort of taken this Oreo tweet to really bring it to the forefront. And it, you know, it does make it seem like this is a new thing, a new trend. But, yeah, it has been going on for a little bit of a while. This may be kind of a tipping point to, you know, make more mainstream, I guess. CONAN: And do you do it at Baker Street Advertising? DORFMAN: With our clients, not as much. It's something we're getting into a little more. We definitely do work with digital partners on our clients. Most of our clients are more regional, so it's not quite as appropriate for us. CONAN: But the moment of some bright young spark raises a hand, it says, I've got an idea. It's crazy, but it just might work. DORFMAN: Absolutely. (LAUGHTER)CONAN: As you look at the future of this, and clearly it does have a future, where does it go next do you think? DORFMAN: Again, it's going to be, you know, a lot of big companies of these types of events, you know, all kind of being mobilized to do this kind of thing. You know, the challenge now is that it's going to get - it's going to start to get very cluttered. You know, now that everybody has seen that Oreo has had success with it. It's going to be jumping on the bandwagon. We want, you know, we've got to have our digital team ready. We've got to be doing this. So how do you kind of stand out? How do you cut through the clutter? Again, it's still a learning environment and agencies, and clients are still kind of, you know, feeling their way. But, again, it's going to be who's got the most interesting message and the most the interesting way of getting it out there. CONAN: And which events are big enough? DORFMAN: Exactly. CONAN: Certainly, the Oscars, but maybe not the Grammys. DORFMAN: Probably not. CONAN: Yeah. DORFMAN: Well, you never know. CONAN: You never known. With certain products, it might be in a less cluttered field. All of a sudden, you're getting it to niche social advertising, which is, I guess, what the social advertising is all about anyway. DORFMAN: Exactly. CONAN: All right. Well, Bob Dorfman, thank you very much for your time today. DORFMAN: Thank you, Neal.

And, again, it's - and sort of a new way of advertising. And the challenge here, obviously, is, you've got to be ready, you've got to make quick decisions. This was a, you know, you had a 30-minute blackout during the game. They pretty much came up with this idea and got it out and online in five minutes. So you've got to have all your marketing people who are the decision-makers, all your tech people, everybody in a room together watching the event and kind of at the ready for any kind of situation where something might pop up that you can take advantage. CONAN: There goes the idea of going over to the boss' house to - for the Super Bowl party. DORFMAN: Yeah. That's true. (LAUGHTER) DORFMAN: It kind of turns their bow into a working session. CONAN: It sort of does. And you got to do it fast because that's a 34-minute blackout. If you can do it in 35 minutes, you're too late. DORFMAN: You're too late. Exactly. And it also presents problems, too, because you have to act fast, but it also presents the - the problem of acting too rashly. You know, if you come out with something that's, you know, obviously, Super Bowl commercials are researched and over thought and thunk again and, oh, you know, every - so many people get their hands on them before they're finished. It's very hard to do something that's, you know, that's going to cause problems. But when you only have, you know, a few minutes to come up with an idea, there is the chance that, you know, something is going to offend somebody in some way. So you have to be a little bit more careful, and you have to make sure that you've got, you know, all the people, the big decision makers, the people responsible making, you know, making the call to do it so that, you know, there won't be any problems down the road if there are issues. CONAN: You're right. There is a possibility for - just as there is for that buzzy moment there is for that buzzy-for-the-wrong-reason moment. DORFMAN: Exactly. CONAN: Yeah. And the next - this is coming off something that is - it's one of those rare moments in American life these days where just about everybody in the country is gathered around a screen somewhere watching the Super Bowl. There aren't too many of those moments. DORFMAN: No, there aren't. And, you know, everybody talks now about the second screen. So, you know, Twitter - somebody joked that Twitter is really just, you know, a bunch of people sitting around watching TV and commenting on it. And this whole second screen phenomenon is, you know, referring to people using social media on the computer, on Twitter, on Facebook while they're watching an event, you know, unfold on TV. And it - when you have these big live events, it does present that opportunity for a, you know, social community to comment on the event. It's - obviously the Super Bowl is the big one. I think you'll be seeing more of this happen during the Academy Awards telecast, which is also another big event for advertisers. Any kind of live sporting events, you know, I suppose any live political events, any sort of newsy events that bring big collective crowds to social media, I think that will all draw this type of advertising. CONAN: And how do they get people to see it though? I mean, I assume they have a list of people who, for some reason or other, have signed on to like Oreos or follow Oreos. But that's probably a fairly limited. . . DORFMAN: That would be a - that's the big challenge. You know, a lot of this is coming down to hashtags, you know, putting the. . . CONAN: Could've been a blackout hashtag or something. DORFMAN: . . . hashtag at the end of your message so that it does get people who are looking at that same topic collectively. And then it's also just, you know, word of mouth and, you know, people, you know, sending it out to other people and retweeting and retweeting, and then that just multiplies. CONAN: And the delight of it is other than whatever overtime you were paying that creative crew to sit around and watch the Super Bowl in the office, it was free. DORFMAN: Yes. Absolutely free, did not cost a dime except, yeah, again, except for the hours that those people are spending watching the game together and working. CONAN: We'd like to hear from others of you who work in the advertising business. How is social media changing the game? 800-989-8255. Email: talk@npr. org. Mike's on the line with us from Boston. MIKE: Hi. How are you? CONAN: I'm good. Thanks. MIKE: Good. Yeah. I run a number of social media teams. I work on the agency side with a number of big clients. And I actually just want to back up real quick. In regards to kind of the Oreo example, one of the, I think, really important things you kind of pull out from that is that they have 31 million fans just waiting for messaging, right? So these are people who already signed up, that clicked like on their Facebook page. So when we start to talk about it really not costing much to do. It doesn't. But there still is kind of this initial cost to acquiring kind of this fan base that then you can activate at kind of a moment's notice when you want to. So I just think that's kind of just important kind of point to pull out. CONAN: Well, also they have the, as you say, the advantage of, you know, all these people waiting around for 34 minutes for something to do. MIKE: Yeah. Absolutely right. And so I think, you know, one of the real challenges, and you guys kind of touched some of them a moment ago, is kind of operationalizing(ph) agility. When you have somebody like Oreo who has both an agency partner and they have a client, on both sides you're going to have lawyers that are going to be assessing the risk associated with saying what you're about to say, and that can get very, very difficult trying to get, you know, kind of two legal teams, a client and a creative team and then kind of a social media strategist all get on the same page. And Oreo does it very well. But from an organizational standpoint, that's a huge shift in terms of kind of agency relationships. That's taking a long time for a lot of clients to kind of get on board. DORFMAN: That usually takes weeks, you know, to do that kind of thing, if not months. And to do that in real time is, you know, pretty ridiculously difficult. CONAN: So, Mike, do you expect to - suddenly you're going to be working on Oscar night? MIKE: Oh, yeah. Thankfully, we have a couple of great clients that we always kind of plan for this sort of thing. And, you know, we did something during the blackout that was one of, you know, our most highly-engaged with pieces of content in the past year. But, yeah, like, these are the kind of (unintelligible) which you get into when you start to get into social medias and kind of. . . CONAN: You say we always do. How long have you always been doing this? (LAUGHTER) MIKE: Well, we've been doing this for about two years with kind of the majority of our clients. And it's certainly evolved, you know, since we first kind of started using engagements and, like, you know, both sides of the people are learning kind of every day as to how to, you know, continue to refine what we do. But it's really clear that this is, you know, not something that's going away, so making kind of an early investment issue kind of ahead of the game, you know, as we move forward. CONAN: All right. Well, thanks very much, Mike. Appreciate the phone call. MIKE: Thank you very much. CONAN: And as we talk, Bob Dorfman, clearly, that's - people - this is brand new. This is - he's been doing two years. DORFMAN: Yeah. That's the thing. It's kind of funny that this has been going on, but it's sort of taken this Oreo tweet to really bring it to the forefront. And it, you know, it does make it seem like this is a new thing, a new trend. But, yeah, it has been going on for a little bit of a while. This may be kind of a tipping point to, you know, make more mainstream, I guess. CONAN: And do you do it at Baker Street Advertising? DORFMAN: With our clients, not as much. It's something we're getting into a little more. We definitely do work with digital partners on our clients. Most of our clients are more regional, so it's not quite as appropriate for us. CONAN: But the moment of some bright young spark raises a hand, it says, I've got an idea. It's crazy, but it just might work. DORFMAN: Absolutely. (LAUGHTER) CONAN: As you look at the future of this, and clearly it does have a future, where does it go next do you think? DORFMAN: Again, it's going to be, you know, a lot of big companies of these types of events, you know, all kind of being mobilized to do this kind of thing. You know, the challenge now is that it's going to get - it's going to start to get very cluttered. You know, now that everybody has seen that Oreo has had success with it. It's going to be jumping on the bandwagon. We want, you know, we've got to have our digital team ready. We've got to be doing this. So how do you kind of stand out? How do you cut through the clutter? Again, it's still a learning environment and agencies, and clients are still kind of, you know, feeling their way. But, again, it's going to be who's got the most interesting message and the most the interesting way of getting it out there. CONAN: And which events are big enough? DORFMAN: Exactly. CONAN: Certainly, the Oscars, but maybe not the Grammys. DORFMAN: Probably not. CONAN: Yeah. DORFMAN: Well, you never know. CONAN: You never known. With certain products, it might be in a less cluttered field. All of a sudden, you're getting it to niche social advertising, which is, I guess, what the social advertising is all about anyway. DORFMAN: Exactly. CONAN: All right. Well, Bob Dorfman, thank you very much for your time today. DORFMAN: Thank you, Neal. CONAN: Bob Dorfman is the executive creator director of Baker Street Advertising in San Francisco. He joined us by phone from his office there.

Do you ever get the feeling you're being watched? These days if you're not careful, your phone knows where you are, and there's a good chance somebody else does, too. Or you've noticed that the ads on sites you visit are starting to look a little too personalized, like how did they know I was planning a vacation to New Orleans. We share bits of information, and there's a good chance someone out there is collecting it and trying to find a way to use it. So do we actually have any control over our own data? What about the things we buy? Why can't I unlock my smartphone? I bought it, right? Well, joining me to talk about those issues and others is Khaliah Barnes. She's the administrative law counsel for the Electronic Privacy Information Center, EPIC, here in Washington, D. C. , and she joins us in the studio. Welcome. KHALIAH BARNES: Thank you, thank you for having me. PALCA: So this is a big issue, but sometimes I wonder if people are even aware of it. Is that something you have to - I mean, do people come to you with questions, or do you have to go to them and say you should be asking questions? BARNES: It's a little bit of both. It seems like the public is increasingly aware of various privacy threats. But also our organization, EPIC, does a lot to educate the public on pending legislation on rulemakings, on just how to navigate. PALCA: So what is pending? What is coming up that the public needs to be aware of? BARNES: Well, one particularly interesting public opportunity for people to comment is a federal agency, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, has mandated that in 2014 your car will need to be equipped with little - we call them black boxes, even data recorders. PALCA: Like what they have on airplanes. BARNES: Correct, and the agency is interested in having one of these recording devices for safety purposes. They want to know if your car has a crash, was it a manufacturer error. However, this technology raises obvious privacy threats because it can tell where you are going, at what speed you are going, et cetera. And you can be sure that other people are interested in that information: Your insurance companies, law enforcement, et cetera. PALCA: Wow, yeah, you're right, those are things that are not so obvious. If you have questions for Khaliah Barnes, give us a call. Our number is 800-989-8255. You know, but that raises the question in my mind, you know, there are - this privacy question about red light cameras, for example, where people had their pictures taken because they went through a red light, isn't there a public good for having this information to be weighed against the privacy question that's raised by it? BARNES: See, the interesting thing is modern privacy law is really about our ability to control and own our information held by others. So we choose to make certain information available. We choose to be out, you know, on the public streets, et cetera. But it matters how this information is used. So it's - you know, it's a perfectly legitimate purpose for agencies to say, you know, was somebody speeding, did someone go through this light. But what's not an appropriate use is then to take that license plate and put it in a database and just have it just in case this license plate comes up again or just in case this person is doing something wrong. PALCA: So are we able as a society to strike that balance? Have we struck it properly, or are we erring on one side or the other? BARNES: Increasing, it's becoming harder to control and own our data because privacy policies, as everyone knows, are constantly changing. Your consent today may not be your consent tomorrow, and even if it was, even if you said, you know, I fully understand all of the privacy terms with Facebook, although I've never heard anybody say that, we know that in a matter of weeks and a matter of months that will change. So it's definitely getting harder for individuals to, as you said, strike the right balance. PALCA: I just, you know, I can't get over the fact that this data - companies seem to be being very subtle about how they sneak it in that they know something about you. Is there any way to out companies that are advertising to you and say how did you know about this? BARNES: Well, that's oftentimes very difficult to access all of the information that they have. And what's happening is oftentimes we're consenting to this. We say sure, I'll use your terms of service, but we'll give a blanket consent, and we don't know that the privacy policy is constantly changing. What's a more appropriate tactic is in a case by case scenario. Yes, you can disclose my picture to these many friends, yes, you can have this wall posting. But what's not OK is me saying yeah, OK, collect this information because I want to know the nearest restaurant, and then my locational information is then given to law enforcement or another service I'm not interested in. PALCA: I just - I can't - I mean, I have to say I totally love walking in a strange city and saying where's a bookstore, and I look at my phone, and it tells me where a bookstore is. I just - that so amazes me that it's a possibility. BARNES: That's good, and there are definitely, of course, good uses to the technology, but what's happening is when that information is collected and further disclosed without your consent. PALCA: Well, it's - yeah, it's keeping sense of what you're getting and what you're paying for. Well, let's see what things our callers are concerned about, and let's first go to Scott(ph) in Palo Alto, California. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. SCOTT: Thank you very much. I've got a question about what I call analytics. You know, Google offers an interesting thing for advertisers called Google Analytics, I believe. And it breaks down a lot of data for them. And I wanted to know: When will the ball get rolling on user analytics, when all of the data that's currently being collected on us and given to other people, when that will be available, legally even, to the users to analyze their own metrics, the way they use their phones, how they travel, how they communicate because we all have our face stuck in a phone, but we know very little about the nuances, about how we create and consume data. I just wanted to get your input. PALCA: Sure, thanks, Khaliah, what about that? BARNES: Well, thank you for that question. There are certain - there have been certain initiatives to happen. I mean, you have Europe versus Facebook, where basically members and individuals, and Europe said hey, you're collecting all of this information, basically getting to what Scott was saying, analytics, and I want to know all of the information that you have. But I feel, unfortunately, that it may be a long - a bit of time before the U. S. really wholeheartedly embraces that. Now you have certain laws that do allow for that information. For example when we're talking about children, we have COPPA, the Children's Online Protection - Privacy Protection Act. And parents are allowed to access the type of - the information that a website has collected about their child. So in certain arenas, we're moving towards that, but I'm not sure when all industries will be onboard. PALCA: How about in health care? Has that industry been out front? Have they been leading the way in this? BARNES: In the healthcare front there have definitely been some advances, recently with the health insurance portability, accountability act, or as we love to say, HIPPA, they've recently - stronger rules have been issued about use of health information, disclosure of that information. And what's really important, it's very subtle, breach notification because. . . PALCA: What's that? BARNES: So what happens is you give your information to a company, and maybe they experience a security breach. These rules increase when you should be notified and et cetera because oftentimes companies collect the information, they've been hacked, and maybe they're reluctant to tell youu, or maybe they tell you down the line three months and now. . . PALCA: In very fine print at the bottom of a letter, yeah. BARNES: Exactly. PALCA: Yeah, wow, that's - it's - well, the issues that we haven't thought about are probable even more interesting than the ones we have. Let's take another call now and go to Tyler(ph) in Dover, Delaware. Tyler(ph), can you hear me? TYLER: I can, sir. How are you guys doing today? PALCA: We're great. BARNES: Good, thank you. PALCA: What's your question? TYLER: Well, in regards stuff like vehicular monitoring, regarding stuff like the black box scenario, as they role those out to, you know, cars in productions for consumers, are they also rolling them out for things like government agencies? We've all seen that cop, you know, kind of ease through the stop sign or maybe run through a yellow light that, you know, was five or so miles an hour over the speed limit further than we thought they would be comfortable with us going, that type of thing. So is it a blanket rollout, I guess is my question, or is it going more to just consumers? BARNES: Well, the mandate will be required for certain light vehicles that will be equipped with this information. Now there's not an explicit, to say, you know, this is only for consumers, this isn't for law enforcement access. If all of the cars are required to have it, then this would also be for law enforcement. But what's interesting is at least 13 states are ahead of this. Thirteen states recognize that this technology is already being used, and they're ahead of it. They're saying the driver owns his or her data. No one should be able to access that without his or consent except for in certain circumstances. This shouldn't just be given carte blanche to law enforcement or to insurance companies. PALCA: Tyler, I'm sorry, Tyler are you also - do you work for the government? Is this a particular professional concern of yours? Tyler, I'm sorry. Tyler, are you also - are you - do you work for the government? Is this a particular professional concern of yours? TYLER: I don't, actually. My current situation has me in a rental on a regular basis, and that was another spin to it as to whether or not, you know, if you're monitoring the vehicle, obviously you're not monitoring the driver of said rental car necessarily, just the way the vehicle itself is driven. That kind of falls to another outlier in the situation. But, no, my personal experience - in Delaware, for example, we have a lot volunteer fire department members. You know, you'll see the guy with the blue siren doing 95 miles an hour to go somewhere hopefully to a fire, maybe to dinner. (LAUGHTER)PALCA: I don't think we want to use this technology for that purpose, I'm just saying.  Tyler, thanks very much for that call. TYLER: Absolutely. PALCA: Sorry. I'm still getting to know this phone system. It's a little new. This is the question he raises. It really troubles me, this idea that there is so much to be learned from what kinds of behaviors are causing car accidents, for example, that it seems a shame to shut off access to it. And that's what really - where the nexus comes I guess between privacy and public utility. BARNES: Exactly. And we recognize that there are legitimate purposes for this type of data collection. It's absolutely imperative to have emergency response in these types of situations. But what's not good is if other parties are able to access that information outside of the scope. So you say, yes, I want you to alert emergency response personnel, and I also want to know if there is a manufacturer error with my car. But I don't want you to give this information to my insurance, and my rates go up, or I don't want you just to give this information to law enforcement just so I can get a speeding ticket later. PALCA: So what about this - what about things that are coming - can anybody successfully - has anybody successfully challenged these kinds of things? They say, hey, my privacy was violated. They'll say, well, we told you on line 317 of the contract you signed, and they say, look, a reasonable person wouldn't have seen that, and we're going to fight it in court. Has that come up at all? BARNES: You definitely have issues with the FTC, for example. So a company may represent that it's only going to collect a certain amount of information, and the FTC initiates an investigation, oftentimes by complaints, consumer complaints. EPIC does a lot of those to say actually you need to look closer at that. And if the FTC finds out that actually, you know, company X collected information in excess of what it was doing, or it disclosed information for purposes that it didn't initially inform consumers, there are repercussions. In that scenario companies are forbidden from doing that behavior in the future. There are also fines involved. So yes, but it's happening so fast. And the problem with privacy - and it goes with the privacy breaches - it's oftentimes way after the fact. You didn't know that your information was collected for that reason. PALCA: We're talking with Khaliah Barnes of the Electronic Privacy Center, EPIC, about privacy of data. I'm Joe Palca, and this is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. And let's take another call now and go to George in San Francisco. George, you're on SCIENCE FRIDAY. Welcome. GEORGE: Thank you. Ms. Barnes, it would interesting to consider whether - what the state of the art is. Do you know of any cases that have worked their way through the legal system where somebody's data provides an alibi? In other words, if somebody says, well, we know that you were on your way to San Jose midday Friday on the 9th of February, and the party says, no, I couldn't have been. I was on my home phone talking to Ms. Barnes on SCIENCE FRIDAY. And that those would be mutually exclusive, therefore one would be afforded an alibi. Has any of this information gone that far yet that you know of? BARNES: Well, certain - the state legislation that is looking at - we'll just use the example of the black boxes in cars, recognize certain uses for that information in court proceedings, but it's under extremely - for certain state laws - narrow circumstances. So it wouldn't just be enough to say I'm interested in this information just to go on a fishing expedition, but perhaps, if that information is necessary to resolve a specific matter in the legal proceeding, perhaps. PALCA: You know what, I had an experience that was somewhat similar to that, and it worries me a bit (unintelligible) this is going to come up very often. But what happens if the data is wrong that that is supposedly recorded on you because someone said that I had gone through a toll plaza in upstate New York, and I was nowhere near New York. And it was because there was an offset in the date, somehow the date got corrupted. BARNES: Exactly. And access, data access and amendment of data is very - a big topic in the privacy community because you have to think about the security of the technology. Is it able to be, as we like to call it, spoofed? Is someone able to log into the system and change that Joe actually - he was going at a different rate, or is someone able to access the technology for nefarious purposes and say that you were doing something that you weren't? And then, you know, you should always have the availability to access and amend that. PALCA: Do you do anything, by the way, about these radio frequency bracelets that they're giving out some places? How do those work, and what are the issues there? BARNES: Yes. That comes up a lot in the context recently of students' privacy. So RFID trackers, basically they can be - they're invisible. You can't see them. But let's use the example of being put into, like an access card, an access key card, and there's a reader separately to say I know where this individual is throughout this building. But obviously there it raises privacy threats because it can, you know, it can tell you innocuous things. This person is in office A. But depending - in the context of a school it can say, you know, the student is at the nurse's office. The student is in the restroom. The student is in a counselor's office. And as the Texas case brought up, there. . . PALCA: Texas cases? I'm sorry. BARNES: Oh, I'm sorry. Yes. There was a court challenge to an RFID tracker that a student was required to wear by being on campus, and she objected to this on religious ground. So RFID tracking is - it's increasing. Lots of schools are using it, and other trackers and biometric identifiers for students. PALCA: OK. That question actually came from one of our tweeters, Erin(ph). And thank you for that question. She was actually talking about a trip to Disneyland. Apparently they're using. . . BARNES: Ah, with the bracelets. Yes, they are. PALCA: I know there are times when I wish I had that for my children. (LAUGHTER)PALCA: But I'll take it as - they're often gone now, so I don't need to worry so much. Khaliah Barnes, thanks very much for joining us. BARNES: Thank you for having me. PALCA: Khaliah Barnes is with the administrative law council for the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington. JOE PALCA, HOST:  This is SCIENCE FRIDAY; I'm Joe Palca.

But what's not OK is me saying yeah, OK, collect this information because I want to know the nearest restaurant, and then my locational information is then given to law enforcement or another service I'm not interested in. PALCA: I just - I can't - I mean, I have to say I totally love walking in a strange city and saying where's a bookstore, and I look at my phone, and it tells me where a bookstore is. I just - that so amazes me that it's a possibility. BARNES: That's good, and there are definitely, of course, good uses to the technology, but what's happening is when that information is collected and further disclosed without your consent. PALCA: Well, it's - yeah, it's keeping sense of what you're getting and what you're paying for. Well, let's see what things our callers are concerned about, and let's first go to Scott(ph) in Palo Alto, California. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. SCOTT: Thank you very much. I've got a question about what I call analytics. You know, Google offers an interesting thing for advertisers called Google Analytics, I believe. And it breaks down a lot of data for them. And I wanted to know: When will the ball get rolling on user analytics, when all of the data that's currently being collected on us and given to other people, when that will be available, legally even, to the users to analyze their own metrics, the way they use their phones, how they travel, how they communicate because we all have our face stuck in a phone, but we know very little about the nuances, about how we create and consume data. I just wanted to get your input. PALCA: Sure, thanks, Khaliah, what about that? BARNES: Well, thank you for that question. There are certain - there have been certain initiatives to happen. I mean, you have Europe versus Facebook, where basically members and individuals, and Europe said hey, you're collecting all of this information, basically getting to what Scott was saying, analytics, and I want to know all of the information that you have. But I feel, unfortunately, that it may be a long - a bit of time before the U. S. really wholeheartedly embraces that. Now you have certain laws that do allow for that information. For example when we're talking about children, we have COPPA, the Children's Online Protection - Privacy Protection Act. And parents are allowed to access the type of - the information that a website has collected about their child. So in certain arenas, we're moving towards that, but I'm not sure when all industries will be onboard. PALCA: How about in health care? Has that industry been out front? Have they been leading the way in this? BARNES: In the healthcare front there have definitely been some advances, recently with the health insurance portability, accountability act, or as we love to say, HIPPA, they've recently - stronger rules have been issued about use of health information, disclosure of that information. And what's really important, it's very subtle, breach notification because. . . PALCA: What's that? BARNES: So what happens is you give your information to a company, and maybe they experience a security breach. These rules increase when you should be notified and et cetera because oftentimes companies collect the information, they've been hacked, and maybe they're reluctant to tell youu, or maybe they tell you down the line three months and now. . . PALCA: In very fine print at the bottom of a letter, yeah. BARNES: Exactly. PALCA: Yeah, wow, that's - it's - well, the issues that we haven't thought about are probable even more interesting than the ones we have. Let's take another call now and go to Tyler(ph) in Dover, Delaware. Tyler(ph), can you hear me? TYLER: I can, sir. How are you guys doing today? PALCA: We're great. BARNES: Good, thank you. PALCA: What's your question? TYLER: Well, in regards stuff like vehicular monitoring, regarding stuff like the black box scenario, as they role those out to, you know, cars in productions for consumers, are they also rolling them out for things like government agencies? We've all seen that cop, you know, kind of ease through the stop sign or maybe run through a yellow light that, you know, was five or so miles an hour over the speed limit further than we thought they would be comfortable with us going, that type of thing. So is it a blanket rollout, I guess is my question, or is it going more to just consumers? BARNES: Well, the mandate will be required for certain light vehicles that will be equipped with this information. Now there's not an explicit, to say, you know, this is only for consumers, this isn't for law enforcement access. If all of the cars are required to have it, then this would also be for law enforcement. But what's interesting is at least 13 states are ahead of this. Thirteen states recognize that this technology is already being used, and they're ahead of it. They're saying the driver owns his or her data. No one should be able to access that without his or consent except for in certain circumstances. This shouldn't just be given carte blanche to law enforcement or to insurance companies. PALCA: Tyler, I'm sorry, Tyler are you also - do you work for the government? Is this a particular professional concern of yours? Tyler, I'm sorry. Tyler, are you also - are you - do you work for the government? Is this a particular professional concern of yours? TYLER: I don't, actually. My current situation has me in a rental on a regular basis, and that was another spin to it as to whether or not, you know, if you're monitoring the vehicle, obviously you're not monitoring the driver of said rental car necessarily, just the way the vehicle itself is driven. That kind of falls to another outlier in the situation. But, no, my personal experience - in Delaware, for example, we have a lot volunteer fire department members. You know, you'll see the guy with the blue siren doing 95 miles an hour to go somewhere hopefully to a fire, maybe to dinner. (LAUGHTER) PALCA: I don't think we want to use this technology for that purpose, I'm just saying.  Tyler, thanks very much for that call. TYLER: Absolutely. PALCA: Sorry. I'm still getting to know this phone system. It's a little new. This is the question he raises. It really troubles me, this idea that there is so much to be learned from what kinds of behaviors are causing car accidents, for example, that it seems a shame to shut off access to it. And that's what really - where the nexus comes I guess between privacy and public utility. BARNES: Exactly. And we recognize that there are legitimate purposes for this type of data collection. It's absolutely imperative to have emergency response in these types of situations. But what's not good is if other parties are able to access that information outside of the scope. So you say, yes, I want you to alert emergency response personnel, and I also want to know if there is a manufacturer error with my car. But I don't want you to give this information to my insurance, and my rates go up, or I don't want you just to give this information to law enforcement just so I can get a speeding ticket later. PALCA: So what about this - what about things that are coming - can anybody successfully - has anybody successfully challenged these kinds of things? They say, hey, my privacy was violated. They'll say, well, we told you on line 317 of the contract you signed, and they say, look, a reasonable person wouldn't have seen that, and we're going to fight it in court. Has that come up at all? BARNES: You definitely have issues with the FTC, for example. So a company may represent that it's only going to collect a certain amount of information, and the FTC initiates an investigation, oftentimes by complaints, consumer complaints. EPIC does a lot of those to say actually you need to look closer at that. And if the FTC finds out that actually, you know, company X collected information in excess of what it was doing, or it disclosed information for purposes that it didn't initially inform consumers, there are repercussions. In that scenario companies are forbidden from doing that behavior in the future. There are also fines involved. So yes, but it's happening so fast. And the problem with privacy - and it goes with the privacy breaches - it's oftentimes way after the fact. You didn't know that your information was collected for that reason. PALCA: We're talking with Khaliah Barnes of the Electronic Privacy Center, EPIC, about privacy of data. I'm Joe Palca, and this is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. And let's take another call now and go to George in San Francisco. George, you're on SCIENCE FRIDAY. Welcome. GEORGE: Thank you. Ms. Barnes, it would interesting to consider whether - what the state of the art is. Do you know of any cases that have worked their way through the legal system where somebody's data provides an alibi? In other words, if somebody says, well, we know that you were on your way to San Jose midday Friday on the 9th of February, and the party says, no, I couldn't have been. I was on my home phone talking to Ms. Barnes on SCIENCE FRIDAY. And that those would be mutually exclusive, therefore one would be afforded an alibi. Has any of this information gone that far yet that you know of? BARNES: Well, certain - the state legislation that is looking at - we'll just use the example of the black boxes in cars, recognize certain uses for that information in court proceedings, but it's under extremely - for certain state laws - narrow circumstances. So it wouldn't just be enough to say I'm interested in this information just to go on a fishing expedition, but perhaps, if that information is necessary to resolve a specific matter in the legal proceeding, perhaps. PALCA: You know what, I had an experience that was somewhat similar to that, and it worries me a bit (unintelligible) this is going to come up very often. But what happens if the data is wrong that that is supposedly recorded on you because someone said that I had gone through a toll plaza in upstate New York, and I was nowhere near New York. And it was because there was an offset in the date, somehow the date got corrupted. BARNES: Exactly. And access, data access and amendment of data is very - a big topic in the privacy community because you have to think about the security of the technology. Is it able to be, as we like to call it, spoofed? Is someone able to log into the system and change that Joe actually - he was going at a different rate, or is someone able to access the technology for nefarious purposes and say that you were doing something that you weren't? And then, you know, you should always have the availability to access and amend that. PALCA: Do you do anything, by the way, about these radio frequency bracelets that they're giving out some places? How do those work, and what are the issues there? BARNES: Yes. That comes up a lot in the context recently of students' privacy. So RFID trackers, basically they can be - they're invisible. You can't see them. But let's use the example of being put into, like an access card, an access key card, and there's a reader separately to say I know where this individual is throughout this building. But obviously there it raises privacy threats because it can, you know, it can tell you innocuous things. This person is in office A. But depending - in the context of a school it can say, you know, the student is at the nurse's office. The student is in the restroom. The student is in a counselor's office. And as the Texas case brought up, there. . . PALCA: Texas cases? I'm sorry. BARNES: Oh, I'm sorry. Yes. There was a court challenge to an RFID tracker that a student was required to wear by being on campus, and she objected to this on religious ground. So RFID tracking is - it's increasing. Lots of schools are using it, and other trackers and biometric identifiers for students. PALCA: OK. That question actually came from one of our tweeters, Erin(ph). And thank you for that question. She was actually talking about a trip to Disneyland. Apparently they're using. . . BARNES: Ah, with the bracelets. Yes, they are. PALCA: I know there are times when I wish I had that for my children. (LAUGHTER) PALCA: But I'll take it as - they're often gone now, so I don't need to worry so much. Khaliah Barnes, thanks very much for joining us. BARNES: Thank you for having me.

I'm Joe Palca, sitting in for Ira Flatow. Later in the hour, digital privacy and dating the demise of the dinosaur, that's a lot of D's. But first, last week, Daimler, Ford and Nissan announced an alliance to work together on hydrogen fuel-cell technology for their passenger vehicles. That follows on the heels of a similar announcement last month from Toyota and BMW. Other major automakers have signaled that they're fuel cell, too. But where does the technology stand now, and what needs to be done to make the carmakers' hopes of getting tires on the road by 2017 a reality? What obstacles still stand in the way?

Jennifer Kurtz is a senior engineer and the leader of the Technology Validation Group in the NREL Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Technologies Program, part of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado. Jennifer Kurtz, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. JENNIFER KURTZ: Thank you, Joe, and I'm happy to be on the program today. PALCA: Oh, that's great. So you've - I mean, what have you been doing with these cars over at NREL? What's been the last few years? Have you been driving them? Have you driven them? KURTZ: Yeah, in fact I was driving a fuel-cell vehicle this morning. We went out and got some bagels for our center to celebrate the interview today. PALCA: So is it a different kind of experience? Do you feel like you're not driving - I mean, is it different from a normal car, You know, the cars we're used to, internal combustion? KURTZ: Yeah, no, the car has some unique characteristics, one of them being zero tailpipe emissions. It's quite quiet. But, you know, once you start driving the vehicle, it's really easy to forget that you're driving fuel-cell vehicle. It's just like a standard, traditional driving experience. And since we had visitors on site, we had five adults in the vehicle. It was very easy to carry a conversation. And it becomes just a standard mode of transportation. PALCA: So do they look any different from other cars, or can you put a fuel-cell engine into any - or a fuel-cell-equipped engine into any kind of car? KURTZ: You can use any car, actually. We have - the vehicles that we've analyzed, they range from compact sedans all the way up to SUVs. PALCA: So what's the advantage, do you think, of using a hydrogen-powered, full-cell-driven, fuel-cell energy care over, say, you know, one that you just plug in? KURTZ: Well, for the fuel-cell vehicle, the zero tailpipe emissions is one key aspects. These vehicles can be filled in three to five minutes, and right now there are hydrogen stations available 24/7 and have very traditional retail-style filling capabilities. Vehicles - excuse me. PALCA: No, go ahead. I was just going to ask, you said that there are filling stations available, but that made me wonder, you know, if I'm driving across the country, could I make it? I didn't think there were so many of those. KURTZ: No, not across the country. The hydrogen stations, as well as the vehicle deployments, are very targeted right now, and that - so that the investments are not spread too thin. So for instance California, Hawaii, the Northeast all have focused activities in fuel cell and hydrogen deployment. So for instances there is a pipeline station in Southern California. You can drive up and fill up. It looks very similar to a traditional gasoline pump. And fill your vehicle quickly and drive off. And with the vehicles, we validated a 250-plus-mile range on the vehicles we've analyzed. We've also participated in an on-road driving evaluation in collaboration with Toyota and Savannah River National Laboratory. The results of that evaluation was a possible 431-mile on-road range. So range is another key aspect of fuel-cell vehicles. PALCA: Right, so is that - I mean, we talked at the beginning, I said at the beginning about the obstacles. Is getting that kind of hydrogen infrastructure or the fueling infrastructure in place something that's one of the roadblocks to getting these cars on the road more widely? KURTZ: Yes, that is a challenge. And one of the ways that we're working on that challenge is through highly collaborative relationships between automakers, energy industries and government, and that's state and federal government. So these activities include working groups to identify how to make the investment in stations. It's also looking at scenario analyses so that we can understand risks with station deployment and really look at market and regulations and policies to help make sure that we're putting early stations in or the next generation of stations in key areas. PALCA: Well, let's take a call from one of our listeners. We've got quite a few. And let's go first to Molly(ph) in Hillsboro, California. Molly, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. MOLLY: Hi, thank you. I was wondering two things. First, I'm wondering about the safety in terms of accidents on the road, it being hydrogen and all, and the second thing is I was wondering if there are plans in place to keep the manufacture and such in America. KURTZ: Yes, so with regard to safety, the vehicles that we've analyzed through the support of the Department of Energy Fuel Cell Technologies Office, has had a very strong safety record. Safety is a key aspect to the vehicle and station deployment. It includes things like hydrogen sensing, alarms, control strategies to make sure that if there is a situation that the systems are shut down appropriately and quickly and safely. Traffic accidents are common. With hundreds of fuel-cell vehicles on the road, we've actually some fuel-cell vehicles that have been in non-related hydrogen accidents. All onboard safety mechanisms reacted appropriately, and we didn't see released hydrogen. And just from my personal perspective, I feel completely safe driving a hydrogen fuel-cell vehicle around, having my family and the people that I love in those vehicles. PALCA: And I don't suppose you really have that much to say, Jennifer Kurtz, about whether or not these cars are built in America. KURTZ: Well, you know, it's - you know, it's certainly an international effort. We've got the - just the OEMs that you mentioned at the beginning of the program. They're - it's international. So we do have deployments in the United States, and you're exactly right. In terms of manufacturing, that's outside of my spectrum. PALCA: Yeah, let's take another cal now and go to Matt(ph) in Rockford, Illinois. Matt, you're on SCIENCE FRIDAY. MATT: Hey, hello there, how are you guys doing? PALCA: Great. KURTZ: Great. MATT: I have a question for you in regards to electrolysis and type of a hybrid fuel-cell vehicle. I've created a little HHO system run my whatchamacallit, my lawn mower. It seems to work. I cut the consumption in pretty much half. I've seen people on the Internet do the same things for their trucks, except they just purely run off of electrolysis, the HHO systems. Would you guys ever consider doing something like that? Because I know the hydrogen systems that you guys are talking about, the infrastructures, you know, implement the stuff would be, you know, amazing in the cost it would take for the taxpayer to put up with the bill. KURTZ: Well, how about we have a - there are a number of ways to produce hydrogen. And we have four fuel-cell vehicles on loan at NREL's campus fom Toyota. Our hydrogen is actually produced through electrolysis that's powered by wind and solar. So a colleague has stated our fuel-cell vehicles are driving around today based on hydrogen produced from wind that blew last week. So that's an example of an exciting way to produce hydrogen. There's also an example a trigeneration system right now in Southern California at a wastewater treatment facility. This facility or this system uses biogas to fuel a fuel cell, and it co-produces heat, power and hydrogen for light-duty fuel-cell vehicles. So there are a wide range of possibilities and ways to produce hydrogen right now that are being worked on. PALCA: So I've been wondering, you were talking earlier about the safety of these systems. I heard a very interesting lecture some weeks ago about these solid-state systems, some sort of a solid material that couldn't explode, that would be recharged, and you would sort of move it in and out, not really just a gas tank of hydrogen but something a little different. Do you know about those? KURTZ: Well, my area of expertise is looking at and validating fuel-cell vehicles that are on the road today. Those fuel-cell vehicles are using compressed gasses, as you mentioned. Most of the vehicles are at 700 bar pressure. And so we've seen very strong safety records with those tanks. I think, as I mentioned, I feel comfortable with those fuel-cell systems and that onboard hydrogen storage system. PALCA: So is there one thing at this point that you think is a barrier to getting these cars on the road? Is there something that - I mean, what would prevent it, for example, from making it by 2017? KURTZ: Well, I think there are challenges that are being worked on. We talked about hydrogen infrastructure. I would say cost and durability are also two challenges remaining. I think what we've seen is a progression in terms of technology development. For instance the vehicles that we looked at very early on, so this would be approximately 2003 technology, within the last decade, the range was - we've seen improvement in range, in freeze capability, in durability. And we've also - DOE has funded projects that have seen 80 percent cost reduction in fuel-cell systems. We think with the partnerships, the investments that are being made by private industry, as well as government, will continue to see costs come down. But we certainly need to leverage economies of scale and investments across the board. PALCA: Well, I'm wondering: What are costs? I mean, is this car going to be - are these first cars going to be comparable to what a standard car is going to cost, or are they going to be a lot more? KURTZ: In terms of specific costs, I don't have the answer for you. PALCA: Of course not. KURTZ: But we have seen with all advanced vehicle technologies that there is a price premium associated with those technologies. So I expect that to be the case. But the partnerships, the recent announcements by the automakers have identified cost as a key area for development, whether they're looking to go in terms of the production scale. For instance Hyundai has also announced recently they've kicked off their series production of up to 1,000 fuel-cell systems. So we should see in each phase of the deployment and wide-scale commercialization, or working towards wide-scale commercialization, that those costs won't come down. PALCA: OK, well, we'll have to leave it there. We've run out of time. Jennifer Kurtz is a senior engineer and the leader of the Technology Validation Group in the NREL Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Technologies Program, part of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado. Thanks for joining me today. KURTZ: Well, thank you very much for having me on. PALCA: And when we come back, digital privacy. Do you own any of your personal data? We'll be right back after this short break. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)PALCA: This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)PALCA: This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR.

I heard a very interesting lecture some weeks ago about these solid-state systems, some sort of a solid material that couldn't explode, that would be recharged, and you would sort of move it in and out, not really just a gas tank of hydrogen but something a little different. Do you know about those? KURTZ: Well, my area of expertise is looking at and validating fuel-cell vehicles that are on the road today. Those fuel-cell vehicles are using compressed gasses, as you mentioned. Most of the vehicles are at 700 bar pressure. And so we've seen very strong safety records with those tanks. I think, as I mentioned, I feel comfortable with those fuel-cell systems and that onboard hydrogen storage system. PALCA: So is there one thing at this point that you think is a barrier to getting these cars on the road? Is there something that - I mean, what would prevent it, for example, from making it by 2017? KURTZ: Well, I think there are challenges that are being worked on. We talked about hydrogen infrastructure. I would say cost and durability are also two challenges remaining. I think what we've seen is a progression in terms of technology development. For instance the vehicles that we looked at very early on, so this would be approximately 2003 technology, within the last decade, the range was - we've seen improvement in range, in freeze capability, in durability. And we've also - DOE has funded projects that have seen 80 percent cost reduction in fuel-cell systems. We think with the partnerships, the investments that are being made by private industry, as well as government, will continue to see costs come down. But we certainly need to leverage economies of scale and investments across the board. PALCA: Well, I'm wondering: What are costs? I mean, is this car going to be - are these first cars going to be comparable to what a standard car is going to cost, or are they going to be a lot more? KURTZ: In terms of specific costs, I don't have the answer for you. PALCA: Of course not. KURTZ: But we have seen with all advanced vehicle technologies that there is a price premium associated with those technologies. So I expect that to be the case. But the partnerships, the recent announcements by the automakers have identified cost as a key area for development, whether they're looking to go in terms of the production scale. For instance Hyundai has also announced recently they've kicked off their series production of up to 1,000 fuel-cell systems. So we should see in each phase of the deployment and wide-scale commercialization, or working towards wide-scale commercialization, that those costs won't come down. PALCA: OK, well, we'll have to leave it there. We've run out of time. Jennifer Kurtz is a senior engineer and the leader of the Technology Validation Group in the NREL Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Technologies Program, part of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado. Thanks for joining me today. KURTZ: Well, thank you very much for having me on. PALCA: And when we come back, digital privacy. Do you own any of your personal data? We'll be right back after this short break. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) PALCA: This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR.

I'm Rachel Martin. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MARTIN: A few months ago, I showed a couple of friends around our NPR studios and we went down to the main newsroom just minutes before show time. They were shocked. Where was the news-making mayhem, they asked, the din of communication, all the last-minute directions? Why is it so quiet? I said all of that is happening; it's just happening online. Like almost every other kind of workplace these days, most of our communication between our colleagues, even those sitting just a few feet away, is on email. This week on the program, we're exploring how technology affects our relationships, and that includes what happens at work. Shayne Hughes is a CEO from the Bay Area, and he thought his staff had become way too dependent on email to communicate, so he launched an experiment: no internal email for one whole week. SHAYNE HUGHES: I announced it in a Thursday staff meeting. So, the very next day, I came in and I took care of a few things and I realized I felt this emptiness because there wasn't a slew of things coming at me. And so my first thought was what should I be doing with my time right now? You know, I'm so used to being reactive to these things coming at me. And part of what happened with my team is that something similar - one woman in particular was very upset because she delegates a lot of her work to her assistants through email and she just thought the world was going to end. MARTIN: It didn't occur to her that she could just walk out and talk with her assistant? HUGHES: We're habitual. We just get in this very reactive do - react-do, react-do - react mode. And in fact, yeah, we're not very thoughtful. And so something very obvious doesn't occur to us because we're just in survival. And I think she was in survival with all the many things she was trying to do and what she was trying to delegate, and it was a coping system she had developed. It wasn't the best one, but it was what she had been able to create. MARTIN: Can email sometimes be useful in a work environment because it can be kind of a safe zone? HUGHES: I think we have a tendency to interpret judgment in people's emails, or, you know, if there's a lack of warmth at the end it means they're angry - or capitals. I mean, there's all these ways in which we try to read into this set of words on the page that if we were in front of the person I think we would see more, how they're saying it or with what tone they say it, or I might be able a question to clarify what they mean. And because I don't have the person in front of me, I often find that we can be a little harsher than we might otherwise be. Now, I do have, in my company, I have a relationship with someone that's a little tense. And at different moments in time, he or I have summarized what our thoughts were about this situation or what was going on or what the conflict was by email and send it to the other person. But it was really a sub-tool that came on the foundation of us being committed to working through this issue, as opposed the first symptom that there was a problem. MARTIN: Were there people who said to you, you know, this didn't work for me. This was not helpful. I want to go back to the way it was. HUGHES: I got a lot of that during the week, I can tell you. And part of my challenge was email is this tool that is quite powerful and it's really embedded in how we do work. And I didn't think that we needed to eradicate email all together. I just couldn't tell anymore when it was useful to use it and when it wasn't. And what we did at the end of the week is we talked together about the moments in which email actually would have been a more effective way than talking. And we agreed that that was how we could use email. So, we do have a limited acceptable use of email. But I don't think there's anyone in my company right now that is unhappy with the change we made. I mean, do you know anyone who would like more email? MARTIN: No. HUGHES: Yeah. MARTIN: I do not. I mean, my email box is overwhelmed, and I think that's something that a lot of people feel. So, this week, we're taking a look at intimacy and technology, and the workplace isn't exactly where you would think that you would have intimate relationships, but it's a kind of intimacy when you're working closely with colleagues. How did you look at relationships changing? I mean, did people talk to one another more? Did they have closer, more productive conversations? More honest conversations? HUGHES: They absolutely did. I'd love just to mention this question about intimacy in the workplace. I actually feel quite strongly about this, that one of our problems in the workplace in general is that there's not enough intimacy, where I'm able to express authentically what's going on for me and feel like it's being heard and received without judgment. And I think a lot of what's missing for the really productive conversations, or the ones about performance or difficult interpersonal issues, are that they're uncomfortable. And by definition then they become intimate, if we have them. And I think part of why it's easy to go to email is that it's just more comfortable. It's more comfortable to sort of say that thing or not say or say it more harshly than I would but not actually step into the one-on-one and to deal with the disagreement and the different worldviews and perspective on things and to work through that constructive conflict. I mentioned this woman. We still have this policy around our emails. We're human, so we go through waves of more and less stringence(ph). But she's really maintained this new framework she has with her assistant. And. . . MARTIN: She liked it. HUGHES: She liked it. And in fact she's like I never asked by email how her weekend was or vice versa. I mean, they got along fine before, but I think they have a deeper personal relationship. And that's one of those intangibles that's really satisfying for people. MARTIN: Shayne Hughes is a CEO who decided to eliminate email for his company for an entire week. Shayne, thanks so much for talking with us. HUGHES: It was my pleasure. MARTIN: We want to hear how technology has changed your personal and professional relationships. Connect with us on Twitter.

If so, you may want to turn the radio up for our next segment. All throughout the program today, we're exploring how the digital devices that make our lives more convenient can make our personal relationships more complicated, especially the romantic variety. That's what Edward Hallowell told us. DR. EDWARD HALLOWELL: My name is Edward Hallowell. I'm an M. D. , a psychiatrist. MARTIN: Hallowell says he sees couples whose problems stem from their attachment to technology a lot. HALLOWELL: All the time, every day; it comes up all the time where the one spouse is literally alienated by the ongoing presence of an iPhone or a laptop in their conversations. MARTIN: Our devices can distract us from our partners. And over time, he says that can erode emotional intimacy. HALLOWELL: You really do need time and attention in order to feel empathy, in order to feel trust, in order to feel closeness. Particularly busy working couples don't know how to turn it off. MARTIN: So, there are downsides to our digital habits. But some couples say technology has actually brought them closer together. ROB COTTINGHAM: We embrace technology and we embrace each other. MARTIN: This is Rob Cottingham and his wife. ALEXANDRA SAMUEL: I'm Alexandra when I'm Alexandra Samuel. But feel free to call me Alex. MARTIN: These two have made social media an integral part of their marriage. They tweet each other so much that they won a Shorty Award - a social media award for best Twitter couple. They also curate their tweets on a website. Alexandra says the key to keeping technology in its place within a romantic partnership is to be deliberate about how you use it. SAMUEL: For us, the question is always is this something that's actually strengthening our relationship? Or is this something that is distracting from it? COTTINGHAM: And we found and kind of negotiated boundaries with technology. I think that one of the cool things is the way that it augments the communication that we're having face-to-face instead of taking away or distracting from it. MARTIN: Can you give me an example of a time when you were both online and in some way, and one of you said to the other: you know what, I think we should stop? (LAUGHTER)SAMUEL: No. Well, so here's the thing, Rachel. The beautiful thing about our marriage is we found another person who shares the same level of connectivity compulsion. (LAUGHTER)COTTINGHAM: So I think, too, there are times where will notice that there is a conversation that's going to work a lot better face-to-face. You know, where you're able to convey emotions more richly or capture nuance or, you know, avoid saying something that's going to be to be misunderstood, and put the devices down from either end of the sofa and actually turn to each other and talk. (LAUGHTER)MARTIN: You're exaggerating, but does that happen? Are you guys texting each other in the house? SAMUEL: Oh, yeah. Oh, we're not exaggerating at all. I mean, it is not atypical for us to be sitting side-by-side in bed, on the sofa, out for dinner and be tweeting. I know that sounds crazy. MARTIN: It kind of sounds crazy. SAMUEL: Well, so I think what is helpful to understand is we're both people who love to play with words. So when we're tweeting back-and-forth, it's just we're playing with tweets or we're playing with the Internet; we're shooting links back and forth. MARTIN: Really using the medium. SAMUEL: Yeah, exactly. MARTIN: We talked to one therapist who said that technology in some ways strips away the messiness of working out conflicts. And that, that is not necessarily where intimacy happens. Have you to thought about that? SAMUEL: Well, you know, I'm always skeptical of any broad statements about technology does this or technology does that. I mean, technology isn't neutral, but people can also use technology to make things very messy, very dramatic. And, you know, you really do see that full spectrum online the same way you see a full spectrum offline. I don't think it really creates distance for us. I think, if anything, it brings us closer together. But that's, again, because part of the reason we connected is 'cause we're both huge geeks. (LAUGHTER)COTTINGHAM: I think it also speaks to the need to examine things that are large part of your relationship and a large part of the way that you interact, whether it's the way that you talk with each other face-to-face or the way that you're tweeting back-and-forth, or sharing things on Facebook. It is important to step back and ask yourself, you know, how is this working for us, and not just how is this working for, you know, the median population or the latest people to be profiled on the front page of a newspaper or on a radio show. But how is this working for the people that I care most about? (LAUGHTER)MARTIN: Is everything is fair game when it comes to what you tweet about? Or are there some things that you think, hey, Alex, why did you bring that up on Twitter or Facebook? That was something that we should keep to ourselves? COTTINGHAM: I think that arguing on Facebook or Twitter is an enormous mistake. There are conversations that you need to have face-to-face, because you need to be able to pick up on those subconscious cues and understand where somebody is vulnerable or expressing something beyond what they're saying, and where you're able to do that active process of loving the other person. And it's very difficult to do that using the ASCII character set. MARTIN: Alexander Samuel and Rob Cottingham. Thanks so much for talking with us, both of you. We really appreciate it.

I'm Rachel Martin. (SOUNDBITE OF SMARTPHONE GAME)MARTIN: You can learn a lot about someone on a long car ride, especially if you turn the radio off and put away the smartphones. Sherry Turkle teaches social studies at MIT, and she says car rides are especially useful for parents trying to get through to their teenagers. SHERRY TURKLE: The thing about a car ride is that it's one of the few places where you can slow things down because, you know, teenagers are - it's hard to talk to them. That's why they're so eager to reach for something that distracts them. And to have a conversation - which, you look out the window and exchange pleasantries and then gradually, you know, some little thing will come, and then you talk about that. And some other little thing will come, and you talk about that. That's how conversations start to happen. And I think that that's very good for you, and that's very good for the children in your family, to realize that - what we're losing is just the sense of the pleasure of each other's company, and that that's part of conversation, too. MARTIN: Today on the show, we've been looking at how technology affects our personal relationships. We're going to turn our attention now to the family dynamic. We just heard Sherry Turkle say that car rides are prime time to connect with kids. The other opportunity comes at the dinner table. SUE JORDAN: I tried to keep these four men - boys - from eating, but they're eating. (LAUGHTER)MARTIN: This is the Jordan household. There's mom and dad - Sue and David. S. JORDAN: . . . the least techno-savvy person 'cause he never. . . DAVID JORDAN: I can put it away. S. JORDAN: . . . answers his phone. D. JORDAN: I can compartamentalize my life. MARTIN: And five kids. Two off at college, and three still at home. BRIAN JORDAN: I'm Brian. I'm 16. KEVIN JORDAN: I'm Kevin Jordan. I'm 11 years old. DAVID JORDAN: I'm David. I'm 13. MARTIN: The Jordans are kind of a classic example of a family trying to figure out how to use technology without feeling disconnected from one another. We stopped by their house on Friday night as they were just finishing up a couple delivery pizzas. (SOUNDBITE OF FAMILY CHATTER)MARTIN: They have laptops. Everyone has a cellphone, although only Mom and Dad and the oldest kids are allowed to have smartphones. And they have an iPad that everyone shares although Sue uses it most, to connect with her daughter Kelly, who is at college in Pennsylvania. S. JORDAN: Hi, Boo. D. JORDAN: Did you eat yet, hon? KELLY JORDAN: Yeah. You want to see outside? It's snowing. S. JORDAN: Is it? Oh, you've still got your lights on. MARTIN: Kelly, we should say, is a texting fiend. Once when she was in high school, she was sending around 15,000 text messages a month. Her parents had to take her phone away for a while, as punishment. S. JORDAN: All right honey, bye. D. JORDAN: See you later, honey. S. JORDAN: I love you. KELLY: Bye-bye. MARTIN: The Jordans don't allow their two youngest kids to be on Facebook, but they don't put limits on cellphones. The kids can use them anytime. And while we're talking around the kitchen table, 16-year-old Brian is quietly tapping out messages on his iPhone. I ask Sue and David if they have any concerns about raising kids who are so engaged with their devices. S. JORDAN: The biggest limitations, that we talk about all the time, is just making sure that our kids still interact with each other and, you know - articulate in conversation with adults. And with our oldest son interviewing, you know, for jobs and things like that, we wanted to make sure that they had good eye contract and still maintained, and didn't get disrupted by this. D. JORDAN: Granted, when we're all old and gone and buried and not - you know, they get hired by the next generation, it won't be as important. But for now, that's my concern - is it's a mix between, you know, having the technology, but you still have to be able to relate and interact with people. MARTIN: Their son Brian looks up from his phone to respond. BRIAN: Yeah, he says this a lot. (LAUGHTER)D. JORDAN: I annoy him with that. But hopefully, it sticks. BRIAN: Yeah, I mean, it makes sense. It gets a little old after awhile, but. . . (LAUGHTER)MARTIN: After the kids disperse, I ask Sue and David if the technology makes parenting tougher, in some ways. Do you think it ever gets in the way of really figuring out what's really going on in your kids' life? S. JORDAN: Oh, I think so. I mean, I think it can 'cause you don't know. Things can happen so quickly, like you said. Like, they could come home happy and then all of a sudden, things are upset because there was an exchange on the phone or something, that you're not aware of. You know, when we were growing up, it had to be a phone call into the house - like, you could isolate what happened in the last hour because they didn't talk to anybody, they didn't see anybody. Here, you have no idea how fast their world's going. D. JORDAN: Well, in some ways - though I remember growing up, though, too. At dinnertime, Dad, Dad - up, how was your day? Fine. And no one ever - we didn't really give information. They just - you said, dinner was fine. Whether it was good or not, everything was fine. So. . . S. JORDAN: But I can say - do you remember when our daughter did have an issue with her phone, and we took it away? As devastating as that was to her, wasn't that the best time with her? D. JORDAN: Oh, yeah. S. JORDAN: She sat with us and talked to us, and looked at us. . . (LAUGHTER)S. JORDAN: You know, and it was the age, too. But I did enjoy that. MARTIN: The Jordans settle into a Friday night ritual. D. JORDAN: Don't lean back. S. JORDAN: Kevin, come here, honey. MARTIN: They sit down in the living room; TV is on. Sue's oldest son, Brendan, calls from Chicago. S. JORDAN: Hi, Brendan. Hi! MARTIN: The two younger boys fidget on the couch. David does some channel surfing on the TV, while 16-year-old Brian sits at the far end of the couch, still tapping out messages on his phone. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. I'm Rachel Martin. (SOUNDBITE OF SMARTPHONE GAME) MARTIN: You can learn a lot about someone on a long car ride, especially if you turn the radio off and put away the smartphones. Sherry Turkle teaches social studies at MIT, and she says car rides are especially useful for parents trying to get through to their teenagers. SHERRY TURKLE: The thing about a car ride is that it's one of the few places where you can slow things down because, you know, teenagers are - it's hard to talk to them. That's why they're so eager to reach for something that distracts them. And to have a conversation - which, you look out the window and exchange pleasantries and then gradually, you know, some little thing will come, and then you talk about that. And some other little thing will come, and you talk about that. That's how conversations start to happen. And I think that that's very good for you, and that's very good for the children in your family, to realize that - what we're losing is just the sense of the pleasure of each other's company, and that that's part of conversation, too. MARTIN: Today on the show, we've been looking at how technology affects our personal relationships. We're going to turn our attention now to the family dynamic. We just heard Sherry Turkle say that car rides are prime time to connect with kids. The other opportunity comes at the dinner table. SUE JORDAN: I tried to keep these four men - boys - from eating, but they're eating. (LAUGHTER) MARTIN: This is the Jordan household. There's mom and dad - Sue and David. S. JORDAN: . . . the least techno-savvy person 'cause he never. . . DAVID JORDAN: I can put it away. S. JORDAN: . . . answers his phone. D. JORDAN: I can compartamentalize my life. MARTIN: And five kids. Two off at college, and three still at home. BRIAN JORDAN: I'm Brian. I'm 16. KEVIN JORDAN: I'm Kevin Jordan. I'm 11 years old. DAVID JORDAN: I'm David. I'm 13. MARTIN: The Jordans are kind of a classic example of a family trying to figure out how to use technology without feeling disconnected from one another. We stopped by their house on Friday night as they were just finishing up a couple delivery pizzas. (SOUNDBITE OF FAMILY CHATTER) MARTIN: They have laptops. Everyone has a cellphone, although only Mom and Dad and the oldest kids are allowed to have smartphones. And they have an iPad that everyone shares although Sue uses it most, to connect with her daughter Kelly, who is at college in Pennsylvania. S. JORDAN: Hi, Boo. D. JORDAN: Did you eat yet, hon?

Maybe you'll post a photo of your loved one on Facebook, tweet out a love poem or text message your secret crush. There's no doubt that our level of connectedness through smartphones and social media has made it a whole lot easier to reach out and touch those we love - at least virtually. But is there a downside to all this connectedness? Throughout the program today, we're going to explore a few of the places in our lives where technology can actually drive us apart and make real intimacy tough. In our romantic relationships. . . ALEXANDRA SAMUEL: I'd like to say we do say hello to each other face to face before we switch on any devices. MARTIN: . . . with our kids. SUE JORDAN: Why do you have this phone, David? Tell me why you don't have your nice new phone. DAVID JORDAN: Oh, I left it in my pocket and went down to the laundry room. . . S. JORDAN: And? D. JORDAN: . . . it went in the washer. MARTIN: . . . even in the workplace. SHAYNE HUGHES: Email is this tool that is quite powerful and it's really embedded in how we do work. MARTIN: So, how did we get here? Sherry Turkle has thought a lot about this. She's a professor of social studies of science and technology at MIT, and we asked her if our digital devices make us more or less capable of real communication. SHERRY TURKLE: Well, the answer to that question is - it's complicated. So many people have shared with me their stories of how unburdened by bodies, social status, age-height-weight. A certain deeper truth about themselves comes out to another person they'd met online. But at the same time, I think as we live in a culture where increasingly I'd rather text than talk, after interviewing hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people about their current communications, that's the phrase that I get most. We're also moving into a world where we're truncating our communications, making them briefer and briefer, where sometimes we're willing to sacrifice conversation for mere connection. MARTIN: Isn't there though an argument that would say, you know, I can fly off the handle in person in one-on-one, face-to-face interactions, especially if it's over something that's tense, that's confrontational, and that maybe it's beneficial to take a deep breath and write an email, where I can be more deliberate and choose my words carefully. TURKLE: Yes, absolutely. I've interviewed many husbands and wives actually who say that they prefer to do their fighting over email because they can have that cool-down. And that's an interesting use of the technology. I don't want to say that inventive people who are self-reflective about can use email constructively. On the other hand, there's something very useful about learning how to be in a conversation where you have strong feelings and to experience someone else's anger and your own, and to control your feelings but to experience the humanity. . . MARTIN: And the messiness of that. TURKLE: . . . and the messiness. And we're sort of cleaning up human relationships and making them less messy. For example, kids today really don't know how to apologize. I have a great example of a young boy about 13 who wants to get out of dinner with his grandmother and he wants to just send a message: not coming to dinner - send. And his father says to him - because they live in the same neighborhood - you go over and tell her you're not coming to dinner, or you at least call. Because when he calls, he's going to hear the grandmother say, but I've put the chicken in the oven. Your grandfather is waiting to hear about what you're doing at school. In other words, that sense that someone is waiting for him. That there's expectations, that there's human desire and expectation here. And that's what we're getting out of. We just type: I'm not coming - send. MARTIN: I mean, we all do that, right? It's a lot easier to just write an email really quickly and say, sorry, can't make it. TURKLE: Exactly. And I think that that's the kind of thing where we're sort of taking shortcuts and we're shortchanging ourselves. MARTIN: But you're not arguing that we wistfully look back on years past and a different time. We live in the world we live in with the devices and technology we have and it improves our lives immeasurably in many ways. You're a busy working mom. I imagine you use technology. TURKLE: All the time. I'm not arguing any kind of retro position. I'm arguing that if you want to put intimate conversation in your life, you need to leave a little space for it. It is not a luddite thing to say or it is not a retro thing to say. I love texting you. I love keeping in touch with text. But for this conversation, we really need to talk. We all get to keep our phones and love our phones. But now we're into a more mature use of the technology, we also need to be able to say for this conversation we need to talk. MARTIN: Sherry Turkle is a professor of social studies of science and technology at MIT. Sherry, thanks so much for talking with us. TURKLE: My pleasure.

The big question is: Do they make people more violent in the real world? And while the answer to that question is unclear, one thing is indisputable: Violence sells. The most popular video game franchise is Call of Duty, where killing is the goal. NPR's Sami Yenigun looks into why violent games appeal so much to so many. SAMI YENIGUN, BYLINE: There are over 40 million copies of Call of Duty in the U. S. One of them is at iStrategyLabs in Washington, D. C. It's a digital marketing agency, and in the center of the office is an 80-inch television, where employees sometimes take breaks and shoot at each other. MEGAN ZLOCK: Yeah, it's a military game where basically you have an objective on each level, and you need to, like, pass the objective whether that's getting past. . . SARAH SUGARMAN: Checkpoints. ZLOCK: . . . like super soldiers. YENIGUN: Megan Zlock and Sarah Sugarman are gamers. Sugarman likes playing RPGs or role-playing games. She says, for the most part, they're less violent than first-person shooters like \"Call of Duty. \" Zlock, on the other hand, likes her games bloody, especially \"Mortal Kombat\" and \"Diablo. \"ZLOCK: You're really just plowing through and killing, like, millions of demons throughout the progress of the story. YENIGUN: A story which, she says, is better with violence. ZLOCK: If you want to create a good narrative, you need to create conflict, and, like, violence is a really easy way to create conflict. YENIGUN: Both Zlock and Sugarman, along with the dozen or so people around the TV, say that violence doesn't have to be part of a good game, but sometimes, it makes the game better. Dr. Douglas Gentile, who studies the effect of violent video games on children, says violent games tap into a primal instinct. DR. DOUGLAS GENTILE: There are two things that, you know, force us to pay attention. One is violence, and the other is sex. Whenever either of those are present in our environment, they have survival value for us. YENIGUN: Gentile explains there's a very basic reason that a lot of people think violent games are more exciting than, say, \"Tetris. \"GENTILE: These gamers do have an adrenaline rush, and it's noradrenaline, and it's testosterone, and it's cortisol. These are the so-called stress hormones. That's exactly the same cocktail of hormones you drop into your bloodstream if I punched you. YENIGUN: Getting punched in real life, not fun. GENTILE: But when you know you're safe, having that really heightened sense of stress can be fun. YENIGUN: Or as Zach Solly of iStrategyLabs puts it. . . ZACH SOLLY: It just feels, like, awesome. YENIGUN: The palpable, frenetic energy that fills this room suggests that Zack Solly's opponents are feeling pretty awesome too. SOLLY: When I play this, like, since it is more realistic, like it is easier to, like, lose yourself in the game while you're playing it. YENIGUN: So violence provides thrills that we're hardwired to enjoy, and video games offer an immersive experience that were hardwired to crave, according to Gentile. He says there's an A, B and C of human motivation, and that video games hit all three. A is for autonomy. GENTILE: You're holding a controller so you are in control. YENIGUN: B is for belonging. GENTILE: If you play with other people or you have friends who play the same game or you play online, you also are meeting your belonging need. YENIGUN: C is for competence. GENTILE: They often train you how to play as you're playing, and so you start feeling competent. YENIGUN: Which brings us to a decades-old question: Do violent video games make people more violent? Gentile says his research shows that children who play more violent games by and large behave more aggressively. But he adds. . . GENTILE: That does not mean school shootings. YENIGUN: Gentile says we don't know if games turn people into murderers because the sample size is just too small. And that exposure to violent games is likely just one part of a bigger picture. GENTILE: Take the killers at Columbine High School. They had been bullied. They had psychiatric illnesses. And, yes, they also consumed a lot of media violence. No one of those things was the cause. YENIGUN: The people at iStrategyLabs playing \"Call of Duty\" aren't scientists, but they say something similar. Again, Zack Solly. SOLLY: I think that people who are going to be prone to violence might be affected by video games, but I think someone who is of, like, sound mind is not going to be affected by a violent movie or a violent video game.

I'm Robert Siegel. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: I'm Melissa Block. And we end the hour with All Tech Considered. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)BLOCK: As always, we kick things off with a look ahead at the week in tech. The big story this week comes from defense contracting giant Raytheon. It has developed data-mining software that tracks people and predicts their future locations using posts to social networks. NPR's Steve Henn joins us to talk about a software called RIOT, which stands for Rapid Information Overlay Technology. Steve, first, how did RIOT come to light? STEVE HENN, BYLINE: Well, for years now, the federal government has been pretty open about its desire for software that could help law enforcement sift through social media sites like Facebook. RIOT looks like it was developed to meet some of those needs, but it captured the limelight this week because a reporter at The Guardian newspaper in England got a hold of a video that demonstrates exactly what the software can do. BLOCK: And what is that? What can it do? HENN: Well, quite a bit, actually. In the demo video, Brian Urch, from Raytheon, shows off how it can piece together a pretty detailed map of where someone has traveled over time by analyzing posts on sites like Facebook, Foursquare and Twitter. In the video, Brian's guinea pig is a co-worker of his named Nick. BRIAN URCH: One of the things we've noticed is that when people take pictures and post them on the Internet using their smartphones that the phone will actually embed the latitude and longitude into the exit header data of that image. So we're going to take advantage of that by bringing down all the pictures where Nick has checked in and then placing those on Google Earth. HENN: What they got was a pretty fine-grained look at how Nick was moving around the country and the city where he lives. And with a tiny bit of analysis, they found patterns in his behavior like when he was most likely to work out. URCH: 6 a. m. appears to be obviously the most frequently visited time at the gym. So if you ever did want to try to get a hold of Nick or maybe get a hold of his laptop, you might want to visit the gym at 6 a. m. on Monday. BLOCK: So, Steve, that's the video for this data-mining software. I'm a little confused about how this is revolutionary, if it is. I mean, it's basically just consolidating a lot of information that's out there on these social networks that you mentioned - Foursquare, Facebook and Twitter. HENN: Yeah. That's right. That's what it does. And independent hackers built very similar software several years ago to try to demonstrate to people that this would be possible. I think what's been alarming to some is that it's a defense contractor that's making the software. And that if it is distributed and used widely, which it is not, yet, it would allow law enforcement to run these kinds of analyses over large groups of people very quickly all at once. It's sort of stalking at scale. And the other thing that's alarming about this is because we're all putting our information on these social networks voluntarily, there are very few checks built into the law that would prevent any organization from doing that. We're basically writing little newspaper columns about what we do every day. And so if someone builds software that aggregates all that information and analyzes it across thousands or even millions of people, it's technically pretty easy to do, but it gives them a lot of insight and actually a lot of predictive ability about how any of us are going to behave or where we might be or what we might do.

About 900 people currently track cyberwarfare. That's going up to around 5,000, even as other parts of the defense budget shrink. Now, we hear a lot about efforts at cyberdefense, defense against attack, but in the next three days, NPR's Tom Gjelten is going to talk with us about U. S. efforts to prepare for offensive operations in cyberwarfare. Hi, Tom. TOM GJELTEN, BYLINE: Hi, Steve. INSKEEP: Okay. We don't hear quite so much about the offensive side of this. GJELTEN: That's right. The government is not exactly upfront about this. Let me just give you one example. In July 2011, the Pentagon announces its cyber strategy - it's all about defending the country from cyberattacks, not one word about attacking the other guy. William Lynn, who was deputy secretary of defense at the time, spoke for the Pentagon. I was actually there and I had an opportunity to ask Lynn where in the strategy is there anything about offensive attacks. Here's what he said. WILLIAM LYNN: The thrust of the strategy, as you correctly identified, is defensive. It is protecting the networks because those networks undergird all of our capabilities, offensive and defensive. . . GJELTEN: Steve, we now know that was only part of the story. The military does not just protect computer networks here. U. S. cyber warriors attack enemy networks overseas. They go on the offense. INSKEEP: What are some examples? GJELTEN: Well, take Afghanistan, for example. Soldiers over there depend on computers for information sharing. You lose those computer links, you're in trouble. So when commanders set out to do an operation, a combat operation, they first have their cyber warriors preemptively go after the enemy computers. Here's Lieutenant General Richard Mills speaking at a military conference last August. LIEUTENANT GENERAL RICHARD MILLS: I can tell you as a commander in Afghanistan in the year 2010, I was able to use my cyber operations against my adversary with great impact. I was able to get inside his nets, infect his command and control, and in fact defend myself against his almost constant incursions to get inside my wire to affect my operations. INSKEEP: Get inside the enemy's nets, he says, the networks. GJELTEN: Infecting them. That is a cyber attack with cyber weapons. Here's another example, this one from back in 2009. The Air Force Chief of Staff at the time, General Norton Schwartz, speaking at the Brookings Institution said his airmen were prepared to carry out cyberattacks on another country's radar and missile installations before launching airstrikes against that country. Let's listen. GENERAL NORTON SCHWARTZ: Traditionally, we take down integrated air defenses via kinetic means. INSKEEP: Kinetic is physical. Bombing them. SCHWARTZ: But if it were possible to interrupt radar systems or surface-to-air missile systems via cyber, that would be another very powerful tool. . . INSKEEP: Wait, wait, wait. He said if it were possible. Is it possible to do this? GJELTEN: Yes. They can do it now. Remember, General Schwartz here was speaking more than three years ago. Now, in that case, and in Afghanistan, you have offensive cyberattacks carried out as part of a traditional combat operation, what the military calls kinetic operation, bombs and bullets. But the military is also carrying out offensive cyber-attacks on their own merits. I spoke with a former Air Force officer named Jason Healey about this. He now directs the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council and he keeps close track of what the U. S. military is doing with offensive cyber weapons. JASON HEALEY: It might happen that we'll use them as an adjunct to kinetic, but it's quite clear that we're using it quite a bit more freely. GJELTEN: The best example, Steve, would be Stuxnet, the cyber-weapon secretly used to damage nuclear installations in Iran. A U. S. official has privately confirmed to NPR what the New York Times reported last summer, that the United States had a role in developing Stuxnet. It was not used as part of any larger military operation against Iran. It was used on its own. But this is still officially a secret. As long as it's secret, there's no public discussion about the pros and cons of using a cyberweapon in this way. INSKEEP: Well, let's have some of that discussion right here. What are some of the downsides? GJELTEN: Well, you have to consider that using an offensive cyber weapon sets a precedent that other countries might then follow. This was a preemptive cyberattack. I'm talking about Stuxnet. It did not come in response to a provocation. It was used to deal with a potential threat, the Iranian nuclear program. So now other countries might feel they'd be justified in carrying out a preemptive cyberattack. And here's another issue. The Stuxnet worm instructed computers to damage industrial equipment. There's a fear now that someone else could modify or copy that code and turn it back against targets in the United States. This is the danger that Republican Congressman Mike Rogers focuses on. He's the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. REPRESENTATIVE MIKE ROGERS: Now that technology is out there, people are taking a look at it. We are just a few lines of code away from someone else getting close to a very sophisticated piece of malware that they either wittingly or unwittingly unleash across the world that causes huge, huge damage. INSKEEP: Okay. That sounds scary, Tom Gjelten. Is the U. S. government, the administration, focused on the implications of the policies they're pursuing? GJELTEN: It doesn't seem like it. We don't know what they're saying secretly or behind closed doors. Here's an analogy. The U. S. government for years has had what's called a declaratory policy regarding why it has nuclear weapons and when it would be justified to use them. There is nothing comparable for the use of cyber-weapons. So you have people like Congressman Rogers saying developments on this front are getting ahead of our thinking. ROGERS: The capabilities, I think, are keeping pace with technology. It's the policy that I worry about. We have not fully rounded out what our policies are. GJELTEN: Policies, like when is it justified to use a cyber-weapon for offensive purposes? What rules should apply? What are the risks? Jason Healy at the Atlantic Council says you start doing a lot of offensive operations without considering the consequences, you could create chaos in cyberspace. HEALEY: We're more likely to end up with a cyberspace where everybody is attacking everybody else 'cause we haven't built up the norms of trust. GJELTEN: Now, see, there are powerful arguments for using cyber-weapons. They're more precise than bombs, less likely to hurt innocent civilians, but these are new weapons and you would think the pros and cons of using them would be a subject for public debate. INSKEEP: Okay. Why isn't the U. S. government eager to have that debate? GJELTEN: Well, I've talked to some senior officials about this and they make a couple of points. One is they are edging closer to transparency here. Just as with drone warfare, they know there is pressure to be more open and they're gradually getting more open. Part of the problem is this area's so new, they're just not sure what to say, what authorities they have, who within the government has the authority to order cyber-attacks. A legal review of these issues has been underway and they are making progress. The other thing they say is that cyber is different. Most of the activities in the cyber domain are civilian. So for example, this analogy with nuclear weapons may just not apply. INSKEEP: Okay. So we're trying to pry open the door to a discussion here a little bit. NPR's Tom Gjelten will be with us the next few days. Where are you going to take us to tomorrow? GJELTEN: Tomorrow we're going to be talking about actual cyber weapons. Do you know, Steve, there's actually a global market in cyber weapons, kind of a cyber arms bazaar. We're going to talk about that tomorrow. INSKEEP: NPR's Tom Gjelten. Thanks. GJELTEN: Thank you.

Now there's a new battlefield - cyberspace. Countries, the United States included, are launching attacks on each other's computer networks. Software can be a lethal weapon. This week, NPR's Tom Gjelten is looking at the offensive side of cyber war. Today, the cyber arms market - how computer weapons are developed, bought and sold around the world. TOM GJELTEN, BYLINE: To understand how a cyber-attack works, think of it like a burglary. First, you have to get inside the place you're going to burgle. You do that by picking a lock or maybe you can sneak in through a back door someone left open. Only then, when you're inside, can you carry out the crime. Technologist Christopher Soghoian says it's the same thing when you attack a computer network. CHRISTOPHER SOGHOIAN: You need a way of getting in the door. You need a way of getting into the system that you're hacking into, whether it's the computer of a surveillance target or the computer running a nuclear power plant. So you need a way in. GJELTEN: Once you've found that way in, once you've penetrated a network, you instruct the computer to do what you want. But these are separate operations, and Soghoian says the first step in a cyber-attack is often the most challenging. SOGHOIAN: The code that you run that steals data, that taps the microphone, this is easy stuff to write. The code that gets in the door is really sophisticated, very difficult and completely unregulated. GJELTEN: Here's the trick. All computer systems linked to the Internet use applications like Internet Explorer or Adobe. These programs inevitably have bugs in them. Some are security flaws. They're like that back door someone neglected to lock. Cyber researchers call these bugs vulnerabilities because they expose the program to intruders just as an open window makes a house vulnerable to burglary. When security researchers found these bugs in the past, they'd report them to the software manufacturer so they could be patched. But then the cyber weapon designers came along and set their sights on the vulnerabilities. They'd actually call them back doors because they could serve as back doors into a network. They didn't want to patch them. They wanted to exploit them. The weapon designers especially liked the vulnerabilities nobody else knew about. In cyberspeak these are called zero days or O-days. Richard Bejtlich, a former cyber specialist in the Air Force, remembers the time back in the '90s when he first realized a software vulnerability was something a cyber weapon designer could exploit. RICHARD BEJTLICH: Myself and a couple other guys, we found a zero day vulnerability in Cisco routing equipment, and we looked at it and we said, did we really find this? We can really get into these Cisco routers? Yes, we can. So what did we do? Called up Cisco, told them, hey, we found this vulnerability, and they go, thank you for telling us, we'll work on fixing it. A couple days later, I'm talking to some of my friends who work on the offensive side of the unit and I said, yeah, we actually reported this O-day to Cisco. And they said, you did what? Why didn't you tell us? We could have used this to get into all these various hard targets. GJELTEN: To Bejtlich, a software flaw was a mistake to be corrected. But that was the view from the defensive side. Air Force guys assigned to offensive cyber operations saw that software flaw as an open door into the network they were trying to attack. BEJTLICH: We actually had a standing order past that point that said if you find something, you don't tell the vendor, you need to tell the offensive side, and then they'll decide what to do about it. GJELTEN: What this means is that if the military thinks a software flaw can be used for a cyber weapon, it may not want anyone else to know about it. Christopher Soghoian with the Speech Privacy and Technology Project at the ACLU says consumers, individuals and businesses could be the losers here. SOGHOIAN: I don't think they realize that their government knows about flaws that could be fixed and is sitting on them and exploiting them against other people rather than having them fixed. GJELTEN: That's just one issue. There's more. The greater interest there is in a capability to launch cyber attacks, the more demand there is for those software vulnerabilities, the back doors that allow an attacker to sneak into someone's network. There's now a global market for back doors. Soghoian says private researchers who discover a software flaw have a choice - alert the manufacturer and maybe get a little reward or share that vulnerability with a potential cyber-attacker for a big payoff. SOGHOIAN: For every researcher who's doing the right thing and getting, you know, the modest gift, there are plenty of researchers who are selling these things for what they deem to be the true market value. And the true market value is whatever governments and their middlemen are willing to pay. GJELTEN: Former Air Force officer Richard Bejtlich is on the private side himself now, as chief security officer at Mandiant, a cyber consultancy. He's not in the business of selling vulnerabilities to the highest bidder, but he knows other people who are. BEJTLICH: There seems to have been an explosion of interest in the last maybe two years, where the hot thing to do is to found a company with five of your buddies who are all really good at finding vulnerabilities and just start making money. GJELTEN: Essentially we're talking here about a cyber arms market. Not surprisingly, it operates mostly in the shadows, but at conference last weekend I caught up with one seller of back door vulnerabilities. His name is Donato Ferrante. He says he advertises his vulnerabilities through an email list. Clients see what back doors he has found into which software products, but they get only the barest information about the vulnerability. DONATO FERRANTE: If the customer wants to use the vulnerability, the customer needs to buy the vulnerability. This is just a sort of, you know, portfolio and then the customer needs to buy the details. GJELTEN: And would you sell them? FERRANTE: I mean if they want to buy, yeah. I mean this is our job. It's business. GJELTEN: It's business. Between the U. S. military, law enforcement and intelligence agencies, the U. S. government is a big buyer of vulnerabilities or back doors. But it's not only the U. S. developing cyber weapons. So are other governments. Private companies wanting to penetrate an adversary's network may also be in the market for back doors. So could cyber criminals, for that matter, or even groups plotting a cyberterrorist attack. No wonder vulnerability sellers don't want to say much about their business. Donato Ferrante says he's based in Europe, but won't say which country. I want to know more. What's this world like that you work in? FERRANTE: It's just, you know, I don't see, you know, bad guys or good guys. It's just business. GJELTEN: No bad guys or good guys, just clients. After all, Ferrante says, he's just selling information. FERRANTE: The way the information, you know, would be used, it's up to the customer.  It's not, you know, up to us. GJELTEN: At the moment, there is virtually no regulation of the back door market in the United States, no mandatory reporting of vulnerability sales, for example. Richard Bejtlich of Mandiant. BEJTLICH: I am shocked that this has not been regulated, because to me it would be so easy for a legislator to say, we're going to do arms control. We're going to keep this out of the hands of the bad guys. You're going to need a license to have these tools. And who's going to stand up and say, no, you have to have cyber weapons. I mean, if you wanted to look for an easy way to have legislators appear to be doing something, this would be it. GJELTEN: But developments in cyber warfare and cyber weaponry are moving so fast that our thinking about this new domain of combat and crime just can't keep pace. And it's not just governments finding new ways to attack each other. Private firms frustrated by their inability to defend their networks against cyber-attacks are increasingly going on the offense themselves. That story tomorrow. Tom Gjelten, NPR News. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:  Wars have long been fought on land, on sea and in the air. Now there's a new battlefield - cyberspace. Countries, the United States included, are launching attacks on each other's computer networks. Software can be a lethal weapon. This week, NPR's Tom Gjelten is looking at the offensive side of cyber war. Today, the cyber arms market - how computer weapons are developed, bought and sold around the world. TOM GJELTEN, BYLINE: To understand how a cyber-attack works, think of it like a burglary. First, you have to get inside the place you're going to burgle. You do that by picking a lock or maybe you can sneak in through a back door someone left open. Only then, when you're inside, can you carry out the crime. Technologist Christopher Soghoian says it's the same thing when you attack a computer network. CHRISTOPHER SOGHOIAN: You need a way of getting in the door. You need a way of getting into the system that you're hacking into, whether it's the computer of a surveillance target or the computer running a nuclear power plant. So you need a way in. GJELTEN: Once you've found that way in, once you've penetrated a network, you instruct the computer to do what you want. But these are separate operations, and Soghoian says the first step in a cyber-attack is often the most challenging. SOGHOIAN: The code that you run that steals data, that taps the microphone, this is easy stuff to write. The code that gets in the door is really sophisticated, very difficult and completely unregulated. GJELTEN: Here's the trick. All computer systems linked to the Internet use applications like Internet Explorer or Adobe. These programs inevitably have bugs in them. Some are security flaws. They're like that back door someone neglected to lock. Cyber researchers call these bugs vulnerabilities because they expose the program to intruders just as an open window makes a house vulnerable to burglary. When security researchers found these bugs in the past, they'd report them to the software manufacturer so they could be patched. But then the cyber weapon designers came along and set their sights on the vulnerabilities. They'd actually call them back doors because they could serve as back doors into a network. They didn't want to patch them. They wanted to exploit them. The weapon designers especially liked the vulnerabilities nobody else knew about. In cyberspeak these are called zero days or O-days. Richard Bejtlich, a former cyber specialist in the Air Force, remembers the time back in the '90s when he first realized a software vulnerability was something a cyber weapon designer could exploit. RICHARD BEJTLICH: Myself and a couple other guys, we found a zero day vulnerability in Cisco routing equipment, and we looked at it and we said, did we really find this? We can really get into these Cisco routers? Yes, we can. So what did we do? Called up Cisco, told them, hey, we found this vulnerability, and they go, thank you for telling us, we'll work on fixing it. A couple days later, I'm talking to some of my friends who work on the offensive side of the unit and I said, yeah, we actually reported this O-day to Cisco. And they said, you did what? Why didn't you tell us? We could have used this to get into all these various hard targets. GJELTEN: To Bejtlich, a software flaw was a mistake to be corrected. But that was the view from the defensive side. Air Force guys assigned to offensive cyber operations saw that software flaw as an open door into the network they were trying to attack. BEJTLICH: We actually had a standing order past that point that said if you find something, you don't tell the vendor, you need to tell the offensive side, and then they'll decide what to do about it. GJELTEN: What this means is that if the military thinks a software flaw can be used for a cyber weapon, it may not want anyone else to know about it. Christopher Soghoian with the Speech Privacy and Technology Project at the ACLU says consumers, individuals and businesses could be the losers here. SOGHOIAN: I don't think they realize that their government knows about flaws that could be fixed and is sitting on them and exploiting them against other people rather than having them fixed. GJELTEN: That's just one issue. There's more. The greater interest there is in a capability to launch cyber attacks, the more demand there is for those software vulnerabilities, the back doors that allow an attacker to sneak into someone's network. There's now a global market for back doors. Soghoian says private researchers who discover a software flaw have a choice - alert the manufacturer and maybe get a little reward or share that vulnerability with a potential cyber-attacker for a big payoff. SOGHOIAN: For every researcher who's doing the right thing and getting, you know, the modest gift, there are plenty of researchers who are selling these things for what they deem to be the true market value. And the true market value is whatever governments and their middlemen are willing to pay. GJELTEN: Former Air Force officer Richard Bejtlich is on the private side himself now, as chief security officer at Mandiant, a cyber consultancy. He's not in the business of selling vulnerabilities to the highest bidder, but he knows other people who are. BEJTLICH: There seems to have been an explosion of interest in the last maybe two years, where the hot thing to do is to found a company with five of your buddies who are all really good at finding vulnerabilities and just start making money. GJELTEN: Essentially we're talking here about a cyber arms market. Not surprisingly, it operates mostly in the shadows, but at conference last weekend I caught up with one seller of back door vulnerabilities. His name is Donato Ferrante. He says he advertises his vulnerabilities through an email list. Clients see what back doors he has found into which software products, but they get only the barest information about the vulnerability. DONATO FERRANTE: If the customer wants to use the vulnerability, the customer needs to buy the vulnerability. This is just a sort of, you know, portfolio and then the customer needs to buy the details. GJELTEN: And would you sell them? FERRANTE: I mean if they want to buy, yeah. I mean this is our job. It's business. GJELTEN: It's business. Between the U. S. military, law enforcement and intelligence agencies, the U. S. government is a big buyer of vulnerabilities or back doors. But it's not only the U. S. developing cyber weapons. So are other governments. Private companies wanting to penetrate an adversary's network may also be in the market for back doors. So could cyber criminals, for that matter, or even groups plotting a cyberterrorist attack. No wonder vulnerability sellers don't want to say much about their business. Donato Ferrante says he's based in Europe, but won't say which country. I want to know more. What's this world like that you work in? FERRANTE: It's just, you know, I don't see, you know, bad guys or good guys. It's just business. GJELTEN: No bad guys or good guys, just clients. After all, Ferrante says, he's just selling information. FERRANTE: The way the information, you know, would be used, it's up to the customer.  It's not, you know, up to us. GJELTEN: At the moment, there is virtually no regulation of the back door market in the United States, no mandatory reporting of vulnerability sales, for example. Richard Bejtlich of Mandiant. BEJTLICH: I am shocked that this has not been regulated, because to me it would be so easy for a legislator to say, we're going to do arms control. We're going to keep this out of the hands of the bad guys. You're going to need a license to have these tools. And who's going to stand up and say, no, you have to have cyber weapons. I mean, if you wanted to look for an easy way to have legislators appear to be doing something, this would be it. GJELTEN: But developments in cyber warfare and cyber weaponry are moving so fast that our thinking about this new domain of combat and crime just can't keep pace. And it's not just governments finding new ways to attack each other.

All this week we've been reporting on how they U. S. military is prepared to wage cyber-war. But it's not just the government that's moving away from a strictly defensive posture; so too are some private companies. In the final report in this series, NPR's Tom Gjelten reports on companies that think it's time to attack the attackers. TOM GJELTEN, BYLINE: For the first time ever, the CIA and other agencies have prepared a National Intelligence Estimate on the threat to the United States posed by cyber-espionage. The NIE is classified, but it's said to identify China as the leading culprit and it describes the espionage campaign as massive. That comes as no surprise to U. S. companies who see their networks routinely penetrated and their trade secrets stolen. Many are deeply frustrated over their inability to keep intruders out of their networks. When he was the FBI's top cyber attorney, Steven Chabinsky saw hundreds of U. S. companies being hacked. Then he resigned and went to work as a private cyber-security expert. His view: Companies spend too much time trying to patch their security holes and defend their networks. STEVEN CHABINSKY: That model needs to reverse itself, okay? There is no way that we are going to win the cyber-security effort on defense. We have to go on the offensive. GJELTEN: Chabinksy was speaking at a recent conference. He's now the chief risk officer at CrowdStrike, a firm set up to serve companies ready to take the cyber-security fight to their adversaries. Dmitri Alperovitch co-founded CrowdStrike. In an interview, he explained the company philosophy. DMITRI ALPEROVITCH: You can never win a fight, whether in a boxing match, whether it's in a war, by only taking defensive actions, right? If you're just standing up taking blows, the adversary will ultimately hit you hard enough that you fall to the ground and lose the match. You need to hit back. GJELTEN: This idea of fighting back is increasingly popular among companies with assets at risk. Greg Hoglund co-founded HBGary, another firm known for its aggressive approach to cybersecurity. He too complains that companies are too slow to confront the people attacking their computer networks. GREG HOGLUND: What we need to do is get rid of the attackers and take away their tools and learn where their hideouts are and flush them out. And that isn't really happening yet in the security space. GJELTEN: This is tough talk. At times it sounds like these security people are advocating vigilante justice. It's hardly been up to private individuals or firms to get rid of bad guys or flush them out of their hideouts. That's normally the job of law enforcement. But Dmitri Alperovitch says the government does little more than warn U. S. companies about the cyber-threats they're facing. ALPEROVITCH: It's sort of the equivalent of the government sees a missile heading for your company's headquarters, and the government just yells incoming, right, and it's doing nothing to prevent it, nothing to stop it, nothing to retaliate against the adversary. That's how the private sector feels today. And until that changes, the private sector is going to take actions into their own hands, and the government shouldn't be surprised about that. GJELTEN: Part of the problem is that the government's jurisdiction in the cyber-security area is not clear. Some companies don't want the government involved. President Obama yesterday signed an executive order setting out procedures by which the government and the private sector would collaborate in confronting cyber-threats. A turn toward more aggressive, more offensive actions against cyber-attackers can be risky. In remarks at George Washington University recently, Congressman Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, reminded companies that they may not know for sure who is attacking them, so counterattacking might not be a good idea. REPRESENTATIVE MIKE ROGERS: I will guarantee you there will be lots of mistakes made, given the sophistication of nation-states in hiding their hand in activities. So I worry about the private sector engaging in offensive or active defense, as they call it. I cannot blame them because if we can't get this framework right, you have an obligation to protect your networks. I get very, very concerned about an unleashed private sector to do active defense because a lot of things are going to go wrong, I think. GJELTEN: Rogers prefers defense-oriented cyber-security. He's introducing legislation today that would promote cyber-threat information sharing between industry and government. Companies that want to go on offense, striking back at their cyber-adversaries, do need to consider the legal risks. Just because you've been hacked doesn't necessarily mean you can hack back. Richard Bejtlich is chief security officer at the cyber-firm Mandiant. RICHARD BEJTLICH: I have only found one or two lawyers, in all the work that I've done over the years, who have said let's consider pursuing some type of offensive response. The corporate legal structure is very conservative when it comes to what we could allow someone to do. GJELTEN: Companies dealing with cyber-threats may have to choose between listening to their lawyers and listening to their security people. Bejtlich says it may feel good for companies to move aggressively against whoever is hacking them, but he questions whether it's practical. BEJTLICH: Most of the lawyers think, look, the data has already been stolen, so if the data's been stolen, what are you going to gain by doing something to the intruder? GJELTEN: Dmitri Alperovitch at CrowdStrike is familiar with all the arguments against striking back. He insists there are safe and lawful ways a company can stop an intruder in his tracks and come out ahead. ALPEROVITCH: One thing you can do as a private sector company when they're coming at you is draft a fake negotiation document that they may be after and feed that to them. If they're going after a particular negotiation strategy for a business deal you're involved in, and they're on the other side, you feed them a different strategy, you're going to cause them to act in a certain way that's actually going to benefit you. GJELTEN: This is called a honeypot approach. You plant a document in your network that an adversary will find irresistible. But it's a booby-trap. The attacker steals the document, takes it home - and boom. In one clever version, the document includes secret code so that when the intruder opens it, it turns the camera on in his computer, takes his picture, and sends it back to you so you can report him to the authorities. Greg Hoglund, the founder of HBGary, says he has reviewed techniques like this with lawyers. HOGLUND: It was pretty clear that putting a booby-trapped document in your own network is 100 percent legal. There's no problem with that. If the bad guy comes and steals it out of your network and opens it in his computer, that's his problem. GJELTEN: Perhaps, but there is still a vigorous debate around what is legal in offensive cyber-operations. In the physical world, if you're mugged, you can defend yourself, but you can't track the mugger down a day later and shoot him. Nor can you break into his house and get your wallet back. Similar constraints govern in the cyberworld. Hoglund recognizes this. He concedes that risks in the offensive approach have to be considered carefully. HOGLUND: This is completely new territory, so a lot of thinking needs to occur around this. Something will change. It will take its time, but we will see something come out, both from an aspect of what you can do from a self-defense as well as what kind of policies will be changed to make it so that the attackers will suffer. GJELTEN: Hoglund and other advocates of a harder line against cyber-attackers are unlikely to be satisfied by yesterday's executive order. The order requires federal agencies to alert private companies to cyber-threats, but it maintains the focus on defense. Companies with critical infrastructure assets like power plants are asked to follow security standards worked out jointly by government and industry. Tom Gjelten, NPR News.

I'm Jacki Lyden. On Thursday, Twitter lit up with tweets, of course, about finding love, and then losing it. As they poured in, one program gathered all those tweets up and organized them into something unexpected - poetry. Ranjit Bhatnagar is an artist and the inventor of that program which is called Pentametron. And he joins us from our studios in New York. Welcome, Ranjit Bhatnagar. RANJIT BHATNAGAR: Thank you very much. LYDEN: So this is pretty much fun. First of all, tell us what Pentametron is. BHATNAGAR: Well, Pentametron is a computer program I wrote which just watches Twitter, watches 525 million tweets a day. And it picks out the ones that happen to be in iambic pentameter. And when it finds some of those, it looks for a pair that rhyme, and then it tweets out a couplet. LYDEN: Whatever made you think of this? BHATNAGAR: It was two different factors. One is I've been interested in playing around with the idea of poetry. I was kind of inspired by the exquisite corpse games of the surrealist. And on the other hand, I'm a big nerd, and I was looking at the systems that let programmers talk to Twitter. So I saw that Twitter has this way that you can subscribe to receive just an endless waterfall of tweets from them. And I thought, wow, that would be really neat just to find a way to play with that. And what I ended up doing was combining my interest in the surrealist poetry with Twitter's API. And Pentametron came out of that. LYDEN: So, please, I'm dying to know. Give me an example. BHATNAGAR: Yes. Well, I looked back through the last day or two of tweets and picked some of my favorites, and here is a couple of couplets: That hesitation right before a kiss, I don't remember ever learning this. I have never had a valentine before, I'm not a little baby anymore. (LAUGHTER)BHATNAGAR: And then there is this one that I found that's for you: I want to be a news reporter, yo, I never listen to the radio. LYDEN: I'm kind of thirsty for a valentine, my volume doesn't have a minus sign. (LAUGHTER)LYDEN: It's a lot of fun. So how does this work? How much poetry does that computer program write every day? BHATNAGAR: It comes up with about 15 to 20 couplets a day. LYDEN: Are these certain times of day where you find the volumes greater, that are more fruitful? BHATNAGAR: I haven't noticed anything about times of day. But I have noticed that during big national events, like the Super Bowl or the Grammys, the volume goes up a lot. LYDEN: And how about a couple more of these? For example, here's a couplet: I want the other Spanish teacher back. Someone actually said that. BHATNAGAR: Yes. LYDEN: And you've paired it with: Sting ray, a double-sided Scooby snack. Boy, whoever wrote that, I mean, I want to get to know them. BHATNAGAR: Yes. LYDEN: And are there any common phrases that happen to be in iambic pentameter? BHATNAGAR: Oh, there are so many common phrases that happen to be in iambic pentameter that I have a blacklist in my program because I got tired of hearing some of them. Actually, the very first iambic phrase that Pentametron ever discovered was: I've never been in Twitter jail before. And I didn't know what Twitter jail was. It turns out if you tweet more than about 200 times in the same day, Twitter cuts you off for a day, and that's Twitter jail. People say I've never in Twitter jail before a lot. So I got finally got tired of seeing Pentametron pick it up, and I blacklisted it. Another example is: I want to see \"The Hunger Games\" again, which, last year, about this time, \"The Hunger Games\" was the big new movie and everybody wanted to see \"The Hunger Games\" again. LYDEN: Have you been able to analyze this any other way? I mean, are you - do you have any sense of age groups or places in the country or where this information is coming from in anyway? Obviously, it's English, so we know that. BHATNAGAR: It's in English. And it's hard to tell for sure, but it seems to me that it's probably a pretty random cross-section of everyone on Twitter, which means that I'm exposed to more different kinds of people, more different kinds of language than I would be if I just followed the people I normally follow on Twitter. LYDEN: It's so democratic, Ranjit. Maybe Pentametron should be, you know, the next poet laureate. BHATNAGAR: That seems like a good idea to me. LYDEN: Ranjit Bhatnagar is the creator of the Pentametron Twitter poet. Ranjit, thanks. It was really a lot of fun. BHATNAGAR: Thank you very much. JACKI LYDEN, HOST:  Thanks for listening in here, WEEKENDS on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Jacki Lyden.

LYDEN: Are these certain times of day where you find the volumes greater, that are more fruitful? BHATNAGAR: I haven't noticed anything about times of day. But I have noticed that during big national events, like the Super Bowl or the Grammys, the volume goes up a lot. LYDEN: And how about a couple more of these? For example, here's a couplet: I want the other Spanish teacher back. Someone actually said that. BHATNAGAR: Yes. LYDEN: And you've paired it with: Sting ray, a double-sided Scooby snack. Boy, whoever wrote that, I mean, I want to get to know them. BHATNAGAR: Yes. LYDEN: And are there any common phrases that happen to be in iambic pentameter? BHATNAGAR: Oh, there are so many common phrases that happen to be in iambic pentameter that I have a blacklist in my program because I got tired of hearing some of them. Actually, the very first iambic phrase that Pentametron ever discovered was: I've never been in Twitter jail before. And I didn't know what Twitter jail was. It turns out if you tweet more than about 200 times in the same day, Twitter cuts you off for a day, and that's Twitter jail. People say I've never in Twitter jail before a lot. So I got finally got tired of seeing Pentametron pick it up, and I blacklisted it. Another example is: I want to see \"The Hunger Games\" again, which, last year, about this time, \"The Hunger Games\" was the big new movie and everybody wanted to see \"The Hunger Games\" again. LYDEN: Have you been able to analyze this any other way? I mean, are you - do you have any sense of age groups or places in the country or where this information is coming from in anyway? Obviously, it's English, so we know that. BHATNAGAR: It's in English. And it's hard to tell for sure, but it seems to me that it's probably a pretty random cross-section of everyone on Twitter, which means that I'm exposed to more different kinds of people, more different kinds of language than I would be if I just followed the people I normally follow on Twitter. LYDEN: It's so democratic, Ranjit. Maybe Pentametron should be, you know, the next poet laureate. BHATNAGAR: That seems like a good idea to me. LYDEN: Ranjit Bhatnagar is the creator of the Pentametron Twitter poet. Ranjit, thanks. It was really a lot of fun. BHATNAGAR: Thank you very much.", "section": "Poetry", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2013 NPR.  All rights reserved.

S. corporations and government agencies. That's the conclusion of a lengthy report released today by the computer security firm Mandiant. Mandiant says the hacking campaign goes back at least to 2006 and it targeted industries strategic to China's growth, including IT, energy and aerospace. Kevin Mandia is the founder and CEO of Mandiant. He joins me here in the studio to talk about what they found. Welcome to the program. KEVIN MANDIA: Thanks for having me. BLOCK: Why don't you give us a sense of the scale and the scope of the hacking that you've traced to a group that you call Advanced Persistent Threat One? MANDIA: Well, I think it's key to note two things. One, we only are publishing on a single group out of China and we think there's plenty more. Second is we only published the lowest bounds, if you think about it. Mandiant knows of 141 victim companies that have been compromised by APT Group One, that we concluded was Unit 61398 in the Chinese army. And the reason we only know the lowest bounds is we only knows what Mandiant knows. We don't know what other security companies know. So, I almost feel like we're a long line of security companies that has blamed China. But what makes this report different is this is the first time we're trying to elevate it to it's not just someone in China, this is right under the noses of the government or it is the government themselves. BLOCK: We mentioned some of the industries that were targeted and presumably a number of these are your own clients. What information exactly were the hackers stealing? What kinds of stuff are they after? MANDIA: If you're a company that's doing mergers and acquisitions in China, we see your email targeted. But if you're in the defense industrial base and you make weaponry or you make high-tech systems, what we see there is your Word documents, your PowerPoint documents, your PDF documents - those are taken. So the campaigns depend a little bit about the industry you're in and what the attackers are seeking. BLOCK: Now, the Chinese defense and foreign ministry have denied any connection to hacking. They call these unfounded accusations. They say hacking is illegal in China. What evidence do you have that, in fact, this is a Chinese army unit - People's Liberation Army Unit 61398 - that's behind what you've seen here? MANDIA: All right. Right before I tell you the evidence, I'll tell you this: They always deny it. But let's look at what Mandiant did. We had a dual-pronged investigation. On one hand, we're responding to all these victim companies and following technical evidence. And all the technical evidence brought us to thousands of computers being compromised by about a thousand computers and that the people logging into the infrastructure used to hack all these companies were native Chinese speakers and that the IP addresses, or the origin of these attacks, went back to Shanghai. In conjunction with that, we learned about a unit that existed in Shanghai, where they were recruiting people that spoke English and understood what we call Computer Network Operations, or attacking. And it was a unique requirement. And their location was right in the same location where the technical evidence was bringing us. So if you look at the scale of the operations, the mission of the unit, and what we actually witnessed and just where it's coming from, it all overlaps. BLOCK: I read in your report that your own company, Mandiant, got one of these spear-fishing emails from this apparent Chinese unit with a malicious attachment. How does it work? Is it any different from any other standard hacking that you see all the time? MANDIA: Well, I think spear-fishing is commonly used by a lot of people that want to target an organization or target individuals. But how it works is, in general, the victims get an email and there's either a link in that email or there's an attachment to that email that contains malicious code. BLOCK: So the email that your company got had a malicious attachment. What was the red flag that showed you this was not what it appeared to be? MANDIA: It was an email from me allegedly, but it was from an external account that I don't use, to two Mandiant employees. And both Mandiant employees recognized this just wasn't my email address. And I was lucky enough nobody clicked on the attachment. They recognized it for what it was. It was a fraud. BLOCK: Why did you decide to go public with this - because you do say in your report that your own security techniques are vastly more effective when attackers are not aware of them, and you do, as you say, expect reprisals, so why publish? MANDIA: Because information sharing does work, I believe that. And we wanted to get the indicators out to the public. The bottom line is no one is getting smarter from each breach, and we need to make the environment so that we do. BLOCK: Kevin Mandia is the founder and CEO of the computer security firm Mandiant.

I'm Celeste Headlee, filling in for Neal Conan from Washington. These days Facebook and Twitter are almost ubiquitous, and online our friends and family members are just as likely to talk about their jobs as their children and spouses. In many ways we've lost sight of that old line between work life and personal life, and that can be problematic because many workers have lost their jobs because of things they posted on social media sites. In response, the National Labor Relations Board has issued new guidelines that more narrowly define what kind of posts on Facebook or Twitter can actually prompt an employee's dismissal. So employers, we want to hear from you. When did you have to draw the line on social media for your employees? And for employees, when did you cross that line? Our number is 800-989-8255. Our email address is talk@npr. org. Or join the conversation from npr. org - click on TALK OF THE NATION. Later on in the program, after Europe's outrage over horse meat sold as beef, we're going to talk about why some foods are taboo in some places and not others. But first to social media and the workplace. Joining me now from a studio at the New York Times is Steven Greenhouse. He's the New York Times labor and workplace reporter, who has reported on these new social media guidelines. So let's talk just about these new advice - this new advice from the National Labor Relations Board. And what exactly does it say is OK to fire an employee for, and what is not OK? STEVEN GREENHOUSE: Hi, Celeste, good to be here. So what the National Labor Relations Board says is that when you use Facebook, Twitter and say something that upsets your employer, your employer can't necessarily fire you. There are limits on what an employer can and cannot restrict you from saying. You know, the National Labor Relations Act, this law passed in 1935 that gives workers the right to form unions and to work together to improve workplace matters, you know, interpreting that law, the National Labor Relations Board says that companies cannot ban you from writing on Facebook or Twitter, you know, something to a co-worker and complaining about working conditions, or in saying that you're not paid enough or saying that your boss stresses you out and makes life too difficult. But the National Labor Relations Board also says that to be protected you have to be conversing with another worker, communicating with another worker, whether at the water cooler or on Facebook, it has to be considered cooperative concerted activity, and it has to be about, you know, ways to improve working conditions. It just can't be a lone wolf, a lone worker ranting or venting, saying my boss is the world's biggest fat jerk and I can't stand him. If you post something like that on Facebook, it's going to be considered, you know, an individualized lone rant, and you're not going to be protected, whereas if you write to a co-worker and say, you know, our boss, you know, shouldn't have yelled at us today, and besides, it stinks only earning $8 an hour, we should, you know, get together and do something about it, that's the type of so-called concerted activity, Celeste, that the labor board says is protected. HEADLEE: OK, so let me give you an example, Steven. Let's say I put on my Facebook page: My manager is such a jerk. That's not protected. GREENHOUSE: Generally not. There are always exceptions. . . HEADLEE: What if - right, and let's get to some of these exceptions. What if somebody responds: Are you talking about having to work double-shifts all the time, and I say yes, that's just not fair. Then is it protected? GREENHOUSE: It might be. If you just go on Facebook and write just to the world or to your mother, my boss is a jerk, that's probably not going to be protected. But if you're in a string of communication, a thread of communication with your co-workers, and you're discussing, say, wages or having a hard time getting the vacation time you want, and in the middle of that conversation you say, you know, Jerry, my boss is such a jerk, that might be considered protected. But, you know, there are limits. You know, if you say truly outrageous things about your boss or disclose, you know, horrendous confidential things that your boss would never want to see publicized in a million years, or false things, you know, some of these protections, even when it's in a conversation with your co-workers, will not be protected. HEADLEE: All right, so how exactly - I mean do employers pay attention to these NLRB rulings? Do they follow them when they create their social media policies? GREENHOUSE: I think they are following them more than before. You know, the National Labor Relations Board, which is a five-person panel, normally a five-seat panel in Washington that oversees labor relations for the nation's private-sector companies, it has issued three long reports, three advisories that kind of, you know, tell companies this is what you can do, this is what you can't do. It's also issued a series of decisions. And you know, the bottom line of what the labor board is saying is if you, an employer, a human resources director, issue these blanket policies saying thou shalt not use social media to ever criticize your company or put your company in a negative light or say something negative about your boss, the labor board is going to say that is overbroad because it would improperly deter, discourage, employees from talking about things like, you know, boss losing his temper too often or a boss, you know, subjecting, pressuring workers to work in a dangerous situation, or a boss making you work, say, overtime without paying overtime. You know, the labor board is saying you have every right to communicate with your co-workers, even in a way that criticizes your boss or puts your company in a negative light, if it involves working conditions in a way that's aimed at improving things on the job. Now, one caveat I should make very clear, Celeste, so there was this, you know, court decision two, three weeks ago that said that two of the three sitting members on the labor board were not appointed properly, that they're recess appointments. HEADLEE: Right. GREENHOUSE: And these judges said that these labor board members were not seated properly, that the labor board did not have a proper quorum late last year when some of these social media decisions were handed down. So that calls into question whether some of these social media decisions are really in effect. Meanwhile, you know, the labor board's permanent staff has been issuing these advisories on what employers can and cannot do, and those are generally considered valid, still valid advice. HEADLEE: Steven Greenhouse is the labor and workplace reporter for The New York Times. Let's also bring into this conversation Mari Smith. She's a social media consultant, author of \"The New Relationship Marketing: How to Build a Large, Loyal, Profitable Network Using the Social Web,\" and she joins us from by phone from her office in San Diego. Welcome, Mari. MARI SMITH: Thank you, glad to be here, Celeste. HEADLEE: How important is a social media policy for a business? Is it only necessary for a great big huge company, or does a small business with five or 10 people also need a social media policy? SMITH: It is absolutely vital whether you're a sole entrepreneur or a Fortune 500 company. Every single business and businessperson should have a social media policy. HEADLEE: So I mean how seriously do they take these guidelines from the NLRB, right? I mean what do you tell companies to do when they're creating that social media policy? SMITH: Well, there's certain components that absolutely must be included, and obviously it comes down to enforceability. Ultimately the way that I see the social media policies is it all emerges from the company culture. When you have a great culture of community both inside and outside the business, like social from the inside out, it's fostered on mutual respect, there's common sense, there's common courtesy, then you build the social media policy on that. But the guidelines are really there to give every employee a sense of, you know, what they can and can't share, whether they are operating on behalf of the business or they're in their own personal profiles. But really you want to have a safe environment so that employees can share non-proprietary subject matter and to really actually show off, in a way, to management and to be recognized that they can do really well with the social media for business and represent the brand or the company in a really good light. Really, everybody, all employees, and this goes into the social media policy, all employees need to know what to do in the event of a crisis or a PR faux pas. Certainly everybody needs to know how they need to be complying with the state or federal social media regulations and laws and rules, et cetera. But yeah, my approach is generally really wanting to focus in on the company culture and the values of the company and how the employees can really be empowered to love the brand, to love working for the company. It breaks my heart, to be perfectly honest, when, you know, you can go and do a search online and you can see every minute, there's somebody on Facebook just ranting about their boss. And I just think it's really sad. HEADLEE: Well, let's go to a call here. This is Charity(ph) in Kansas City, Missouri. Our question was for employers: When have you had to draw the line? But you were an employee that I guess at one point stepped over the line - right, Charity? CHARITY: Yes, apparently I did. It was 2009, and I'm a former journalist, and like a lot of my former colleagues found myself in 2009 waiting tables instead of doing journalism. But I was working at a very upscale steakhouse, and I absolutely loved the job and was a proponent for the brand. But it was just so rife with material, I did start writing a - kind of a behind-the-scenes look at the upscale dining culture. And it was a funny blog. I did not use the name of my company or - which is a national large company, or my name when writing the blog. But, you know, most of my server co-workers knew about it, and it did eventually come to management attention, and I was terminated for it. HEADLEE: But the happy ending for you was you got picked up by Reader's Digest, right? CHARITY: That's correct. (LAUGHTER)HEADLEE: Well, thank you very much, that's Charity in Kansas City. So Steven Greenhouse of the New York Times, does the NLRB rulings help somebody like Charity at all? GREENHOUSE: My sense is, you know, Charity was just writing on her own, it wasn't signed by three co-workers saying we're describing what things are like in this steakhouse and we're writing this with the intention of trying to improve working conditions. My sense is Charity was trying to write a wonderfully literary, Joycean essay that would attract even Reader's Digest. Just - and Mari said some very good things. I just wanted to add one or two things. She said, you know, of her advice for companies - some companies issue social media policies saying, you know, thou shalt not disclose anything confidential. And the labor board says you can't have something so overbroad. You know, if you think that discussing another employee's wages or discussing the health plan is confidential, you can't prohibit workers from discussing that. But the labor board says, you know, but please, companies, be specific. You are allowed to prohibit, you know, writing certain things on social media. You're allowed to tell employees you can't divulge trade secrets, you can't divulge when hot new products are going to be introduced. You can't talk about the private health details of your co-workers or managers. So it's very important not to use blanket rules but to be very, very specific. And as Mari said, it's fine for companies to say that, you know, when you're - whether it's speaking on the telephone or talking with customers on Facebook or whatever, you have to maintain proper business decorum. I mean that's totally accepted. But again, you can't say thou shalt never say anything negative about the company ever ever. That goes too far. HEADLEE: Steven Greenhouse is the labor and workplace reporter for the New York Times. He's going to stay with us. We're talking about social media and work, what you can and can't say legally. So employers, tell us about a time when you had to draw the line. And employees, when did you cross it? 800-989-8255. Or drop us an email to talk@npr. org. I'm Celeste Headlee. This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)HEADLEE: This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. I'm Celeste Headlee. If social media is the modern water cooler, the place we go to complain about the latest \"Downton Abbey\" episode - and I'm sure there's a lot of you who are complaining - or to crow maybe over our genius child's latest feats, it's only natural we'd turn there to talk about work, also, both the good and the bad. But that becomes tricky for employers, who know that what's said online can reach far beyond one's circle of friends. So recently, the NLRB, that's the National Labor Relations Board, has drawn some conclusions about what kinds of online speech can get an employee fired, some useful guidance for companies that are hoping to draw up policies around social media use and for employees who want to express themselves without losing their jobs. And we want to hear from you. Employers, when have you had to draw the line on social media? And employees, tell us about a time when you crossed that line. The number is 800-989-8255. Our email address is talk@npr. org. Or go to our website, npr. org, and then click on TALK OF THE NATION. Let's hear from Brent(ph) here in Long Island. Brent, you're an employer, right? BRENT: Yes, I am. We have about seven employees at the moment, and I had a situation with - I'm actually friends with two of them online, on Facebook, and a couple of longstanding employees I've had for about 10 years, one of them, you know, had pictures of herself partying online and things like that and putting pictures of herself sort of, you know, holding the wine bottle on all fours kind of thing. And, you know, at first I approached her, and I said: Do you have an issue with alcohol? And she said no, no, I don't. And I just sort of had a conversation like, you know, I'm concerned, you know, these are public pictures. You're putting this out. And it was - I got I know, I know, just a one-time. And anyway, we had a meeting about it actually, and told the employees that you're - it's more - it's less about representing our company, more about just for you personally, I care about you as a person, and I wouldn't want later on this to come back to you, you know, pictures that are sort of - you know, not just holding a wine glass enjoying a drink with friends, but, you know, completely trashed and, you know, that type of thing. She did not put the - I haven't seen pictures like that, and she really, you know, took heed to the warning and cleared it up. HEADLEE: Thank you very much. That's an interesting point. That's Brent calling from Long Island, New York. And Steven, I wonder: Does anything in the NLRB decisions, either present or past, address this? Because that sounds to me like when we talk about professional decorum, maybe that can go a little bit too far, intrude a little too far into your personal life. GREENHOUSE: That would not be - what Brent talked about would generally not be protected by the National Labor Relations Board because it's just people acting alone, being exhibitionist or just plain dumb without, you know, working hand-in-hand with co-workers for, you know, mutual aid and protection or improved working conditions. But there's another issue. Six states now, and most recently Illinois and California, have passed laws that bar employers from asking either job applicants or current employees from turning over their Facebook password in case an employer wants to rummage around to see whether there are drunken pictures of you like that. But also, you know, and, you know, young people who are applying for jobs should be very cognizant of this, a lot of employers do heavy research on you when you're applying for a job and see what they could find out there on the Web about you, pictures on Facebook, pictures with friends, you know, drunk and frolicking. And, you know, that could really hurt you when you're applying for jobs. You know, there are serious Web searches, Google searches by employers, and if there's something embarrassing about you, it could really hurt. And I think Brent gave his employee very good advice. HEADLEE: Let's go to bring Matt Watson into this discussion. He's the author of the \"Bitter Barista\" blog, and he joins us now from member station KUOW in Seattle. And you got fired, Matt, for tweeting about customers who came into the coffee shop, right? MATT WATSON: Yeah, thanks for having me. Yeah, so. . . HEADLEE: Thanks so much for joining us. So yeah, tell us what happened. WATSON: So I started this blog about three weeks ago called \"Bitter Barista,\" which basically was just a place for me to aggregate my workday tweets working as a barista for the last decade. HEADLEE: Now why do it, Matt, while you were still working there? Even if you didn't say the name of the company, why not save that up for your book later? (LAUGHTER)WATSON: You know, I think people from my generation, social media is pretty ubiquitous, and it's just kind of a natural reaction to turn there. The idea for my generation of saving content for a book doesn't make a whole lot of sense, I guess. We kind of like to put it out there. HEADLEE: Was there a social media policy, a printed policy, for you? WATSON: No, I mean, I just worked for a coffee shop. I've never worked for a small business in the food service industry that has a social media policy. So there was nothing spelled out from the start, no. HEADLEE: Well, let me write - let me read you something that you wrote about your boss. You wrote, and I quote: My boss watches the cameras at the cafe, but he'd save time if he just followed my Twitter to see that I'm not working. (LAUGHTER)HEADLEE: Let me read a couple more: I put a macchiato down on the bar and called it out. A customer walks up, drinks it in one gulp and then says I ordered a mocha. And here's another one: If your coffee order takes more than 20 seconds to say, you've forfeited your right to complain about the price. Do you think that your firing is fair? I mean, it seems to me like those are. . . WATSON: Oh yeah. HEADLEE: Oh you do. WATSON: By all means. Yeah, you know, I originally started out the website to be anonymous, and I kind of underestimated the curiosity of the Internet to find out who I was. So about a week and a half ago, another coffee website decided to do some Googling and find out who I was and ended up calling the shop. And once it became not anonymous anymore, it was pretty clear that we couldn't - I couldn't continue working there. HEADLEE: Are you sorry? Did you enjoy your job there? WATSON: Oh yeah, I loved my job. You know, there's a little regret, but at the same time, you know, I did what I could to keep it anonymous, and I'm not really sure on the motives of the people that outed me. So I don't really have any regret, and I'm not entirely sorry. I wish it had gone down differently, but no. HEADLEE: It's a pretty - I mean, I've read it. It's pretty entertaining. You've got a future if you're going to just write about - blog about stuff. That's Matt Watson. WATSON: I appreciate that. HEADLEE: Who is author. . . GREENHOUSE: Can I just jump in? HEADLEE: Go ahead. GREENHOUSE: So Matt, you have a great sense of humor, but it sounds as if the guy who heads your bar, your coffee shop, doesn't have as good a sense of humor as he does. And he's - you know, he's very sensitive to things that might put his business in a poor light. There was a case somewhat similar - there was a case somewhat similar to yours involving the NLRB where a bartender at a restaurant in a Chicago suburb was upset that he hadn't received a raise in five years. So he went onto Facebook to say - to complain that the restaurant's customers were a bunch of rednecks, and he said, you know, he'd hoped they'd choke on glass when they were driving home drunk. So he went to the National Labor Relations Board and said, you know, I'm complaining about not receiving a raise. You know, this is protected activity. And the labor board says basically, you know, bunkum bull, you were just venting, it was actually in a note to his stepsister who was asking him how work was, not a note to co-workers. And they said, you know, you're not really discussing working conditions, you're not doing it in concert with other employees. This was just venting. Forget it, you're gone. HEADLEE: All right, that is Matt Watson, he's - well, you just heard Steven Greenhouse of the New York Times, but Matt Watson was with us, author of the Bitter Barista blog, joining us from member station KUOW in Seattle. Thank you very much. You have a job now? Are you still unemployed, Matt, or. . . WATSON: I'm still unemployed but working on some writing stuff and some music stuff, so. . . HEADLEE: That's probably a good idea. WATSON: Absolutely. HEADLEE: No more coffee shops. (LAUGHTER)HEADLEE: Let's take a call here. Thank you very much, Matt. Let's take a call here from David(ph) in Chico, California, and David, tell me about the line that's been established at your workplace on social media. DAVID: Well, we're - I'm in kind of an unusual situation in that I'm both a hospital nurse and also a union representative for nurses. And so I get involved in both sides of this National Labor Relations Board. And the line that we tell people is that again, it is just what Steven has said, that if it's concerted activity, and in fact we have a union Facebook group at the hospital that we use for communicating on union issues and things like that, and that's a perfectly protected activity under those guidelines. But we tell people really clearly, don't get involved in just ranting about your work. And most especially don't do something that is ranting about a patient or might somehow give patients the impression that they wouldn't get as good care as anybody else if you, you know, were upset at a certain category of patient or something like that. You know, this could be the - say, the emergency room nurse upset with the patient who's coming in for the third time this week, or something like that. HEADLEE: Right, well, that sounds like pretty sensible advice. That's David calling from Chico, California. Let me just ask you, really quickly, Mari Smith, you consult people on this. What - are businesses concerned, do you think, about their liability should they fire someone and it be found to be an unlawful termination? SMITH: Gosh, yes, oh, businesses should be concerned about this of course and always want to be representing the company in the best light. And, you know, it's interesting, and there's also something, what I like to call the back channel. And even though, you know, something might be going online, and maybe it complies with the laws, and it's shared in a personal social profile, but it still will hold the company in a bad light. I mean, there was an example just a few days ago, without disclosing the identity of these people, but there were two - a couple of heads, of major known names in tech companies were over in a foreign country and romping around, naked and drunk. And somehow, a video ends up on Facebook. And a whole bunch of us are chatting in the background about this. Nobody's dared putting any comments - well, people in my circle. But they were getting comments. And that interaction, that behavior has forever impacted my impression of these companies. HEADLEE: Yeah. Well if it can happen to Prince Harry, it can happen to anybody, right? SMITH: Yeah. (LAUGHTER)SMITH: Right, exactly. HEADLEE: Let's take another call here, Anthony in Lexington, Kentucky, and you were fired from your work. Can you tell us that story, Anthony? ANTHONY: Yeah. Hi. I was working for a Catholic church in Lexington, Kentucky, and posted on Facebook that I was in a relationship with another man. I had my Facebook profile locked down to only about 40 viewers, and they cited Facebook and said that I wasn't in good standing with the church and told me that I could either resign or be fired. HEADLEE: Oh, I'm very sorry that happened to you. But let me take this to Steven Greenhouse. Thank you very much for that phone call. That's Anthony in Lexington, Kentucky. Steven, protected, not protected? That's a rough one. GREENHOUSE: It's a rough one. I guess, Anthony, if you were discussing your sexual orientation with a co-worker, and I'm - in theory, talking about how we need to try to change the church, good luck, to make it more tolerant of gays, one could say that you were advocating together to improve working conditions. But you know, government agencies, as you know, are very, very reluctant to interfere in the internal workings of religious organizations. So even though, Anthony, it might be considered, you know, cooperative concerted activity to help each other, I think the labor board is not going to really want to get involved in telling the Catholic Church what to do. I want to add, Celeste, there was one case that the NLRB was involved in, that was very similar to what David and Mari were just discussing before. You know, a female employee. . . HEADLEE: David was the. . . GREENHOUSE: David from Chico. . . HEADLEE: Right, the nurse. GREENHOUSE: . . . the nurse. That there was a case in which a female employee at a facility for homeless people with metal health issues, she was fired after she wrote on Facebook that it was, quote,\"spooky,\" unquote, working there on the overnight shift. And this woman also wrote on Facebook: My dear client - this was a homeless patient - my dear client - is cracking up at my post. I don't whether if she's laughing at me, with me or at the voices inside her head. And the board, you know, of the institution saw this post and fired her, and the labor board upheld that saying, this did not really involve conditions of employment, it wasn't done with co-workers and that she had clearly violated the home's policy of not disclosing confidential information about clients. HEADLEE: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. So let's talk a little bit more, Mari, about how exactly you counsel employers to create social media policies. How much leeway do you think they should give? I mean, is it safer for a business to just clamp down on it completely or is that - is there a danger in being too restrictive? SMITH: I think there is, Celeste, yes. I wouldn't recommend being too restrictive because people are going to find ways to, you know, go outside the lines anyway, I love Zappos' policy, Zappos, with their 10 core values and the company culture emerges from that, and their social media policy is very, very simple. It's use your common sense, use common courtesy. If you're not sure, seek permission. Be appropriate and polite, diplomatic, respect confidentiality, et cetera. However, we have to always remember that wonderful line from the movie \"The Social Network,\" that the Internet is in ink. You know, you can't really go back and delete it. So the thing with Zappos, that kind of open approach will not work for every company. And so, one of the first things that I do with my clients is to really do an assessment of where they're at with their current company culture and what the sentiment is, if you will, of the employees and to talk to employees to find out, you know, the kinds of things that they are sharing. Often, you know, people will be sharing things on Facebook thinking it's locked down to just a few friends, and in fact, they're inadvertently sharing things to public. HEADLEE: Well, that's what Anthony found out, the caller. SMITH: Exactly. Yeah. That's so unfortunate and plus, you never know it. My rule of thumb is this is that you never, ever want to share anything online at all, ever, ever that you wouldn't want on the front page of The New York Times, found in a Google search in years to come and proud of your own mom to see. Those are my simple points. . . HEADLEE: Although, Steven could tell you, Mari, how hard it is to get something on the front page of The New York Times. But let's take a call here. . . (LAUGHTER)HEADLEE: . . . from Katherine(ph) in St. Louis, Missouri. Katherine, you actually helped to handle social media for a large bank, right? KATHERINE: Yes. HEADLEE: What kind of counseling did you give? KATHERINE: Well, basically, it was strategy, just getting up and going, and then I had to forge a very valuable relationship with Legal and Compliance, and then also HR. But what we were finding was that some employees would get to their bank branch and then check in and actually, probably, tell people that they were sick or they would talk about, you know, a customer that would come in. And so, not only were they checking in and letting everyone know what branch they were at, but then also letting people know that they were sick too. So. . . HEADLEE: Your mean like when you post on Twitter or Facebook and it tells the location to where you are? KATHERINE: Well, that or you can use Foursquare to check in. And a lot of times, employees will, you know, want to be the king of that particular branch, so it. . . HEADLEE: The mayor. KATHERINE: . . . depends on how many. . . HEADLEE: It's mayor, Katherine. KATHERINE: The mayor, the mayor. Right, right. (LAUGHTER)KATHERINE: And so, yeah. And so we would go to HR and, you know, their hands were really tied that, you know, it's such a new landscape that I think a lot of HR departments are just having trouble navigating. You know. there's just so little information. HEADLEE: You think? Yeah, that's a really - that's great point. That's Katherine in St. Louis, Missouri. Thank you so much, Katherine. And this, this is a good point that she's brought up, Steven, how new it is. For example, what if I just post a picture on Instagram, can I get fired for a picture I take at work that somebody thinks is not flattering? GREENHOUSE: You know, generally, in the United States, employers can fire you for virtually any reason. If they don't like the color of your shoelaces, you know. You know the reasons you can't be fired, you know, because of your race, because of your religion, because of your national origin. But they can fire you because they don't like the way you blink your eyes. So if you post something on Instagram that they don't like because it's yellow and not red, in theory, they could fire you. But if you post something on Instagram saying, you know, our wages are too low, we have to work together and I'm posting this with my. . . HEADLEE: That's protected. GREENHOUSE: . . . the person who sits next to me, that's protected. HEADLEE: Steven Greenhouse is the labor and workplace reporter for The New York Times. We talked to him from his studio there. Mari Smith is social media consultant. We spoke to her by phone from her office in San Diego, California. Thanks to both of you. GREENHOUSE: Thanks very much. Nice to be here. HEADLEE: Coming up, the horse meat scandal that is rocking Europe right now. It leads us to ask, why are certain meats taboo in certain places? I'm Celeste Headlee. It's TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. CELESTE HEADLEE, HOST:  This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Celeste Headlee, filling in for Neal Conan from Washington. These days Facebook and Twitter are almost ubiquitous, and online our friends and family members are just as likely to talk about their jobs as their children and spouses. In many ways we've lost sight of that old line between work life and personal life, and that can be problematic because many workers have lost their jobs because of things they posted on social media sites. In response, the National Labor Relations Board has issued new guidelines that more narrowly define what kind of posts on Facebook or Twitter can actually prompt an employee's dismissal. So employers, we want to hear from you. When did you have to draw the line on social media for your employees? And for employees, when did you cross that line? Our number is 800-989-8255. Our email address is talk@npr. org. Or join the conversation from npr. org - click on TALK OF THE NATION. Later on in the program, after Europe's outrage over horse meat sold as beef, we're going to talk about why some foods are taboo in some places and not others. But first to social media and the workplace. Joining me now from a studio at the New York Times is Steven Greenhouse. He's the New York Times labor and workplace reporter, who has reported on these new social media guidelines. So let's talk just about these new advice - this new advice from the National Labor Relations Board. And what exactly does it say is OK to fire an employee for, and what is not OK? STEVEN GREENHOUSE: Hi, Celeste, good to be here. So what the National Labor Relations Board says is that when you use Facebook, Twitter and say something that upsets your employer, your employer can't necessarily fire you. There are limits on what an employer can and cannot restrict you from saying. You know, the National Labor Relations Act, this law passed in 1935 that gives workers the right to form unions and to work together to improve workplace matters, you know, interpreting that law, the National Labor Relations Board says that companies cannot ban you from writing on Facebook or Twitter, you know, something to a co-worker and complaining about working conditions, or in saying that you're not paid enough or saying that your boss stresses you out and makes life too difficult. But the National Labor Relations Board also says that to be protected you have to be conversing with another worker, communicating with another worker, whether at the water cooler or on Facebook, it has to be considered cooperative concerted activity, and it has to be about, you know, ways to improve working conditions. It just can't be a lone wolf, a lone worker ranting or venting, saying my boss is the world's biggest fat jerk and I can't stand him. If you post something like that on Facebook, it's going to be considered, you know, an individualized lone rant, and you're not going to be protected, whereas if you write to a co-worker and say, you know, our boss, you know, shouldn't have yelled at us today, and besides, it stinks only earning $8 an hour, we should, you know, get together and do something about it, that's the type of so-called concerted activity, Celeste, that the labor board says is protected. HEADLEE: OK, so let me give you an example, Steven. Let's say I put on my Facebook page: My manager is such a jerk. That's not protected. GREENHOUSE: Generally not. There are always exceptions. . . HEADLEE: What if - right, and let's get to some of these exceptions. What if somebody responds: Are you talking about having to work double-shifts all the time, and I say yes, that's just not fair. Then is it protected? GREENHOUSE: It might be. If you just go on Facebook and write just to the world or to your mother, my boss is a jerk, that's probably not going to be protected. But if you're in a string of communication, a thread of communication with your co-workers, and you're discussing, say, wages or having a hard time getting the vacation time you want, and in the middle of that conversation you say, you know, Jerry, my boss is such a jerk, that might be considered protected. But, you know, there are limits. You know, if you say truly outrageous things about your boss or disclose, you know, horrendous confidential things that your boss would never want to see publicized in a million years, or false things, you know, some of these protections, even when it's in a conversation with your co-workers, will not be protected. HEADLEE: All right, so how exactly - I mean do employers pay attention to these NLRB rulings? Do they follow them when they create their social media policies? GREENHOUSE: I think they are following them more than before. You know, the National Labor Relations Board, which is a five-person panel, normally a five-seat panel in Washington that oversees labor relations for the nation's private-sector companies, it has issued three long reports, three advisories that kind of, you know, tell companies this is what you can do, this is what you can't do. It's also issued a series of decisions. And you know, the bottom line of what the labor board is saying is if you, an employer, a human resources director, issue these blanket policies saying thou shalt not use social media to ever criticize your company or put your company in a negative light or say something negative about your boss, the labor board is going to say that is overbroad because it would improperly deter, discourage, employees from talking about things like, you know, boss losing his temper too often or a boss, you know, subjecting, pressuring workers to work in a dangerous situation, or a boss making you work, say, overtime without paying overtime. You know, the labor board is saying you have every right to communicate with your co-workers, even in a way that criticizes your boss or puts your company in a negative light, if it involves working conditions in a way that's aimed at improving things on the job. Now, one caveat I should make very clear, Celeste, so there was this, you know, court decision two, three weeks ago that said that two of the three sitting members on the labor board were not appointed properly, that they're recess appointments. HEADLEE: Right. GREENHOUSE: And these judges said that these labor board members were not seated properly, that the labor board did not have a proper quorum late last year when some of these social media decisions were handed down. So that calls into question whether some of these social media decisions are really in effect. Meanwhile, you know, the labor board's permanent staff has been issuing these advisories on what employers can and cannot do, and those are generally considered valid, still valid advice. HEADLEE: Steven Greenhouse is the labor and workplace reporter for The New York Times. Let's also bring into this conversation Mari Smith. She's a social media consultant, author of \"The New Relationship Marketing: How to Build a Large, Loyal, Profitable Network Using the Social Web,\" and she joins us from by phone from her office in San Diego. Welcome, Mari. MARI SMITH: Thank you, glad to be here, Celeste. HEADLEE: How important is a social media policy for a business? Is it only necessary for a great big huge company, or does a small business with five or 10 people also need a social media policy? SMITH: It is absolutely vital whether you're a sole entrepreneur or a Fortune 500 company. Every single business and businessperson should have a social media policy. HEADLEE: So I mean how seriously do they take these guidelines from the NLRB, right? I mean what do you tell companies to do when they're creating that social media policy? SMITH: Well, there's certain components that absolutely must be included, and obviously it comes down to enforceability. Ultimately the way that I see the social media policies is it all emerges from the company culture. When you have a great culture of community both inside and outside the business, like social from the inside out, it's fostered on mutual respect, there's common sense, there's common courtesy, then you build the social media policy on that. But the guidelines are really there to give every employee a sense of, you know, what they can and can't share, whether they are operating on behalf of the business or they're in their own personal profiles. But really you want to have a safe environment so that employees can share non-proprietary subject matter and to really actually show off, in a way, to management and to be recognized that they can do really well with the social media for business and represent the brand or the company in a really good light. Really, everybody, all employees, and this goes into the social media policy, all employees need to know what to do in the event of a crisis or a PR faux pas. Certainly everybody needs to know how they need to be complying with the state or federal social media regulations and laws and rules, et cetera. But yeah, my approach is generally really wanting to focus in on the company culture and the values of the company and how the employees can really be empowered to love the brand, to love working for the company. It breaks my heart, to be perfectly honest, when, you know, you can go and do a search online and you can see every minute, there's somebody on Facebook just ranting about their boss. And I just think it's really sad. HEADLEE: Well, let's go to a call here. This is Charity(ph) in Kansas City, Missouri. Our question was for employers: When have you had to draw the line? But you were an employee that I guess at one point stepped over the line - right, Charity? CHARITY: Yes, apparently I did. It was 2009, and I'm a former journalist, and like a lot of my former colleagues found myself in 2009 waiting tables instead of doing journalism. But I was working at a very upscale steakhouse, and I absolutely loved the job and was a proponent for the brand. But it was just so rife with material, I did start writing a - kind of a behind-the-scenes look at the upscale dining culture. And it was a funny blog. I did not use the name of my company or - which is a national large company, or my name when writing the blog. But, you know, most of my server co-workers knew about it, and it did eventually come to management attention, and I was terminated for it. HEADLEE: But the happy ending for you was you got picked up by Reader's Digest, right? CHARITY: That's correct. (LAUGHTER) HEADLEE: Well, thank you very much, that's Charity in Kansas City. So Steven Greenhouse of the New York Times, does the NLRB rulings help somebody like Charity at all? GREENHOUSE: My sense is, you know, Charity was just writing on her own, it wasn't signed by three co-workers saying we're describing what things are like in this steakhouse and we're writing this with the intention of trying to improve working conditions. My sense is Charity was trying to write a wonderfully literary, Joycean essay that would attract even Reader's Digest. Just - and Mari said some very good things. I just wanted to add one or two things. She said, you know, of her advice for companies - some companies issue social media policies saying, you know, thou shalt not disclose anything confidential. And the labor board says you can't have something so overbroad. You know, if you think that discussing another employee's wages or discussing the health plan is confidential, you can't prohibit workers from discussing that. But the labor board says, you know, but please, companies, be specific. You are allowed to prohibit, you know, writing certain things on social media. You're allowed to tell employees you can't divulge trade secrets, you can't divulge when hot new products are going to be introduced. You can't talk about the private health details of your co-workers or managers. So it's very important not to use blanket rules but to be very, very specific. And as Mari said, it's fine for companies to say that, you know, when you're - whether it's speaking on the telephone or talking with customers on Facebook or whatever, you have to maintain proper business decorum. I mean that's totally accepted. But again, you can't say thou shalt never say anything negative about the company ever ever. That goes too far. HEADLEE: Steven Greenhouse is the labor and workplace reporter for the New York Times. He's going to stay with us. We're talking about social media and work, what you can and can't say legally. So employers, tell us about a time when you had to draw the line. And employees, when did you cross it? 800-989-8255. Or drop us an email to talk@npr. org. I'm Celeste Headlee. This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) HEADLEE: This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. I'm Celeste Headlee. If social media is the modern water cooler, the place we go to complain about the latest \"Downton Abbey\" episode - and I'm sure there's a lot of you who are complaining - or to crow maybe over our genius child's latest feats, it's only natural we'd turn there to talk about work, also, both the good and the bad. But that becomes tricky for employers, who know that what's said online can reach far beyond one's circle of friends. So recently, the NLRB, that's the National Labor Relations Board, has drawn some conclusions about what kinds of online speech can get an employee fired, some useful guidance for companies that are hoping to draw up policies around social media use and for employees who want to express themselves without losing their jobs. And we want to hear from you. Employers, when have you had to draw the line on social media? And employees, tell us about a time when you crossed that line. The number is 800-989-8255. Our email address is talk@npr. org. Or go to our website, npr. org, and then click on TALK OF THE NATION. Let's hear from Brent(ph) here in Long Island. Brent, you're an employer, right? BRENT: Yes, I am. We have about seven employees at the moment, and I had a situation with - I'm actually friends with two of them online, on Facebook, and a couple of longstanding employees I've had for about 10 years, one of them, you know, had pictures of herself partying online and things like that and putting pictures of herself sort of, you know, holding the wine bottle on all fours kind of thing. And, you know, at first I approached her, and I said: Do you have an issue with alcohol? And she said no, no, I don't. And I just sort of had a conversation like, you know, I'm concerned, you know, these are public pictures. You're putting this out. And it was - I got I know, I know, just a one-time. And anyway, we had a meeting about it actually, and told the employees that you're - it's more - it's less about representing our company, more about just for you personally, I care about you as a person, and I wouldn't want later on this to come back to you, you know, pictures that are sort of - you know, not just holding a wine glass enjoying a drink with friends, but, you know, completely trashed and, you know, that type of thing. She did not put the - I haven't seen pictures like that, and she really, you know, took heed to the warning and cleared it up. HEADLEE: Thank you very much. That's an interesting point. That's Brent calling from Long Island, New York. And Steven, I wonder: Does anything in the NLRB decisions, either present or past, address this? Because that sounds to me like when we talk about professional decorum, maybe that can go a little bit too far, intrude a little too far into your personal life. GREENHOUSE: That would not be - what Brent talked about would generally not be protected by the National Labor Relations Board because it's just people acting alone, being exhibitionist or just plain dumb without, you know, working hand-in-hand with co-workers for, you know, mutual aid and protection or improved working conditions. But there's another issue. Six states now, and most recently Illinois and California, have passed laws that bar employers from asking either job applicants or current employees from turning over their Facebook password in case an employer wants to rummage around to see whether there are drunken pictures of you like that. But also, you know, and, you know, young people who are applying for jobs should be very cognizant of this, a lot of employers do heavy research on you when you're applying for a job and see what they could find out there on the Web about you, pictures on Facebook, pictures with friends, you know, drunk and frolicking. And, you know, that could really hurt you when you're applying for jobs. You know, there are serious Web searches, Google searches by employers, and if there's something embarrassing about you, it could really hurt. And I think Brent gave his employee very good advice. HEADLEE: Let's go to bring Matt Watson into this discussion. He's the author of the \"Bitter Barista\" blog, and he joins us now from member station KUOW in Seattle. And you got fired, Matt, for tweeting about customers who came into the coffee shop, right? MATT WATSON: Yeah, thanks for having me. Yeah, so. . . HEADLEE: Thanks so much for joining us. So yeah, tell us what happened. WATSON: So I started this blog about three weeks ago called \"Bitter Barista,\" which basically was just a place for me to aggregate my workday tweets working as a barista for the last decade. HEADLEE: Now why do it, Matt, while you were still working there? Even if you didn't say the name of the company, why not save that up for your book later? (LAUGHTER) WATSON: You know, I think people from my generation, social media is pretty ubiquitous, and it's just kind of a natural reaction to turn there. The idea for my generation of saving content for a book doesn't make a whole lot of sense, I guess. We kind of like to put it out there. HEADLEE: Was there a social media policy, a printed policy, for you? WATSON: No, I mean, I just worked for a coffee shop. I've never worked for a small business in the food service industry that has a social media policy. So there was nothing spelled out from the start, no. HEADLEE: Well, let me write - let me read you something that you wrote about your boss. You wrote, and I quote: My boss watches the cameras at the cafe, but he'd save time if he just followed my Twitter to see that I'm not working. (LAUGHTER) HEADLEE: Let me read a couple more: I put a macchiato down on the bar and called it out. A customer walks up, drinks it in one gulp and then says I ordered a mocha. And here's another one: If your coffee order takes more than 20 seconds to say, you've forfeited your right to complain about the price. Do you think that your firing is fair? I mean, it seems to me like those are. . . WATSON: Oh yeah. HEADLEE: Oh you do. WATSON: By all means. Yeah, you know, I originally started out the website to be anonymous, and I kind of underestimated the curiosity of the Internet to find out who I was. So about a week and a half ago, another coffee website decided to do some Googling and find out who I was and ended up calling the shop. And once it became not anonymous anymore, it was pretty clear that we couldn't - I couldn't continue working there. HEADLEE: Are you sorry? Did you enjoy your job there? WATSON: Oh yeah, I loved my job. You know, there's a little regret, but at the same time, you know, I did what I could to keep it anonymous, and I'm not really sure on the motives of the people that outed me. So I don't really have any regret, and I'm not entirely sorry. I wish it had gone down differently, but no. HEADLEE: It's a pretty - I mean, I've read it. It's pretty entertaining. You've got a future if you're going to just write about - blog about stuff. That's Matt Watson. WATSON: I appreciate that. HEADLEE: Who is author. . . GREENHOUSE: Can I just jump in? HEADLEE: Go ahead. GREENHOUSE: So Matt, you have a great sense of humor, but it sounds as if the guy who heads your bar, your coffee shop, doesn't have as good a sense of humor as he does. And he's - you know, he's very sensitive to things that might put his business in a poor light. There was a case somewhat similar - there was a case somewhat similar to yours involving the NLRB where a bartender at a restaurant in a Chicago suburb was upset that he hadn't received a raise in five years. So he went onto Facebook to say - to complain that the restaurant's customers were a bunch of rednecks, and he said, you know, he'd hoped they'd choke on glass when they were driving home drunk. So he went to the National Labor Relations Board and said, you know, I'm complaining about not receiving a raise. You know, this is protected activity. And the labor board says basically, you know, bunkum bull, you were just venting, it was actually in a note to his stepsister who was asking him how work was, not a note to co-workers. And they said, you know, you're not really discussing working conditions, you're not doing it in concert with other employees. This was just venting. Forget it, you're gone. HEADLEE: All right, that is Matt Watson, he's - well, you just heard Steven Greenhouse of the New York Times, but Matt Watson was with us, author of the Bitter Barista blog, joining us from member station KUOW in Seattle. Thank you very much. You have a job now? Are you still unemployed, Matt, or. . . WATSON: I'm still unemployed but working on some writing stuff and some music stuff, so. . . HEADLEE: That's probably a good idea. WATSON: Absolutely. HEADLEE: No more coffee shops. (LAUGHTER) HEADLEE: Let's take a call here. Thank you very much, Matt. Let's take a call here from David(ph) in Chico, California, and David, tell me about the line that's been established at your workplace on social media. DAVID: Well, we're - I'm in kind of an unusual situation in that I'm both a hospital nurse and also a union representative for nurses. And so I get involved in both sides of this National Labor Relations Board. And the line that we tell people is that again, it is just what Steven has said, that if it's concerted activity, and in fact we have a union Facebook group at the hospital that we use for communicating on union issues and things like that, and that's a perfectly protected activity under those guidelines. But we tell people really clearly, don't get involved in just ranting about your work. And most especially don't do something that is ranting about a patient or might somehow give patients the impression that they wouldn't get as good care as anybody else if you, you know, were upset at a certain category of patient or something like that. You know, this could be the - say, the emergency room nurse upset with the patient who's coming in for the third time this week, or something like that. HEADLEE: Right, well, that sounds like pretty sensible advice. That's David calling from Chico, California. Let me just ask you, really quickly, Mari Smith, you consult people on this. What - are businesses concerned, do you think, about their liability should they fire someone and it be found to be an unlawful termination? SMITH: Gosh, yes, oh, businesses should be concerned about this of course and always want to be representing the company in the best light. And, you know, it's interesting, and there's also something, what I like to call the back channel. And even though, you know, something might be going online, and maybe it complies with the laws, and it's shared in a personal social profile, but it still will hold the company in a bad light. I mean, there was an example just a few days ago, without disclosing the identity of these people, but there were two - a couple of heads, of major known names in tech companies were over in a foreign country and romping around, naked and drunk. And somehow, a video ends up on Facebook. And a whole bunch of us are chatting in the background about this. Nobody's dared putting any comments - well, people in my circle. But they were getting comments. And that interaction, that behavior has forever impacted my impression of these companies. HEADLEE: Yeah. Well if it can happen to Prince Harry, it can happen to anybody, right? SMITH: Yeah. (LAUGHTER) SMITH: Right, exactly. HEADLEE: Let's take another call here, Anthony in Lexington, Kentucky, and you were fired from your work. Can you tell us that story, Anthony? ANTHONY: Yeah. Hi. I was working for a Catholic church in Lexington, Kentucky, and posted on Facebook that I was in a relationship with another man. I had my Facebook profile locked down to only about 40 viewers, and they cited Facebook and said that I wasn't in good standing with the church and told me that I could either resign or be fired. HEADLEE: Oh, I'm very sorry that happened to you. But let me take this to Steven Greenhouse. Thank you very much for that phone call. That's Anthony in Lexington, Kentucky. Steven, protected, not protected? That's a rough one. GREENHOUSE: It's a rough one. I guess, Anthony, if you were discussing your sexual orientation with a co-worker, and I'm - in theory, talking about how we need to try to change the church, good luck, to make it more tolerant of gays, one could say that you were advocating together to improve working conditions. But you know, government agencies, as you know, are very, very reluctant to interfere in the internal workings of religious organizations. So even though, Anthony, it might be considered, you know, cooperative concerted activity to help each other, I think the labor board is not going to really want to get involved in telling the Catholic Church what to do. I want to add, Celeste, there was one case that the NLRB was involved in, that was very similar to what David and Mari were just discussing before. You know, a female employee. . . HEADLEE: David was the. . . GREENHOUSE: David from Chico. . . HEADLEE: Right, the nurse. GREENHOUSE: . . . the nurse. That there was a case in which a female employee at a facility for homeless people with metal health issues, she was fired after she wrote on Facebook that it was, quote,\"spooky,\" unquote, working there on the overnight shift. And this woman also wrote on Facebook: My dear client - this was a homeless patient - my dear client - is cracking up at my post. I don't whether if she's laughing at me, with me or at the voices inside her head. And the board, you know, of the institution saw this post and fired her, and the labor board upheld that saying, this did not really involve conditions of employment, it wasn't done with co-workers and that she had clearly violated the home's policy of not disclosing confidential information about clients. HEADLEE: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. So let's talk a little bit more, Mari, about how exactly you counsel employers to create social media policies. How much leeway do you think they should give? I mean, is it safer for a business to just clamp down on it completely or is that - is there a danger in being too restrictive? SMITH: I think there is, Celeste, yes. I wouldn't recommend being too restrictive because people are going to find ways to, you know, go outside the lines anyway, I love Zappos' policy, Zappos, with their 10 core values and the company culture emerges from that, and their social media policy is very, very simple. It's use your common sense, use common courtesy. If you're not sure, seek permission. Be appropriate and polite, diplomatic, respect confidentiality, et cetera. However, we have to always remember that wonderful line from the movie \"The Social Network,\" that the Internet is in ink. You know, you can't really go back and delete it. So the thing with Zappos, that kind of open approach will not work for every company. And so, one of the first things that I do with my clients is to really do an assessment of where they're at with their current company culture and what the sentiment is, if you will, of the employees and to talk to employees to find out, you know, the kinds of things that they are sharing. Often, you know, people will be sharing things on Facebook thinking it's locked down to just a few friends, and in fact, they're inadvertently sharing things to public. HEADLEE: Well, that's what Anthony found out, the caller. SMITH: Exactly. Yeah. That's so unfortunate and plus, you never know it. My rule of thumb is this is that you never, ever want to share anything online at all, ever, ever that you wouldn't want on the front page of The New York Times, found in a Google search in years to come and proud of your own mom to see. Those are my simple points. . . HEADLEE: Although, Steven could tell you, Mari, how hard it is to get something on the front page of The New York Times. But let's take a call here. . . (LAUGHTER) HEADLEE: . . . from Katherine(ph) in St. Louis, Missouri. Katherine, you actually helped to handle social media for a large bank, right? KATHERINE: Yes. HEADLEE: What kind of counseling did you give? KATHERINE: Well, basically, it was strategy, just getting up and going, and then I had to forge a very valuable relationship with Legal and Compliance, and then also HR. But what we were finding was that some employees would get to their bank branch and then check in and actually, probably, tell people that they were sick or they would talk about, you know, a customer that would come in. And so, not only were they checking in and letting everyone know what branch they were at, but then also letting people know that they were sick too. So. . . HEADLEE: Your mean like when you post on Twitter or Facebook and it tells the location to where you are? KATHERINE: Well, that or you can use Foursquare to check in. And a lot of times, employees will, you know, want to be the king of that particular branch, so it. . . HEADLEE: The mayor. KATHERINE: . . . depends on how many. . . HEADLEE: It's mayor, Katherine. KATHERINE: The mayor, the mayor. Right, right. (LAUGHTER) KATHERINE: And so, yeah. And so we would go to HR and, you know, their hands were really tied that, you know, it's such a new landscape that I think a lot of HR departments are just having trouble navigating. You know. there's just so little information. HEADLEE: You think? Yeah, that's a really - that's great point. That's Katherine in St. Louis, Missouri. Thank you so much, Katherine. And this, this is a good point that she's brought up, Steven, how new it is. For example, what if I just post a picture on Instagram, can I get fired for a picture I take at work that somebody thinks is not flattering? GREENHOUSE: You know, generally, in the United States, employers can fire you for virtually any reason. If they don't like the color of your shoelaces, you know. You know the reasons you can't be fired, you know, because of your race, because of your religion, because of your national origin. But they can fire you because they don't like the way you blink your eyes. So if you post something on Instagram that they don't like because it's yellow and not red, in theory, they could fire you. But if you post something on Instagram saying, you know, our wages are too low, we have to work together and I'm posting this with my. . . HEADLEE: That's protected. GREENHOUSE: . . . the person who sits next to me, that's protected. HEADLEE: Steven Greenhouse is the labor and workplace reporter for The New York Times. We talked to him from his studio there. Mari Smith is social media consultant. We spoke to her by phone from her office in San Diego, California. Thanks to both of you. GREENHOUSE: Thanks very much. Nice to be here. HEADLEE: Coming up, the horse meat scandal that is rocking Europe right now. It leads us to ask, why are certain meats taboo in certain places? I'm Celeste Headlee.

Coming up, if your seven-year-old was topping out the weight charts for her age, what do you think you'd do? Sign her up for dance class, cut out dessert, wait and see what happens? We'll hear about the steps one mom took when she realized her daughter was losing the battle of the bulge and the incredible blowback she got from friends and family. She'll tell us about it all in just a few minutes. But, first, we are going to continue our series celebrating Black History Month. All this month, we've been speaking with African-Americans on the cutting edge in the so-called stem fields, science, technology, engineering and math. Today, we'll hear from a real player in the field. Lisette Titre turned her love of video games into a career in the multibillion dollar gaming industry. She got her first job in that industry at EA, the company behind blockbuster games like \"Madden NFL. \" While there, she worked on everything from zombie-slaying adventures to digital dance battles like \"Dance Central 3. \"(SOUNDBITE OF \"DANCE CENTRAL 3\")UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: One man will rise up. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Dance Central wil soon have a new leader. . . MARTIN: Lisette Titre, who's now working as a freelance video game designer, says that her work is more than fun and games. It takes a lot of math and science skills to create the lifelike graphics that make these games so popular and Lisette Titre is with us now. Thanks so much for joining us. LISETTE TITRE: Thanks for having me. MARTIN: So how did this get started? Were you a kid who always loved video games? TITRE: Yeah. I've been playing games all my life. I've been drawing since I can remember. I think it started when I saw \"Toy Story. \" It sort of clicked for me that I could be an artist and also use my left and my right brain and do very technical work, in addition to creating beautiful art. So it was really \"Toy Story\" that sort of drove me to go to school for computer animation. MARTIN: Talk to me, if you would, about - you said that one of the things that's great about your work is that it combines both your right brain and left brain. Talk a little bit about both the art, as well as the math and the science. Could you talk a little bit about that? TITRE: Sure. The art is - you know, pretty obvious. When you play a game, you see the art, which you're physically interacting with, or the props, or the environment or the characters. But what's really driving a lot of the art is actually math, science and technology. So you know, things like explosions - those are driven by physics. You know, when a character is running forward, backward and side-to-side, that's all basic trigonometry functions that are happening. So, for me, as an artist creating art for a game, you know, there's a lot of coding and scripting that needs to be sort of manipulated to get things to work properly. So in addition to being creative and creating beautiful visuals, I also have to interact with this technology to get it to function properly. MARTIN: What does it take to be excellent in your field? TITRE: First of all, it takes a thick skin. You have to be OK with failing and failing several times until you get it right. It's a lot of problem-solving and self-motivation. Nobody's going to stand over your shoulder and tell you what to do. You kind of have to keep beating your head against the wall until you get it right. MARTIN: You know, to that end, you are a double minority in your field. It's not just about race. It's also about gender. I think the numbers indicate that only about 10 percent of people involved in the industry are women, of any race or ethnicity, and I don't think that it's a secret that the field is predominantly white male - and Asian male, as well. Do you feel you have anything in particular to navigate because of that? TITRE: I do find that it is actually an advantage in some way, because I can bring a different perspective than other people can in the room; so I try to make sure I share my opinions, especially if I feel like the content is a little off. People need that sort of insight, you know, in the industry right now, because there is a lack of diversity and that lack of diversity leads to a lack of ideas; and that lack of ideas is also translating to poor sales in some areas. MARTIN: Every now and again when the subject comes up, people also talk about - it's not just what the character looks like, it's what the character does and what circumstances the character is placed in, and what choices he or she is called upon to make. It's no secret that, a lot of times, people have a lot of problems with the way women are positioned in these games. And I just wonder, do you feel like you have a voice in that, in that aspect of the story? TITRE: You know, if I feel something is a little risqu\u00e9 or in poor taste, I try to point it out and be like, this isn't cool. But I will. . . MARTIN: Well, but to that point, though, can you do it if you're not in the room? TITRE: . . . enlighten it to them. MARTIN: I mean, if you're not in the room - right - then you can't speak up. . . TITRE: Yes. MARTIN: . . . if you're not there to speak up. Right? TITRE: You have to be present. You know, I think there would be different decisions made if there were different people in the room. MARTIN: What goes into developing characters? And do you have a favorite? TITRE: Usually, it comes down to what the game designer decides the character's role is in the game, and then the artists take it from there. They, sort of, start doing concept sketches or just drawings of what the character looks like and then, you know, someone like me would come on and take that sketch and develop it into a full 3-D character. As far as my favorite character, I would have to say Glitch from \"Dance Central 3\" was probably one of my favorite characters. He's just a quirky, innocent cool kid who loves to dance, and his positivity and innocence is very refreshing. MARTIN: I love his hair. TITRE: Yes. His hair is pretty cool. MARTIN: Can you describe it for people who haven't seen it? Kind of a widow's peak kind of thing. I don't know. What would you. . . TITRE: Yeah. There's a lot of product involved in his hair. MARTIN: That's fierce. TITRE: It's very sculpted and stylized with streaks of color. It's a lot of fun. He was lot of fun to work on. MARTIN: And he has some good moves. TITRE: Yes, he does. MARTIN: You kind of can see him kind of busting loose in the supermarket, or something, just to make everybody happy. I don't know. He's what my little girl would call - he's a nice boy. TITRE: He is a nice boy. MARTIN: He's a nice boy. TITRE: Yeah. MARTIN: I was going to ask you about Blacks In Gaming. Just to describe it for folks who haven't heard, but it's a nonprofit trying to create networking and collaboration opportunities and also - what - outreach and education so that more people think of the opportunity to work in gaming. But - I'm sorry. Lisette, I'm sorry. What you do is so cool. Do you ever stop to say that? Do you ever look at yourself in the mirror, like, in the ladies' room, and say, it's so cool, what I do? TITRE: I definitely have moments. I think the most pleasure I get out of talking about what I do is the outreach that I do through Blacks In Gaming. You know, we have a speakers' group where we go out to elementary schools or middle schools and disadvantaged areas, and we talk to kids about tech and, you know, what it means to be in the game industry. I'm trying to change the way minorities think about technology and being proud of being intelligent, being proud of being a blerd(ph), you know. MARTIN: Tell me, what's a blerd? What's a blerd? A blerd is a. . . TITRE: A black nerd. MARTIN: Did you come up with that? TITRE: I think it's a cultural term, at this point, but it's something I identify with. I didn't have a hip word for it before, but I've always been a blerd. MARTIN: Do you mind, though, if I ask, though, when you first started out and you walked into a room, were people surprised to see you there? TITRE: Of course. They always are. MARTIN: They still are? TITRE: They still are. I've been around for a while and, you know, people know me wherever I go at this point. It's a very small industry, like, two degrees of separation. So you know, people who know me aren't surprised, but you know, you get the people who see my name and it's not exactly African-American by description. You know, Lisette's very French, so they expect a little French woman to walk in - and it's me. But, you know, it doesn't take long for me to do. And I am who I am, and then they sort of understand that I know what I'm talking about. MARTIN: And what does it mean when you walk into those schools and kids see you for the first time and realize that it's you who's designing some of these games who is a player in designing some of these games? What is that like? TITRE: I think it means a lot. I don't think a lot of kids - they don't think about what it takes to make a game and they don't - may not even think about who is making the games, but when they see someone who looks like them in front of them, talking about something that they enjoy on a daily basis, explaining to them in, you know, basic technical terms what's happening on the screen, something clicks. You know, you see it click, especially with little black women who come in and see me speak, you know, their eyes light up and you can see a light going off, which is great. MARTIN: Lisette Titre is a freelance video game artist and she joined us from member station KQED in San Francisco. Lisette Titre, thank you so much for joining us. TITRE: Thank you for having me.

Joining me to talk about the promise and possible pitfalls of 3-D printing is Terry Wohlers, president of Wohlers Associates, a consulting firm that follows the 3-D printing industry. He joins us by phone from Fort Collins, Colorado. Welcome to the program. TERRY WOHLERS: Oh, thanks, Jennifer. LUDDEN: So what are some things you have used 3-D printing for? WOHLERS: Well, I've had many different types of parts made over the years - automotive parts, parts of scanned images of faces. Just last week, I received 50 stainless steel bottle openers that have our name on the side to give away as gifts. Just a wide range of - well, we have a little 3-D printer in our office just mostly for playing, experimentation. And we made some Christmas tree ornaments and other little items like that as gifts. And so you can make just about anything you can imagine and model up on a computer. LUDDEN: OK. And I've seen the pictures of these products. We've had them on our website. Lots of stories done this week, since President Obama mentioned 3-D printing in his State of the Union. But I just - I can't quite get my mind around it. Can you please give us a layman's description? How does this work? WOHLERS: Sure. I'd be happy to. So you start out with a computer model. And the way that's constructed is usually with computer-aided design software that's intended to allow you to create a three-dimension object. And it can be a technical part, like a cell phone or automotive part, or it can be a figurine or an action figure. It can be just about anything. And then special software slices that model, that digital model up into thin, horizontal cross-sections. And then it takes each of those cross-sections, sends them to the 3-D printer, and the 3-D printer prints each one after the other, one on top of the next, to create an object. And so it can be a very complex shape, like even a human skull that would be difficult to manufacture any other way. But the computer doesn't care, nor does the 3-D printer. It just takes these cross sections and prints them. And it can work with powder and a laser. And then your parts are fully encased in a powder at the end. And you remove the powder, brush it away, and there are your parts, along with internal cavities and channels and so forth, whatever the. . . LUDDEN: But, I mean, what materials go in? Don't you have - do you have, like, a big cavity? Is there heat involved? Is it, you know, molded in there? What do you put in to make this happen? WOHLERS: Yeah, well - sure. Well, you start out - in this case, the one I was describing is a plastic powder. And the - it's called thermoplastic, like a nylon or ABS plastic, and it melts under heat. So a laser's used, and the laser traces it, draws the - each of those cross-sections that I described one after the other. And the second cross-section adheres to the first, and the third to the second, and so forth. And so it melts the plastic together, but it does it in a very precise way so that the quality of the parts can be quite good, especially with the high-end professional-grade systems. There are. . . LUDDEN: And it's being built there. You can see while it's being built? Or does it just kind of pop out of the machine all made? WOHLERS: Well, when the part - and typically, you build multiple parts at once if you can - will be fully enclosed inside the material. So when the build process is finished, the parts are inside, in this case, the powder, and you remove the powder, and then your parts are inside. There are systems that will print a polymer, a plastic material with an inkjet print head, and so it deposits layer by layer in the same fashion. And then at the end, there's some extra material that you have to remove, because it can have overhanging features that need to be supported. And so there can be some handwork at the end, but the same basic idea is you're printing layer by layer. LUDDEN: Wow. All right. Let's get some callers on the line. Mark is in Gainesville, Florida. Hi, Mark. MARK: Hi there. How are you doing today? LUDDEN: Good. MARK: Yeah. So I'm an engineering student at the University of Florida, and we actually use the same exact 3-D printers that have been described here in our - in my undergraduate classes. One thing that we did was we kind of had to design something using computer-aided graphic design. We actually used SolidWorks in my class, and me and my group made a Rubik's cube. Unfortunately, it doesn't print in color. It's just kind of like an off-white color is what ours printed, at least. And so we painted on the different sides, and were able to use it. So I thought it was kind of interesting that it's being used in higher education, as well. LUDDEN: Huh. Interesting. All right. So you're still in school? MARK: Yes. LUDDEN: OK. So you don't know if you're going to make a business using all of this technology yet. MARK: Not quite, no. But I just thought it was exactly the same thing. He actually - he pulled it up in class. He had a webcam set up on the printer, I don't know, from a building on campus, and he showed it to us. We checked in on it a random few times during class, and he pulled it up on this other projector and showed us through the - it was printing and moving around, doing layer by layer and moving. And so each person got to kind of like make their own thing and send it to the printer. LUDDEN: Oh. Thanks so much, Mark. MARK: Thank you. LUDDEN: Let's get another call - Jon in Ithaca. Hi, Jon. JON: Hi, there. LUDDEN: What do you print? JON: So I run a startup called Widetronix. We're making very tiny batteries. And we actually use a 3-D printer to make what's called the transistor outline, or the standard semi-conductor packaging that you can buy in the millions in the marketplace. But we wanted to develop something custom and prototype it, and it was much less expensive for us to actually develop these really tiny packages for our battery technology. LUDDEN: OK. And this is - so you're using it and manufacturing - you're not - you don't feel threatened by the technology. You're taking advantage of it. JON: Well, it's a much less-expensive way to actually prototype a semi-conductor package that is kind of non-standard. Typically, it's been upwards of 10 or $15,000 to actually have a packaging manufacture do the molds and kind of put it all together and stamp out, you know, a couple of thousand of them for you, which is kind of overkill when you're just trying to prototype something. LUDDEN: All right, Jon. Thank you so much. JON: You're welcome. LUDDEN: Terry Wohlers, was there some weird thing like this on \"Star Trek\" some years back or something? Did someone imagine this? You know, we heard about Steve Jobs imagining iPhones and things years, decades ago. Did I miss that \"Star Trek\" episode that had all this happening? WOHLERS: Well, there's a \"Star Trek\" replicator you may be thinking of, and some people have thought of that as, in the future, we'll be able to walk up to a device and get whatever you want. And, essentially, it's headed in that direction. We will have that opportunity to get parts made much quicker, less expensively, easier. And there'll be many factories set up - well, I can't say everywhere, but in a lot of places, even in some homes, where people will operate businesses, hobbyists have already started to buy these machines. And so it's really changing the face of manufacturing. It's really a fundamental way of thinking of manufacturing, because in the past - well, even today, a lot of products are built in the thousands or millions at a big organization where you have hundreds of thousands of people coming to that location, and now, if you can imagine an individual having a personal factory in his or her home or dorm room or small office somewhere. LUDDEN: But is that going to mean fewer jobs? I mean, it's some people take advantage, and other people get hurt by this. I mean, what's this going to do to China? WOHLERS: Well, I think if you're wanting to buy a trashcan or equip a stadium with stadium seats, you'll go to China or someplace else to get those because they're big, basic in shape, inexpensive items. But if you want more specialized, custom or semi-custom, limited edition products, or even small quantities of some type of product for aerospace, medical, some consumer products, then this makes a lot of sense. So I think it's going to create not thousands, but tens of thousands of new opportunities, businesses throughout the U. S. and elsewhere. So it's a very exciting time. LUDDEN: All right. Let's get a call in. Joe is in San Francisco. Hi, Joe. JOE: Hi. I just want to add that I think it's just another one of those tools that come on and democratize a process that typically before was limited to big engineering companies that has the tools to do it. I went to a how-to fair with my son this summer, and there was probably half a dozen or so booths using the 3-D printer in all sorts of different ways. One, a guy made a guitar using a 3-D printer, and it took just a few hours, I guess, from what he told. It put out the parts, and then assemble it, and it played. And it was pretty amazing what the capabilities of this equipment is. And it just - I think it's just the beginning of what is - kind of the potential is. LUDDEN: All right. Joe, thanks so much. JOE: You're welcome. LUDDEN: Terry Wohlers, I mean, do you see the shift in manufacturing already? Or have companies been using this, and are they - what shifts do you see? WOHLERS: Well, we're already seeing companies in aerospace, such as Boeing, they're flying 22,000 parts made in this way on 10 different types of aircraft, both military and commercial. We're seeing medical orthopedic implant companies in Europe, and now in United States. More than - for example, more than 80,000 metal and titanium, solid titanium hip implants have been manufactured to date. About 30,000 of those have been implanted into patients. More than 15,000 dental copings are made everyday. A dental coping is the main body, the main structure of a crown or bridge. About 15,000 of those are being made - manufactured every day of the week. And so that's - these are very recent developments, just in the last few years. And as medical companies and aerospace companies certify more designs, we're going to see the demand for machines, the materials and new businesses to support the need that's developing. LUDDEN: All right. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News. Madeline is in Ferdinand, Indiana. Hi, Madeline. Welcome to the program. MADELINE: Hello. How are you? LUDDEN: Good. MADELINE: Hello. I'm a junior at Forest Park High School here in Ferdinand. And I'm a Project Lead the Way student in engineering, and we've had a 3-D printer for over two years. And by using that technology and printing out things we developed on Autodesk or CAD, it has really helped us foster creativity and make things for projects or displays and learn about isometric views. LUDDEN: Excellent. Thank you for sharing, Madeline. MADELINE: You're welcome. LUDDEN: What was your favorite project or product? MADELINE: Well, we've made so many things. I don't know. I got to make some little key chains and things to my friends, which is really great, but we're actually working on a wind energy project, and we've made a lot our components with it. So it's been a great help. LUDDEN: All right. Thanks so much for the call. MADELINE: Thank you. LUDDEN: But, Terry Wohlers, aren't there still some legal issues here at play, and copyright? What about, you know, see it and make it, but someone else has already made that first? What does the law say here? WOHLERS: Well, you're right, Jennifer. It has never been to easier to copy a design and then print it. And so it's going to be a big - well, I guess the legal professionals certainly benefit from this new development. We have three-dimensional scanning tools that can capture a shape, an object, and create that digital model that we talked about earlier. And then once you have that, then you can print it out. And, of course, some people can copy things any - well, let's hope that not too much of this goes on, but we know it will, and it already has. And so is there a problem? Yes. There's been IP laws in place for very long time, copyright trademark and patent laws. So it's hopeful that most people will respect those, but we know that many won't. So now we have the tools to copy and remake things. And so, well, it's anybody guess as to how that will unfold. LUDDEN: All right. Well, meanwhile, we have people who've responded to our Twitter challenge. Some tweets came in, one from @fourwhitefeet: I'd like to print breakfast, lunch and dinner on a 3-D printer like the Jetsons. Any chance for that? WOHLERS: Well, we've already seen companies and universities experiment and develop processes of 3-D printing that can print chocolate and can print cheese. LUDDEN: That you can eat. You can eat these things. WOHLERS: That's correct. Yes. And so - cheesecake icing, as well. There's a development going on here in the United States, the ideas to print beef. So instead of slaughtering cattle, you could print a fillet and serve it. LUDDEN: Oh, I hear a new food movement coming, and a backlash against it. OK. From claraharris: I want a 3-D printer to make Lego pieces to replace the ones Kiddo loses, or specialty pieces to let him design his own. How about that? That sounds pretty reasonable. WOHLERS: Yeah. Well, we've already seen some of that. If you go on the Web and Google the right terms, you can find some examples of that already. So, yeah, that's - makes a lot of sense. LUDDEN: More things to step on in the house. OK. This is from @idlbeokay_bob, I believe: I would make copies of rare artwork, like statues. That might get into the legal arena, no? WOHLERS: Yeah. Well, you know, that's a good point. If you have something that could be stolen or broken or somehow damaged, it'd be nice to have a backup copy of that. And so, yeah, that's possible now in museums like the Smithsonian. They're looking at digitizing and making replicas of these different artifacts and other pieces that they have. And, of course, if you go into these gift shops, they have scaled-down versions of these different items that you see in museums. So it could be used in that way, as well. LUDDEN: Wow. All right. A final tweet, Julian Brooks(ph) says: A functional government, definitely. (LAUGHTER)LUDDEN: We wish him luck on that one. Final few seconds, what else are you looking for as this technology develops, Terry Wohlers? WOHLERS: What else am I looking for? Well, we - the really big opportunity is to use this to manufacture parts. It's been used for more than two decades as a tool for prototyping. So the real big opportunity and where the money is is in manufacturing, and to do the types of products, hopefully, here domestically, rather than outsourcing around the world, and to do that in a very smart way and in - on a demand basis - in other words, rather than building millions of something or thousands and having them in warehouses, to have your inventory digital, and to print on-demand. LUDDEN: All right. Terry Wohlers, president of Wohlers Associates on the 3-D printing industry. Thank you so much. WOHLERS: Oh, you're welcome. LUDDEN: Tomorrow, it's Book Club day on TALK OF THE NATION. We'll discuss Dian Fossey's \"Gorillas in the Mist. \" This is TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News. I'm Jennifer Ludden, in Washington.

And, of course, if you go into these gift shops, they have scaled-down versions of these different items that you see in museums. So it could be used in that way, as well. LUDDEN: Wow. All right. A final tweet, Julian Brooks(ph) says: A functional government, definitely. (LAUGHTER) LUDDEN: We wish him luck on that one. Final few seconds, what else are you looking for as this technology develops, Terry Wohlers? WOHLERS: What else am I looking for? Well, we - the really big opportunity is to use this to manufacture parts. It's been used for more than two decades as a tool for prototyping. So the real big opportunity and where the money is is in manufacturing, and to do the types of products, hopefully, here domestically, rather than outsourcing around the world, and to do that in a very smart way and in - on a demand basis - in other words, rather than building millions of something or thousands and having them in warehouses, to have your inventory digital, and to print on-demand. LUDDEN: All right. Terry Wohlers, president of Wohlers Associates on the 3-D printing industry. Thank you so much. WOHLERS: Oh, you're welcome.

The Internet is the new battleground. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: We know foreign countries and companies swipe our corporate secrets. Now our enemies are also seeking the ability to sabotage our power grid, our financial institutions, our air traffic control systems. We cannot look back years from now and wonder why we did nothing in the face of real threats to our security and our economy. FLATOW: In his State of the Union address, President Obama said we need to focus more on cybersecurity. That point was driven home this week by a report released by Mandiant, an American security firm, which claims a unit of the Chinese military has been carrying out extensive cyber-espionage against the U. S. since 2006. And it goes beyond stealing corporate secrets. The report says agencies that control critical infrastructure, everything from power grids to hydro, have been targeted by Chinese hackers. Is China engaged in cyberwarfare against the U. S. ? And if it is, why are we so surprised? Doesn't the U. S. do it, don't - doesn't everybody do it? In this brave new world of cybersecurity, how can we protect our most valuable networks and systems? Our number is 1-800-989-8255 if you'd like to get in on the conversation. You can also tweet us @scifri, @-S-C-I-F-R-I, go to our website at sciencefriday. com. Jon Lindsay is a research fellow at the University of California Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation, that's at U. C. San Diego. He joins us. Welcome to the program. JON LINDSAY: Thanks, good to be here. FLATOW: Is the president overstating the threat? LINDSAY: Well, there's definitely a lot of malicious cyber-activity that's happening. The question is whether this really raises to the level of a national security threat, whether because it is a massive transfer of wealth through espionage or if there are risks to our critical infrastructure on the level of, you know, large-scale military attack. And there are big debates on both of those questions. FLATOW: But he is right about all the attacks that are occurring. LINDSAY: Absolutely. We can certainly observe a lot of activity, especially from China there is a lot of hacking activity. But again the question is how do you relate activity to actual strategic effect. And that is a more tenuous question. FLATOW: Let's talk about this new report. What kinds of things did we learn from it? LINDSAY: So this new report is fascinating for - you know, we've had several very interesting reports over the last several years of hacking, which almost certainly originated in China, but that was always based on looking at the motive, the kinds of targets that were hit, maybe a history of attacking, things like this. This is the first report in the public domain, which makes a very, very strong case for not only China, not only the Chinese military but this particular unit. So, you know, I think that attribution case in this was pretty good. FLATOW: So you think that the real news is that it's in the public domain because most people in the business know this already? LINDSAY: Yeah, I think that's true. I mean, when you look at the kinds of information that they provided, no piece of information on its own was a smoking gun, right. So I mean you have Internet addresses from China, you have servers that are in China, you have telephone numbers used to verify Gmail accounts that are in China. You have some, you know, Chinese language in some of the code and idiosyncratic behavior and whatnot. So, you know, any of these by themselves don't work, but when you see how you put them all together, that's how you see how the fusion of all that intelligence can help to make the attribution case. So I think this just helps to highlight the kind of information that people in the forensics business have been tracking for a while. FLATOW: And in the report, what type of organizations are being targeted? LINDSAY: In the report, you know, they lay out a very wide range. I mean, it's everything from the energy industry to the chemical industry to information technology was one of the big ones. I mean, you name it. And what's very interesting is that there's a pretty good, you know, correlation between that and the strategic emerging industries that China is interested in developing. So again, this is, you know, the kinds of targets are the kinds of things that, you know, China would be interested in. FLATOW: Something like our infrastructure, like our electrical grid, things like that? LINDSAY: Sure, but again, you know, you have to ask what is the reason that they're looking at these things. I mean, is - are they interested in finding out information about how it works so maybe they can improve their own operations or, you know, economic espionage? Or is this, you know, the toehold for the great cyber-Pearl Harbor? And this is where it's - you know, I find that proposition a little bit harder to believe. FLATOW: Is it more than you think for stealing company secrets or strategies for negotiating with the companies that they deal with all the time? LINDSAY: Yes, I mean, there's a great deal of theft in all of these things, and you can definitely think of lots of things. There'd be research and development on products and processes that could be valuable, negotiating plans and strategies, mergers and acquisitions could be incredibly valuable, a lot of stuff. But then all this information then gets, you know, sucked into the Chinese intelligence apparatus. The first question is: Well, are they actually getting that information? You know, we know that there's an incredible amount of junk information on networks and on the Internet in general. So finding that needle in the haystack when you've got the haystacks growing really quickly is very, very difficult. Then they have to identify that that is useful information. Then they have to be able to get that to a customer that can use it. And there's a great deal of Chinese bureaucracy in the Chinese state between, you know, the PLA Third Department and the actual state-owned enterprises that might be able to use it. Then they would have to recognize it. So, you know, I guess my bottom line is you can steal text, but you can't steal the context that makes that text really, really valuable. So we see a tremendous amount of information being sucked out that would be potentially useful, but to actually call that a transfer of wealth requires that the Chinese are actually able to do something with it, and that's something that we really do not know anything about. And the Mandiant report did not give us any new information on that front. FLATOW: But China can't be the only country that's doing this. Don't we all do it? LINDSAY: I - that's a great point. You know, there was a - the U. S. government released a report a year and a half, two years ago that also named Russia as a major player in cyberespionage for economic purposes. But clearly the U. S. is very involved. You think of Stuxnet, Flame, Duqu, Gala, a lot of these kinds of things that were designed for, you know, more political- and military-type espionage. This is certainly a new modality of information collection, and, you know, all countries with advanced intelligence organizations and military are in on the game. FLATOW: Let me go to the phones, 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to Terry(ph) in Robbins, Tennessee. Hi Terry. TERRY: Hello, Ira. Thank you. FLATOW: Hey there, you're welcome. TERRY: My question is the - well, first of all, it's all of the above as far as the uses, but isn't all that outsourcing that we did of sending all of our computer manufacturing and everything to China really showing up to be real cheap now, that we're going to have to deal with all the repercussions? FLATOW: Are you saying that - and this is an interesting point. If we're buying all oru hardware from China, could there not be stuff, Trojan horses and things inside the hardware they're sending us? LINDSAY: Yeah, that's a really important concern. You know, we talk about the security of supply chains and the fact that, you know, China is the factory and the workshop of the world, especially on IT. You know, there could be a lot of back doors. And in fact this is a concern that prompted Australia to ban Huawei, which is the major telecommunications company, they build servers and routers, Internet infrastructure, they banned them from bidding on their high-speed backbone project. There also was a House report on Huawei, which recommended against dealing with either Huawei or ZTE for exactly these kinds of reasons. You know, but that kind of shows you that, you know, that concern can have a huge business impact for these corporations. So do they necessarily have an interest in getting involved? Plus, again, you know, I won't get into the technical details, but if you start thinking about, you know, if you put a bug in there, then actually being able to use it at a time and place of your choosing is going to be a really difficult proposition because supply chains are incredibly, incredibly complex. So being able to activate that logic bomb, if you will, and understanding where it is and understanding all of the other complex factors that go into its embeddedness in human and technical systems is a really, really hard thing. So, you know, it's a genuine concern, but again it's a technical possibility is probably a lot greater than its actual probability. FLATOW: Is there a high-tech fix to any of this snooping around? LINDSAY: To snooping around? No, I don't think there's a high-tech fix because, you know, if you -you know, the Mandiant report and, you know, plenty of other reports from MacAfee or Symantec which kind of walk you through similar information show you that the weaknesses are less technical and more in exploiting just human gullibility or, you know, people who let their guard down. Some of these phishing emails are incredibly sophisticated, right. I mean, if it comes from your boss, and it's talking about a project that you're working on, you're going to be very likely to open that file. Well, you've just installed a root kit onto your server, and now they can start moving laterally and, you know, compromising other pieces of the network. FLATOW: So that's how they can do it? You had something called \"spear phishing,\" which is even higher level than regular - P-H-I-S-H, phishing. LINDSAY: Yeah, so the term \"spear phishing\" means that, you know, they have identified you and your interests and your relationships. So for example, you know, you might get an email from one of your colleagues at NPR that says hey Ira, this is about the story that we're running next week. And you're like OK, that's interesting. You would open that up, bam, you get hit. So they made it very, very believable because they did the intelligence work on your background, which is now very easy to do because we have Twitter and Facebook, and people put all kinds of personal information that they can basically, you know, fake a contact. FLATOW: Yeah, that's why I don't open my NPR mail anymore. (LAUGHTER)FLATOW: So is there - what do you see of the future here? Where is this headed? LINDSAY: Well, I think that there's going to continue to be a lot of noise and friction in cyberspace. This isn't going to get fixed, but I think it's just going to be sort of the general level of background radiation that we will get used to. You know, when militaries go to war, there will be a cyber component, but people don't go to war because of cyberspace, you know, they just use it as one tool amongst many. So, you know, it's going to be a complex world, but I don't think it's necessarily going to be a more dangerous world. FLATOW: If you unplug for total security, can you have total security? Let's say you want to just unplug from the Internet and stay in-house. LINDSAY: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, you know, the only reason that people can hack your computer is because you're connected to the network. So if you don't connect to anything, you can't do anything. But then it's not very useful. And this gets to the fundamental tradeoff in a lot of the policy that we're considering. If we get really scared about the threat, and we start imposing, you know, technology standards and, you know, all kinds of things that would impact the productivity of our information networks, then you're going to see kind of the great gifts of the information economy start to be whittled away. So right now we just don't have a good sense of how fast the threat is increasing relative to the productivity benefits of computers. And everything that I've looked at says that, you know, for every dollar that we make because of computers in the workplace, you know, we're definitely not losing a dollar, in fact we're losing, you know, far less than that. FLATOW: All right, I've got to go, Jon. LINDSAY: OK. FLATOW: Thank you very much, Jon Lindsay of U. C. San Diego. We'll be right back after this break. Stay with us.

So, you know, any of these by themselves don't work, but when you see how you put them all together, that's how you see how the fusion of all that intelligence can help to make the attribution case. So I think this just helps to highlight the kind of information that people in the forensics business have been tracking for a while. FLATOW: And in the report, what type of organizations are being targeted? LINDSAY: In the report, you know, they lay out a very wide range. I mean, it's everything from the energy industry to the chemical industry to information technology was one of the big ones. I mean, you name it. And what's very interesting is that there's a pretty good, you know, correlation between that and the strategic emerging industries that China is interested in developing. So again, this is, you know, the kinds of targets are the kinds of things that, you know, China would be interested in. FLATOW: Something like our infrastructure, like our electrical grid, things like that? LINDSAY: Sure, but again, you know, you have to ask what is the reason that they're looking at these things. I mean, is - are they interested in finding out information about how it works so maybe they can improve their own operations or, you know, economic espionage? Or is this, you know, the toehold for the great cyber-Pearl Harbor? And this is where it's - you know, I find that proposition a little bit harder to believe. FLATOW: Is it more than you think for stealing company secrets or strategies for negotiating with the companies that they deal with all the time? LINDSAY: Yes, I mean, there's a great deal of theft in all of these things, and you can definitely think of lots of things. There'd be research and development on products and processes that could be valuable, negotiating plans and strategies, mergers and acquisitions could be incredibly valuable, a lot of stuff. But then all this information then gets, you know, sucked into the Chinese intelligence apparatus. The first question is: Well, are they actually getting that information? You know, we know that there's an incredible amount of junk information on networks and on the Internet in general. So finding that needle in the haystack when you've got the haystacks growing really quickly is very, very difficult. Then they have to identify that that is useful information. Then they have to be able to get that to a customer that can use it. And there's a great deal of Chinese bureaucracy in the Chinese state between, you know, the PLA Third Department and the actual state-owned enterprises that might be able to use it. Then they would have to recognize it. So, you know, I guess my bottom line is you can steal text, but you can't steal the context that makes that text really, really valuable. So we see a tremendous amount of information being sucked out that would be potentially useful, but to actually call that a transfer of wealth requires that the Chinese are actually able to do something with it, and that's something that we really do not know anything about. And the Mandiant report did not give us any new information on that front. FLATOW: But China can't be the only country that's doing this. Don't we all do it? LINDSAY: I - that's a great point. You know, there was a - the U. S. government released a report a year and a half, two years ago that also named Russia as a major player in cyberespionage for economic purposes. But clearly the U. S. is very involved. You think of Stuxnet, Flame, Duqu, Gala, a lot of these kinds of things that were designed for, you know, more political- and military-type espionage. This is certainly a new modality of information collection, and, you know, all countries with advanced intelligence organizations and military are in on the game. FLATOW: Let me go to the phones, 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to Terry(ph) in Robbins, Tennessee. Hi Terry. TERRY: Hello, Ira. Thank you. FLATOW: Hey there, you're welcome. TERRY: My question is the - well, first of all, it's all of the above as far as the uses, but isn't all that outsourcing that we did of sending all of our computer manufacturing and everything to China really showing up to be real cheap now, that we're going to have to deal with all the repercussions? FLATOW: Are you saying that - and this is an interesting point. If we're buying all oru hardware from China, could there not be stuff, Trojan horses and things inside the hardware they're sending us? LINDSAY: Yeah, that's a really important concern. You know, we talk about the security of supply chains and the fact that, you know, China is the factory and the workshop of the world, especially on IT. You know, there could be a lot of back doors. And in fact this is a concern that prompted Australia to ban Huawei, which is the major telecommunications company, they build servers and routers, Internet infrastructure, they banned them from bidding on their high-speed backbone project. There also was a House report on Huawei, which recommended against dealing with either Huawei or ZTE for exactly these kinds of reasons. You know, but that kind of shows you that, you know, that concern can have a huge business impact for these corporations. So do they necessarily have an interest in getting involved? Plus, again, you know, I won't get into the technical details, but if you start thinking about, you know, if you put a bug in there, then actually being able to use it at a time and place of your choosing is going to be a really difficult proposition because supply chains are incredibly, incredibly complex. So being able to activate that logic bomb, if you will, and understanding where it is and understanding all of the other complex factors that go into its embeddedness in human and technical systems is a really, really hard thing. So, you know, it's a genuine concern, but again it's a technical possibility is probably a lot greater than its actual probability. FLATOW: Is there a high-tech fix to any of this snooping around? LINDSAY: To snooping around? No, I don't think there's a high-tech fix because, you know, if you -you know, the Mandiant report and, you know, plenty of other reports from MacAfee or Symantec which kind of walk you through similar information show you that the weaknesses are less technical and more in exploiting just human gullibility or, you know, people who let their guard down. Some of these phishing emails are incredibly sophisticated, right. I mean, if it comes from your boss, and it's talking about a project that you're working on, you're going to be very likely to open that file. Well, you've just installed a root kit onto your server, and now they can start moving laterally and, you know, compromising other pieces of the network. FLATOW: So that's how they can do it? You had something called \"spear phishing,\" which is even higher level than regular - P-H-I-S-H, phishing. LINDSAY: Yeah, so the term \"spear phishing\" means that, you know, they have identified you and your interests and your relationships. So for example, you know, you might get an email from one of your colleagues at NPR that says hey Ira, this is about the story that we're running next week. And you're like OK, that's interesting. You would open that up, bam, you get hit. So they made it very, very believable because they did the intelligence work on your background, which is now very easy to do because we have Twitter and Facebook, and people put all kinds of personal information that they can basically, you know, fake a contact. FLATOW: Yeah, that's why I don't open my NPR mail anymore. (LAUGHTER) FLATOW: So is there - what do you see of the future here? Where is this headed? LINDSAY: Well, I think that there's going to continue to be a lot of noise and friction in cyberspace. This isn't going to get fixed, but I think it's just going to be sort of the general level of background radiation that we will get used to. You know, when militaries go to war, there will be a cyber component, but people don't go to war because of cyberspace, you know, they just use it as one tool amongst many. So, you know, it's going to be a complex world, but I don't think it's necessarily going to be a more dangerous world. FLATOW: If you unplug for total security, can you have total security? Let's say you want to just unplug from the Internet and stay in-house. LINDSAY: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, you know, the only reason that people can hack your computer is because you're connected to the network. So if you don't connect to anything, you can't do anything. But then it's not very useful. And this gets to the fundamental tradeoff in a lot of the policy that we're considering. If we get really scared about the threat, and we start imposing, you know, technology standards and, you know, all kinds of things that would impact the productivity of our information networks, then you're going to see kind of the great gifts of the information economy start to be whittled away. So right now we just don't have a good sense of how fast the threat is increasing relative to the productivity benefits of computers. And everything that I've looked at says that, you know, for every dollar that we make because of computers in the workplace, you know, we're definitely not losing a dollar, in fact we're losing, you know, far less than that. FLATOW: All right, I've got to go, Jon. LINDSAY: OK. FLATOW: Thank you very much, Jon Lindsay of U. C. San Diego. We'll be right back after this break. Stay with us.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"HARLEM SHAKE\")GONYEA: The song is \"Harlem Shake\" and it's by a DJ who calls himself Baauer - that's with two As. And this week it shot to number one on the Billboard Hot 100, the most watched ranking in the music biz. But if you turn on the radio, you might not actually hear the song. Baauer's \"Harlem Shake\" has taken the top spot mostly because of views on YouTube. This week, Billboard - for the first time - started to incorporate those views into its Hot 100 formula. The guy behind those changes is Silvio Pietroluongo. He's the director of charts at Billboard magazine. Hi, Silvio. SILVIO PIETROLUONGO: Hi, Don. How are you? GONYEA: Good, good. So, why the changes? Why start using YouTube? PIETROLUONGO: Well, we always try to go where people are consuming music historically, and we've been doing this for decades now. And there's no denying the effect that YouTube is having on music and popular culture. GONYEA: When you say you've always adapted to modern times, I mean, if we go way, way, way back, I understand you used to count sheet music sales. PIETROLUONGO: Yeah. That was the first charts, and then it was jukebox, airplay sales, vinyl, cassette, CDs, and then we moved into ringtones and digital downloads. And we've had streaming in the Hot 100 for about five or six years, so this is just a continuance of increasing the pool of streamers that we have on the chart. GONYEA: Explain exactly what's happening with \"Harlem Shake. \" It wasn't even on the charts and now it's number one. How do you get that big of a leap? PIETROLUONGO: Well, even if we didn't have YouTube in the calculations this week, the song would have debuted probably somewhere in the top 15 because it's been among the top-selling downloads this past week. And it might actually be the number one selling download next week when we have our charts. So, you saw this kind of activity with PSY, where it broke on YouTube and then it led to sales, which led to airplay and then led to way more sales. GONYEA: Again, that's \"Gangnam Style,\" that one, right? PIETROLUONGO: That, exactly. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"GANGNAM STYLE\")GONYEA: So, talk about how important radio is given this change. It's been one of the dominant factors in determining chart position. Where is it now? PIETROLUONGO: Of the three streams that we use - of sales, airplay and streaming - sales still weighs heavier than radio; radio weighs heavier than streaming. But if you look at the top-selling downloads each week, if you look at the top streaming songs each week, 90 percent of the top it's the top radio hits. So, you know, radio still validates, I think, at the end of the day, what a major hit will be. GONYEA: All right. Silvio Pietroluongo is the director of charts at Billboard magazine.

As lawmakers debate access to guns, some people are trying to make their own using 3-D printers. And they're learning how from information they find on the Internet. Reporter Jon Kalish explains how 3-D printers complicate the conversation about guns. JON KALISH, BYLINE: The rifle used in the Newtown school shootings was a version of an AR-15. It's the civilian counterpart of the military's M16, and is one of the most popular firearms in America. This semiautomatic weapon can fire individual rounds as fast as you can squeeze the trigger. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)(GUNSHOTS)\")KALISH: This is from a video posted online by an amateur gunsmith in New Hampshire. (GUNSHOTS)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Beauty. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Yes, it appears to be functioning. (GUNSHOTS)KALISH: What you just heard is no ordinary AR-15. One of its key parts is plastic and was made on a 3-D printer. Picture an inkjet printer that sprays hot plastic onto a platform, instead of ink onto a page. The machine can make a variety of three-dimensional objects, everything from a lens cap to an iPhone case - and even a key part of a firearm, something called a lower receiver. MICHAEL GUSLICK: The lower receiver is really the core of the firearm. KALISH: Michael Guslick is a hobbyist gunsmith and a serious computer geek. GUSLICK: It is the chassis onto which all of the other major components are bolted onto. The lower receiver is by itself considered a firearm, under the terms of the 1968 Gun Control Act. KALISH: That's important - this one part is considered the gun. Making it on a 3-D printer isn't simple. You need to be something of a gunsmith and a computer geek, which is a rare combination of skills. But people with those skills have made plastic lower receivers for real guns that fire real bullets. Sometimes they fail, but it can be done with as little as $20 worth of raw plastic on a machine that costs $1,000. Again, Michael Guslick. GUSLICK: There are probably a good half-dozen people that I'm aware of, that have 3-D printed their own AR-15 lower receivers - and I'm sure many others who have done so quietly and haven't said anything about it. KALISH: Guslick shared his design for a plastic lower receiver on the Internet. One man who got the design is Cody Wilson, a 25-year-old law student in Texas. The first plastic receiver Wilson printed broke after six shots, but he and his team improved the design. Wilson is not afraid to say that his ultimate goal is to design a firearm that can be produced almost entirely on a 3-D printer. CODY WILSON: We're like a little design firm now, prototyping other people's designs, our own designs, and releasing the files as free software. KALISH: Anyone can download these 3-D gun designs. But after the Newtown school shooting, some file-sharing websites took down the design files for lower receivers. But once information is on the Internet, it's almost impossible to contain. Wilson's group started a new site to give away files for gun parts. He appeared recently on Glenn Beck's show, and described his blueprint for a plastic gun magazine capable of holding 30 bullets. (SOUNDBITE OF \"THE GLENN BECK PROGRAM\")WILSON: Now, it's been downloaded over 50,000 times. You know, the Internet has it. This is no longer ban-able, in some traditional sense. That's a real political act - giving you a magazine, telling you that that will never be taken away. That's radical equality. That's what I believe in. KALISH: Cody Wilson sees geeks like him as defenders of civil liberties, safeguarding Second Amendment rights with the Internet and a 3-D printer, which could complicate the debate over gun control. Felons and mentally unstable individuals could get around background checks, and gain easy access to firearms if they can make them at home. And there are other scenarios. REP. STEVE ISRAEL: We have a law on the books that currently says that you cannot put on an airplane a component for a firearm, or a firearm, that can't be detected by the metal detector. KALISH: That's Rep. Steve Israel of New York. He wants to renew that law. He worries that terrorists, for example, could use 3-D printers to make a weapon that they could sneak aboard a plane. ISRAEL: Before too long, we will have the technology through a - inexpensive, 3-D printer to construct a plastic firearm in its entirety. KALISH: A lot of design work and testing still needs to be done before an entire gun could be made at home on a  3-D printer. But that's exactly what Cody Wilson is trying to do. If he succeeds, he might end up subverting gun regulations. But he's a subversive who works within the law. Wilson recently applied to the Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms and Tobacco for a federal license to manufacture firearms.

One reason for the very slow pace of job gains is that many businesses learned to do more with less during the recession. And now they don't need to bring back as many people. These new efficiencies lead to what economists call labor displacement, and it's today's Bottom Line in business. To illustrate how labor displacement works, NPR's Yuki Noguchi followed a business doing the same amount of work with half the original staff. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Two things are noticeably absent from the offices of Mid-Atlantic Builders in Rockville, Maryland: people and paper. John Lavery is vice president of sales for the residential builder. In his office, he keeps a relic of the company's recent past: a binder heftier than a phone book that's filled with sketches and floor plan options of all the homes the company builds. JOHN LAVERY: Each home had sometimes up to 25 different versions of the fronts that they could choose from, and then literally hundreds of different layouts. NOGUCHI: There are literally millions of permutations and combinations possible for the company's customizable homes. And their paper-based systems have been confusing and fraught with potential for error, miscommunication and logistical snags. But a few years ago the company automated everything. Now customers click and drag to design their floor plans. Those changes update in a single digital file, which in turn synchs up with the design, procurement and billing systems. Lavery says they no longer wrestle with muddy blueprints or misplace orders for windows. And automation has made it possible for each worker to do more. LAVERY: Oh, I would say it doubles their efficiency. NOGUCHI: Before the recession, Mid-Atlantic Builders employed 75 people. That fell to a low of 22. The company resumed hiring again with the recent uptick in business and by next year plans to build almost as many homes as it did at its peak, but with half the staff it once employed. Besides the automation, executive vice president Stephen Paul says he's found other ways to cut time and waste. To illustrate, he takes me to meet the crew building a house nearby. Hi, I'm Yuki. JIM BARBES: I'm Jim. Nice to. . . NOGUCHI: Nice to meet you. Paul says in the past he might have had a team of employees on-site. Today he needs only one. STEPHEN PAUL: Back in the day, when we'd get more and more houses, we would just keep hiring people, we'd be throwing bodies at the problem. NOGUCHI: To build this large luxury home, Paul is testing a new strategy. He's contracting out the building of the frame, the walls, and windows to a bigger company that builds the home in pieces, then assembles it on-site. Jim Barbes is the area manager of that bigger firm, 84 Lumber. Barbes says more builders are turning to his company to essentially prefabricate their homes. BARBES: In a sense we've kind of become a virtual factory. We're able to, you know, take it from design all the way through to a total structure. NOGUCHI: Outsourcing shaves weeks off building time and makes the process less dependent on weather. It also reduces headaches. Instead of hiring five or six contractors, from roofers to drywall people and window installers, Mid-Atlantic Builders deals with just one. Paul says the changes have allowed him to go after a different kind of talent. Now he recruits people like Christian Cerria. CHRISTIAN CERRIA: I recent graduated from University of Maryland in architecture. NOGUCHI: Cerria is not only young - he did a stint with Apple and pushed Mid-Atlantic Builders to use iPads and iPhones to manage projects without shuttling blueprints back and forth. Technical know-how like this makes it easier to coordinate the complex dance between the arrival of supplies and workmen, which, again, cuts down on both mistakes and cost. (SOUNDBITE OF MACHINERY)NOGUCHI: Timing is everything, Cerria says. And as if on cue, the cabinets arrive for installation. CERRIA: I'll get you some plywood. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: You want it in that room? CERRIA: Yeah. NOGUCHI: When everything arrives at just the right moment, you don't have workers standing around waiting for something to do and you also don't have an unfinished house full of appliances inviting theft. Stephen Paul says there's little he misses about the old way of doing business. PAUL: It's a lot of work to retool a company. To see the computer system you saw, that took thousands of hours to do that, but once you get past the pain, it's a powerful tool. Very powerful. NOGUCHI: And now, he says, it's paying off. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News, Washington. LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST:  The threat of furloughs comes at a time when hiring in this country remains slow. One reason for the very slow pace of job gains is that many businesses learned to do more with less during the recession. And now they don't need to bring back as many people. These new efficiencies lead to what economists call labor displacement, and it's today's Bottom Line in business. To illustrate how labor displacement works, NPR's Yuki Noguchi followed a business doing the same amount of work with half the original staff. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Two things are noticeably absent from the offices of Mid-Atlantic Builders in Rockville, Maryland: people and paper. John Lavery is vice president of sales for the residential builder. In his office, he keeps a relic of the company's recent past: a binder heftier than a phone book that's filled with sketches and floor plan options of all the homes the company builds. JOHN LAVERY: Each home had sometimes up to 25 different versions of the fronts that they could choose from, and then literally hundreds of different layouts. NOGUCHI: There are literally millions of permutations and combinations possible for the company's customizable homes. And their paper-based systems have been confusing and fraught with potential for error, miscommunication and logistical snags. But a few years ago the company automated everything. Now customers click and drag to design their floor plans. Those changes update in a single digital file, which in turn synchs up with the design, procurement and billing systems. Lavery says they no longer wrestle with muddy blueprints or misplace orders for windows. And automation has made it possible for each worker to do more. LAVERY: Oh, I would say it doubles their efficiency. NOGUCHI: Before the recession, Mid-Atlantic Builders employed 75 people. That fell to a low of 22. The company resumed hiring again with the recent uptick in business and by next year plans to build almost as many homes as it did at its peak, but with half the staff it once employed. Besides the automation, executive vice president Stephen Paul says he's found other ways to cut time and waste. To illustrate, he takes me to meet the crew building a house nearby. Hi, I'm Yuki. JIM BARBES: I'm Jim. Nice to. . . NOGUCHI: Nice to meet you. Paul says in the past he might have had a team of employees on-site. Today he needs only one. STEPHEN PAUL: Back in the day, when we'd get more and more houses, we would just keep hiring people, we'd be throwing bodies at the problem. NOGUCHI: To build this large luxury home, Paul is testing a new strategy. He's contracting out the building of the frame, the walls, and windows to a bigger company that builds the home in pieces, then assembles it on-site. Jim Barbes is the area manager of that bigger firm, 84 Lumber. Barbes says more builders are turning to his company to essentially prefabricate their homes. BARBES: In a sense we've kind of become a virtual factory. We're able to, you know, take it from design all the way through to a total structure. NOGUCHI: Outsourcing shaves weeks off building time and makes the process less dependent on weather. It also reduces headaches. Instead of hiring five or six contractors, from roofers to drywall people and window installers, Mid-Atlantic Builders deals with just one. Paul says the changes have allowed him to go after a different kind of talent. Now he recruits people like Christian Cerria. CHRISTIAN CERRIA: I recent graduated from University of Maryland in architecture. NOGUCHI: Cerria is not only young - he did a stint with Apple and pushed Mid-Atlantic Builders to use iPads and iPhones to manage projects without shuttling blueprints back and forth. Technical know-how like this makes it easier to coordinate the complex dance between the arrival of supplies and workmen, which, again, cuts down on both mistakes and cost. (SOUNDBITE OF MACHINERY) NOGUCHI: Timing is everything, Cerria says. And as if on cue, the cabinets arrive for installation. CERRIA: I'll get you some plywood. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: You want it in that room? CERRIA: Yeah. NOGUCHI: When everything arrives at just the right moment, you don't have workers standing around waiting for something to do and you also don't have an unfinished house full of appliances inviting theft. Stephen Paul says there's little he misses about the old way of doing business. PAUL: It's a lot of work to retool a company.

This week, half a dozen Internet service providers - from Verizon to AT&T, along with entertainment industry trade groups - launched the Copyright Alert System. It's a program to help deter online piracy. When they see movies or TV shows getting swapped illegally, they will trace that back to the person who's doing it, using the IP address. And then - well, here to tell us what happens next is New York Law School professor James Grimmelmann. And James, what happens next? JAMES GRIMMELMANN: So it starts off very mildly. All they do is throw up a pop-up window to say, hey, we saw what you're doing there. You know, there's this thing, copyright law, you really should be aware of it. CORNISH: So you just get a nice wrap on the wrist, a warning. And what exactly is behavior that's considered bad behavior under this system? GRIMMELMANN: So they're looking for people who are downloading or uploading really complete copies of works. They're looking for somebody who's sharing a complete movie or something like that. CORNISH: And so there are actually six steps, right, in all. It's called the six strikes system. Walk us through some of those later warnings. What happens if you're a repeat offender? GRIMMELMANN: So after you get past the first two steps, they make it a little more serious by making sure they have your attention. So now they need you to acknowledge that you've actually seen the warnings. So you go to a kind of mini copyright jail where you have to actually click through to say I've seen this. It's kind of like when you're at the airport using the WiFi there, you have to click through the terms and conditions before you can get online. And part of this is building a record so that people can't say, I had no idea what was going on. CORNISH: So just how serious a penalty can the Internet service provider levy against people? I mean, can they yank their service altogether? GRIMMELMANN: So Time Warner has said that, yes, if he gets to the sixth step and you haven't shown any signs of changing your ways, yes, they will cut you off. The others are going to take milder steps. They might slow down your connection a bit to make it harder to download. They might block you from sites that are known to be sources of a lot of infringing files. It's a variety of approaches. CORNISH: So we should be clear that this is not run by the government in any way. I mean, this is a voluntary program between all these, the companies and the Internet service providers. But what's in it for the Internet service providers? Why would they take part in this? GRIMMELMANN: So some of them, like Comcast, are also in the entertainment business. They produce and sell entertainment content. So they're copyright owners, too, and it's in their interest. The others are probably doing it to avoid trouble. That is an area on which they don't want to be accused of shielding infringers, so they see this as a way to hold off the pressure that might try to hold them liable for infringements by finding a compromised middle ground. CORNISH: Now Internet privacy groups cannot be happy with this. Outline some of their concerns. GRIMMELMANN: So one of the concerns has to do with due process, that there's just this list of IP addresses and it comes with the presumption that person who was targeted actually was doing something illegal. But there's a concern about misidentification. There's a concern that some of these uses might be fair uses and legal. There is a concern that it might be just somebody else was using my wireless network and it wasn't me at all. CORNISH: When you look at the online video promoting this or kind of materials from the copyright alert system, it's very couched in terms of this is education. This is educating the public about copyright law. I mean, is this education or is this them cracking down? GRIMMELMANN: This is an alternative to the crackdown they tried that didn't work so well. And they are hoping that an educational campaign will help. I don't think education about copyright will do that much, but the sense of you are being watched might.

We're going to explore pros and cons of telecommuting in today's Business Bottom Line. NPR's Yuki Noguchi asked some experts about what's lost and what's gained when people work from home. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Jerry Davis noticed that his University of Michigan colleagues got most of their work done during free food Fridays at the office.

(LAUGHTER)NOGUCHI: Davis, a business professor, says what you miss in telecommuting is the oh, I'd been meaning to ask you, conversations that turn into something more. DAVIS: It's more efficient, but you lose that serendipity. NOGUCHI: Davis says he himself has had those moments. When he was donating blood, a political science professor lay on the gurney next to him, and that discussion eventually turned into some scholarly research. And, he suspects, it's that serendipity that Yahoo is trying to recreate by summoning workers back into the office. DAVIS: The random interactions that people have turn out to be quite consequential. NOGUCHI: Is it possible to measure what that happenstance interaction really generates in terms of innovation or productivity? DAVIS: Yes. (LAUGHTER)NOGUCHI: Funny you should ask.

He says tech companies were early adopters of telecommuting and are now finding the practice sometimes goes too far. But, he says, it's interesting that this edict is coming from an Internet company that offers email and instant messaging. JOHN CHALLENGER: There's so much irony here. Not only is this high-tech company that's been at the forefront of the technology that's changed how we work now asking workers to come back in, but also it's a 37-year-old mother who is seeing the advantages of being able to balance her work life and her personal life by telecommuting, and yet saying, for the good of the company, we can't do this, we have to change. NOGUCHI: Many people say Yahoo CEO Mayer is missing the point and missing an opportunity to set an example as one of the few prominent women in technology. One of them is Cindy Auten, general manager at Mobile Work Exchange, a group that helps government and business clients design telework programs. She says telecommuting requires putting trust in your employees. And if you can't do that, she says, you've got other problems. CINDY AUTEN: One of the things telework will expose is issues in your management. NOGUCHI: Auten says the fear is that telecommuters may just eat snacks and watch cat videos all day. But in fact, properly managed, telework often exposes unproductive workers. AUTEN: You know, a lot of cases, from a management standpoint, is if somebody wants to telework, it's forcing a conversation that you might need to have with that employee, or had needed to have a long time ago. NOGUCHI: Yahoo itself, said in a statement: This isn't a broad industry view on working from home. It added, this is about what is right for Yahoo, right now. In clamping down on remote work, Yahoo is going against the grain. The Family and Work Institute, a research nonprofit, says the number of employers who allow telecommuting has more than doubled since 2005. Ellen Galinsky is president of that group. ELLEN GALINSKY: We can't just assume that we're in an industrial command and control work environment anymore. NOGUCHI: Galinsky says companies that don't recognize this, do so at their peril.

BAXTER: Forget the old days when you'd print your application materials on nice, thick resume paper and mail them in. These days, you usually apply online. At the start of the process, you create an account. And then you might be asked questions like can you lift 50 pounds? Or are you a convicted felon?

It's no longer just a famous music festival. Techies will be there too for South by Southwest Interactive. It's a big showcase for tech trends and start-ups. NPR's Laura Sydell will be there and she joins us for a quick preview. And, Laura, to start, what are some of the big trends that you expect to get a lot of attention in Austin? LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE: Well, we've seen a lot of coverage of 3D printing and you will see a lot of new startups doing 3D printing and taking it to new places. For example, you'll see 3D printing for people with disabilities. Or, in fashion, say, print your own bikini. We're also probably going to see a lot of startups in solar power and space exploration. One of the keynotes is Elon Musk who's the founder of Tesla Motors and SpaceX, a space exploration company. CORNISH: And is there anything you're really excited to see? SYDELL: Yes, there is a motion controller that will let you just move your hands without touching your computer and control your computer. You could browse the Web.

If you prefer positive reinforcement, this is not where you want to look. CORNISH: That's right. Think negative. Think evil. (LAUGHTER)CORNISH: That's the Alarm Clock app, Wake N Shake. The name explains it. You have to shake your phone to shut off the alarm. And the amount of shaking needed is adjustable, so you can make it easy or hard on those arms. KLOSOWSKI: Yeah, you can really force yourself into getting out of bed at that point. If you set it up as maniacal as it can go, it's not fun. (LAUGHTER)CORNISH: Well, if shaking is not your thing, how about an alarm app that publicly shames you into getting out of bed? KLOSOWSKI: There's one called BetterMe, that when you hit snooze on it, it automatically posts to your Facebook that you did not get up in time. If you don't want your friends knowing that you get up late every single day, that would be the way to go. CORNISH: I predict a lot of unfriending with that one. Now, waking up on time might be hard, but exercising even harder for lots of us. So apps like GymPact motivate by working out your wallet. KLOSOWSKI: Everyone that goes to the gym gets money from everyone that doesn't. CORNISH: Once you sign up, you commit to a set number of workout days per week and how much it'll cost you if you miss one. Your smartphone's GPS even verifies when you're actually at the gym. But if you skip a day so you can, say, eat potato chips, your cash goes to the people who stuck to their pact. KLOSOWSKI: You have to really value money for this to be a motivator for you.

That movie took us back to a dangerous period of political unrest and, of course, the country remains in the headlines because of concerns about a rising nuclear threat. But while all of that is true, it's not the whole truth. The country has given roots to such diverse cultural figures as the beloved 13th century poet Rumi, the up-to-the-minute comedian Teron von Gostrie(ph), and authors like Firoozeh Dumas and the founder of eBay, Pierre Omidyar, have Iranian roots. Now here at TELL ME MORE - a name you hear every week in our list of credits - our own senior producer, Iran Davar Ardalan has, decided to tell these stories in a new digital book. It's titled \"The Persian Square. \" It explores many of the major figures in Iran's history with interactive video, art, and, of course, audio. And Davar is with us in the studio now. Thank you so much for walking down the hall to talk with us. (LAUGHTER)DAVAR ARDALAN, BYLINE: Thank you so much, Michel. MARTIN: This isn't your first book. You write a straightforward memoir in 2007. So why this topic and why this format? ARDALAN: Well, I thought it was important to create a digital space. You know, many who came here in 1979 were living in exile and they weren't sure how long they would stay here. And it seemed 30 years on after the revolution that there was an opportunity to see who this community has become, who are Iranian-Americans. And the digital space let itself to that really well. I've loved being able to put together like a little carpet. A little, you know, multi-touch tapestry of a little bit of this person's voice, that person's voice, and putting together a bigger picture of who Iranian-Americans are in this country. MARTIN: I want to talk a little bit more about the audio but I do want to talk about the stories. I'll just play the short clip and you can tell us who this is. Here it is. (SOUNDBITE OF DIGITAL BOOK, \"THE PERSIAN SQUARE\")HELEN JEFFREYS BAKHTIAR: I went to Iran many years ago as the wife of an Iranian physician. And I have lived off and on in Iran since 1931, so that I have become very much attached to the country. MARTIN: And that's a name, that's a voice that you know very well. Who is that? ARDALAN: That's my grandmother, Helen Jeffreys Bakhtiar. And she met my grandfather when she was 22 years old in Harlem, New York. She was a nurse. He was a doctor at Harlem Hospital. And he would take her to Coney Island and read her Persian poetry and kind of mesmerized her and she fell in love with Persian culture. The two of them went back to Iran together in 1931, opened one of the first private hospitals. And she is an example of an early Iranian-American. MARTIN: I'm interested in your decision about how to talk about your own family and how much to talk about your own family because we live in a time when many people are encouraged to be and are very out loud and proud about their ethnic roots. But it's also true that this is a part of the world that many people have ambivalence about, that, you know, we know for a fact that say, during the revolution it was not an easy time to be an Iranian-American if you had a name that was Persian. And I just wondered was there hesitation on your part? Did you ever think maybe this isn't such a great thing to highlight your connection to this part of the world and to the story? ARDALAN: Well, I was 16 years old when I was in Boston during the hostage-taking crisis, and my name was Iran. And I felt completely ashamed and out of place. And honestly, just a year ago I thought about whether there's another 16-year-old girl today in Los Angeles, in Ohio, in Wisconsin, who is Iranian-American and who is ashamed of who she is. So this was an opportunity to be able to explore the rich cultural traditions that the two countries have had between one another and not so much try to hide behind it because I'm almost 50 years old and it's like this might as well be my midlife crisis, you know, come to terms with the fact that I'm Iranian-American and be proud of it. MARTIN: To that end, one of the interesting features of the book that I like - this is actually something that we at NPR avail ourselves of a lot. You have audio clips were people whom you've interviewed pronounce their names both in English and in the Persian way. ARDALAN: Sure. MARTIN: Do you mind giving us your name in the Persian way? ARDALAN: Absolutely. So in Farsi my name is pronounced Iran Davar Ardalan. And so in English it's pronounced Iran Davar Ardalan. Like all different ethnic groups, we do grapple with how to present ourselves and our names, but I think that we also have to be understanding of the fact that not everybody can pronounce it the way of our birthplace. MARTIN: Well, thank you for noticing that your English is so superior to my Farsi so I will not attempt to pronounce it in Farsi. (LAUGHTER)MARTIN: But the other advantage of the multimedia aspect of it is that you can hear music. ARDALAN: Sure. MARTIN: You can hear music. You can hear poetry. I specifically want to play one song by a woman named Dr. Pardis Sabeti. And I'll play - how was that? Did I do pretty with the pronunciation? ARDALAN: That was pretty good. Yeah. Nice. MARTIN: OK. OK. And let me just play a short clip and you can tell us a little bit about her. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"NEDA\")DR. PARDIS SABETI: (Singing) All at once there her voice was gone as her daughter so passes on. MARTIN: Tell us a little bit about this. ARDALAN: Sure. This is a song called \"Neda\" and Dr. Pardis Sabeti wrote it in honor of Neda, the young woman who was killed in 2009 in the aftermath of the presidential elections. And she is a computational biologist. She studies evolutionary diseases at Harvard. But on the side she's the lead singer of Thousand Days. And so I think that's part of what's exciting about this interactive format, is that you can be on the entry on her page reading about what she's doing at Harvard, but at the same time you can tap on this song and swipe and pinch through the galleries and see her actually on stage performing. MARTIN: Before we let you go, the title of the book is \"The Persian Square. \" Where does that title come from? ARDALAN: In February of 2010, the Los Angeles City Council designated the corner between Wilshire Boulevard and Wilkins Avenue in Los Angeles, the Persian Square. And it was basically to honor the contribution of Persian businesses to Los Angeles, to the city of Los Angeles. The first business started on the corner of Wilshire and Wilkins in 1974. And so I've actually been asked by one of the city council members press officers whether I would go and have an event at the Persian Square with my iPad, so I'm waiting to see if that'll come together. (LAUGHTER)MARTIN: That was NPR senior producer Iran Davar Ardalan. She is talking about her new digital book, \"The Persian Square. \" You can get it from the iBook store starting today. And if you want a sneak peek, just head to our website@npr. org. Davar, thank you for joining us. ARDALAN: Thank you so much. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG \"NEDA\")SABETI: (Singing) It matters this day. Neda.

I'm Audie Cornish. This next segment is about a fundamental of flight: The airplane battery. The battery is the latest problem for Boeing's Dreamliner. All of those jets have been grounded since January, after reports of battery smoking or even catching fire. Boeing says it hopes to have a permanent fix by the end of the month. Now, this is not the first time the aviation industry has struggled with batteries and we'll have more on that in a few minutes. But first, Michigan Radio's Lindsey Smith tells us more about this current complication for the makers of lithium ion batteries. LINDSEY SMITH, BYLINE: Check out the battery in your cell phone. Chances are it's lithium ion. So is the battery in your laptop or tablet, cordless power tools. But there are several kinds of lithium ion batteries. The ones in the Dreamliner aren't the same as the one in your cell phone. SAM JAFFE: We're in the middle of a horse race. And right now, lithium ion is far in the lead of that horse race. SMITH: That's Sam Jaffe. He's an energy storage analyst with Pike Research. He says lithium ion batteries are beating traditional batteries because they can store a lot more energy in a much smaller space. They charge up fast and they're more durable over time but trying to store energy safely is always a challenge. And that's been a problem with the batteries in the Dreamliner. JAFFE: When you have incidents where it's not done correctly it makes everybody in that industry look bad. And that is going to be an issue going forward. SMITH: Jaffe says the high cost of lithium ion batteries is another critical issue facing the industry, especially when it comes to electric vehicles, which he says is the next big potential market for lithium ion batteries. Governments in China, South Korea, Japan, and the United State have all subsidized lithium ion battery plants. Their hope is that it will help producers make cheaper batteries and boost demand for electric cars. In 2009, the federal stimulus package dumped $2 billion in battery plants but the results have been mixed. One company, A123 Systems, went bankrupt. It's still making batteries but now it's owned by a Chinese company. LG Chem, a South Korean company, got millions to build a battery plant in Holland, Michigan, but so far it's sitting idle and hasn't made any batteries. JAFFE: The very act of incentivizing these factories is one of the reasons why they're not running it at full or, in some cases, any capacity. SMITH: Jaffe says the problem is sort of a classic catch-22 situation. Batteries can't be made super cheap because the demand isn't high and the demand isn't high because the cars aren't very affordable. But he sees that balance shifting over the next few years. And not all investment in battery plants have been failures. SHELLY MACIEJEWSKI: So, I'm Shelly Maciejewski. I'm the plant manager here at Meadowbrook and I have the pleasure of leading this team as we embark on this new market. SMITH: Johnson Controls' Meadowbrook plant got the biggest chunk of the stimulus money that went to battery makers. Johnson Controls sells these new batteries to several different customers in different industries. It's a huge global company with lots of capital. And it already has lot of experience making other kinds batteries. It makes more lead acid batteries than any company in the world. Those are the batteries used to start regular cars and trucks. And so, maybe it's no surprise this lithium ion battery plant is doing well. MACIEJEWSKI: We've already put our second shift in place and we're already looking to hire our third shift. So we're currently going into production and we're doing our system build for a major European manufacturer. SMITH: And the U. S. government's investment in battery technology hasn't stopped since the stimulus package. Johnson Controls is a partner in a new federally-funded project that could completely transform the battery market and the science behind it. The research team wants to build a new battery, in five years, that holds five times the energy as lithium-based batteries, but can be produced at one fifth the cost. Jeff Chamberlain is deputy director of the Joint Center for Energy Storage Research in Chicago. JEFF CHAMBERLAIN: That's what needs to be achieved in order to have the impact on society. Or to put it another way, to pay back the investor - the investor is the taxpayer. We believe what we're going to do may even have impact on lithium ion in the short run. SMITH: Chamberlain concedes it's an ambitious goal. But for taxpayers, the pay-off for this research could be much better than their investment to subsidize battery plants, especially ones that are still sitting idle and not making any batteries at all.

Chances are it's lithium ion. So is the battery in your laptop or tablet, cordless power tools. But there are several kinds of lithium ion batteries. The ones in the Dreamliner aren't the same as the one in your cell phone. SAM JAFFE: We're in the middle of a horse race. And right now, lithium ion is far in the lead of that horse race. SMITH: That's Sam Jaffe. He's an energy storage analyst with Pike Research. He says lithium ion batteries are beating traditional batteries because they can store a lot more energy in a much smaller space. They charge up fast and they're more durable over time but trying to store energy safely is always a challenge. And that's been a problem with the batteries in the Dreamliner. JAFFE: When you have incidents where it's not done correctly it makes everybody in that industry look bad. And that is going to be an issue going forward. SMITH: Jaffe says the high cost of lithium ion batteries is another critical issue facing the industry, especially when it comes to electric vehicles, which he says is the next big potential market for lithium ion batteries. Governments in China, South Korea, Japan, and the United State have all subsidized lithium ion battery plants. Their hope is that it will help producers make cheaper batteries and boost demand for electric cars. In 2009, the federal stimulus package dumped $2 billion in battery plants but the results have been mixed. One company, A123 Systems, went bankrupt. It's still making batteries but now it's owned by a Chinese company. LG Chem, a South Korean company, got millions to build a battery plant in Holland, Michigan, but so far it's sitting idle and hasn't made any batteries. JAFFE: The very act of incentivizing these factories is one of the reasons why they're not running it at full or, in some cases, any capacity. SMITH: Jaffe says the problem is sort of a classic catch-22 situation. Batteries can't be made super cheap because the demand isn't high and the demand isn't high because the cars aren't very affordable. But he sees that balance shifting over the next few years. And not all investment in battery plants have been failures. SHELLY MACIEJEWSKI: So, I'm Shelly Maciejewski. I'm the plant manager here at Meadowbrook and I have the pleasure of leading this team as we embark on this new market. SMITH: Johnson Controls' Meadowbrook plant got the biggest chunk of the stimulus money that went to battery makers. Johnson Controls sells these new batteries to several different customers in different industries. It's a huge global company with lots of capital. And it already has lot of experience making other kinds batteries. It makes more lead acid batteries than any company in the world. Those are the batteries used to start regular cars and trucks. And so, maybe it's no surprise this lithium ion battery plant is doing well. MACIEJEWSKI: We've already put our second shift in place and we're already looking to hire our third shift. So we're currently going into production and we're doing our system build for a major European manufacturer. SMITH: And the U. S. government's investment in battery technology hasn't stopped since the stimulus package. Johnson Controls is a partner in a new federally-funded project that could completely transform the battery market and the science behind it. The research team wants to build a new battery, in five years, that holds five times the energy as lithium-based batteries, but can be produced at one fifth the cost. Jeff Chamberlain is deputy director of the Joint Center for Energy Storage Research in Chicago. JEFF CHAMBERLAIN: That's what needs to be achieved in order to have the impact on society. Or to put it another way, to pay back the investor - the investor is the taxpayer. We believe what we're going to do may even have impact on lithium ion in the short run. SMITH: Chamberlain concedes it's an ambitious goal. But for taxpayers, the pay-off for this research could be much better than their investment to subsidize battery plants, especially ones that are still sitting idle and not making any batteries at all.

By some estimates, the people on this planet spend 3 billion hours a week playing video games. That's billion - with a B. Some scientists are hoping to make use of all that human capital. NPR's Joe Palca reports on what they're doing, in his series \"Joe's Big Idea. \"JOE PALCA, BYLINE: People can get pretty addicted to computer games, so why not do it for a good cause? (SOUNDBITE OF GAMING SOUNDS)PALCA: Right now, I'm at the novice level of a game called EyeWire. Each one of those annoying bloops you can hear in the background is me trying to color in a nerve cell, in a cartoon drawing of a slice of tissue. (SOUNDBITE OF GAMING SOUNDS)PALCA: EyeWire is designed to solve a real science problem. It aims to chart the billions of nerve connections in the brain. SEBASTIAN SEUNG: There's no way the professional scientists alone can analyze all of that. We need people to help us. PALCA: Sebastian Seung is a neuroscientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He thinks understanding all those connections is key to understanding how the brain works. SEUNG: And I like to use the metaphor of the brain as a huge jungle of these entangled branches of neurons, and we need an army of people to go out and explore that jungle. What could be more exciting than exploring the brain? Much more exciting than any artificial video game. PALCA: At least, Seung is hoping that's what people will think. But before he tackles the human brain, Seung wants to explore a simpler collection of nerves, the ones in the back of the eyes of mice. So he and his colleagues created EyeWire - E-Y-E wire - that looks at the neural connections in the eye. So far, about 35,000 people have registered with EyeWire. org to play. SEUNG: Anyone sitting in their living room can just fire up a web browser and look at images of neurons, and help us figure out how they're connected. PALCA: The game sounds deceptively simple. Players get a virtual cube of material filled with neurons, to analyze. SEUNG: It looks like a three-dimensional coloring book. Your job is just to stay between the lines, which are the boundaries of a neuron, and follow the branch of a neuron through that cube. PALCA: But I can tell you, it's not as easy as it sounds. You get to practice, at the start of the game, on cubes where the neuronal branches have already been worked out. It's only after you master those that you get fresh material. SEUNG: It actually takes many hours of training to be able to color reliably, between those lines. You have to learn something about neuroanatomy - what the structure of a neuron looks like at the micro scale - in order to do this reliably. PALCA: Now, you may be thinking what I was thinking when I heard Seung describe his game - wouldn't a computer using artificial intelligence do a better job of coloring between the lines? Well, it turns out the answer is no. Human vision is better than machine vision, for this kind of task. SEUNG: One thing that humans are doing as they play this game - they're also teaching the artificial intelligence to become smarter. PALCA: I guess we humans are still good for something. Now, EyeWire is all about how well we see. There's another game, called Foldit, that takes advantage of something humans are also remarkably good at, thinking in 3-D. The game was created at the Center for Game Science, at the University of Washington. Really, there's a whole center - with a faculty and grad students. Zoran Popovic, who runs the place, says Foldit was designed to help solve a major problem in biology, how proteins fold. That's an important issue. Misfolded proteins can lead to all kinds of diseases, from cystic fibrosis to mad cow disease. Foldit has been a big success. Popovic says there are half a million people registered to play the game, and that's made other scientists and inventors take the idea of using games for science seriously. ZORAN POPOVIC: I get a new proposal from people every week or something, about the different potential scientific thing that we could - doing. There's also even more applications in engineering. So for example, one thing that people have a lot of trouble with, is designing really compact silicon chips. PALCA: Although they're small, these chips have complicated 3-D structures, and Popovic says designing them is a bit of a dark art. Gamers might come up with better approaches. One additional benefit to these games is, they're open to everyone. You don't have to have an advanced degree to play. Adrien Treuille was involved in the origins of Foldit, and is now at the Carnegie Mellon University. He says there may be people out there who had no idea they were any good at mapping neurons or designing silicon chips. And Treuille says superstar gamers might have even more to contribute to science. ADRIEN TREUILLE: And these games have given us - really, for the first time in history - a way of identifying these people completely outside of the ordinary academic food chain; which is actually, you know, very elitist and very difficult to get into. PALCA: Computer games may be a more populist way of drawing people into science and invention. Joe Palca, NPR News.

RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: That popular buzz phrase means analyzing the masses of information that are now available about your every purchase, your every online search, your every preference. INSKEEP: And quite a bit more, along with information about millions of other people. The company that finds a pattern in that data may also find a profit. And in today's business bottom line, we talk through the implications with Kenneth Cukier. He's one of the authors of a new book called \"Big Data: A Revolution That Will Transform How We Live, Work and Think. \" You write about, I believe it is, the store chain Target and pregnant women. KENNETH CUKIER: Well, the example comes from Charles Duhigg, who's a reporter at The New York Times. He's the one who uncovered the story. And what Target was doing was they were trying to find out what customers were likely to be pregnant or not. So what they were able to do was to look at all the different things that couples were buying, such as vitamins at one point, unscented lotion at another point, lots of hand towels at another point. And with that make a prediction, score the likelihood that this person was pregnant, so that they could then send coupons to the people involved. So that you could say there might be a coupon for a stroller or for diapers. INSKEEP: Wait a minute. You're saying that if someone's credit card shows that she bought unscented lotions on a particular date, it suggests that she might be a certain number of weeks pregnant? CUKIER: You know, it's not going to be just one factor. It's probably going to be many factors and it's also probably going to be over time. So what we may find that at the outset of a pregnancy, a woman who discovers she's pregnant is going to start taking certain vitamins. Later on in the pregnancy, she's going to want to buy certain things like new lotions. Her body's getting bigger and so she wants to make sure her skin is smoother and doesn't crack as the tummy expands. Those sorts of thing we can now identify are predictors of pregnancy. INSKEEP: And you even give an example of the book where Target seemed to know things that even the family did not know. CUKIER: Well, that's exactly right. There was an example of a father coming in to a store and complaining that the teenage daughter was receiving fliers in the mail for coupons for baby products. And he said, what are you trying to do? Trying to get my teenage daughter pregnant? And of course the way it ends is that he comes back later and apologizes and says it turns out there were things in my house that I wasn't aware of. Now, the story may be - it may not be real. But the fact is, this is the sort of universe that we are now going to be in - we're all going to be in - because of big data. And all stores will be doing this, and all governments will be doing this. Your doctor will do this. Your employer will do this. This is the new norm. INSKEEP: Now, I want to get at something that you underline in the book, which is that a lot of people who are mining data do not care why one fact means that another fact is likely to be true. They just care that it is. You give the example of a study that attempts to determine which used cars are more likely to run well. CUKIER: Yes. So they crunched the numbers, and they found out that cars that were orange tended to not have breakdowns compared to other colors of cars. INSKEEP: You're just talking about the paint, right? It's an orange car. CUKIER: That's exactly right. So why might this be? Well, we can sort of concoct different scenarios. One is that orange tends to be a custom color, and if you order an orange car, perhaps the rest of the car was made in a custom way, a little bit more care was taken into it. We don't know why, and it's frankly, it's not that important. It might just bring us down a rabbit hole for us to try to find out why. But again, if you just want to buy a car that's not going to break down, go with the correlation. INSKEEP: When I read this book, what I read is companies finding masses of information that was previously thought to be useless and finding new uses for it. CUKIER: That's right. Take search queries, for example. Google stores all of its searches. What they were able to do was go through the database of previous searches to identify what was the likely predictor that there was going to be a flu outbreak in certain regions in America. Now, keep in mind, we pay for the Center of Disease Control to look at the United States and find out where flu outbreaks are taking place for the seasonal flu. But the difference is that it takes the CDC about two weeks to report the data. Google does it in real time simply on search queries. INSKEEP: We've reported on this in the program in the past. You're saying that certain search queries are a predictor. They correlate with the spread of the flu. And it might be something obvious like people doing searches for flu remedies or flu vaccines. But whatever it is, there are search terms that can help you predict that the flu is about to spread in a certain area. CUKIER: That's exactly right. INSKEEP: When does all this go too far? CUKIER: It goes too far when we start making predictions for things that we have not yet done but we have the propensity to do. So, for example, commit a crime. If big data correlations identify me as a 44-year-old male who's a journalist and has grand eyes for things I can't afford, it may think that I'm going to be susceptible to embezzlement, and maybe I'll get a knock on the door by the police saying we have reason to believe that you're about to commit a crime. This is sort of like pre-crime in \"Minority Report. \"INSKEEP: Yeah, the movie - the Tom Cruise movie from some years ago, right. CUKIER: You know, will that be the case, will we go down that route? Frankly, we already are. There's a whole branch of criminology called algorithmic criminology, and a dimension called predictive policing. Police forces in many cities in America are crunching the numbers and looking at where the likelihood of a crime is going to be, and when, based on the past patterns of crime. And now we can say not just that a crime is going to exist in an area, but that these people have a, say, 80 percent likelihood to be a felon. We have judicial systems that presume you've acted and therefore we're going to penalize. We've never had a system whereby we're making predictions about your likelihood, your propensity to do something, before you've actually acted and therefore we're going to take remedial steps against you. INSKEEP: Did the knowledge that you gained over the course of writing this book change the way that you lead your life? CUKIER: Yeah, absolutely. I think about what it means to educate my children. I have a five-year-old and a two-year-old, and I talk to them about - in strategic language and thinking - in terms of how to understand the world and interact in the world with imperfect information. This is going to sound very strange, but I ask my child questions with which I know she doesn't have enough answers - enough information to answer. And I absolutely reward her when she takes an educated guess, when she makes a decision based on imperfect information. And I find, even though in the five-year-old language, a way of explaining to her that that's great. You're living in a world in which you're never going to have enough information, but you're going to have to come to answers and conclusions and make decisions based on it. So it's really important that you take in as much information and come up, using your judgment and wisdom - I don't use those words - but come up with a decision based on that. INSKEEP: And that's what big data is, as you define it. It's not knowing everything. It's even though you have an enormous amount of information, you're figuring out just enough to act, even if you don't fully understand the conclusions that you're drawing. CUKIER: That's exactly right. INSKEEP: So does your five-year-old look at you like you're kind of weird when you do this? CUKIER: No. She says that she's writing a book. It's called \"Big Data for Ponies. \"INSKEEP: Well, I never could have predicted that the interview would end this way but it has.

It's intended to serve millions of schoolchildren and their teachers across the country. News Corp. chairman Rupert Murdoch is counting on new revenues from his educational division, to help shore up the finances of his newspapers. NPR's David Folkenflik brings us this report for today's \"Business Bottom Line. \"DAVID FOLKENFLIK, BYLINE: In Amplify's telling, taking attendance will take just a few quick seconds in the school of the future; teachers will more effectively coax out shy students; and kids will be able to go at their own pace to complete coursework - all thanks to a specially designed digital tablet from Amplify. I recently got a sneak peak from Amplify's Stephen Smyth. STEPHEN SMYTH: What you see here is - two things. So a series of apps - a teacher dashboard, we call it, and on the right-hand side, you see, essentially, a feed of what's happening in the class. And we call this a playlist. FOLKENFLIK: Why not just rely on an iPad or another digital tablet? Smyth argues that Amplify offers the only tablet designed to allow students to interact with teachers instantaneously. SMYTH: These devices are connected. If you go to Best Buy or a retailer, and buy a tablet off the shelf, it can't do this. These devices are talking to each other. And really, what we're trying to solve here is actually, how to have teachers use tablets in the classroom environment. FOLKENFLIK: News Corp. Chairman and CEO Rupert Murdoch has described education as a market worth hundreds of billions of dollars. In May 2011, at an event in Paris, he argued that schools have failed to take advantage of leaps in technology. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)FOLKENFLIK: The person Murdoch hired to lead his charge is familiar in education circles - Joel Klein, a Democrat and a former assistant attorney general under President Clinton, who became chancellor of the New York City school system for more than eight years. JOEL KLEIN: Critics and others have said, you know, well, technology's been around a long time, but it hasn't changed the learning experience. It's not about hardware. It's not about devices. It's really about learning. And if this does what I believe it'll do - which is, enhance the teaching and learning processes - then it's going to be a home run. FOLKENFLIK: Klein joined News Corp. in 2010, in order to invigorate Murdoch's efforts in education. The company paid $360 million for an educational tech venture started by several of Klein's former employees. [POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: The founders are not former employees but did contract work for the New York City Department of Education when Klein was chancellor. ] And they used it as the basis of what they rechristened Amplify. But before they could get very far, Murdoch's newspapers in London became embroiled in the criminal, phone-hacking scandal. New York state revoked a $27 million contract for an education database with Amplify, citing concerns about the integrity of the parent company, News Corp. And Klein was pulled away for awhile, to help Murdoch clean up the legal mess. KLEIN: The good news was that while we had a problem in the U. K. , that problem wasn't a global problem. FOLKENFLIK: Klein, now back at Amplify, knows there is some suspicion of his boss' politics, too. In this country, Murdoch is closely identified with Fox News. And he's also a player in the educational reform movement, pushing for greater reliance on charter schools, giving money to selected candidates and criticizing teachers' unions. Klein says Amplify is a separate creature. KLEIN: Rupert realized this from the beginning - this is a division that's going to be focused on education. We don't have a political mission, none whatsoever. FOLKENFLIK: Yet teachers unions and other critics say Amplify's efforts are part of a disturbing trend - dangling the illusion of big savings to politicians by claiming teachers using the tablets will be able to handle more students per class and thus, reduce how many teachers school districts will need to employ.

LEONIE HAIMSON: . . . believe that public school kids should have larger classes, and instead of getting personalized instruction via their teachers, should do it via a computer. FOLKENFLIK: Haimson says the tablet may well be fine on its own, but argues that Amplify's goal is less about helping school children than turning a profit. HAIMSON: And it's all part of the same vision they have for transforming education by privatizing it. And we have seen - not just in New York City, but nationwide - an avid pillaging going on, of public resources for private ends. FOLKENFLIK: Klein says that's offensive to companies that do good work, and he says that misrepresents Amplify's goal. KLEIN: People say this is - you know, designed to eliminate teachers or designed - that's - you know, my view is, I want the teachers to embrace, be excited and get behind this, so that their work is more effective and better.

I'm Audie Cornish, and it's time for All Tech Considered. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CORNISH: The big thinkers and big players in the tech industry are in Austin, Texas, right now for South by Southwest. It started as a music festival that grew into being a film festival and a tech conference. Back in 2007, South by Southwest Interactive was that place that Twitter first took off. NPR's Laura Sydell is there, along with the techies and investors, to find out about up-and-coming ideas and trends. LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE: If you want to go to the biggest tech conference, that might be the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. It's bright lights and 150,000 people, and most of them are trying to sell you gadgets. But for South by Southwest Interactive, sharing new ideas was the goal when it was founded 20 years ago. South by Southwest is a lot smaller and, like Austin, it's a little friendlier. When you ask people why they're here, some sound a little idealistic. JAMAL ORR: Mainly, it's inspiration. Some of these things just get you charged up to go back and get you thinking about new things, as I'm doing software development and so on. JASON CARPENTER: You get like a fresh burst of energy just about like something that may have not been on your radar. Like, wow, this technology is interesting. I'm going to figure out how I can apply it to what it is I do personally. SYDELL: That was Jamal Orr, a digital marketer, and Jason Carpenter, a software engineer. While this conference tends to be more focused on software and social media, this year there was a lot more chatter about hardware. The opening keynote speaker was Bre Pettis, the founder and CEO of MakerBot. BRE PETTIS: MakerBot is all about empowering people to make stuff. SYDELL: Make stuff using 3-D printers that individuals can afford. Three-D printing allows people to design an object on a computer. The printer melts metals and plastics and reshapes them into the form you designed. In his talk, Pettis offered up inspiration when he told the audience that he launched his company at South by Southwest in 2009. He'd just finished making his first low-cost 3-D printer the night before the conference began. PETTIS: And at about 8 A. M. , our prototype worked, and I jumped on a flight at 10 A. M. to come to South by Southwest. And I basically went to bars and put the MakerBot on the bar and started printing shot glasses, which turned out to be pretty popular. SYDELL: Also on display was the Leap Motion Sensor, which lets you control your computer with hand gestures. There are start-ups here focused on taking tourists into space and software to keep track of your cholesterol. There are also big names in tech like Google, Twitter and Yahoo with big banners and loud parties. And a few big names here like Ashton Kutcher and Al Gore.

SCOTT STULEN: Now, I'm not to the point where I'm going to call all cat videos high art. But I'm also not going to call them meaningless either.

No, not Congress. We're talking about the comments section. Web-savvy news junkies have known for a long time that reader feedback can often turn nasty. Now, a new study finds that just reading that uncivil discourse can change the way we interpret the news. The study comes from this month's Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication by five researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and George Mason University. So if you write for the web, do you keep your commenters in mind as you write? 800-989-8255. Email us: talk@npr. org. You can also join the conversation at our website. That's at npr. org, click on TALK OF THE NATION. Dominique Brossard is a professor in the department of life sciences communication at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, co-author of the first study looking at the so-called nasty effect. She joins us from WPR in Madison. Nice to have you with us today. DOMINIQUE BROSSARD: Thanks for having me. CONAN: And did it come as a surprise to find that opinion on an article changed if someone wrote \"that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard of\" at the end of it? BROSSARD: Well, there's been some concern about uncivility and, you know, the fact that people tend to be rude on the online environment for quite a long time. But as far as the effect of the comments themselves being rude in changing the perception of the issue covering the study, yes, we investigated this from an open-minded perspective and we were surprised to see that what we use as rude comments, which as one of the news reporters that covered our study said - as reported to the online environment was quite tame, you know, like name calling such as idiot or things like that, were enough to actually change, you know, the perception of the story. So what we use as uncivil comments, were actually quite tame. So if those have an effect, then the question is what happen when people are much more outrageous in their way of behaving online. CONAN: So you tested for this by writing a spurious article and then people read it without comments and people read it with nasty comments. BROSSARD: No, not exactly, actually. What we did is that we wrote a balanced news story about something complicated, an emerging technology, nanosilver, that can have some risks and some benefits. And we wrote this with a science writer to make sure that, you know, we would not pushing more the risk or the benefits related to the issue. And then we had more than 1,000 Americans, a representative sample, look at this story. Half of the sample saw the story plus comments that were actually quite polite. And then the other half of the sample saw the same story but with the comments that were, you know, followed by name calling. So the same comments but just name calling and just rudeness, you know, overall in the comments. So basically what we saw is people that were exposed to the polite comments didn't change their views really about the issue covered in the story versus the people that did see the rude comments became polarized, they became more against the technology that was covered in the story. And again, remember, like everybody saw the same story. So it was really the fact that you had that name-calling that, you know, that really out-of-the-board type of behavior that made a difference. CONAN: As you said, the nasty comments you included were not all that nasty as far as the Web is concerned, and nanosilver, I have to say, is not as controversial a subject as, say, abortion or gun rights or for that matter, climate change. BROSSARD: Yes. Exactly and that's a good point. We did choose nanosilver. We are interested in emerging technologies. How can people make sense of complicated issues and that have multiple dimensions, that not just about oh, I'm against or for this because my values tell me that that's not OK, right? But if you think of complex issues such as, let's say, foreign policy or, you know, the economy or you just mentioned climate change, that are complicated - you know, they have different dimension: social dimension, technical dimension, legal dimension, ethical dimension. So how do people make sense of this kind of complicated issue? And we know in communication research that people - all of us, we use mental shortcut to make sense of things that are complicated, right, because we cannot know everything about everything. So we need to have an anchor to make sense of this. And it seems that rudeness and incivility is used as a mental shortcut to make sense of those complicated issues. So as you say, Neal, and it's a good point, this is likely to happen for other issues such as climate change, for example, that are also very complicated and have different dimensions. CONAN: So how do we deal with this? What do we do? BROSSARD: You know, I wish I could answer that question. I think what we do is like we all put our heads around the issue and try to find a way, all of us, you know, that are involved in journalism, communication, online communication, and that actually we believe that it's important, as you do in your show by having callers call and be part of the conversation. It's important to have that conversation. But how do we foster a constructive conversation? And I think what we need to define now on the, you know, like on the Web, what is a good conversation? What are the things that are allowed socially? Also, as an audience, what do we let happen there? Because what happen right now is, you know, as I sense elsewhere, it seems to be like the Wild West. The trolls are winning. Now people, you know, they are used to see people being very outrageous in those comments, and then they won't comment because they don't want to be, you know, included in this type of discussion. So I think we need to really move towards how can we moderate those comments in a way that's good for everybody? CONAN: So we want to hear from those of you involved in online communications. How do you deal with flamers or, well, do you anticipate their comments and adjust your articles accordingly? Give us a call: 800-989-8255. Email us: talk@npr. org. We'll start with Brett, and Brett's on the line with us from Phoenix. BRETT: Yeah, hi. Very interesting. I have been commenting mostly at the New York Times on many of the stories that I read, especially in the opinion section. And for example, I just read Paul Krugman's very good article, I believe, in the last day. And I find that it adds layers of depth to the overall opinion piece or article that I don't get in the article itself in many cases. And I've been reading these comments for a number of years. I would like to say one thing, though. I kind of disagree with the person on the show to say that we have to, quote, foster or moderate. I think this is a reality of today's online, and I don't see how it's any different than going to a town meeting where you might have a few hecklers and people in the audience. But still, the conversation goes on and information can be exchanged. So I'll take my answer off the air. CONAN: Just a comment, Brett. I think that the New York Times and other places, too, will have people remove comments that are considered offensive. BROSSARD: Exactly. BRETT: Right. And I don't think they have to be heavily edited or moderated. I do want to hear divergent points of view, and I appreciate that. CONAN: OK. That's a different point and, I think, a good one. Dominique Brossard? BROSSARD: Yes, indeed. And I hope, you know, I won't be misunderstood, really not my intention to suggest that we need to heavily edit comments, and I do believe, indeed, that you can have an excellent, you know, comments that follow an article and bring a lot to the conversation. As a matter of fact, we had - a colleague of mine had an opinion editorial in the New York Times last Sunday, and you know, like, the readers brought amazing good points that really added value to our piece. Unfortunately, it's not always the case. And to give you another example, our research was covered in the Journal Sentinel here in Milwaukee, and we got some comments that were totally disconnected to the topic of the article and were, you know, borderline offensive. So every newspaper, every media organization has, you know, different ways to deal with this. And the question is, and I agree with your caller, where you do you draw the line? You don't want to be censoring opinions, but you don't want to allow, neither, points that are, you know, out of topic and that are offensive to the other people that are discussing. CONAN: Let's get Mike on the line. Mike's on the line with us from Cape Cod. MIKE: Good afternoon. CONAN: Good afternoon. MIKE: I'm an editor of a website about Earth science. And one of the things that we do is we try to edit out comments, delete comments that don't advance the conversation. I don't necessarily mean ones that are disagreeing with the point of view or, in the case of science, you'll get people who are denying the science. We don't necessarily even weed those out. But the things that are nasty, that are uninformative, that are just sort of someone's making it up, we just go out of our way and nip those comments in the bud. They're not advancing the conversation. And just because you have a First Amendment right to have freedom of speech does not mean you have a First Amendment right to express that speech on my website. CONAN: I understand that, too, but doesn't this take up a fair amount of time? MIKE: It can. That's what the delete button is for. (LAUGHTER)CONAN: I see. OK. But as there are other journals and other publications that are not - don't have editors like you to say, well, I don't know. Maybe this one, maybe not that one. MIKE: Yes. I mean, that's the problem. But I think it's an obligation. If you're going to open up the conversation online, you need to be prepared to moderate it and to stay engaged with it. A lot of - where a lot of sites go wrong, whether it's at federal agencies or at newspapers, is that they open this up and then they let the free-for-all happen, and then they wonder why it goes wrong. If you're going to have - if you can't manage the conversation, you shouldn't open the conversation. Just don't take comments. CONAN: Just as a question of technique, do you respond to, you know, commenters' questions? I mean, for example, if they ask a factual question, would you say \"the answer is 476, Ed\" or something like that? MIKE: Yes, we will do it. We've been known to make corrections or make adjustments or additions to a story and note that, that readers pointed that out. CONAN: So there is a hint that there is an intelligence there that is moderating the conversation. MIKE: Yes, absolutely. And we owe that to the readers. It's not easy. It's not - it does take time, but it - that's our responsibility, if you're going to have a conversation. That makes it two-way. Otherwise, you're just talking at people. CONAN: Mike, thanks very much for the call, appreciate it. MIKE: Thank you. CONAN: We're talking with Dominique Brossard, a professor in the Department of Life Sciences Communication at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and one of the authors of a new study in this month's Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication on the online nasty effect. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. And Howard's on the line, Howard calling from San Antonio. HOWARD: Yes, hi. I just was going to comment and say that I have a site, and it's a soccer site. It's americanizesoccer. com. And with a name like that,  you can imagine that there's a lot of people who disagree and are very upset that here I am stating some of the rules in soccer may need to change and - for Americans to like the game better. So I know ahead of time that people are not going to agree with what I'm saying. But what I try to do and because I've had so many people comment and so - the trolls that you talk about - people just out there just make horrible comments just for the heck of it, I try to be as clear, concise. I try to make common sense. And in the end, people are going to disagree, but at least I can feel good about the fact that I've written the article to try to explain exactly why, and the Americanized soccer is a thing that we should look for, for the future in soccer. CONAN: Well, I don't - I will not agree or disagree about Americanized soccer, but I will appreciate your difficulties in writing about something that people, as you suggest, feel so passionately about. So I don't envy your editing tasks. HOWARD: Exactly. And thank you for allowing me to comment. CONAN: Thanks very much, Howard. And let's see if we go next to - this is. . . BROSSARD: Neal, if I can say something. CONAN: Go ahead, please. BROSSARD: I think it's important to keep in mind, I think your callers, you know, it was great to hear that they wanted to establish a fruitful conversation with their readership. But I think the point that you brought up earlier, which is related to the volume, is extremely important. I mean, how can you deal like - our opinion editorial in the New York Times, you know, had 400 comments after two hours. So they just stopped allowing, you know, those comments to be posted. So the problem is really a question of human power, or how can you deal with this? And I think that's where we are right now. And you do have different companies that are trying to develop different ways of having automated ways of moderating the comments, you know, but this is complicated. You need to have intelligent algorithms that let you, you know, still keep the essence of the conversation and not be too harsh in eliminating the ones that do not feed the flow, for example. CONAN: Here's a tweet from Jessie Hudgens: \"I try to engage with trolls. Often, gentle pushback can lead to concessions and convert rants into fruitful debate. \" And again, that's the moderated question, but what if you got 400 of them? And that's the point that Dominique Brossard just made. Matisse is on the line calling from San Francisco. MATISSE: Hi, there. So I have about 25 years of experience in online discussion forums because I started using and eventually became an employee of and then continue to use a system called The WELL, which was one of the early online discussion systems. And my comments or observation is that a technique that is not a silver bullet but has tremendous value is to not allow anonymous commentary. So, for example, if people must use their real name and it is linked to, say, their zip code, if there's a national or international forum, and backed by the use of a credit card, not that they have to pay in order to make a comment, but that it's backed to a real verified identity, that it helps a lot. Obviously, NPR uses, like, a much more - higher-cost technique of screening every caller. . . CONAN: Yes. MATISSE: . . . before they're allowed on the air. And you can't do that if you're getting 400 in two hours. But if you restrict comments to people who are publicly identified by their real name and do not allow anonymous. . . CONAN: And I don't mean to cut you off, Matisse, I just wanted to give Dominique Brossard a chance to respond. Is the cloak of anonymity a problem here? BROSSARD: Well, actually, it does help to some extent to have, you know, way to link the commenter to some kind of identity. But it's not foolproof either. And, for example, that news story I was commenting on, that generated a lot of nasty comments for our own, you know, study, you had to actually log in with your Facebook account to this. CONAN: Ah. BROSSARD: So - and still we got a fair number of the - we got more than 170 comments, so our numbers are very good. Ones, you know - when I say good, it's like either they disagree or agree, but in, you know, constructive terms. And we still got the nasty ones. So let's say that didn't prevent the trolls from invading our space. CONAN: And, Matisse, thanks very much. As you suggest, not a silver bullet, but perhaps helpful. Our guest was Dominique Brossard, co-author of a new study on the Web's nasty effect.  She joined us from Wisconsin Public Radio in Madison, and we thank her very much for her time. Tomorrow, doctors work through on pot prescriptions. Join us for that. I'm Neal Conan, it's the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. NEAL CONAN, HOST:  What was once a democratic forum for opinion and information has been reduced to a feeding frenzy. No, not Congress. We're talking about the comments section. Web-savvy news junkies have known for a long time that reader feedback can often turn nasty. Now, a new study finds that just reading that uncivil discourse can change the way we interpret the news. The study comes from this month's Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication by five researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and George Mason University. So if you write for the web, do you keep your commenters in mind as you write? 800-989-8255. Email us: talk@npr. org. You can also join the conversation at our website. That's at npr. org, click on TALK OF THE NATION. Dominique Brossard is a professor in the department of life sciences communication at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, co-author of the first study looking at the so-called nasty effect. She joins us from WPR in Madison. Nice to have you with us today. DOMINIQUE BROSSARD: Thanks for having me. CONAN: And did it come as a surprise to find that opinion on an article changed if someone wrote \"that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard of\" at the end of it? BROSSARD: Well, there's been some concern about uncivility and, you know, the fact that people tend to be rude on the online environment for quite a long time. But as far as the effect of the comments themselves being rude in changing the perception of the issue covering the study, yes, we investigated this from an open-minded perspective and we were surprised to see that what we use as rude comments, which as one of the news reporters that covered our study said - as reported to the online environment was quite tame, you know, like name calling such as idiot or things like that, were enough to actually change, you know, the perception of the story. So what we use as uncivil comments, were actually quite tame. So if those have an effect, then the question is what happen when people are much more outrageous in their way of behaving online. CONAN: So you tested for this by writing a spurious article and then people read it without comments and people read it with nasty comments. BROSSARD: No, not exactly, actually. What we did is that we wrote a balanced news story about something complicated, an emerging technology, nanosilver, that can have some risks and some benefits. And we wrote this with a science writer to make sure that, you know, we would not pushing more the risk or the benefits related to the issue. And then we had more than 1,000 Americans, a representative sample, look at this story. Half of the sample saw the story plus comments that were actually quite polite. And then the other half of the sample saw the same story but with the comments that were, you know, followed by name calling. So the same comments but just name calling and just rudeness, you know, overall in the comments. So basically what we saw is people that were exposed to the polite comments didn't change their views really about the issue covered in the story versus the people that did see the rude comments became polarized, they became more against the technology that was covered in the story. And again, remember, like everybody saw the same story. So it was really the fact that you had that name-calling that, you know, that really out-of-the-board type of behavior that made a difference. CONAN: As you said, the nasty comments you included were not all that nasty as far as the Web is concerned, and nanosilver, I have to say, is not as controversial a subject as, say, abortion or gun rights or for that matter, climate change. BROSSARD: Yes. Exactly and that's a good point. We did choose nanosilver. We are interested in emerging technologies. How can people make sense of complicated issues and that have multiple dimensions, that not just about oh, I'm against or for this because my values tell me that that's not OK, right? But if you think of complex issues such as, let's say, foreign policy or, you know, the economy or you just mentioned climate change, that are complicated - you know, they have different dimension: social dimension, technical dimension, legal dimension, ethical dimension. So how do people make sense of this kind of complicated issue? And we know in communication research that people - all of us, we use mental shortcut to make sense of things that are complicated, right, because we cannot know everything about everything. So we need to have an anchor to make sense of this. And it seems that rudeness and incivility is used as a mental shortcut to make sense of those complicated issues. So as you say, Neal, and it's a good point, this is likely to happen for other issues such as climate change, for example, that are also very complicated and have different dimensions. CONAN: So how do we deal with this? What do we do? BROSSARD: You know, I wish I could answer that question. I think what we do is like we all put our heads around the issue and try to find a way, all of us, you know, that are involved in journalism, communication, online communication, and that actually we believe that it's important, as you do in your show by having callers call and be part of the conversation. It's important to have that conversation. But how do we foster a constructive conversation? And I think what we need to define now on the, you know, like on the Web, what is a good conversation? What are the things that are allowed socially? Also, as an audience, what do we let happen there? Because what happen right now is, you know, as I sense elsewhere, it seems to be like the Wild West. The trolls are winning. Now people, you know, they are used to see people being very outrageous in those comments, and then they won't comment because they don't want to be, you know, included in this type of discussion. So I think we need to really move towards how can we moderate those comments in a way that's good for everybody? CONAN: So we want to hear from those of you involved in online communications. How do you deal with flamers or, well, do you anticipate their comments and adjust your articles accordingly? Give us a call: 800-989-8255. Email us: talk@npr. org. We'll start with Brett, and Brett's on the line with us from Phoenix. BRETT: Yeah, hi. Very interesting. I have been commenting mostly at the New York Times on many of the stories that I read, especially in the opinion section. And for example, I just read Paul Krugman's very good article, I believe, in the last day. And I find that it adds layers of depth to the overall opinion piece or article that I don't get in the article itself in many cases. And I've been reading these comments for a number of years. I would like to say one thing, though. I kind of disagree with the person on the show to say that we have to, quote, foster or moderate. I think this is a reality of today's online, and I don't see how it's any different than going to a town meeting where you might have a few hecklers and people in the audience. But still, the conversation goes on and information can be exchanged. So I'll take my answer off the air. CONAN: Just a comment, Brett. I think that the New York Times and other places, too, will have people remove comments that are considered offensive. BROSSARD: Exactly. BRETT: Right. And I don't think they have to be heavily edited or moderated. I do want to hear divergent points of view, and I appreciate that. CONAN: OK. That's a different point and, I think, a good one. Dominique Brossard? BROSSARD: Yes, indeed. And I hope, you know, I won't be misunderstood, really not my intention to suggest that we need to heavily edit comments, and I do believe, indeed, that you can have an excellent, you know, comments that follow an article and bring a lot to the conversation. As a matter of fact, we had - a colleague of mine had an opinion editorial in the New York Times last Sunday, and you know, like, the readers brought amazing good points that really added value to our piece. Unfortunately, it's not always the case. And to give you another example, our research was covered in the Journal Sentinel here in Milwaukee, and we got some comments that were totally disconnected to the topic of the article and were, you know, borderline offensive. So every newspaper, every media organization has, you know, different ways to deal with this. And the question is, and I agree with your caller, where you do you draw the line? You don't want to be censoring opinions, but you don't want to allow, neither, points that are, you know, out of topic and that are offensive to the other people that are discussing. CONAN: Let's get Mike on the line. Mike's on the line with us from Cape Cod. MIKE: Good afternoon. CONAN: Good afternoon. MIKE: I'm an editor of a website about Earth science.

I'm Audie Cornish. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: And I'm Melissa Block. There's a new element at this year's South by Southwest Festival in Austin - a gaming expo. Austin is a good place for it. The city has strong ties to the video game industry and its home to an estimated 7,000 independent game developers. Reporter Noah Nelson, of Turnstyle News and Youth Radio, went in search of the indie gaming scene. NOAH NELSON, BYLINE: Before I go looking for the heart of Austin's indie game scene, I better define what an indie game is. (LAUGHTER)BRANDON BOYER: That's kind of the million-dollar question. NELSON: Brandon Boyer is the lynchpin of the community and chairman of San Francisco's Independent Games Festival. Here, developers introduce popular games like \"Braid,\" which turns a classic like Mario on its head with puzzle challenges. They market their latest work either to triple-A publishers like Microsoft and Sony or directly to gamers. Here's how Boyer defines indie. BOYER: It's a game that's basically created without someone on top kind of making demands of the game itself. So it's one that typically is kind of truer to the creator's original vision because there wasn't, like, a marketing team, you know, there wasn't shareholders to please. NELSON: Boyer seeks games that break away from military shooters and sports games that sell millions of units for big publishers; games that emphasize discovery: odd narratives, out-of-the-box thinking. In Austin, Boyer shows those games off at Juegoes Racheroes. BOYER: Next up is another, like, really curious little, single idea game. It's called \"30 Second Life. \" It's from a guy called. . . NELSON: Juegoes is a monthly gathering held in a pizza and beer joint just east of downtown Austin. Boyer is the master of ceremonies, leading the crowd through the month's latest indie releases. The audience even gets to play demos of games. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO GAME)NELSON: I'm here looking for indie developer Robin Arnott. One way developers raise cash is through online crowd-funding sites like Kickstarter. Arnott is launching the Kickstarter campaign for his new project onstage tonight. It's a trippy meditation game called \"Sound Self\" that you control with your voice to create digitally generated mandala-like images. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)NELSON: Arnott and his business partner Davey Welden have invited college students and developers to their house for a party the next night. They'll show off art-driven games like \"Sound Self,\" the kind of work they want to spend their lives making. Tonight, Arnott is nervous about the upcoming partyROBIN ARNOTT: It could just be a disaster. DAVEY WELDEN: Uh-oh. Oh, no. . . ARNOTT: It's not going to be, I don't think. I hope not. WELDEN: Is it too late to cancel? ARNOTT: We have to cancel. NELSON: Arnott has chosen the indie path, but some developers find themselves on it unexpectedly. One reason the Austin indie scene keeps growing is the boom and bust cycle of game production. Layoffs at the multi-million dollar selling triple-A studios here are annual events. Developers inside those studios look to indie games for a way out. Arnie Jorgensen is the art director of indie studio Stoic. He says the indie community went into triage mode last month for newly jobless developers. They slapped together a conference in a matter of days. ARNIE JORGENSEN: We talked about things like how do you do taxes. You know, how would do you do a Kickstarter? How would you crowd-fund it? How do you come up with an idea? NELSON: Austin has a long tradition of making games and every time a studio goes under, the talent sticks around. Developers come for jobs and stay for Austin's creative-is-cool culture. At Arnott and Welden's party, Arnott is still a little on edge. ARNOTT: And, of course I'm so nervous about the game because it's so weird. And I think I'm so afraid that people aren't going to get it or aren't going to like it. NELSON: Dude, you saw the crowd. ARNOTT: Yeah. NELSON: Like, everyone is super into it. (SOUNDBITE OF CHANTING)NELSON: Online, Arnott has already raised $4,000. And here at the party in Austin, the crowd is eating \"Sound Self\" up. Kids pile into the tool shed where the game is set up, laying on their backs on a pile of pillows. Which is how I wind up surrounded by a motley crew of hippies and indie gamers, chanting into a microphone. WELDEN: More and more, more people. More people. NELSON: This is what I always imagined South by Southwest would be: music, tech, and Austin's famous weirdness brought together. I just never thought I'd find it in a tool shed.

WELDEN: Is it too late to cancel? ARNOTT: We have to cancel. NELSON: Arnott has chosen the indie path, but some developers find themselves on it unexpectedly. One reason the Austin indie scene keeps growing is the boom and bust cycle of game production. Layoffs at the multi-million dollar selling triple-A studios here are annual events. Developers inside those studios look to indie games for a way out. Arnie Jorgensen is the art director of indie studio Stoic. He says the indie community went into triage mode last month for newly jobless developers. They slapped together a conference in a matter of days. ARNIE JORGENSEN: We talked about things like how do you do taxes. You know, how would do you do a Kickstarter? How would you crowd-fund it? How do you come up with an idea? NELSON: Austin has a long tradition of making games and every time a studio goes under, the talent sticks around. Developers come for jobs and stay for Austin's creative-is-cool culture. At Arnott and Welden's party, Arnott is still a little on edge. ARNOTT: And, of course I'm so nervous about the game because it's so weird. And I think I'm so afraid that people aren't going to get it or aren't going to like it. NELSON: Dude, you saw the crowd. ARNOTT: Yeah. NELSON: Like, everyone is super into it. (SOUNDBITE OF CHANTING) NELSON: Online, Arnott has already raised $4,000. And here at the party in Austin, the crowd is eating \"Sound Self\" up. Kids pile into the tool shed where the game is set up, laying on their backs on a pile of pillows. Which is how I wind up surrounded by a motley crew of hippies and indie gamers, chanting into a microphone. WELDEN: More and more, more people. More people. NELSON: This is what I always imagined South by Southwest would be: music, tech, and Austin's famous weirdness brought together. I just never thought I'd find it in a tool shed.

That medium has exploded in the decade or so that it's existed. Over the next few months we're going to be listening to some of your favorite podcasts. And first up, one that's been downloaded more than five million times. This podcast is called \"The Bowery Boys\" and it's named for a 19th century Manhattan street gang. The podcast bills itself as telling the unofficial history of New York City. Here's NPR's Caitlin Dickerson. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CAITLIN DICKERSON, BYLINE: You could call Tom Meyers and Greg Young modern-day Bowery Boys. They're best friends who love to perform, almost as much as they love New York City. And they record their show a few blocks from the Bowery district. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"AFTER THE BALL\")DICKERSON: Here's a clip from an episode about Tin Pan Alley, where 19th century composers churned out sheet music to distribute across the country. GREG YOUNG: Charles Harris wrote a song called \"After the Ball\" in 1892. TOM MEYERS: Yes. YOUNG: He was lucky enough to get a vaudevillian star to perform the song in her show. And it would sell up to 10 million copies. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"AFTER THE BALL\")YOUNG: I mean, could you imagine like a Lady Gaga song rolling out over six years, rolling out throughout the country? (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"AFTER THE BALL\")DICKERSON: The Bowery Boys audience doesn't quite rival Lady Gaga's, but 20,000 listeners isn't too shabby. Still, Greg and Tom are the first to admit they're not professionals. MEYERS: We bought \"Podcasting for Dummies,\" partially to figure out what a podcast was and also how to record these things. DICKERSON: And they don't use fancy equipment either. MEYERS: I think that for the first episode, we recorded with a spare karaoke microphone that we had in the closet for other occasions. (LAUGHTER)YOUNG: Yes, that's exactly right. DICKERSON: Each episode, two best friends tell little-known stories about their adopted city's history. Tom grew up in Ohio and Greg in Missouri, but they're more than qualified to talk Big Apple. Like, why a trip up Manhattan is quick and easy, but traveling a few blocks east or west takes much longer. YOUNG: That's because of decisions made 200 years ago by the commissioners' plan, through the use of a grid plan. But that is something that every New Yorker lives with every day. DICKERSON: Tom and Greg have touched on New York's iconic landmarks like Times Square. But the Bowery Boys don't stop with the familiar. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)DICKERSON: They took listeners to a 1960s theme park in the Bronx called. . . YOUNG: Freedomland USA was an American theme park. It was shaped like the United States and you went into each area and there were themed rides and everything. (SOUNDBITE OF AD)DICKERSON: That's an ad from Freedomland, the quirky amusement park that closed after only four years. Greg says he likes an element of randomness to help choose episodes. And it works. YOUNG: I got responses of people who said when I was a kid my parents took me to Freedomland and I thought I had made it up. DICKERSON: Tom and Greg pack in incredible about of history into each episode - not so easy for two guys with day jobs. Greg does music licensing for Sony and Tom runs his own online travel business. MEYERS: I don't read anything that's not related to New York City history, which is a little bit sad. . . (LAUGHTER)YOUNG: Yeah. MEYERS: . . . because I'd love to read a novel that wasn't - I'd love to read a novel. But at the same time I can't get enough. DICKERSON: The Bowery Boys podcast now includes a blog that gets about 100,000 hits each month. And Greg and Tom have become sort of unofficial ambassadors of New York City history. They've appeared on local television and done events with the city's Municipal Arts Society. MEYERS: We don't pretend to have doctorates in the subject. And I feel like we are getting our own degree in this because. . . YOUNG: Oh yeah, home-schooled. MEYERS: We are home-schooled historians. (LAUGHTER)DICKERSON: Home-schooled, maybe. But five years and just shy of 150 episodes later, when it comes to New York City they're schooling us. Caitlin Dickerson, NPR News.

Match. com launched way back in 1995, and it's still a major player. But another dating site that's drawing today's 20-somethings is Grouper. It uses Facebook profiles to set up group dates of six people. NPR's Sam Sanders tagged along on a Grouper date in Los Angeles. He has this report on how the hashtag generation approaches love in the age of social media. SAM SANDERS, BYLINE: Here's how it works. You sign up for Grouper through Facebook. Grouper uses your Facebook profile to match you up with a blind date. Next, you recruit two of your friends. The blind date does the same. And then Grouper sends all six of you on a group date. Everyone pays 20 bucks to make sure you show up. And the day of, you get a text with a time and a place. I tagged along on one of these dates, with a group of six all in their early 20s; at a bar called the Virgil, on Santa Monica Boulevard in L. A. NPR agreed to the group's request to use only first names in this story. We all know how dicey first dates can be. Before the date, the three ladies - Chloe, Daphne and Katie - had set the bar pretty low. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: I hope they're good looking, and I hope they're not acnified and sweaty. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: The fun part about it, though, is if they're awkward or acnified, we have each other. Hence. . . SANDERS: I caught the three guys - Alex, Max and Josh - outside at a taco truck, before they went in the bar. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: I expect to find three relatively fun girls. SANDERS: What's your ideal? UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: My ideal is that they're very attractive, and they have great personalities, and they probably want to hook up. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Uh - I'm looking to find true love. SANDERS: A little after 8 p. m. , game on. (SOUNDBITE OF GROUPER DATE CONVERSATION). . . Hi guys. . . . . . Hi. . . . . . I'm Max. . . . . . I'm Katie. . . . . . Where are you from? . . . I'm from here. . . . . . I'm from here. . . . . . Echo Park? Is this Echo Park? . . . No. This is. . . . . . Technically, it's Silver Lake, technically. . . . . . We ride horses together, and I went to high school with her. . . (LAUGHTER). . . So what do you guys do? . . . I used to have a bellybutton ring. . . . . . I did, too. . . . . So did she. . . . . . I used to. . . (LAUGHTER). . . My favorite band to see, before they were famous, was Kings of Leon. . . . . . Oh, yeah. . . . . . back when they were folk. . . . . . I told the office that I'm going to live tweet the Grouper. . . . . . Well, he told all of Twitter that he is because you tweeted it, so. . . SANDERS: SANDERS: So yeah, a typical date times three, except it's not. This is not a date. Do not call it a date. MICHAEL WAXMAN: We just call them Groupers and in fact, we have a policy of not using the D-word internally or externally. SANDERS: That's Michael Waxman. He's the CEO of Grouper, based in New York. He actually met his long-term girlfriend on a Grouper date. He says his company is all about leaving labels at the door. And the label of date can be absolutely terrifying for 20-somethings these days. There's another label that Grouper helps you avoid: reject. WAXMAN: For a generation of people who grew up with participation trophies, rejection is a hard thing. SANDERS: With a Grouper date, no one likes anyone, so what? You're there with your friends. The heck with love. Shots all around. OK. Back to the date. (SOUNDBITE OF GROUPER DATE CONVERSATION). . . Groupergram. . . . . . Groupergram. . . . . . Instagram it for the Groupergram to win free drinks. . . . . . A Groupergram is when you and your Grouper groupies take a photo, and you post it on Instagram. But the best Grouper photo of the night gets. . . . . . At least a free drink. . . . A free round of drinks. . . SANDERS: SANDERS: This, the Groupergram, took at least half an hour. UNIDENTIFIED BARTENDER: You need to be on your knees. I need you right here. I need you to look right down at this guy. So I need you right here-ish. SANDERS: Intricate poses, props, a bartender who became a set director; and then the sharing, the captioning. (SOUNDBITE OF GROUPER DATE CONVERSATION)Wait, wait, he's adding text, right? SANDERS: SANDERS: The editing. (SOUNDBITE OF GROUPER DATE CONVERSATION)Are we using this one? This is the best one. . . SANDERS: SANDERS: This is modern nondating. If you can't like it, tweet it, share it or hashtag it, then it's just a tree falling in the woods by itself - or something. A few hours in, things got real with a popular but vulgar drinking game. (SOUNDBITE OF GROUPER DATE CONVERSATION)Um, I think I would kill you. . . Wow. (bleep). . . . . . and marry you. . . SANDERS: SANDERS: A group date, at its essence, is downright Darwinian. At some point, someone loses. So around 10 p. m. , I separated the boys from the girls, to see where things stood. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: So I feel like it was super exciting, at first. And then as their charm started to wear and they got a little more comfortable, they became a little more boring. SANDERS: Which guy is not liked? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: I think the guy that's not liked is the skinny one. What's his name? UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: I'm enjoying myself. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Yeah, it was fun. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: They're fun girls. We all agree that two out of the three girls are very - are attractive. SANDERS: And the third is? UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Sweet. SANDERS: So yeah, no love connection. I left around 10:30. From what I heard the next day, the six went to another bar for a few more drinks, and that was it - which is fine. Michael Waxman says a successful Grouper can be many things; making new friends, reconnecting with old ones, or just having a good night of drinking. But more than anything that stood out that night was that the hashtag generation would almost be fine doing nothing alone, ever again. Here's Chloe and Alex. CHLOE: Of course, I would go out on my own if I knew other people were going to be out on their own as well, and I wouldn't be the awkward person alone at the bar, desperate. But everyone is always in a group these days. ALEX: Desperation, I feel like if you're alone, it's - you're becoming desperate, yeah. SANDERS: Grouper's got them covered, and they're moving to where just about everything is going these days: your smartphone. The company plans to debut a mobile app later this spring. It may be the only way to stay current in a sea of dating sites and apps. With the Grouper app, you and your friends will be able to set up Grouper rendezvous almost immediately. So you can move from quiet night alone to hashtag Groupergram, in no time. And all of your friends can see. Modern love is a group sport. And the stadium - the stadium is all of the Internet.

The company behind it, Rovio, says it is the number one paid app of all time. It's been downloaded 1. 7 billion times. And starting tomorrow, the company that created \"Angry Birds\" is releasing a cartoon series directly through its games. That series will also be shown on international TV channels, though in the U. S. the main way to see it will be inside the mobile game. As NPR's Mandalit del Barco reports, Rovio is sidestepping traditional distribution deals with major Hollywood players. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MANDALIT DEL BARCO, BYLINE: \"Angry Birds\" is just so simple, says Rovio's Andrew Stalbow. ANDREW STALBOW: They're very unique birds, with each with very special powers that each of which get very upset and aggravated by the very rascal-ish pigs who've stolen their eggs. BARCO: In the game, players use slingshots to catapult the colorful birds, who don't fly, to destroy structures hiding the green pigs. (SOUNDBITE OF \"ANGRY BIRDS\")BARCO: The new \"Angry Birds\" cartoons go one step farther. STALBOW: There's a whole infrastructure to the pigs' world. They live on an island that has some amazing stories to tell. BARCO: Stalbow, who's in charge of Rovio's strategic partnerships, is only a little ambitious about how far his birds and pigs can fly. STALBOW: I would describe them as most closely aligned to, say, \"Tom 'N Jerry. \" And I we're thinking about really Looney Tunes for the mobile generation. (SOUNDBITE OF \"ANGRY BIRDS\")BARCO: New three minute episodes will be revealed every week when players push a button on the 99 cent game app. KIRK HAMILTON: At its heart, you know, it's just fun to play, it's just basically sling-shotting birds. So anyone can understand it. BARCO: Kirk Hamilton is a features editor for Gawker Media's gaming website. He says the startup Rovio has already thrown the video gaming industry for a loop, and could do the same for TV. HAMILTON: I think that's the thing that makes this really interesting, is that they have this huge embedded audience who all have a way to just give them money already. So they're just giving them more stuff to spend money on. BARCO: Four years after the small Finnish company launched its digital game, Rovio has become a major player in the entertainment world. (SOUNDBITE OF THEME \"STAR WARS,\" THEME SONG)BARCO: Rovio joined forces with Lucasfilm to come up with a \"Star Wars Angry Birds\" cartoons, games and merchandise. They've partnered with 20th Century Fox, National Geographic and even NASA. There are now \"Angry Birds\" plush toys, lunchboxes and T-shirts, books; and \"Angry Birds\" theme parks in Europe and China. The company makes most of its money from merchandise and advertisers on its games and YouTube channel, with more than a billion views. (SOUNDBITE OF \"ANGRY BIRDS\")BARCO: With its new cartoon series, Rovio is betting on new media to directly collect more revenue from its fans and advertising partners like Paramount Pictures, and Sony Pictures and BlackBerry. Executive vice president Stalbow says that puts Rovio in a unique position. STALBOW: The world's changing, where a really small company of 12 people in Helsinki can compete with the big media company who has significantly more resources, because the platforms are more accessible to everybody. So it's an exciting time for any startup out there because the playing field just got leveled. BARCO: In three years, \"Angry Birds\" is set to be a feature length film. Where will it end?  How long will the birds be angry? And when will those pigs stop stealing their eggs? Stalbow says there are generations of bad blood between them, so many more stories to tell on many different devices. (SOUNDBITE OF \"ANGRY BIRDS\")BARCO: Mandalit del Barco, NPR News. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Well, a very clear hit has been the game \"Angry Birds\" game. The company behind it, Rovio, says it is the number one paid app of all time. It's been downloaded 1. 7 billion times. And starting tomorrow, the company that created \"Angry Birds\" is releasing a cartoon series directly through its games. That series will also be shown on international TV channels, though in the U. S. the main way to see it will be inside the mobile game. As NPR's Mandalit del Barco reports, Rovio is sidestepping traditional distribution deals with major Hollywood players. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MANDALIT DEL BARCO, BYLINE: \"Angry Birds\" is just so simple, says Rovio's Andrew Stalbow. ANDREW STALBOW: They're very unique birds, with each with very special powers that each of which get very upset and aggravated by the very rascal-ish pigs who've stolen their eggs. BARCO: In the game, players use slingshots to catapult the colorful birds, who don't fly, to destroy structures hiding the green pigs. (SOUNDBITE OF \"ANGRY BIRDS\") BARCO: The new \"Angry Birds\" cartoons go one step farther. STALBOW: There's a whole infrastructure to the pigs' world. They live on an island that has some amazing stories to tell. BARCO: Stalbow, who's in charge of Rovio's strategic partnerships, is only a little ambitious about how far his birds and pigs can fly. STALBOW: I would describe them as most closely aligned to, say, \"Tom 'N Jerry. \" And I we're thinking about really Looney Tunes for the mobile generation. (SOUNDBITE OF \"ANGRY BIRDS\") BARCO: New three minute episodes will be revealed every week when players push a button on the 99 cent game app. KIRK HAMILTON: At its heart, you know, it's just fun to play, it's just basically sling-shotting birds. So anyone can understand it. BARCO: Kirk Hamilton is a features editor for Gawker Media's gaming website. He says the startup Rovio has already thrown the video gaming industry for a loop, and could do the same for TV. HAMILTON: I think that's the thing that makes this really interesting, is that they have this huge embedded audience who all have a way to just give them money already. So they're just giving them more stuff to spend money on. BARCO: Four years after the small Finnish company launched its digital game, Rovio has become a major player in the entertainment world. (SOUNDBITE OF THEME \"STAR WARS,\" THEME SONG) BARCO: Rovio joined forces with Lucasfilm to come up with a \"Star Wars Angry Birds\" cartoons, games and merchandise. They've partnered with 20th Century Fox, National Geographic and even NASA. There are now \"Angry Birds\" plush toys, lunchboxes and T-shirts, books; and \"Angry Birds\" theme parks in Europe and China. The company makes most of its money from merchandise and advertisers on its games and YouTube channel, with more than a billion views. (SOUNDBITE OF \"ANGRY BIRDS\") BARCO: With its new cartoon series, Rovio is betting on new media to directly collect more revenue from its fans and advertising partners like Paramount Pictures, and Sony Pictures and BlackBerry. Executive vice president Stalbow says that puts Rovio in a unique position.

I'm Renee Montagne. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: And I'm Steve Inskeep. Good morning. The director of National Intelligence says the prospect of a cyber attack is now the number one security threat. In remarks this week, James Clapper ranked the cyber threat above terrorism. Plenty of leaders have issued warnings, like former defense secretary Leon Panetta's statement about a cyber Pearl Harbor. NPR's Tom Gjelten has covered this threat for years, yet some of the rhetoric got him wondering if the threat is overstated. TOM GJELTEN, BYLINE: The country's top intelligence officer and the top cyber officer were both on Capitol Hill this week warning that the danger of computer attacks needs to be taken a lot more seriously. National Intelligence Director James Clapper said it's hard to over-estimate its significance. General Keith Alexander, head of the U. S. military's Cyber Command, explained the threat to Republican Senator Lindsey Graham. (SOUNDBITE OF HEARING)GENERAL KEITH ALEXANDER: All our systems today, our power systems, our water systems, our governments, our industry, depend on computers, depend on computerized switches, depend on these networks. All that are at risk. If an adversary were to get in, they could essentially destroy those components. REPRESENTATIVE LINDSEY GRAHAM: Could do as much or more damage than the attacks of 9/11? ALEXANDER: That's correct. I think it would. GJELTEN: A cyber Pearl Harbor? A cyber attack as bad as 9/11? But Clapper and Alexander's testimonies were worded carefully. Clapper, speaking for the U. S. intelligence community, said there's only, quote, a remote chance, unquote, of a major computer attack during the next two years. Russia and China, the powers capable of mounting such an attack, have no reason to, Clapper suggested. General Alexander of Cyber Command said foreign leaders know a big cyber attack on the United States might be traced back to them and therefore would not want to run the risk of a U. S. counter-attack. So is the scare talk just hype? James Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies says he put that that question to what he calls one of the leading hypers of the cyber threat. JAMES LEWIS: I said, oh, come on, you know it's not going to be Pearl Harbor. And he said, yeah, but he wants people to pay attention and nobody's doing anything. So there are some folks out there who believed we needed to hype the threat to get the country to move, on the theory that democracies don't do anything until they've had a disaster. He's probably right. But I think it has been over-hyped. GJELTEN: Cyber security experts in both industry and government say the country is unprepared to deal with computer threats. But the immediate problem is cyber crime and cyber espionage, not cyber war. President Obama's national security adviser, Tom Donilon, this week accused computer hackers from China of stealing confidential business information and technology. THOMAS DONILON: Increasingly, U. S. businesses are speaking out about their serious concerns about sophisticated, targeted theft through cyber intrusions emanating from China on a very large scale. GJELTEN: Industry and government leaders say the everyday theft of trade secrets is undermining the U. S. economy. Beyond that, there is the danger in the future that some country might be tempted to launch a major cyber attack that could knock out the power grid or paralyze the financial system. That would be seen as an act of war, according to U. S. officials. It's unlikely now, but some up and coming cyber powers are a cause for concern. Cyber expert James Lewis notes that Iran, previously considered a minor cyber player, apparently went after the state oil company in Saudi Arabia recently. LEWIS: One thing most of us didn't expect was the Iranians to go from zero to 60 in about eight months. China, Russia, these are responsible countries. They're not going to start a war. How comfortable do you feel saying that about the Iranian Revolutionary Guard? GJELTEN: At this point, even the leaders of Iran may see little reason to spark a major cyber confrontation with the United States. That calculation, however, could at some point change, considering the current hostility between the two countries. Tom Gjelten, NPR News, Washington.

I'm John Dankosky. Last month New York's Grand Central Terminal celebrated its 100th anniversary, and while you might think of it as just a train station, Grand Central actually pioneered a lot of scientific innovations that spread across the country. Standard time, for example. You probably take today's time zones for granted, but back in the 1800s there more than 50 time zones around the country dictated by the local railroad operators. Grand Central Station led the way in adopting standard time. Then there was the debate over long-distance electric trains and how to power them: direct current or alternating current, another innovation born at Grand Central. How about green lights? Did you know they once meant stop? These are just some of the very surprising facts in the next guest's book, \"Grand Central: How A Train Station Transformed America. \" Sam Roberts is the urban affairs correspondent at the New York Times and author of \"Grand Central. \" He joins us here in our New York studios. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. SAM ROBERTS: Thank you, John. DANKOSKY: There is so much to talk about in this book, about Grand Central, but one of the things that's most fascinating is how they run all these trains all the time. You write that more than 100 years ago, they were running one train every 45 seconds during rush hour. This was way before computers. How did they coordinate all that? ROBERTS: With a lot of people, a lot of people, a lot of manual switches. There were something like over 100 switchmen working in the yards at Grand Central at any given time. Now they've been replaced by fewer than a dozen traffic controllers using computers. But then there were, as you say, about 500 trains maybe on a day running every 45 or so seconds. Now there are as many as 700 days, and in rush hour running about every 30 seconds. And it's really a miracle how well this thing works. DANKOSKY: You know, when Grand Central was built, it wasn't really in the center of anything. We think of it now as the center of Manhattan, but it wasn't really like that at the time. Tell us that story. ROBERTS: Absolutely true. When the original Grand Central opened in 1871, the New York Times said this place is neither grand nor central. What's it doing all the way uptown on East 42nd Street? But what was so fascinating about Grand Central, and you can't say this about the great, late, lamented Penn Station, is Grand Central brought Midtown to its doorstep. It shifted the whole center of gravity of Midtown Manhattan. DANKOSKY: We're talking with Sam Roberts from the New York Times. If you have questions about Grand Central Terminal, yes we'll get to why it's called Grand Central Terminal in a moment, 1-800-989-TALK, that's 1-800-989-8255 as we talk about the 100th anniversary of Grand Central Terminal. So one thing I do need to get from you is: How exactly did you get downtown from Grand Central back in the early days because there weren't trains going everywhere. ROBERTS: Horse. DANKOSKY: Horse-drawn, yeah. ROBERTS: Horse-drawn trolleys, indeed. They kept pushing the ban on coal-burning locomotives farther and farther uptown because they were disruptive, they produced smoke, cinder, soot, and finally they said none south of Grand Central, none south of 42nd Street. So it meant you had to take a horse-drawn carriage down - all the way downtown from there. DANKOSKY: And that soot and smoke and all the problems with the steam train, that's part of the reason why we got the electric railroad in the first place. ROBERTS: That is exactly right. Grand Central, as I say in the book, sort of began by accident or by an accident in 1902. A train coming out of the Park Avenue Tunnel, the engineer just could not see, went through a green light, which meant stop or slow down in those days, crashed into another train. Ultimately about two dozen people were killed. And the railroad was terrified of being held criminally liable when it was obvious that these engineers could not see coming out of the tunnel. And that's when William Wilgus, who was the chief engineer of the New York Central and kind of the hero of this story, said we've got to go to electrification. DANKOSKY: And how long did it take for electrification to get up and running? Because this is a brand new thing. ROBERTS: It was a brand new thing, and people don't realize, but this was early in the 19th century. Electricity was relatively new as a tool for locomotion. Frank Sprague, Edison, Westinghouse were all pioneers in this. They - the accident was 1902. The state legislature said you've got to have electric trains at least running in Manhattan by 1908. And the New York Central came in two years early, actually started the electrification in 1906. DANKOSKY: So this is a science show, and you knew you'd get a question about AC versus DC for powering the trains. So how do we arrive at where we arrived? ROBERTS: Well, you know, I'm still one of those people who thinks the current leaks out of outlets. So, you know, I might not be the best thing to ask. DANKOSKY: I think AC/DC is a rock band. So we're on the same - OK. ROBERTS: That, too. But DC can be transmitted over longer distances, and obviously that turned out to be a big benefit for trains. So you don't need to worry about that so much for a toaster that plugs into a wall, but an electric train definitely. And what was so interesting about it, and I learned doing the book, was that the debate over AC/DC in powering trains was a reprise of the debate that Edison and Westinghouse had had over how to power the electric chair. Edison said oh, you know, this alternating current is really dangerous, it's the best thing to use to kill people. So he surreptitiously powered New York state's electric chair with alternating current, and it worked. I'm not sure how persuasive that was in getting the New York Central Railroad to go with direct current, but it did. (LAUGHTER)DANKOSKY: And of course the trains run on direct current for certain parts of their run, but then once they go to that overhead power, it switches. ROBERTS: Yeah, some of the overhead power, particularly in Connecticut on the New Haven line, switches, yes. DANKOSKY: So I understand from your book that there's actually a button, like a don't press this button kind of button, a red button that you can just press and just take the whole thing right offline. ROBERTS: Well, one of the great things in doing the book was I got to see things in Grand Central that I have never even known existed. There is a basement room 90 feet below the street level where the old transformers used to convert the alternating current into direct current. Now, you know, one of those relic transformers are still there, but now they've been replaced by quietly humming computers. There is a little red button there that if you press, you can shut down the entire railroad. DANKOSKY: One of the most interesting things in this book is how you write about modern time starting at Grand Central. And we don't - we take time for granted. Time is just what it says on the clock, it's what our iPhone tells us it is. It didn't used to be that way. Time was different every place you were, and Grand Central helped to standardize it. ROBERTS: It definitely did. Time was when the sun was directly overhead, and that was noon wherever you happened to be. There was something like 50, and earlier than that even 100, different time zones in the United States, until Charles Dowd, who was a principal at a school that ultimately became Skidmore College Upstate New York, said wait a minute, this is crazy. Let's divide the country into four time zones, 15 degree longitude difference. The sun travels about an hour - travels 15 degrees in about an hour, and the railroads adopted that time in 1883, well ahead of the federal government. It was the railroads who imposed standard time, and the first place it began was at Grand Central. DANKOSKY: We're going to take some phone calls at 1-800-989-TALK for Sam Roberts. His book is \"Grand Central: How A Train Station Transformed America\" here on SCIENCE FRIDAY. Nick(ph) is in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Hi Nick, go ahead. NICK: Hello. DANKOSKY: Hi. NICK: What I was going to say is with the -where the railroads got their time was from the Alleghany Observatory in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It was one of the second-biggest mirrored telescopes at the time. But he would - refractive telescopes. And they would look at a star and, you know, get the time from that rather than looking at the sun, and then they would - go ahead. DANKOSKY: No, I was just going to say Sam Roberts, is this right? This is where they were getting the time? ROBERTS: That is one of the places they used. But the problem was that cities all over the country used different times. And it was very tough if you were trying to catch a train, if you were transferring from a train that was going to Boston to New York to Washington to somewhere else, because each station would have more than one clock explaining what the time was where you left, where you are now and where you're going, so very difficult when the trains began going longer distances and when telegraph began connecting them to come up with those kind of schedules without a standard version of time. DANKOSKY: I have to ask: What happened to the guy who popularized standard time? ROBERTS: Oh, you don't want to know. Poor Charles Dowd, he got hit by a train, run over by a train in Upstate New York. And as I say in the book, it's been lost to history whether that train was on time or not. DANKOSKY: Oh dear. Let's go to Ken, Ken's calling from Aptos, California. Hi there, Ken, go ahead. KEN: Hello, I'm a pretty consistent listener to SCIENCE FRIDAY. Thank you very much for taking my call. I'm calling specifically with a question about the difference between stations and terminals. I heard you refer to Grand Central Station, and recently I heard a program on KQED, where they said it was specifically a terminal. And then when Penn Station came along, that was a station, and I do not know the difference. So if you could help me out, I'd appreciate it. ROBERTS: I can, indeed. It's one of the many things I learned in doing this book. A terminal is where trains terminate. They end there. They stop there. If they don't stop there, as someone said, there'd be an awful crash. One of the interesting things and innovations at Grand Central is there is a loop that allows the trains to turn around, but that is the end of a line. A station like Penn Station, like Union Station in Washington, is a building through which trains pass on their way somewhere else. But all of the trains, the New York central trains coming into Grand Central terminated there. DANKOSKY: But you make a point early on that you say people do call it Grand Central Station. At the end of the day, people all over the world say Grand Central Station, and it's OK to call it a station, right? ROBERTS: I think it's OK. DANKOSKY: You're (unintelligible). ROBERTS: I give everyone permission. I think that's fine. And one of the fascinating things, John, is that you go anywhere in the world and you say, my God. This place is just like Grand Central Station, and everybody knows what you're talking about. It's hustle. It's bustle. It's frenzy. It's sort of that controlled chaos that we see in Grand Central itself. DANKOSKY: So a lot of our listeners had never been there. Maybe they've seen pictures, but they've not walked through the grand hall. If you walk through and you look up, what do you see? ROBERTS: You see a 25,000-square-foot mistake, in fact. And a commuter noticed this just a couple of days after the terminal opened in 1913, looked up at the celestial ceiling - these constellations painted on the ceiling - and discovered that they were backwards. Exactly why they're backwards is not entirely clear, another thing that's sort of bit lost to history. But it appears that the Columbia University astronomer who provided the sky chart assumed that the painters would hold it above their heads and paint. And in fact, they put it down. So what we have is a celestial heavenly view of the constellations, rather than a realistic view from the ground up. The lesson there is don't use those stars to navigate by. DANKOSKY: As you write, it would be God's view. ROBERTS: It would be God's view. DANKOSKY: Yes, exactly. Let's go to Theresa in Old Greenwich, Connecticut. Hi there, Theresa. You're on SCIENCE FRIDAY. THERESA: Hi. Can you hear me? DANKOSKY: Sure can. What's up? THERESA: Oh, great. I just have a quick question. I feel silly now. I was told that after the renovation, when the ceiling, the beautiful ceiling was all sooty and dirty, that they - that I believe it's the north - near the stairs, in the north part of the terminal, that they left a couple of the bricks dirty and sooty so people could see how dirty it used to be before they renovated it. Is that true? ROBERTS: That is a true story. There's a rectangle of the ceiling that overlaps between the blue ceiling and the darker stone. If you look at the rectangle, it's almost entirely black. Now, that is the before of the - what you see the rest of the ceiling, the after. It's interesting because when the engineers went up and looked at that during the renovation in the 1990s, they assumed that was soot and smoke and cinders from the coal-burning locomotives. It turned out to be tar and nicotine from smokers. Now, someone asked me at a book signing recently, was I aware of just where that rectangle was in terms of the constellations? And I said no, which just goes to show I keep learning new things about Grand Central. It turns out that the rectangle formed by tar and nicotine is next to the constellation Cancer, coincidence or not. DANKOSKY: Coincidence or not, that's pretty - that's a pretty good one. Let's go to one more phone caller, here. Let's go to - oh, Hugh in Oakland, California. Hi, there, Hugh. Go ahead. You're on SCIENCE FRIDAY. HUGH: Thank you. There are so many great things about exploring Grand Central, such as the archway downstairs where you can talk on the one side, and somebody can hear you on the other. And we had a tour before some of the renovations, including the - the installing of the second staircase, which was original - which was not originally built, but the architects who were doing the restoration explained to us - and I wanted to know if Mr. Roberts covered this - that Grand Central was originally built to have a taller building, if not a skyscraper, installed - built above the station itself. I wanted to find out if this is true. And what they explained to us was the large walkway on the side above the - where the - one of the staircases is now, and that you can see on the cover of your book was a spot where people would cross back and forth from staircase to staircase, creating a moving, almost water-like effect in - on the different levels of that window/walkway. DANKOSKY: There's - you've got an awful lot in there. ROBERTS: You've got all that information right. I'll try to remember it. DANKOSKY: And hold on for one second, Sam. I'll just say I'm John Dankosky, and this is SCIENCE FRIDAY, from NPR. Go ahead, Sam. ROBERTS: OK. Yes, those are skyways that marry form and function. They are giant glass windows that serve to let light in, to let air in, and also to serve as corridors between what would have been the four elevator banks of that world's tallest building that was going to be built atop Grand Central. You mentioned the whispering gallery on the lower level, one of those fascinating architectural and engineering gems. No one knows for sure whether Rafael Guastavino, when he built that interlocking tile ceiling, intended to do this. But if you stand in one corner - and you can see people doing it all the time - and whisper into the wall just like this, about 40 feet on the other side of the gallery, the sound travels up a parabolic curve, and you can hear it just perfectly. There's so many other engineering innovations. There are ramps. . . DANKOSKY: I was going to ask you about the ramps. This is amazing. ROBERTS: Yeah. Well, we take ramps for granted. . . DANKOSKY: Of course. ROBERTS: . . . but the ramps were put there so that people would not have to carry luggage up and down stairs. And it was such an innovation at the time, that one magazine harkened back to Julius Caesar and said this is what the Romans used to build out of earthworks when they were storming the walls or the ramparts of an ancient city. They would build ramps like this to go over the walls. And at Grand Central, they became a terrific innovation that saved people lots of breaking backs. DANKOSKY: But it also saved the terminal, in a way, because when it was restored, if we didn't have those ramps in place and you had to retrofit it for Americans with Disabilities compliance, all of a sudden you'd have a completely different building. But because they built the ramps 100 years ago, we never had to tear it down. ROBERTS: Absolutely true. In fact, the caller mentioned the staircase. There were originally two staircases planned in that main concourse. One was never built because the builders said: Who's ever going to go to the East Side of Manhattan? It's, you know, cow pastures, tenements. They built that new staircase during the renovation, and it's almost a twin of the original, except this one has to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act. DANKOSKY: Charles is in Kent, Connecticut. Hi, Charles. CHARLES: Hello. DANKOSKY: Hi. You're on the air. CHARLES: Hi. I was just calling to ask whether or not Mr. Roberts has ever gone to the Hayden Planetarium, where he would find a document called the Uranometria. It's a celestial cartography compilation. And that's where the source material for the terminal ceiling was originally found when my grandfather was just an assistant to the artists that did the ceiling back in 1913. In 1945, when the ceiling was repainted, my grandfather, we have the same name. . . ROBERTS: Yeah. CHARLES: . . . also replicated what was originally there. The Uranometria that was done in 1603 caused a huge uproar because, in fact, all the images were depicted from God's point of view. The source material itself was backwards. DANKOSKY: Well, this is interesting. Have you been there, Sam? I'm sure (unintelligible). ROBERTS: I have indeed, yes. DANKOSKY: Well. . . ROBERTS: The caller is absolutely right. DANKOSKY: Sam Roberts is author of \"Grand Central: How A Train Station Transformed America. \" He's the urban affairs correspondent at The New York Times. Thanks so much for joining me, and thanks for this book. ROBERTS: Thank you. DANKOSKY: Coming up after this break, a little evolution in action, how cliff swallows are adapting to escape traffic and stay alive. That's coming up next. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)DANKOSKY: This is SCIENCE FRIDAY, from NPR. JOHN DANKOSKY, HOST:  This is SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm John Dankosky. Last month New York's Grand Central Terminal celebrated its 100th anniversary, and while you might think of it as just a train station, Grand Central actually pioneered a lot of scientific innovations that spread across the country. Standard time, for example. You probably take today's time zones for granted, but back in the 1800s there more than 50 time zones around the country dictated by the local railroad operators. Grand Central Station led the way in adopting standard time. Then there was the debate over long-distance electric trains and how to power them: direct current or alternating current, another innovation born at Grand Central. How about green lights? Did you know they once meant stop? These are just some of the very surprising facts in the next guest's book, \"Grand Central: How A Train Station Transformed America. \" Sam Roberts is the urban affairs correspondent at the New York Times and author of \"Grand Central. \" He joins us here in our New York studios. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. SAM ROBERTS: Thank you, John. DANKOSKY: There is so much to talk about in this book, about Grand Central, but one of the things that's most fascinating is how they run all these trains all the time. You write that more than 100 years ago, they were running one train every 45 seconds during rush hour. This was way before computers. How did they coordinate all that? ROBERTS: With a lot of people, a lot of people, a lot of manual switches. There were something like over 100 switchmen working in the yards at Grand Central at any given time. Now they've been replaced by fewer than a dozen traffic controllers using computers. But then there were, as you say, about 500 trains maybe on a day running every 45 or so seconds. Now there are as many as 700 days, and in rush hour running about every 30 seconds. And it's really a miracle how well this thing works. DANKOSKY: You know, when Grand Central was built, it wasn't really in the center of anything. We think of it now as the center of Manhattan, but it wasn't really like that at the time. Tell us that story. ROBERTS: Absolutely true. When the original Grand Central opened in 1871, the New York Times said this place is neither grand nor central. What's it doing all the way uptown on East 42nd Street? But what was so fascinating about Grand Central, and you can't say this about the great, late, lamented Penn Station, is Grand Central brought Midtown to its doorstep. It shifted the whole center of gravity of Midtown Manhattan. DANKOSKY: We're talking with Sam Roberts from the New York Times. If you have questions about Grand Central Terminal, yes we'll get to why it's called Grand Central Terminal in a moment, 1-800-989-TALK, that's 1-800-989-8255 as we talk about the 100th anniversary of Grand Central Terminal. So one thing I do need to get from you is: How exactly did you get downtown from Grand Central back in the early days because there weren't trains going everywhere. ROBERTS: Horse. DANKOSKY: Horse-drawn, yeah. ROBERTS: Horse-drawn trolleys, indeed. They kept pushing the ban on coal-burning locomotives farther and farther uptown because they were disruptive, they produced smoke, cinder, soot, and finally they said none south of Grand Central, none south of 42nd Street. So it meant you had to take a horse-drawn carriage down - all the way downtown from there. DANKOSKY: And that soot and smoke and all the problems with the steam train, that's part of the reason why we got the electric railroad in the first place. ROBERTS: That is exactly right. Grand Central, as I say in the book, sort of began by accident or by an accident in 1902. A train coming out of the Park Avenue Tunnel, the engineer just could not see, went through a green light, which meant stop or slow down in those days, crashed into another train. Ultimately about two dozen people were killed. And the railroad was terrified of being held criminally liable when it was obvious that these engineers could not see coming out of the tunnel. And that's when William Wilgus, who was the chief engineer of the New York Central and kind of the hero of this story, said we've got to go to electrification. DANKOSKY: And how long did it take for electrification to get up and running? Because this is a brand new thing. ROBERTS: It was a brand new thing, and people don't realize, but this was early in the 19th century. Electricity was relatively new as a tool for locomotion. Frank Sprague, Edison, Westinghouse were all pioneers in this. They - the accident was 1902. The state legislature said you've got to have electric trains at least running in Manhattan by 1908. And the New York Central came in two years early, actually started the electrification in 1906. DANKOSKY: So this is a science show, and you knew you'd get a question about AC versus DC for powering the trains. So how do we arrive at where we arrived? ROBERTS: Well, you know, I'm still one of those people who thinks the current leaks out of outlets. So, you know, I might not be the best thing to ask. DANKOSKY: I think AC/DC is a rock band. So we're on the same - OK. ROBERTS: That, too. But DC can be transmitted over longer distances, and obviously that turned out to be a big benefit for trains. So you don't need to worry about that so much for a toaster that plugs into a wall, but an electric train definitely. And what was so interesting about it, and I learned doing the book, was that the debate over AC/DC in powering trains was a reprise of the debate that Edison and Westinghouse had had over how to power the electric chair. Edison said oh, you know, this alternating current is really dangerous, it's the best thing to use to kill people. So he surreptitiously powered New York state's electric chair with alternating current, and it worked. I'm not sure how persuasive that was in getting the New York Central Railroad to go with direct current, but it did. (LAUGHTER) DANKOSKY: And of course the trains run on direct current for certain parts of their run, but then once they go to that overhead power, it switches. ROBERTS: Yeah, some of the overhead power, particularly in Connecticut on the New Haven line, switches, yes. DANKOSKY: So I understand from your book that there's actually a button, like a don't press this button kind of button, a red button that you can just press and just take the whole thing right offline. ROBERTS: Well, one of the great things in doing the book was I got to see things in Grand Central that I have never even known existed. There is a basement room 90 feet below the street level where the old transformers used to convert the alternating current into direct current. Now, you know, one of those relic transformers are still there, but now they've been replaced by quietly humming computers. There is a little red button there that if you press, you can shut down the entire railroad. DANKOSKY: One of the most interesting things in this book is how you write about modern time starting at Grand Central. And we don't - we take time for granted. Time is just what it says on the clock, it's what our iPhone tells us it is. It didn't used to be that way. Time was different every place you were, and Grand Central helped to standardize it. ROBERTS: It definitely did. Time was when the sun was directly overhead, and that was noon wherever you happened to be. There was something like 50, and earlier than that even 100, different time zones in the United States, until Charles Dowd, who was a principal at a school that ultimately became Skidmore College Upstate New York, said wait a minute, this is crazy. Let's divide the country into four time zones, 15 degree longitude difference. The sun travels about an hour - travels 15 degrees in about an hour, and the railroads adopted that time in 1883, well ahead of the federal government. It was the railroads who imposed standard time, and the first place it began was at Grand Central. DANKOSKY: We're going to take some phone calls at 1-800-989-TALK for Sam Roberts. His book is \"Grand Central: How A Train Station Transformed America\" here on SCIENCE FRIDAY. Nick(ph) is in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Hi Nick, go ahead. NICK: Hello. DANKOSKY: Hi.

I'm Steve Inskeep. Google's executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, has a follow-up act to his visit to North Korea. Today he is in Myanmar, the country also known as Burma. He spoke of the power of technology and is quoted telling an audience that one mobile phone in one village can record injustices. Schmidt is the first big U. S. tech executive to visit the Southeast Asian nation since it began emerging from decades of isolation. NPR's Jackie Northam reports. JACKIE NORTHAM, BYLINE: Eric Schmidt's visit to Myanmar comes at a time when the country is undergoing dramatic political and economic reforms. Ernie Bower, with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says this presents enormous opportunity for business, particularly in the telecommunications field. ERNIE BOWER: It's very important to understand that this is a relatively large country that's right in the middle of the - it's the bulls-eye of Asian growth for the next probably century. And you just don't find places that don't have telecom systems, don't have infrastructure, don't have IT systems. So this is going to be a very big market over the next couple decades. NORTHAM: Bower says fewer than 10 percent of Myanmar's 60 million people currently have a mobile phone. Myanmar is working to expand and improve Internet and mobile phone networks throughout the country, and is expected to award two telecommunications licenses this year to foreign companies - potentially worth billions of dollars. (SOUNDBITE OF AD)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Droid. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: What could you do with the longest-lasting 4G LTE Smartphone? NORTHAM: Google's Android mobile operating system is already well established in Asia. And Andrew Bartels, an analyst with Forrester, a global research and advisory firm, says along with its Internet service, Google can offer the whole information technology package. Bartels says it helps to have the company's executive chairman make the pitch. He says Schmidt has become something of an ambassador for Google. ANDREW BARTELS: Schmidt has that statesman-like perspective, the ability to go and talk to heads of state or talk with business leaders. And because of his age, his experience has credibility that the younger executives may not have off the bat. NORTHAM: Evan Wilson, a senior research analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, says Schmidt's interest in Myanmar may be philosophical. Wilson says the Google executive is also a member of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. He says Schmidt visited North Korea in January. EVAN WILSON: And I think if you see what Eric Schmidt is trying to do - going into these countries that don't have deep Internet penetration - and that the government of those countries has really kind of held back the citizens from being online, I think that that he's trying to break through. And just to make sure that everybody's online, which could benefit Google and just people in general. NORTHAM: Whatever his reasons, Schmidt's visit to Myanmar doesn't guarantee success. Bower, with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says there is stiff competition for Myanmar's telecommunications market by companies in Norway, Malaysia and Singapore, among others. And Bower says U. S. companies are hobbled by some sanctions still in place against individuals in Myanmar. BOWER: This is a real risk for American companies. There are a list, it's called the Specially Designated Nationals, or the SDN list. And you cannot do business with those people or you're breaking the law. NORTHAM: Bower says the problem is some of those people on the list hold positions in Myanmar's telecommunications sector. Jackie Northam NPR News Washington STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Steve Inskeep. Google's executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, has a follow-up act to his visit to North Korea. Today he is in Myanmar, the country also known as Burma. He spoke of the power of technology and is quoted telling an audience that one mobile phone in one village can record injustices. Schmidt is the first big U. S. tech executive to visit the Southeast Asian nation since it began emerging from decades of isolation. NPR's Jackie Northam reports. JACKIE NORTHAM, BYLINE: Eric Schmidt's visit to Myanmar comes at a time when the country is undergoing dramatic political and economic reforms. Ernie Bower, with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says this presents enormous opportunity for business, particularly in the telecommunications field. ERNIE BOWER: It's very important to understand that this is a relatively large country that's right in the middle of the - it's the bulls-eye of Asian growth for the next probably century. And you just don't find places that don't have telecom systems, don't have infrastructure, don't have IT systems. So this is going to be a very big market over the next couple decades. NORTHAM: Bower says fewer than 10 percent of Myanmar's 60 million people currently have a mobile phone. Myanmar is working to expand and improve Internet and mobile phone networks throughout the country, and is expected to award two telecommunications licenses this year to foreign companies - potentially worth billions of dollars. (SOUNDBITE OF AD) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Droid. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: What could you do with the longest-lasting 4G LTE Smartphone? NORTHAM: Google's Android mobile operating system is already well established in Asia. And Andrew Bartels, an analyst with Forrester, a global research and advisory firm, says along with its Internet service, Google can offer the whole information technology package. Bartels says it helps to have the company's executive chairman make the pitch. He says Schmidt has become something of an ambassador for Google.

And when her youngest was still a toddler, the iPad came out. He was mesmerized and mastered the touch screen with uncanny speed. As Rosin writes, quote, \"It was eerie to see a child still in diapers so competent and intent, as if he were forecasting his own adulthood. \" Which led her to wonder, what could this technology be doing to young children's brains? She set out to explore that question in her latest article for The Atlantic. It's called \"The Touch-Screen Generation. \" Hanna Rosin is with us in the studio to talk about her discovery. Hi, Hanna. HANNA ROSIN: Hi. MARTIN: So outline the dilemma for us. I mean, you want to give your kids the cutting-edge technology, but you don't want their brains to turn to mush. ROSIN: Exactly, and brains turn to mush is exactly how many parents put it. I mean, any parent listening has witnessed that face, you know, that blank face that children have when they're staring at the screen. And it just freaks us out. It's not part of our vision of childhood. MARTIN: So, I'm a new parent and this whole concept of screen time, I'd never even heard that expression. (LAUGHTER)MARTIN: And all of a sudden I'm paranoid. What is too much? ROSIN: Well, I'm trying to take a little bit of the neurosis out of this. . . (LAUGHTER)ROSIN: . . . with my story by talking about some of the latest research that exists out there, about ways of interacting with technology that are pretty great. I mean, we can think about this in our own lives. There are ways that we interact with technology that are cool and teach us new things. And there are other ways that are really entertaining, you know, that's a zone too - not everything we watch on TV or listen to is explicitly educational. And then there is, you know, we're just totally wasting time, spending hours playing games on our cell phones. So I think we have a pretty good calibration for ourselves. And I think maybe we should bring some of that sanity to our children, and not freak out just because they're staring at a screen. MARTIN: So what did you find out? Are there any benefits to screen time? ROSIN: Yeah. For one thing, this brain-turned-to-mush sentence that many parents say, is based on a very outdated notion of what your brain is doing when you're watching TV. It's really, really not true. There's been many, many studies done since the '70s by researchers, showing that children's brains are very, very active when they are watching television. If your brain was turning to mush, you'd be like a zombie staring at the screen. That doesn't happen at all. You're trying to figure things out and taking meaning from the television. MARTIN: What about the content of what young kids, toddlers even, are actually consuming on these screens? I mean, there's this whole trend, right, like Baby Einstein or Teletubbies - kid-centric programming. What's the difference between consuming that and having the TV news on in the background? ROSIN: Important question, there is a concept called video deficit in the research. And the video deficit is this idea that children who are toddlers - you know, three, two, something like that - they actually have a hard time trusting or understanding information that they pick up on the television. They just don't really understand the difference between a person and a person on TV. They think they can go into the television. They just don't quite understand the difference. And so, more recently, researchers have tried to see if they could erase the video deficit, if they could make technology accessible to very young children. Now, how do they do that? Anybody who's maybe watched \"Dora, the Explorer\" or \"Blue's Clues\" is familiar with this concept of the pause. In other words, Blue asks a question and then pauses. And the child answers the question, says: It's over there, it's on the corner. I mean, my kids have done it 100 times. This is like a brilliant innovation in television, and it kind of clued the researchers off to this idea that if you made the TV more interactive, kids could trust it more and understand more of what was going on. So some new researchers looking at apps essentially ran a lot of old studies but they made them interactive. They made the person on a two-way screen interact with the kids, talk to the kids, answer their questions. And that basically erased the video deficit. MARTIN: And that's a good thing. ROSIN: That's a good thing, yes. (LAUGHTER)ROSIN: That's a good thing because right now we're trapped in this weird zone where we give our phones to the kids. It's called the pass-back effect. We passed the phone to the kid, but we don't feel good about it. We feel annoyed about it. The whole attitude we transmit to the children is eww. Like, I'm giving you toxic poison now and I'm going to let you muck about in it for, you know, 20 minutes until I can't stand it anymore. And then I'm going to take it away from you. (LAUGHTER)ROSIN: That's not a good place to land. . . MARTIN: So you're saying free yourself from that guilt. ROSIN: Free yourself from this neurosis and guilt. Technology is with us. Just accept it. The phones are with us. The iPads are with us. Some of them are amazing - they're super cool. MARTIN: So, you also did an interesting experiment with one of your own kids. ROSIN: Yes. MARTIN: You just handed him an iPad. (LAUGHTER)ROSIN: Yes. The most radical person I came across in my research did this with his own seven-year-old child. His philosophy is that we are just technophobes and we should treat technology like anything else. We should treat it like books and games, just throw it in there in the toy basket like everything else and, you know, stop freaking out. So I tried this experiment on my then - he was four when I tried this experiment. And I just put the iPad in the toy basket with everything else. I just did not put any limits on it. I was like sure, play that, play Legos - I don't care, do whatever you want. I just, you know, cut out the disdain. You want to know what I discovered? MARTIN: What did you discover? (LAUGHTER)ROSIN: So what I discovered was for the first week and a half, it couldn't have been more annoying. Like, we'd be getting ready for school and he would be like, give me the iPad, give me the iPad. (LAUGHTER)ROSIN: And, you know, it would be like eight in the morning, I'm trying to get all three kids ready for school, he just wants to play his games. And then, the iPad suddenly - he dropped it on the floor. It fell out of rotation like any other game. I mean, honestly. . . MARTIN: Really? ROSIN: . . . he did not interact with it all that differently than he did with his toy cars. He goes through an intense obsession; lets it go, and then sort of picks it up here and there again. MARTIN: Have you made your peace with this now? ROSIN: Yes, I've totally made my peace with it. My only point is not that I'm an awesome parent. It's just that. . . (LAUGHTER)ROSIN: . . . I started to think a little more creatively about what they could get out of it, instead of doing my instinctive, like eww, get that out of your hands. MARTIN: Hanna Rosin, she writes for The Atlantic. She joined us in our studio in Washington. Hanna, thanks so much. ROSIN: Sure. That was fun.

You've probably heard someone say I'm a slave to my computer or my phone. And we all know what that means, but why are we allowing ourselves to be slaves to the very instruments of technology we've created? Digital culture critic Douglas Rushkoff says it's because we're suffering from what he calls present shock. That's the title of his new book. Present shock is a play on a groundbreaking idea coined by futurist Alvin Toffler. In 1970, Toffler defined future shock as too much change in too short a period of time. Well, Rushkoff says no need to look to the future. Everything is happening now. DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF: Most simply, present shock is the human response to living in a world that's, you know, always on real time and simultaneous. You know, in some ways, it's the impact of living in a digital environment. And in the other ways, it's just really what happens when you stop leaning so forward to the millennium and you finally arrive there. CORNISH: So what does that mean in your everyday life? What does that look like? RUSHKOFF: In my life, it's sort of the experience of being on Facebook and seeing everyone from my past suddenly back in my present, you know, and the inability to distinguish between people who may have been friends of mine in second grade and people who I've met just yesterday and people who are actually significant relationships. You know, that sense, that collapse of my whole life into one moment, where every ping, every vibration of my phone might just pull me out of whatever it is I'm doing into something else that seems somehow more pressing on the moment. CORNISH: And does this contribute to another term in your book - I don't know if you came up with this one - digiphrenia? RUSHKOFF: Yeah, digiphrenia is a fun one. I mean, digiphrenia is really the experience of trying to exist in more than one incarnation of yourself at the same time. You know, there's your Twitter profile, there's your Facebook profile, there's your email inbox, and all of these sort of multiple instances of you are operating simultaneously and in parallel. And that's not a really comfortable position for most human beings. CORNISH: Right, because you're trying to maintain them all, right? You want the best foot forward to each one of these different faces. RUSHKOFF: Right. I mean, and computers are really good at multitasking. They do what's called, you know, parallel processing. They have a whole bunch of tasks, and they just divvy them out to the different parts of their chips and their memory and just go about them. You know, human beings can't really do that. So it's really hard to be in one place while you're also in another place. CORNISH: Now, you say that the very way that we think about time has changed in the digital age. And what exactly did you mean by that? RUSHKOFF: You know, in the industrial age and in analog clocks, a minute is some portion of an hour which is some portion of a day. You know, in the digital age, a minute is just a number. It's just 3:23. It's almost this absolute duration that doesn't have a connection to where the sun is or where our day is. It's this very abstracted way of experiencing time. And what I'm arguing in \"Present Shock\" is that that timelessness is very characteristic of living in the digital age, in the age that we're in. And it's very hard for us to orient ourselves, to look forward to things, to join movements with goals, to invest in the future, to think about our long-term careers, that we're just kind of in this moment of pause. CORNISH: At the same time, isn't this lifestyle addictive, habit-forming? I mean, I don't know if I could not check my phone halfway through dinner. Or, you know, it seems like it's very hard to put this stuff down. RUSHKOFF: Oh, it's definitely hard. I mean, it's - your email inbox is a bit like a Las Vegas roulette machine. You know, you just check it and check it and check it. And every once in a while, there's some juicy little tidbit of reward, like the three quarters that pop down on a one-armed bandit. You know, and then that keeps you coming back for more. But I think what happens is as we get more and more obsessed with those pings, we lose touch with sort of the continuity of life. We forget what it means to really just be there, looking in someone else's eyes, rather than down at our phone while we're at the meal. And I guess a lot of what I'm trying to do with this book is to give people permission to take back their time, you know, and to at least, when they're with other human beings, experience that kind of time as very distinct from the sort of time that they might spend, you know, with their nose buried in a device. CORNISH: But really, I mean, haven't we already gone too far down this path? I mean, it sounds like you're saying something that we've been hearing since the industrial age, which is stop and smell the roses. RUSHKOFF: Well, yes. But it's a different stop and smell the roses, if you will. You know, the industrial age was when everything was about efficiency and time was money. You know, the digital age is actually different where time is no longer about efficiency as much as about sequence. You know, if you think about, you know, the industrial age values were towards progress and goals and winning and end points. You know, the digital age feels much more about kind of steady state problems. It's much more about sustainability. You know, even the kinds of politics we see, you know, are less about a political party winning the day and more about a, you know, a bunch of 20-somethings sitting, occupying a park, not stating any forward-thinking goals at all. CORNISH: That's Douglas Rushkoff. He's the author of \"Present Shock: When Everything Happens Now. \"Douglas Rushkoff, thank you so much for speaking with us. RUSHKOFF: Oh, thanks so much for having me. Thanks for your time.

I mean, it sounds like you're saying something that we've been hearing since the industrial age, which is stop and smell the roses. RUSHKOFF: Well, yes. But it's a different stop and smell the roses, if you will. You know, the industrial age was when everything was about efficiency and time was money. You know, the digital age is actually different where time is no longer about efficiency as much as about sequence. You know, if you think about, you know, the industrial age values were towards progress and goals and winning and end points. You know, the digital age feels much more about kind of steady state problems. It's much more about sustainability. You know, even the kinds of politics we see, you know, are less about a political party winning the day and more about a, you know, a bunch of 20-somethings sitting, occupying a park, not stating any forward-thinking goals at all. CORNISH: That's Douglas Rushkoff. He's the author of \"Present Shock: When Everything Happens Now. \" Douglas Rushkoff, thank you so much for speaking with us.

Some 23,000 professionals, from designers to programmers to producers, are expected to attend. For a sneak peek, NPR's Laura Sydell joins us now from the floor of the conference in San Francisco. Hey there, Laura. LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE: Hello. CORNISH: So let's start with the big announcements. What are gamers getting excited about? SYDELL: Well, there are some big announcements from the big gaming companies. So EA has an invite-only event where it is expected to unveil \"Battlefield 4. \" And Sony's giving a big talk that developers are very excited about attending because it's about making games for its PlayStation 4 console, which is expected out later this year. And it does seem like the number four is kind of big. A lot of repeats. And I think that what's more interesting this year, in many ways, is not the repeats of the old, but what's coming from smaller independent developers. CORNISH: So does this say something about how the gaming world is changing? SYDELL: Yeah. More and more, I think you see games being developed for mobile devices and finding new ways to make money and get both casual and hard-core gamers excited about games on those platforms. And there's a lot of talk here about that. Also, how to make money off of mobile games and how to expand audiences. CORNISH: Expanding audiences, but to where? SYDELL: To people outside the U. S. So there're several panels here about bringing games to developing countries. And in those countries, mobile is going to be the way to reach people. And, of course, as in every industry, there is interest in China and finding ways to make a cross-cultural connection to that huge market. And dealing with China can be culturally and politically complex. American companies deal with everything there from intellectual property theft to China's tendency to favor its own company's. And, you know, this is going to come up on panels here. CORNISH: Before we go, Laura, anything else you expect out of this conference? SYDELL: Well, gamers have a chip on their shoulder here. And there's a lot of people talking about how to make the world see games as a serious art form, with strong narratives and characters, the way film and novels are seen today.

Seventeen-year-old Nick D'Aloisio created his app called Summly when he was only 15. As NPR's Jeff Brady reports, the teen will now go to work for Yahoo. JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: When Yahoo was founded in 1995, Nick D'Aloisio wasn't even born yet. He says he taught himself to program computers using books and video tutorials. In an advertisement for the launch of his application, D'Aloisio says he was looking for a way to skim through the oceans of news articles on the Internet. NICK D'ALOISIO: So I started a company called Summly. You tell it your interests and it shows you summarized content. But instead of just a headline, Summly gives you 400 characters. That's more than a tweet, but less than a full article. BRADY: It's a simple concept, but one that attracted loyal advocates. Speaking on CNN, D'Aloisio says he originally created the app under a different name. D'ALOISIO: So I released a demo of the application when I was 15 years old and it was called Trimit. And I've been told that the investors read about this on a few technology blogs and it was actually featured by Apple as one of their apps of the week. BRADY: D'Aloisio says investors flew to London to meet him and committed $300,000 to the project. In November, Summly launched its iPhone application. The company says a half million people downloaded it in the first month. On Monday, Yahoo announced it was buying Summly. Yahoo will shut down the application and incorporate it into the company's products. D'Aloisio and two of his colleagues will become Yahoo employees. D'ALOISIO: I'll be focusing on other projects kind of on the side as well as completing my A-level exams. BRADY: Those are the tests D'Aloisio will take to get into college. That's right. He's developed a company, attracted investment and sold the whole thing for millions even before entering college. Kara Swisher is executive editor at All Things Digital. She says Yahoo is buying more than D'Aloisio's app. KARA SWISHER: He brings, you know, a great story. If you notice, there are about 20 stories about, you know, Yahoo boy genius kind of thing. He's very good at getting good PR. He's a lovely kid. Very smart. BRADY: Swisher says in Yahoo's announcement, the company focused on that and didn't reveal how much it will pay for Summly. Swisher pressed her industry sources for that information. SWISHER: It was $30 million. It's mostly in cash, 90 percent in cash and 10 percent in stock. BRADY: The positive media coverage comes at a good time for Yahoo. CEO Marissa Mayer was widely criticized recently for a decision to end the practice of employees working at home. Swisher says this narrative plays right into Mayer's effort to transition Yahoo from desktop computers. SWISHER: It sort of gets people thinking about Yahoo as a mobile company, even though they've been really a laggard in that area for many, many years. BRADY: This is the latest in a string of acquisitions Yahoo has announced as Mayer tries to overhaul the company. The news prompted investors to bid up Yahoo's stock a few percent.

Some are even calling it the largest of its kind. As NPR's Martin Kaste reports, the attack's target is an organization called Spamhaus, but the effects have spilled out into the broader Internet. MARTIN KASTE, BYLINE: Spamhaus doesn't send spam. It fights it. It identifies the sources and helps companies filter what gets to your inbox. There are some people out there that don't like Spamhaus and they show their displeasure by attacking its website. That happens all the time, but this month, things got a little more intense. JOHN REID: The traffic that spiked up on Friday, the 15th, it spiked up massively. KASTE: John Reid is a senior investigator with Spamhaus. He says they were under a distributed denial of service attack, a DDoS. Basically, the attacker was trying to overwhelm Spamhaus' website. REID: Because of hundreds of attacks in the past going back many years, we set up some very robust Internet connections. The fact that they managed to flood them and flood them quite quickly, we knew that this attack was fairly large. KASTE: Spamhaus struggled to stay online, even when it got help and extra Internet capacity from other companies. In fact, that help seems to have provoked a bigger attack. There's evidence that other websites started slowing down, too. This is new, says Reid, a DDoS that harms innocent bystanders. REID: The criminals normally don't use it to attack Internet infrastructure because if you bring down the internet, you bring down the very thing they're making their illegal money off on. This case seems to be something a little different and people are taking note. KASTE: This attack exploited a known Achilles' heel in the Internet's architecture, vulnerable DNS servers. Those are the servers that translate Web address into numbers and route you to the place you want to go. The servers can be manipulated into amplifying a DDoS attack. Dan Holden is with the Internet security firm Arbor Networks. He says you trick the DNS servers into bombarding your victim with address help he never asked for. DAN HOLDEN: So if you make that request on someone else's behalf, if you will, those requests are all going to flood back to them at the same time and that is what cause the denial of service. KASTE: But did the attack on Spamhaus really come close to breaking the Internet, as some tech websites put it? Probably not, says Holden, in part because the internet is so decentralized. HOLDEN: The question is, you know, does that level of attack actually affect others on the Internet. It would be more localized to where the attack was actually either originating from or going to. KASTE: So if your Internet connection has seemed slow this week, don't blame the Spamhaus attack. The culprits are probably closer to home. Martin Kaste, NPR News.

Kilimanjaro. Now you can, in a way, anyway. Google is sending its employees up to the world's highest peaks with digital cameras, tripods and fisheye lenses. There they take photos that can be stitched together for a 360-degree view from the top of the mountains. You can't follow their exact path, but you can see the photos all along the way. So far, they've got four of the highest summits - of the seven highest summits, Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, Elbrus in Russia, Aconcagua in Argentina and their base camp at Everest. We're gonna talk to someone who actually made a couple of those tracks, but we want to hear from you. Had seen something cool on a map ever lead you to change your planned route? 1-800-989-8255. The email address is talk@npr. org and you can also join the conversation from our website. Go to npr. org and then click on TALK OF THE NATION. Joining in now is Andrew Swerdlow. He's a privacy engineering manager at Google, and he's been working with a team of people to photograph the world's highest peaks for Google Maps. He's been to Everest and Kilimanjaro, but he's not there now. He's at our bureau in New York. Welcome. ANDREW SWERDLOW: Hello. Hi, Celeste. HEADLEE: So where did this idea come from? I can understand street view. You got to get to the grocery store and movie theaters, right, but Kilimanjaro? SWERDLOW: Sure. So you know, there was a lot of planning that went into this. In general, I just want to point out that all of us on the expeditions did this in our vacation time. So Google didn't actually send us to capture these images. This was all done on our vacation time, because we're a group of passionate people who really wanted to improve the quality of Google Maps and make them more usable, make them more accurate and make them more comprehensive. And what's more comprehensive than shots from the top of Kilimanjaro. HEADLEE: So let me understand what you're saying, Andrew, here. You guys took vacation time. You coordinated it, you went up there, you took these pictures, then you took them back to work and said, hey, we want to add these to Google Maps? TRACY THOMPSON: That's exactly it. So this was all in our vacation time and, you know, we really wanted to do this because we were passionate about not just climbing mountains and things like that, but also sharing our experiences with the rest of the world. I have a sister who's in Toronto.  And when we were kids, we always talked about wanting to go and climb Everest and do that. And you know, life goes on and we get jobs. And she has a small child right now and wasn't able to come on this trip. But I showed her some early photos when we first got back from Everest, and she was really blown away by my, sort of, just regular photos. And then when I sent her to the street view galleries, she was just, you know, she was just shocked and really, really liked it. So she felt. . . HEADLEE: Well, let's talk about that difference here, Andrew, because you know, I've seen pictures that people have taken from the top of Everest or Kilimanjaro. SWERDLOW: Yes. HEADLEE: What makes this different in terms of my viewing? What do I learn from seeing these pictures that I don't - from the ones I've seen before? SWERDLOW: Right. Well, I think that, you know, one of the key things here is with street view, you can really tell a story. So you can go to the space, like Namche Bazaar or the monastery, and you can actually go and point and click and zoom around the different spaces. Now we weren't able to capture the entire route, everyday, of the expedition, but we were able to do is take these highlights and when you go to the street view galleries, you can actually feel like you're there. You can go in different directions. You can look up. You can look down. And that's a really, sort of, immersive comprehensive experience. HEADLEE: To what end - what are you're hoping happens? Do - are you hoping it changes people's behavior or is it just suppose to be something cool to look at? SWERDLOW: Well, I think that, you know, one of the key things here is that we really want Google Maps to be, you know, highly accurate, super comprehensive. And this Kilimanjaro, Everest, Aconcagua, this is just a piece of what's really happening as well. We have other groups that have been to the rainforest in the Amazon, to Antarctic and have done similar types of things. And so, you know, these places exist and people want to see them, and we felt like we could do a good job at providing a very accurate experience for them. HEADLEE: And at least you don't have any privacy concerns up on the top of Everest, right? SWERDLOW: Well, actually, you know, we do, you know, there were other people on the mountain as well and so, you know, we take privacy very seriously. And especially with Street View, we do things like face-blurring to protect users. So. . . HEADLEE: All right. So - we're speaking with Andrew Swerdlow. He's a privacy engineering manager, which is why he's particularly equipped to answer the last question, at Google. He went to Everest and Kilimanjaro, took pictures that's now part of Google Maps, and he's joining us from our bureau in New York. Our question to you out there listening, though, is have you ever seen something cool on a map - any map, doesn't have to be Google - that's led you to change your planned route? The number is 800-989-8255. And right now we have Kevin in Buffalo, New York. What about you, Kevin, have you seen something on a map that made you deviate from your course? KEVIN: Every time I look at a map it's likely that I'm going to see something that I find interesting. And as I was mentioning to your producer, I'll just look at a map, where are we going? OK, let's go off a little - there's a park there. Let's see that or there's something interesting over there. My son goes to school in Southern Ohio, and I live in Buffalo. And one of the things I saw in the map was, hey, that's the Ohio River, the river valley is not far out of my way. So I was driving down alone to go visit him, and I said I'm just going to take a different route. I'm not going to go all the way to Cleveland and take the interstates. I'm going to head south at Ashtabula, pick up the Ohio River, drive down along the Ohio side of it before, you know, looking across at West Virginia just to see what it's like. I'm, you know. . . HEADLEE: I get the sense, Kevin, that you often make a call and say I'm going to be a little late. KEVIN: Oh, yeah. Yeah. (LAUGHTER)KEVIN: I'll tell my wife, you know, I'm just going to go out and drive and get lost and find my way home. SWERDLOW: Kevin is calling from Buffalo, New York. And we want to get your stories too of when you have deviated because of something you've seen on the map. Steven is calling from St. Louis, Missouri. Steven, have you ever seen something on a map that made you take a turn? STEVEN: Well, yes, several times and most of - recently we took a three-week road trip and we - part of it was going to Florida. We were going to go to Disney World and to a wedding in Miami. But we were taking our time. We left with lots of time to get there, and we pretty much went from day to day, you know, where are we going to go tomorrow. And when we got close to Atlanta, the original plan was just like to spend the night there and then move on. But when we got close, Google Maps' attraction said there was a museum of puppetry, which I had no idea existed even and no - certainly no intention when we left St. Louis of going to. And we ended up spending the whole day in Atlanta the next day, you know, after we spent the night there at the museum. We saw a puppet show. We toured the museum. It was a great time. HEADLEE: That's Steven calling from St. Louis, Missouri. I wonder, for you, Andrew Swerdlow of Google, do you have this experience? I mean, it sounds like obviously you had to very carefully plan for Everest. But do you have this experience our listeners are talking about? SWERDLOW: Oh, yeah. I can even give an example on Kilimanjaro. So we were looking at the maps just before we were about to do our summit for Kilimanjaro and, you know, one of the guides had pointed out an alternate route. And so, you know, this seemed really interesting to us. They call it the Western Breach; it's a more complex, complicated route to do. But you know, sort of having that awareness of what the different, you know, what could be around a different corner really excited us, and we were able to sort of adjust our plans before going. And that turned out to be a really amazing experience. So although we didn't use Google Maps to identify that other option, I think just sort of having that knowledge is really powerful and can make good things happen. HEADLEE: Well, I mean although you guys are talking - I mean you work for Google and we're talking about Google Maps, this issue is really about the beauty of a map, right? I mean it's about someone else venturing somewhere and then allowing other people thereby to have access to that thing and encouraging them to explore, in a way. SWERDLOW: That's right. HEADLEE: We have this email here from Sharon in Roanoke, Virginia, who says: My husband and I drove our vintage '73 GMC motor home from Virginia to California last summer - brave, Sharon - driving mostly on the old highways. We took a detour to go through Garden City, Kansas when the map said it had the world's largest hairball. It was pretty amazing. I'm not sure I'd deviate for the largest hairball in the country, but I imagine it's interesting. We want to know what kind of deviation from course you have taken. Give us your stories of looking on a map and changing course at 800-989-8255. But Google Maps - and you guys have gone - you have a Google Street View of the Grand Canyon, the Great Barrier Reef and in Antarctica. Is there a chance that someone could say, well, look at it on Google Maps and say well, I've seen the Grand Canyon, I don't need to go? SWERDLOW: Well, you know, that's an interesting question. I think there are two ways to look at this. One is supposedly you've been to the Grand Canyon and you had just a great experience there and you wanted to remember that experience. Looking back, going through Google Street View, sort of really being in that immersive environment can bring back those great memories. So I think that's one type of benefit here. The other is when we were doing the Everest track, there was a lot of interesting natural phenomenon happening. There was earthquakes. There were crazy storms, bridges washed out, rock slides glaciers, you know, all these different types of things that were happening in the natural environment. And as we were going through, we were capturing all of this Street View imagery. We were thinking to ourselves, you know, this is amazing that we're able to capture this now because if we come back in a year, two years time from now, some of this stuff is going to be different and changed. So being able to capture that piece of time has a lot of value. It has a lot of value from an environmental assessment type of opportunity as well, being able to see how the glaciers are moving, being able to see how the passer travel, things of this nature. So even if you've been there five, 10 years ago, going and taking a look at some of these collections, you might actually learn something new as well about how the environment is changing. HEADLEE: Why can't we see the whole path of the mountain? What would it take for us to see every step? SWERDLOW: That's actually a good question as well. So we used a really standard technology here. We used a standard Canon SLR camera with a fisheye lens and a regular tripod. And the Google Maps team, which have done a phenomenal job, have created this software called Business Photos Program. And it was designed for small businesses to be able to take pictures inside their stores and be able to upload that to Google Maps. And so we were actually using that technology to capture these images, which does take a lot of time. And so, you know, we weren't able to do the entire route. I'd also point out that when you're trying to take these photos at 19,000 feet, in the cold with altitude sickness, your hands are shaky, you have to take off your gloves. And it's a really hard experience to do so. HEADLEE: Oh, excuses, excuses, Andrew, just because you climb (unintelligible). SWERDLOW: Next time we'll do better. (LAUGHTER)HEADLEE: Let's take a call now from George in San Jose, California. George, have you deviated from your course based on what you've in a map? GEORGE: Yes, I made a deviation. I was driving from Sacramento to Reno, and the main road is Interstate 80, which is a eight-lane superhighway where the traffic that goes about 70 miles an hour. And I didn't want to go that fast. I wanted to enjoy the view. And I - so I stop at the town called Forestville. I looked at the map and there was a little kind of a dotted line on the map that showed a way, a parallel to Interstate 80, to the right there. So I decided, oh, I'll take that. I was in the 1978 VW Rabbit. It turned out it was a jeep road, and I had to stop several times to cross streams. . . HEADLEE: Oh, boy. GEORGE: . . . move rocks out of the way, I had to move some tree branches, but eventually I made it. HEADLEE: Yeah. That's something you will never forget either. GEORGE: I'll never forget, and that was a very enjoyable ride, too. HEADLEE: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. Thanks so much for that call. It's George calling from California. So what's next? I mean, maybe you won't go, Andrew, but what's the next place where we need to get a 360 degree view? SWERDLOW: Well, first off, I've run out of vacation times so I probably won't be doing it more, these trips for a little while. But, you know, Google - and the Maps came in specific - really, you know, is pushing towards making their maps accessible and discoverable. And this is - everything from the highest peaks of Everest to the London museums. So, you know, I would say that, as long as there are people with passion that, you know, nothing is off limit. I know that one of my colleagues had even talked about, you know, hopefully going to the moon and, you know, doing some street view on the moon as well. So we'll see if that happens. HEADLEE: Wow. Absolutely. I imagine there's a few who'd volunteer for that trip. Let's take one more caller. We have a couple minutes here, Alice. You're calling from the Big Island in Hawaii. What - when have you deviated from your course? ALICE: Well, I was traveling in the late '70s in the Philippines and everybody had said go to the north, it's safe. You know, that was right after Marcos. And I was in the airlines office looking at their map, and I saw this name, Zamboanga. And it was a name of a town on the southern islands. And everyone said, don't go to the south, it's dangerous. But I had to go just because of the name, Zamboanga. And we arrived in the night, and when I woke up in the morning, we were on the harbor, and it was full of what looked like black pirate ships. It really looked like out of \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" though that wasn't made then. And it was the most wonderful trip, the best people we saw, things never saw anywhere out in the Philippines. HEADLEE: And it's all because you picked it based on the name Zamboanga? (LAUGHTER)ALICE: Zamboanga. Wonderful. HEADLEE: That's Alice - yeah - who lives on the Big Island on Hawaii. So she already lives around some pretty long names. OK. So, Andrew, if you have - if you were the in charge of travel at Google - I'm going to try to put this question to another way. If you could send a team to go get a 360 degree view of something, now, where would you send them? SWERDLOW: That's a great question. You know, there's so many places in the world that, you know, I'd love to be on an expedition or I'd love to see the footage back from. As far as the - as far as sort of - for this collection here, I think completing the rest of the seven summits would be a great challenge. So that includes mountains in Papua New Guinea, back to the Antarctic, and also North America as well. So there are definitely some targets that - if there are willing Googlers to go and spend some vacation time and do that, then, you know, would be awesome. HEADLEE: I'm saying go get a waterproof camera and give me the Great Barrier Reef. How about that, Andrew? SWERDLOW: Let's go together. HEADLEE: OK. (LAUGHTER)HEADLEE: Andrew Swerdlow is a privacy engineering manager at Google. He's been photographing the world's highest peaks, went to two of them, right? Kilimanjaro and Everest? SWERDLOW: That's correct. HEADLEE: For Google Maps. And if someone wants to see the pictures, they go to Google Maps and put in Mount Everest? SWERDLOW: Actually, if you just go to Google and type in street view gallery, you'll find all of the collections there. HEADLEE: OK. Andrew spoke to us from our bureau in New York. Thank you so much for talking to us. SWERDLOW: Thank you, Celeste. HEADLEE: We're going to need wrap up some more - rack up some more vacation time, Andrew. (LAUGHTER)SWERDLOW: Thanks. HEADLEE: Tomorrow, it's TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY, we'll take a look at telling good science stories without stretching the truth. You can join us back here again on Monday. This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. I'm Celeste Headlee in Washington. Happy travels. CELESTE HEADLEE, HOST:  But we're wondering if you'd ever dreamed of seeking the view from the top of Mt. Kilimanjaro. Now you can, in a way, anyway. Google is sending its employees up to the world's highest peaks with digital cameras, tripods and fisheye lenses. There they take photos that can be stitched together for a 360-degree view from the top of the mountains. You can't follow their exact path, but you can see the photos all along the way. So far, they've got four of the highest summits - of the seven highest summits, Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, Elbrus in Russia, Aconcagua in Argentina and their base camp at Everest. We're gonna talk to someone who actually made a couple of those tracks, but we want to hear from you. Had seen something cool on a map ever lead you to change your planned route? 1-800-989-8255. The email address is talk@npr. org and you can also join the conversation from our website. Go to npr. org and then click on TALK OF THE NATION. Joining in now is Andrew Swerdlow. He's a privacy engineering manager at Google, and he's been working with a team of people to photograph the world's highest peaks for Google Maps. He's been to Everest and Kilimanjaro, but he's not there now. He's at our bureau in New York. Welcome. ANDREW SWERDLOW: Hello. Hi, Celeste. HEADLEE: So where did this idea come from? I can understand street view. You got to get to the grocery store and movie theaters, right, but Kilimanjaro? SWERDLOW: Sure. So you know, there was a lot of planning that went into this. In general, I just want to point out that all of us on the expeditions did this in our vacation time. So Google didn't actually send us to capture these images. This was all done on our vacation time, because we're a group of passionate people who really wanted to improve the quality of Google Maps and make them more usable, make them more accurate and make them more comprehensive. And what's more comprehensive than shots from the top of Kilimanjaro. HEADLEE: So let me understand what you're saying, Andrew, here. You guys took vacation time. You coordinated it, you went up there, you took these pictures, then you took them back to work and said, hey, we want to add these to Google Maps? TRACY THOMPSON: That's exactly it. So this was all in our vacation time and, you know, we really wanted to do this because we were passionate about not just climbing mountains and things like that, but also sharing our experiences with the rest of the world. I have a sister who's in Toronto.  And when we were kids, we always talked about wanting to go and climb Everest and do that. And you know, life goes on and we get jobs. And she has a small child right now and wasn't able to come on this trip. But I showed her some early photos when we first got back from Everest, and she was really blown away by my, sort of, just regular photos. And then when I sent her to the street view galleries, she was just, you know, she was just shocked and really, really liked it. So she felt. . . HEADLEE: Well, let's talk about that difference here, Andrew, because you know, I've seen pictures that people have taken from the top of Everest or Kilimanjaro. SWERDLOW: Yes. HEADLEE: What makes this different in terms of my viewing? What do I learn from seeing these pictures that I don't - from the ones I've seen before? SWERDLOW: Right. Well, I think that, you know, one of the key things here is with street view, you can really tell a story. So you can go to the space, like Namche Bazaar or the monastery, and you can actually go and point and click and zoom around the different spaces. Now we weren't able to capture the entire route, everyday, of the expedition, but we were able to do is take these highlights and when you go to the street view galleries, you can actually feel like you're there. You can go in different directions. You can look up. You can look down. And that's a really, sort of, immersive comprehensive experience. HEADLEE: To what end - what are you're hoping happens? Do - are you hoping it changes people's behavior or is it just suppose to be something cool to look at? SWERDLOW: Well, I think that, you know, one of the key things here is that we really want Google Maps to be, you know, highly accurate, super comprehensive. And this Kilimanjaro, Everest, Aconcagua, this is just a piece of what's really happening as well. We have other groups that have been to the rainforest in the Amazon, to Antarctic and have done similar types of things. And so, you know, these places exist and people want to see them, and we felt like we could do a good job at providing a very accurate experience for them. HEADLEE: And at least you don't have any privacy concerns up on the top of Everest, right? SWERDLOW: Well, actually, you know, we do, you know, there were other people on the mountain as well and so, you know, we take privacy very seriously. And especially with Street View, we do things like face-blurring to protect users. So. . . HEADLEE: All right. So - we're speaking with Andrew Swerdlow. He's a privacy engineering manager, which is why he's particularly equipped to answer the last question, at Google. He went to Everest and Kilimanjaro, took pictures that's now part of Google Maps, and he's joining us from our bureau in New York. Our question to you out there listening, though, is have you ever seen something cool on a map - any map, doesn't have to be Google - that's led you to change your planned route? The number is 800-989-8255. And right now we have Kevin in Buffalo, New York. What about you, Kevin, have you seen something on a map that made you deviate from your course? KEVIN: Every time I look at a map it's likely that I'm going to see something that I find interesting. And as I was mentioning to your producer, I'll just look at a map, where are we going? OK, let's go off a little - there's a park there. Let's see that or there's something interesting over there. My son goes to school in Southern Ohio, and I live in Buffalo. And one of the things I saw in the map was, hey, that's the Ohio River, the river valley is not far out of my way. So I was driving down alone to go visit him, and I said I'm just going to take a different route. I'm not going to go all the way to Cleveland and take the interstates. I'm going to head south at Ashtabula, pick up the Ohio River, drive down along the Ohio side of it before, you know, looking across at West Virginia just to see what it's like. I'm, you know. . . HEADLEE: I get the sense, Kevin, that you often make a call and say I'm going to be a little late. KEVIN: Oh, yeah. Yeah. (LAUGHTER) KEVIN: I'll tell my wife, you know, I'm just going to go out and drive and get lost and find my way home. SWERDLOW: Kevin is calling from Buffalo, New York. And we want to get your stories too of when you have deviated because of something you've seen on the map. Steven is calling from St. Louis, Missouri. Steven, have you ever seen something on a map that made you take a turn? STEVEN: Well, yes, several times and most of - recently we took a three-week road trip and we - part of it was going to Florida. We were going to go to Disney World and to a wedding in Miami. But we were taking our time. We left with lots of time to get there, and we pretty much went from day to day, you know, where are we going to go tomorrow. And when we got close to Atlanta, the original plan was just like to spend the night there and then move on. But when we got close, Google Maps' attraction said there was a museum of puppetry, which I had no idea existed even and no - certainly no intention when we left St. Louis of going to. And we ended up spending the whole day in Atlanta the next day, you know, after we spent the night there at the museum. We saw a puppet show. We toured the museum. It was a great time. HEADLEE: That's Steven calling from St. Louis, Missouri. I wonder, for you, Andrew Swerdlow of Google, do you have this experience? I mean, it sounds like obviously you had to very carefully plan for Everest. But do you have this experience our listeners are talking about? SWERDLOW: Oh, yeah. I can even give an example on Kilimanjaro. So we were looking at the maps just before we were about to do our summit for Kilimanjaro and, you know, one of the guides had pointed out an alternate route. And so, you know, this seemed really interesting to us. They call it the Western Breach; it's a more complex, complicated route to do. But you know, sort of having that awareness of what the different, you know, what could be around a different corner really excited us, and we were able to sort of adjust our plans before going. And that turned out to be a really amazing experience. So although we didn't use Google Maps to identify that other option, I think just sort of having that knowledge is really powerful and can make good things happen. HEADLEE: Well, I mean although you guys are talking - I mean you work for Google and we're talking about Google Maps, this issue is really about the beauty of a map, right? I mean it's about someone else venturing somewhere and then allowing other people thereby to have access to that thing and encouraging them to explore, in a way. SWERDLOW: That's right. HEADLEE: We have this email here from Sharon in Roanoke, Virginia, who says: My husband and I drove our vintage '73 GMC motor home from Virginia to California last summer - brave, Sharon - driving mostly on the old highways. We took a detour to go through Garden City, Kansas when the map said it had the world's largest hairball. It was pretty amazing. I'm not sure I'd deviate for the largest hairball in the country, but I imagine it's interesting. We want to know what kind of deviation from course you have taken. Give us your stories of looking on a map and changing course at 800-989-8255. But Google Maps - and you guys have gone - you have a Google Street View of the Grand Canyon, the Great Barrier Reef and in Antarctica. Is there a chance that someone could say, well, look at it on Google Maps and say well, I've seen the Grand Canyon, I don't need to go? SWERDLOW: Well, you know, that's an interesting question. I think there are two ways to look at this. One is supposedly you've been to the Grand Canyon and you had just a great experience there and you wanted to remember that experience. Looking back, going through Google Street View, sort of really being in that immersive environment can bring back those great memories. So I think that's one type of benefit here. The other is when we were doing the Everest track, there was a lot of interesting natural phenomenon happening. There was earthquakes. There were crazy storms, bridges washed out, rock slides glaciers, you know, all these different types of things that were happening in the natural environment. And as we were going through, we were capturing all of this Street View imagery. We were thinking to ourselves, you know, this is amazing that we're able to capture this now because if we come back in a year, two years time from now, some of this stuff is going to be different and changed. So being able to capture that piece of time has a lot of value. It has a lot of value from an environmental assessment type of opportunity as well, being able to see how the glaciers are moving, being able to see how the passer travel, things of this nature. So even if you've been there five, 10 years ago, going and taking a look at some of these collections, you might actually learn something new as well about how the environment is changing. HEADLEE: Why can't we see the whole path of the mountain? What would it take for us to see every step? SWERDLOW: That's actually a good question as well. So we used a really standard technology here. We used a standard Canon SLR camera with a fisheye lens and a regular tripod. And the Google Maps team, which have done a phenomenal job, have created this software called Business Photos Program. And it was designed for small businesses to be able to take pictures inside their stores and be able to upload that to Google Maps. And so we were actually using that technology to capture these images, which does take a lot of time. And so, you know, we weren't able to do the entire route. I'd also point out that when you're trying to take these photos at 19,000 feet, in the cold with altitude sickness, your hands are shaky, you have to take off your gloves. And it's a really hard experience to do so. HEADLEE: Oh, excuses, excuses, Andrew, just because you climb (unintelligible). SWERDLOW: Next time we'll do better. (LAUGHTER) HEADLEE: Let's take a call now from George in San Jose, California. George, have you deviated from your course based on what you've in a map? GEORGE: Yes, I made a deviation. I was driving from Sacramento to Reno, and the main road is Interstate 80, which is a eight-lane superhighway where the traffic that goes about 70 miles an hour. And I didn't want to go that fast. I wanted to enjoy the view. And I - so I stop at the town called Forestville. I looked at the map and there was a little kind of a dotted line on the map that showed a way, a parallel to Interstate 80, to the right there. So I decided, oh, I'll take that. I was in the 1978 VW Rabbit. It turned out it was a jeep road, and I had to stop several times to cross streams. . . HEADLEE: Oh, boy. GEORGE: . . . move rocks out of the way, I had to move some tree branches, but eventually I made it. HEADLEE: Yeah. That's something you will never forget either. GEORGE: I'll never forget, and that was a very enjoyable ride, too. HEADLEE: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. Thanks so much for that call. It's George calling from California. So what's next? I mean, maybe you won't go, Andrew, but what's the next place where we need to get a 360 degree view? SWERDLOW: Well, first off, I've run out of vacation times so I probably won't be doing it more, these trips for a little while. But, you know, Google - and the Maps came in specific - really, you know, is pushing towards making their maps accessible and discoverable. And this is - everything from the highest peaks of Everest to the London museums. So, you know, I would say that, as long as there are people with passion that, you know, nothing is off limit. I know that one of my colleagues had even talked about, you know, hopefully going to the moon and, you know, doing some street view on the moon as well. So we'll see if that happens. HEADLEE: Wow. Absolutely. I imagine there's a few who'd volunteer for that trip. Let's take one more caller. We have a couple minutes here, Alice. You're calling from the Big Island in Hawaii. What - when have you deviated from your course? ALICE: Well, I was traveling in the late '70s in the Philippines and everybody had said go to the north, it's safe. You know, that was right after Marcos. And I was in the airlines office looking at their map, and I saw this name, Zamboanga. And it was a name of a town on the southern islands. And everyone said, don't go to the south, it's dangerous. But I had to go just because of the name, Zamboanga. And we arrived in the night, and when I woke up in the morning, we were on the harbor, and it was full of what looked like black pirate ships. It really looked like out of \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" though that wasn't made then. And it was the most wonderful trip, the best people we saw, things never saw anywhere out in the Philippines. HEADLEE: And it's all because you picked it based on the name Zamboanga? (LAUGHTER) ALICE: Zamboanga. Wonderful. HEADLEE: That's Alice - yeah - who lives on the Big Island on Hawaii. So she already lives around some pretty long names. OK. So, Andrew, if you have - if you were the in charge of travel at Google - I'm going to try to put this question to another way.

This is what more than one million fans across the world heard when they downloaded the premiere episode of season three. They did it illegally the day after it aired and set the dubious record for the most people sharing a single download simultaneously. \"Game of Thrones\" is the HBO fantasy series based on writer George R. R. Martin's epic novel \"A Song of Ice and Fire. \" Last year, the show was named the most illegally downloaded television show on TorrentFreak. That's a blog that reports about the latest trends on file sharing. Here to talk about what all this online piracy means for the future of TV is Graeme McMillan. He's a writer for Wired. com, and he joins us now. Thanks for being with us, Graeme. GRAEME MCMILLAN: Hello there. LYDEN: So many people are crazy for this show. More than a million people downloading it after its premiere this season last Sunday night. That's a lot of dragon eggs, Graeme. MCMILLAN: It's a lot of people who are very interested in seeing it immediately, which is one of the things that people are very focused on in terms of piracy, the seeing it immediately and not waiting for it to air in their particular location. LYDEN: So who are these \"Game of Thrones\" pirates? Where do they live? MCMILLAN: They're international. The majority of people for this particular episode were actually American, which is a first. Previously, they have been predominantly Australian, oddly enough. LYDEN: So I have to pay HBO to watch this show. According to your reports, HBO has been a little bit off topic about all these millions of illegal downloads, yes? MCMILLAN: Traditionally, studios and networks are very much on the line of downloading is bad, illegal piracy is bad, we do not support this at all. HBO has been surprisingly polite, if not kind, about the illegal downloads. You had HBO's programming chief, Michael Lombardo, saying a couple of weeks ago that his bigger concern wasn't the people who were downloading, but that by downloading, they'd get an inferior product. LYDEN: Now, last year, didn't a number of HBO fans say that they wish they could somehow purchase only this show? MCMILLAN: Currently, if you want to stream HBO content online, you have to sign up for the cable channel. There was an online campaign called Take My Money, HBO! that was essentially, we'd love to stream your shows, we'd like to pay for this, but we don't want to sign up for a cable subscription. Can you offer something else? And HBO has teased the option before. They've said, maybe, if we can get the math correct. But they've never really come out and said this is something we're interested in. LYDEN: In their view, would it undercut the programming of other series it was creating? MCMILLAN: Their concern is in order to stay competitive with other streaming services, they would have to have a low price point for streaming, which would undercut the cable subscription. LYDEN: Does all this piracy ultimately hurt the network itself? MCMILLAN: I'm not sure it does. I think it really raises the profile of the show and raises the profile of HBO in general. One of the HBO directors for \"Game of Thrones,\" a guy called David Petrarca, actually said: No, it's great. It really helps the show's cultural buzz, and it does not impact the bottom line because HBO has more than enough money to keep making the show. So what this is is this makes HBO the center of a cultural conversation about illegal downloading, about streaming content, about the production of content and distribution of content, which is probably somewhere they really want to be.

Is that the theme from \"House of Cards? \"SYDELL: Yes, and it's not a pretty sound to many broadcasters because the show, which stars Kevin Spacey, was produced by Netflix, and it was available online only. So people could watch it on TVs with Internet connections or on their tablet computers, et cetera. And there aren't a lot of shows produced that way yet, but that's the way it's going.

There are about five million households that have cut the cord, and there's still 100 million homes that have cable. But Nielsen, last month, just started monitoring the number of people who are starting to watch online. So you can see it's growing. And if you're budget conscious, you know, why pay 100 bucks a month for cable when you can have Netflix and Amazon for 15 bucks a month? CORNISH: But plenty of people still buy cable. What's the deal there? SYDELL: Well, the reason, I think, a lot of people stay is it has sports. So ESPN cannot be found in its entirety online, and then there are still those people who want to watch the latest \"Breaking Bad\" when it first airs over cable.

S. to let more foreign workers with computer skills into the country. It's an immigration issue, but it's not often mentioned in the same breath with immigration concerns of agricultural workers, for instance, in the San Joaquin Valley, a couple of hours drive away. To convince Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform, people from these two walks of life may need to come together. From member station KQED, Aarti Shahani reports it's a divide not easily overcome. AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: Jetlore is a startup in Sunnyvale that uses algorithms to read the slang in Facebook posts and Twitter tweets. Two 28-year-olds founded the company: Montse Medina, a Spaniard, who welcomes me into the office with a popular immigrant greeting. . . MONTSE MEDINA: Would you mind taking off the shoes? We actually have a no-shoe policy. But we do have guest slippers. SHAHANI: . . . and co-founder Eldar Sadikov, a Russian, who introduces me to their workforce. ELDAR SADIKOV: Tudor, who's from Romania here, Ignacio, who's actually an American citizen but his family is from Mexico. SHAHANI: What part of Mexico, Ignacio? IGNACIO: (Unintelligible)SHAHANI: Oh, OK, Michoacan. Medina and Sadikov employ a mini-United Nations. They're award-winning authors in artificial intelligence and Stanford University graduates. Despite their brainpower, Medina and Sadikov are here as temporary guests. They do not have green cards. In that sense, they're like fellow immigrants who prune grapes. But Sadikov rejects that comparison outright. SADIKOV: No, we are not. Obviously, I think I made more impact. I think I did more good things for this country. In a way, I deserve to be here. MANUEL CUNHA: I can take a Silicon Valley Ph. D. or whatever who wouldn't know a thing about how to prune a grapevine. SHAHANI: Manuel Cunha works in the other valley, the San Joaquin Valley, land of grapes, oranges, cotton. Cunha is the director of the Nisei Farmers League and has worked on immigration for decades. Cunha recalls a tense moment in 1996. Agriculture and high-tech both wanted visas. High-tech told Congress their workers are more valuable, and they won lawmakers' support. CUNHA: And from that point on, that has always said to me that they only worry about them, and they don't worry about the rest of the country. SHAHANI: Cunha says unlike past rounds of immigration reform, this one is distinct because it's trying to be, like the name says, comprehensive. That means building coalitions between ministers, police, restaurants, unions, chambers of commerce. When I ask Cunha if that also means he's reaching out to his neighbors in Silicon Valley, he flips the question. CUNHA: Why haven't they come to the San Joaquin Valley? Because they're better than us? PETE MULLER: We haven't really coordinated message because it's a different set of issues. SHAHANI: Intel Corporation's policy director, Peter Muller, says he hasn't met with farmers because he's busy meeting with other tech companies trying to finally form a lobby with an industry that's long resisted politics. Muller recalls his own tense moment in 2012. Intel wanted visas for Indian and Chinese workers. Their bill won by a landslide in the House just to get blocked in the Senate. MULLER: There were some senators who felt that it was not right to just deal with that one small issue and thought that there were bigger issues in the immigration arena that needed to be dealt with. SHAHANI: Muller says if Congress wants a big comprehensive bill, it's on Congress to build the bridges. MULLER: We're focused on the Immigration Innovation Act. And if the pieces of that that are important to us are included in a broader bill that has other things in it, that's something we'll be supportive of. SHAHANI: For weeks, Silicon Valley representative in Congress, Zoe Lofgren, would not grant an interview. But her colleague from Illinois, Congressman Luis Gutierrez, jumped on the phone and recited his message to her constituents. REPRESENTATIVE LUIS GUTIERREZ: I have told them time and time again, until you take the least among you, and she or he gets an opportunity, it's going to be broken for everyone. SHAHANI: Gutierrez did not deliver that message in person during his recent visit to the Bay Area. He met with farm workers, not with techies. And he's counting on the voting power of Latinos to get the tech lobby in line. GUTIERREZ: Particularly from the Latino community, people didn't go and vote on November 6th to give one person a leg up over another. SHAHANI: Arguably, it's the Latino vote that put immigration on the table. And arguably, as Gutierrez notes, it's the tech companies - and the money and jobs they're promising - that'll win over reluctant lawmakers. GUTIERREZ: There will not be a problem with the Congress on the Republican and Democratic side providing tens of thousands of visas for the high-tech industry. SHAHANI: And do you ever get the pushback of: Hey, don't strangle my dreams because you want me as some piece in your chess game? GUTIERREZ: Yeah, I get that. But I have to tell you, we're going to do this for everyone. SHAHANI: To do this for everyone, Silicon Valley and the San Joaquin Valley will have to pool their electoral and economic power. And that might take a conversation. For NPR News, I'm Aarti Shahani in San Francisco. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:   Silicon Valley tech companies have pushed for sometime for the U.

SHAHANI: Muller says if Congress wants a big comprehensive bill, it's on Congress to build the bridges. MULLER: We're focused on the Immigration Innovation Act. And if the pieces of that that are important to us are included in a broader bill that has other things in it, that's something we'll be supportive of. SHAHANI: For weeks, Silicon Valley representative in Congress, Zoe Lofgren, would not grant an interview. But her colleague from Illinois, Congressman Luis Gutierrez, jumped on the phone and recited his message to her constituents. REPRESENTATIVE LUIS GUTIERREZ: I have told them time and time again, until you take the least among you, and she or he gets an opportunity, it's going to be broken for everyone. SHAHANI: Gutierrez did not deliver that message in person during his recent visit to the Bay Area. He met with farm workers, not with techies. And he's counting on the voting power of Latinos to get the tech lobby in line. GUTIERREZ: Particularly from the Latino community, people didn't go and vote on November 6th to give one person a leg up over another. SHAHANI: Arguably, it's the Latino vote that put immigration on the table. And arguably, as Gutierrez notes, it's the tech companies - and the money and jobs they're promising - that'll win over reluctant lawmakers. GUTIERREZ: There will not be a problem with the Congress on the Republican and Democratic side providing tens of thousands of visas for the high-tech industry. SHAHANI: And do you ever get the pushback of: Hey, don't strangle my dreams because you want me as some piece in your chess game? GUTIERREZ: Yeah, I get that. But I have to tell you, we're going to do this for everyone. SHAHANI: To do this for everyone, Silicon Valley and the San Joaquin Valley will have to pool their electoral and economic power. And that might take a conversation. For NPR News, I'm Aarti Shahani in San Francisco.", "section": "Technology", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2013 NPR.  All rights reserved.

We're taking a look at an idea that's getting more popular in this country - car sharing. The basic business model has been around for more than a decade, but new companies and concepts are emerging and expanding. Car2Go is one company that seems to be benefiting from the changing way we use cars. From Seattle, NPR's Wendy Kaufman reports that car sharing could reflect a shift in what cars say about us. WENDY KAUFMAN, BYLINE: David Stewart doesn't own a car. Instead, the managing partner of a small social media company relies on Car2Go for getting around. He picks one up first thing in the morning in his neighborhood, and drives to the local coffeehouse. He works for a couple hours and when he's ready to visit a client, he grabs another, which he finds on an app on his smartphone. DAVID STEWART: And these are the closest Car2Gos. And you see the little Car2Go icon there? There's one right across the street. So I'm just going to tap on that and now it's held for me. KAUFMAN: We walk about 100 feet to the tiny two-passenger SmartCar. STEWART: I'm going to go ahead and swipe my card across the screen. And now it's confirming my account. And you wait until the car's unlocked and now we can get in and start driving. KAUFMAN: The idea is simple. Customers like Stewart take a car when they want it, drive it anywhere within the company's designated area and then just leave it . They might drive three or four different cars in a day but pay only for the time they actually use them - 38 cents a minute or 14 bucks an hour for a longer trip. For Stewart, it all works out to about $150 a month - a fraction of what a car payment plus gas, parking and insurance would be. STEWART: Oh, man. I don't even want to think about that. NICHOLAS COLE: It's truly a flexible, on-demand service for our customers. KAUFMAN: Nicholas Cole heads up North American Operations for Car2Go He says its not just 20 and 30-somethings, or college students who are using the service. So are retirees who've moved into the city and given up an automobile. COLE: Seattle is a great example. I mean, you know, we launched right before Christmas. And, you know, here we are in April with over 18,000 people have signed up. KAUFMAN: Nationwide, they claim about 90,000 members. Across the country, about 10 times that many are using established car sharing services, according to Susan Shaheen an expert in sustainable transportation at the University of California, Berkeley. SUSAN SHAHEEN: What a lot of people are starting to see is the emergence of a lot of different companies and a lot of competition. KAUFMAN: She says Zipcar was the first company to gain attention for renting out cars on a short-term basis. More recently, a company called Drive Now - like Car2Go - offers one way options. And says Shaheen. . . SHAHEEN: Now we see things like peer-to-peer car sharing where you can actually put your own personal vehicle into a car sharing system. KAUFMAN: Shaheen counts 12 personal car sharing companies in North America as of last month. There's no question that economics are driving the car sharing market, but environmental concerns and the adaptation of smartphone technology are factors too. So are cultural changes, says Jeffrey Tumlin of the transportation planning firm Nelson Nygaard. JEFFREY TUMLIN: People of my generation believed that our private automobile said a lot about who were are; that defined our power and our status. The younger generations don't seem to be buying into that anymore and they're seeing automobiles as simply a tool. KAUFMAN: It's hardly surprising then that automakers see car sharing as a potential new market. Daimler-Benz owns Car2Go; BMW's offering is Drive Now. Volkswagen and Ford are exploring this market tooBack in Seattle, David Stewart is about to end his current trip. He breezes into a parking spot, closes the windows and sets the parking brake. STEWART: And it automatically ends the trip if you put the key in the spot. (SOUNDBITE OF A CAR DOOR)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Thank you, and we hope to see you again soon.

It's been two years since Google announced it would build its first fiber optic network there. Residents hoped that by now they'd be using the Internet at super fast speeds, but as we hear from Sylvia Maria Gross of member station KCUR, it's taken a little longer than expected. SYLVIA MARIA GROSS, BYLINE: Startup Village is a little strip of limestone bungalows on Stateline Road, which divides Kansas City, Missouri and Kansas City, Kansas. It's where the gigabit Internet was first turned on last fall. PHIL JAYCOX: Four doors down, there's actually four startups and then two doors down from that, there's commercial buildings with three startups and another startup, Pipeline, moving in this week. GROSS: Programmer Phil Jaycox recently moved here from St. Louis. He's living at the Home for Hackers, which offers three months of rent-free housing to budding Internet entrepreneurs. Jaycox is developing a mapping program for delivery services and he's using the gigabit connection to play around with 3-D imaging. He says, even more than bandwidth, geeks are coming to Kansas City for networking, the people kind. JAYCOX: That I can walk four houses down and bounce an idea off of four different companies and they can be like, hey, that's a good idea or, hey, that's terrible, or you should quit - that's what's cool about it. GROSS: Some of the techies who did a stint at the Home have decided to stay in Kansas City. One has even moved his business team here from Boston. But so far, only 3 or 4,000 people are connected and it's taken about a year longer than expected to get it up and running. Meanwhile, Kansas Cityans have been brainstorming the possibilities of a new information infrastructure. Aaron Deacon is managing director of a new organization called KC Digital Drive. AARON DEACON: There is part of the project that is: what specific kind of cool things can I do with having Google Fiber in a building. But there's still the broader project and the much larger project of what are the systematic changes that we need to effect in order to really use this. GROSS: Local governments and businesses are trying to figure out how the new technology could transform sectors like education, health care and the arts. Deacon says it's not really about the technology, but defining goals for the future. DEACON: Having the technology in place forces people to really focus and sort of like recalibrate and say, like, oh, OK, the future is a little bit closer than maybe we thought it was and so we really need to accelerate and think about how to approach these challenges in a smart way. GROSS: Deacon says Google Fiber has attracted funding for business incubators and other digital ventures like Code for America, which helps local governments engage with citizens online. One way Google Fiber is already making a difference is in the marketplace. Other cable operators are offering all sorts of deals for conventional broadband, and Google Fiber is pricey, $70 a month or 120 if you include Google TV. MICHAEL LIIMATTA: The city is going to become one of the most wired cities in America and we just don't want to see tens of thousands of families left out with no connection at all. GROSS: Michael Liimatta heads the nonprofit Connecting For Good, aimed at bridging the digital divide. He's disappointed that Google Fiber is only coming to neighborhoods where enough residents sign up, leaving out the poorest communities. Originally, Google had said it would help bring its high speed Internet to those who don't have access. Still, Liimatta credits Google with starting the conversation. LIIMATTA: Even if Google is not necessarily the vehicle for achieving a lot of this stuff, they certainly are to be praised for at least getting us on a track where we're thinking about this.

These days, if it's difficult to find a producer to fund your latest film, a lot of artists turn to crowd-sourcing sites, like Kickstarter, for money. But here's a new twist. NPR's Laura Sydell reports on a project that's crowd-sourcing for artistic inspiration. LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE: Directors get a lot of credit for great films. Hitchcock, Goddard, Scorsese, Bigelow are auteurs - creative visionaries. On that list some might include Ron Howard the Academy Award-winning director of films such as \"Apollo 13. \"(SOUNDBITE OF MOVIE, \"APOLLO 13\")SYDELL: Howard sees his films as the work of many, many creative people. RON HOWARD: Any film that I've ever done - as much as I like to put my stamp on I, take command of it - it's still influenced by so many collaborators. SYDELL: From screenwriters, cinematographers, designers and other creative professionals. But Howard says now he also finds ideas on the Internet, doing searches of history sites or watching home videos made in places he's never been. HOWARD: People are far more creative than perhaps they give themselves credit for. And when they're willing to put themselves up front and center and share their creativity, it's stimulating. It's exciting for them and it can stimulate others and their imagination. SYDELL: So, when Canon, the camera and film equipment maker, approached Howard about heading up a project that tapped the public for creativity, he said yes.  It's called Project Imagination. The idea is to get people to contribute photos that will be used as the inspiration for five short films. Howard asked for 10 kinds of photos based on the essential elements of a narrative - stuff like mood, setting, obstacle, character. HOWARD: It was interesting to take those ideas, which are a little on the abstract side, and see how people would apply images to those words. SYDELL: Howard and his staff whittled down the entries and then a group of directors whittled them down further. All the directors were chosen by Howard and they're first timers - among them actors Jamie Foxx and Eva Longoria. Also Biz Stone, known more for being the co-founder of Twitter, than an artist. BIZ STONE: Cut. SYDELL: Today, Stone's on the set at a ranch in Los Angeles trying to shoot his film. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: The battery died on that so we might not have that take. STONE: Aw. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: It's really hard with the wind. SYDELL: Stone's got a crew of professionals around him to help and Ron Howard is mentoring him. Before the shooting began, Stone locked himself away with the 10 photos and used them as touch points for the screenplay he wrote; each photo is connected to the plot. Among the pictures is a sad old man on a bench looking at the ground and a close up shot of an ant. STONE: And I imagine that he might be looking at that ant and empathizing with this ant that looks lost and meandering without purpose. SYDELL: Stone imagined the old man was sad because his wife killed herself by drowning. One of the other photos is a fully dressed woman under water. He used the photos taken by people he's never met to come up with a story of a family pulled apart by a suicide. Stone feels like the method he's using to make this film fits in with the ways he hoped social media would change the world.  For example, he thinks photo sharing sites, are proving that you don't have to be a professional to be an artist. STONE: I think there's a lot of things we think are new that have always been happening - and it's just we know about them now. SYDELL: Stone and other social media entrepreneurs are also a threat to the traditional Hollywood model. Nick Childs, a filmmaker and creative director at Fleischman-Hillard, thinks audiences are no longer content to sit around waiting for the next movie by their favorite director with their favorite star.  He says there's a lot of pressure to involve audiences but it can go too far. NICK CHILDS: Where suddenly you're pleasing so many different people, or there's so many pieces trying to be told, that you're not doing the work that a movie needs, which is a discrete viewpoint - making decisions to do this, not that, not everything for everyone. SYDELL: Childs has seen a few successful projects, such as one by the Academy Award-winning director Kevin Macdonald, which pulled together videos taken on one day by different people around the world. The 90 minute documentary \"A Life In A Day\" got nearly 34 million views on YouTube. Director Ron Howard says he's been amazed at the creativity being unleashed online - from everyone from the home repair wizard - to the young comedian.  He thinks Hollywood can't ignore it. HOWARD: I think it's an absolute movement, and I think the people who don't embrace it are, kind of, not paying attention. Because when you look at the Internet and you look at the democratization of creativity - look whatpeople are capable of creating. SYDELL: The five films overseen by Howard will be shown during a film festival in October. For now Biz Stone is back in Silicon Valley where he says he finds programmers a lot easier to work with than actors because they're more predictable. Laura Sydell, NPR News.

I'm Audie Cornish. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: And I'm Melissa Block. In the age of 140 characters or less, fear has been growing among journalists and many readers that long-form storytelling may be lost. People typically sort long-form journalism into two categories. There's investigative or watchdog reporting, and then there's the kind we're going to talk about now - richly textured, nonfiction narratives that delve deeply into the human experience, and may have nothing to do with the day's headlines. As NPR's David Folkenflik reports, far from being lost, these long-form stories are starting to crop up in new and sometimes surprising places. DAVID FOLKENFLIK: As a youngster, Jacqui Banaszynski always knew where to turn for a good read. JACQUI BANASZYNSKI: Magazines, of course, have always been a home for that and especially the big-name magazines - Esquire, Sports Illustrated. A lot of the stuff I learned when I was younger, and trying to figure this out, was by reading Sports Illustrated. But I would be reading not about a sport, but about the people in the sport. Playboy did this stuff back in the day - ooh. FOLKENFLIK: Banaszynski became a newspaper reporter and editor herself, a Pulitzer winner. She says in their heyday, the nation's great newspapers published such work routinely, and not just at The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. BANASZYNSKI: The Philadelphia Inquirer, in my mind, was the gold standard. It was the one we looked to. The Miami Herald, the Detroit Free Press had some amazing writers. FOLKENFLIK: But it's expensive to tie up reporters on intensive projects, and newspaper budgets are tight. Banaszynski is now a professor at the University of Missouri Journalism School. BANASZYNSKI: When you have 30, 40, 50, 60 percent fewer reporters, and when the reporters that you have left are so busy chasing info bits online, you're not going to have as much time for this kind of work. FOLKENFLIK: Prestige magazines are thinner than they used to be, yet readers are stumbling across some intense reads in unexpected spots. On SB Nation, readers can find passionate postings as well as analyses of a lot of those info bits when it comes to professional and collegiate sports. It is a network of more than 300 fan-driven blogs. Glen Stout describes SB Nation as. . . GLEN STOUT: A place that quite frankly, a little over six months ago did not really exist as a place for work of that quality. FOLKENFLIK: Late last year, SB Nation hired Stout to commission and edit long-form pieces for the site. For more than two decades, he has been the series editor of the annual book \"Best American Sportswriting. \" Now, SB Nation posts two to four such deep dives a week, often multimedia efforts; including a look at how a pair of brothers from Seattle built an empire based on posters of sports stars.

FOLKENFLIK: And the suicide of a former University of Maryland men's basketball player, who made one of the most famous shots in the school's history. (SOUNDBITE OF SB NATION VIDEO)(CHEERS FROM CROWD)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER: Yes, it's good! It's good! STOUT: I want stories that once I read them once, I want to read them a second time. FOLKENFLIK: Again, Glen Stout. STOUT: Readers are hungry for really good work. And more and more - they are more and more likely to go looking for that work online; for something they can read on their tablet, or read on their phone. FOLKENFLIK: SB Nation is owned by Vox Media, which also created The Verge, a site covering digital culture; and Polygon, a gamer review and news site. Jim Bankoff is CEO of Vox, and he hired Stout. JIM BANKOFF: We looked around the Web, and we realized that there was a race to the bottom, if you will, with a lot of content. FOLKENFLIK: Bankoff says many online aggregators focus on lists and photo galleries, to the exclusion of reported pieces. BANKOFF: Part of why Web content became shorter and less substantive was that publishers believed in order to have a successful digital business model, they had to produce things as quickly and as cheaply as possible. FOLKENFLIK: Bankoff says he decided to dart in the opposite direction, at SB Nation. BANKOFF: What we found at Vox is that long-form stories are incredibly attractive to advertisers. People are spending a lot of time with them. I think, on average, it's about 17 minutes in our case, but it's sometimes much longer than that. And with such a glut - and such a sea of stuff on the Web that is often not substantive - often is quick listicles(ph) or even worse - we find that advertisers are flocking to quality and trying to get it where they can. FOLKENFLIK: Vox is not the only new media publisher betting long. The viral website BuzzFeed, which posts adorable animal and baby pictures by the cartload, also publishes many lengthy and original political pieces. In one, the reporter McKay Coppins wrote about his experience as a Mormon, covering the nation's first Mormon major-party presidential nominee. Reuters and Bloomberg News have beefed up their enterprise reporting and hired many experienced newspaper reporters. Some not-for-profit news sites have surfaced as well. None of this activity fully replaces the watchdog reporting that was lost at state capitals and city halls throughout the country, due to the hollowing out of major metropolitan newspapers. But Jacqui Banaszynski sees some hope for the textured reporting in deep dives, to which she has dedicated her career. BANASZYNSKI: When I go online, there's all of these little pockets of passion that have sprung up, that are creating homes for it that never used to exist - or at least were harder to find.

Although some of the information shared on Twitter proved correct, much of the unverified reports were false, including a report about a third explosion at the JFK Library and another about law enforcements officials shutting down cell service in Boston. Gathering information on social media can be very tricky for news outlets, so if you work in the media, how do you separate fact from fiction? Our number is 800-989-8255. Our email address is talk@npr. org. And you can also join the conversation at our website. Go to npr. org and then click on TALK OF THE NATION. Joining us now is Jeremy Stahl. We quoted him a moment ago. He's Slate's social media editor and he joins us from the Slate studio in Washington, D. C. Welcome, Jeremy. JEREMY STAHL: Hi, Celeste. Thanks for having me on. HEADLEE: So, through your job, you control Slate's official Twitter account. Walk us through your decision making in the minutes following the explosion because there were - I was watching Twitter there immediately photographs and eyewitness tweets coming out from Boston. What did you do? STAHL: The first thing I did was to shut off our automated Twitter feed, and that's something that a lot of news outlets have which is that they schedule tweets in advance to go out and I think as a social media. . . HEADLEE: Things like promotional things. STAHL: Not even promotional things. Just standard content like we - I saw the news maybe 10 or 15 minutes after it broke actually, so I was a little bit behind in shutting off the feed. And in the midst of the breaking news, a Slate tweet went out linking to our weekly Dear Prudence advice columnist. And, you know, in the middle of something like that, a regularly scheduled tweet can appear to be not only, you know, it makes you look like you're out of the news but it also can make you look callous if you're not tweeting something that is sensitive to very sensitive events. So that's the first thing I did. HEADLEE: But the next thing you do is probably to read all these tweets, these reports coming out, there were eyewitnesses talking about what they've seen. There were people tweeting and posting videos and photographs. What sources did you turn to? How did you try - how were you able to figure out what was reliable, what was credible and what was not? STAHL: That's right. In the moments after I found out and after making that initial turning off of the scheduled feed, I had to sift through just dozens and dozens and dozens of tweets because everybody was obviously discussing the same thing at the same time. So it's very difficult to work through all that noise and what I did was I looked to a list I have of Slate staff and usually I know that they are going to be tweeting reliable information. So I immediately looked them, saw the most reliable information I could get from them and then I started gathering local sources in addition to looking at already a set stream of national sources that I got - that I have already set up. So I started following Boston. com, for example. I started following he Boston Globe. I started following the Boston PD, and immediately they were providing, I think, the most reliable and the quickest information, eyewitness accounts, videos, photos. Everything was there instantly and it was all at my disposal and my job was to curate it as best I could. But again, there - as you mentioned, there are pitfalls in doing that, obviously, and those pitfalls lie in speculation, which is usually rampant in things like this. And this was the case before Twitter even existed, obviously. Anytime there's a breaking news event, there will be initial early reports that will then be proven false. And identifying those and trying to weed those out are - is generally the toughest thing to do. But I find if you source things accurately and rely on the most reputable nationwide and local media, then you're going to do a decent enough job of avoiding the speculation. But even then, avoiding all speculation is very, very difficult when you're on Twitter. HEADLEE: Well - and yeah, since you mentioned it, even from credible sources, we did have law enforcement officials who repeated information they thought was true at the time. There were various reports about an explosion at the JFK Presidential Library, which were confirmed by reliable sources. There were some sources that were saying there were 12 people who died. There were reports of other unexploded devices that were dismantled by law enforcement and reports about a Saudi suspect that turned out to be erroneous. What happens when credible sources get it wrong? Then what? STAHL: I think, then, you want to correct the record as quickly as possible. And I think it's impossible to get everything correct. I admit that I, you know, from the official Slate account, tweeted out some of those reports, because they came from very credible sources, as you mentioned - not just credible news sources, but credible official sources. That JFK Library tidbit came from the Boston Police Department's official Twitter feed, I believe. And then there was another erroneous report from the Associated Press that the Boston Police had shut off all cell phones because they were worried about local detonation, and we even reported that in one of our blog posts. And lots of media outlets before that because, you know, it was the AP. So it was seen as an official source. The important thing, I think, is to - as soon as you know something that you sent out is incorrect, you correct the record. And it's OK, I think, to make mistakes in these circumstances. You - everyone will make mistakes, and it's kind of almost impossible to avoid them. HEADLEE: Let me just pass on an email we just got from Kate in Oregon, who says: I comb through social media info on breaking stories by following multiple sources. If something is misinformation, even when it's widespread, the cue so far is that the information is the same on all channels. That means it's one source. If it doesn't expand, there's nothing to support it. Is that true, Jeremy? STAHL: That's an absolutely great point. A perfect example of this was yesterday, when every major media outlet and the official police press conferences and official sources were citing the number of deceased as two, and then three. Later on, it was up to three. But The New York Post was running alone with a story that 12 people had been killed in the attacks. And they were running with a banner headline, and it was high on their site for much of the day with that number, and they were citing law enforcement officials, unnamed law enforcement officials. And, again, the best thing to do, as your emailer said, was to look at what other sources are saying and compare them and look at the questionable report's sourcing, as well. HEADLEE: We're talking with Jeremy Stahl, who's Slate's social media editor, about how to sift through the information, all the information comes out after an event like the Boston Marathon explosions. And our question for you out there who work in media is how you separate fact from fiction. Our number is 800-989-8255. Dorothy is with us from Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Dorothy, how do you sift through? I assume you work in media. DOROTHY: Yes, I do. I'm with a small town newspaper. And what I do is exactly what Slate did. I shut down the Twitter feed. I go with one source, though, and that is my AP wire. And, yeah, I did get that cell phone report that you were talking about, which, yes, was highly erroneous, because I was able to get in touch with the Baton Rouge running team, and we were able to discern that all runners from the Baton Rouge area were, in fact, all right, and, you know, things like that. And I also go to my rolodex, because around here, somebody always knows somebody else who knows something, and that's a benefit. That is a huge benefit. HEADLEE: Go straight to the source. Thank you so much. That's Dorothy in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Jeremy, I wonder - right now, we're talking about facts and factual accuracies. But I wonder what you think about tone and getting the tone correct, because, you know, Slate has personality. It can be humorous and wry at times. How do you change that when a tragedy like this occurs? What do you do? STAHL: I think when something like this happens, a switch goes off in everybody's head in an instant whether or not you're a journalist, and you just immediately turn off any, you know, wryness that might - you might associate with your personal voice or the voice of your news organization. And you adopt as serious a tone as the occasion merits. And some people don't do that. Some people find it difficult, I guess, and still make jokes about things and still, you know, snark a bit, I guess I should say. And I think the important thing for everyone, journalists and non-journalists included, is to just consider the tact that these situations merit - especially journalists, obviously. HEADLEE: You know, I wonder if you - you're thinking back to your coverage. And it hasn't been that long since it occurred, sadly. But I'm wondering what you would done differently if could. I mean, obviously, you've mentioned not letting the Dear Prudence thing go out, and maybe not tweeting the thing from the AP, though I don't know how you could avoided that. Is there anything else you would have changed? STAHL: We did retweet that New York Post - somebody tweeting that New York Post headline. We tweeted it as a report that the New York Post was saying - and we mentioned the fact that it was the New York Post saying this, a single source. But I would have been more skeptical with that, and I will specifically underline the fact that it was a single source that was saying this. I actually was on the news desk at the time of the Newtown shootings, as well. And I made a - what I consider to be a very significant and regrettable error that was - I would definitely take back in a second if I could, which was CNN was reporting that the shooter was - the shooter had been identified as Ryan Lanza. And after the fact, obviously, it turned out that Ryan Lanza was not the shooter. . . HEADLEE: His brother. STAHL: . . . but it was his brother, Adam Lanza. Exactly. But we ran with that report on the site Twitter feed, and we pointed to Ryan Lanza's Facebook page. And pointing to social media of suspects in major crimes like this is something that's going to be happening more and more, and it's very tricky, unexplored territory. But I would definitely be more cautious about that in the future. HEADLEE: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News. We have this tweet out from Derby(ph): Old school rule, confirm with two independent sources. Used Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn to find and contact Iowa runners in Boston yesterday, which is how this particular media person verified their facts, I guess. One of the last things you write in the piece that you wrote about this for Slate was don't retweet trolls. And this came up quite a bit, where people kept saying, stop trying to score political points - not necessarily all of us people were trolls. I don't want to imply that. But where do you draw the line between someone who's having an honest reaction to an event, and someone who is, as you say, either trying to score a point inappropriately, or is a troll? STAHL: For the trolls, I would say that it's pretty obvious to identify public figures who are - whose main role is to be, say, a shock jock, or something like that. And those shock jocks are going to say shocking, sometimes awful things in the media aftermath of an event, because that's just what they do. And I think right after something like yesterday happens, you want to avoid drawing attention to those people and do your best to draw attention to what facts you can find. In terms of political point-scoring, I think, you know, you just you - I avoid. . . HEADLEE: Avoid. STAHL: Yeah. That is a tough one. I would avoid pointing it out, I guess, because for the same reason that you would avoid pointing out the trolls. But, I mean, you want to avoid doing it altogether. You don't want to be the person who's making a point about the abortion debate or ATF nominees, which two people at major national newspapers did yesterday, connecting them to the horrific events that were unfolding. HEADLEE: We have a response here from Paul in Fort Collins, Colorado. Paul, how do you sift through what's real or not? (SOUNDBITE OF STATIC)PAUL: Well, a lot of times what we do is use Twitter to get pictures. For example, from the Aurora shooting, we wanted legitimate pictures as fast as we can get them, and Twitter was probably the fastest way to find the actual pictures from the spot that it was taken. HEADLEE: You worked for a paper in Colorado? PAUL: No. I work for a radio and Internet company, so I'm a morning show host on a music station with the Internet site that handles a little bit of news, mostly entertainment, but a lot of content. So anything that's happening in the area, we cover. HEADLEE: OK. And thank you so much for your call, Paul. But this is something I want to bring to you, Jeremy, because when you're pulling a photo off of Twitter, that has its own dangers, as well. There was a lot of reaction to some of the very graphic photos that people pulled from their Twitter feeds. STAHL: Absolutely. It's very tricky, and it's very difficult, and you want to, I think, know when something is going to be graphic. You want to say that upfront, and you don't want to go overboard in sharing those kinds of images because I'm not really sure of the news value in just sharing horrific image after horrific image. On-the-scene photos are a different story, obviously, and the caller was absolutely right, that that's - that Twitter is a great resource. That's another one, though, where you have to be careful. You need to trust, but verify. . . HEADLEE: Trust, but verify. What you're talking about, Jeremy, is the beauty of having editors, which I fully support. (LAUGHTER)HEADLEE: Jeremy Stahl is Slate's social media editor. He joined us from the Slate studio in Washington, D. C. Thank you so much. STAHL: Thank you very much, Celeste. HEADLEE: You can find a link to Jeremy's article at our website. Tomorrow, we're going to take a look at how the tragedy in Boston is affecting public safety plans in other cities around the globe.

There were various reports about an explosion at the JFK Presidential Library, which were confirmed by reliable sources. There were some sources that were saying there were 12 people who died. There were reports of other unexploded devices that were dismantled by law enforcement and reports about a Saudi suspect that turned out to be erroneous. What happens when credible sources get it wrong? Then what? STAHL: I think, then, you want to correct the record as quickly as possible. And I think it's impossible to get everything correct. I admit that I, you know, from the official Slate account, tweeted out some of those reports, because they came from very credible sources, as you mentioned - not just credible news sources, but credible official sources. That JFK Library tidbit came from the Boston Police Department's official Twitter feed, I believe. And then there was another erroneous report from the Associated Press that the Boston Police had shut off all cell phones because they were worried about local detonation, and we even reported that in one of our blog posts. And lots of media outlets before that because, you know, it was the AP. So it was seen as an official source. The important thing, I think, is to - as soon as you know something that you sent out is incorrect, you correct the record. And it's OK, I think, to make mistakes in these circumstances. You - everyone will make mistakes, and it's kind of almost impossible to avoid them. HEADLEE: Let me just pass on an email we just got from Kate in Oregon, who says: I comb through social media info on breaking stories by following multiple sources. If something is misinformation, even when it's widespread, the cue so far is that the information is the same on all channels. That means it's one source. If it doesn't expand, there's nothing to support it. Is that true, Jeremy? STAHL: That's an absolutely great point. A perfect example of this was yesterday, when every major media outlet and the official police press conferences and official sources were citing the number of deceased as two, and then three. Later on, it was up to three. But The New York Post was running alone with a story that 12 people had been killed in the attacks. And they were running with a banner headline, and it was high on their site for much of the day with that number, and they were citing law enforcement officials, unnamed law enforcement officials. And, again, the best thing to do, as your emailer said, was to look at what other sources are saying and compare them and look at the questionable report's sourcing, as well. HEADLEE: We're talking with Jeremy Stahl, who's Slate's social media editor, about how to sift through the information, all the information comes out after an event like the Boston Marathon explosions. And our question for you out there who work in media is how you separate fact from fiction. Our number is 800-989-8255. Dorothy is with us from Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Dorothy, how do you sift through? I assume you work in media. DOROTHY: Yes, I do. I'm with a small town newspaper. And what I do is exactly what Slate did. I shut down the Twitter feed. I go with one source, though, and that is my AP wire. And, yeah, I did get that cell phone report that you were talking about, which, yes, was highly erroneous, because I was able to get in touch with the Baton Rouge running team, and we were able to discern that all runners from the Baton Rouge area were, in fact, all right, and, you know, things like that. And I also go to my rolodex, because around here, somebody always knows somebody else who knows something, and that's a benefit. That is a huge benefit. HEADLEE: Go straight to the source. Thank you so much. That's Dorothy in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Jeremy, I wonder - right now, we're talking about facts and factual accuracies. But I wonder what you think about tone and getting the tone correct, because, you know, Slate has personality. It can be humorous and wry at times. How do you change that when a tragedy like this occurs? What do you do? STAHL: I think when something like this happens, a switch goes off in everybody's head in an instant whether or not you're a journalist, and you just immediately turn off any, you know, wryness that might - you might associate with your personal voice or the voice of your news organization. And you adopt as serious a tone as the occasion merits. And some people don't do that. Some people find it difficult, I guess, and still make jokes about things and still, you know, snark a bit, I guess I should say. And I think the important thing for everyone, journalists and non-journalists included, is to just consider the tact that these situations merit - especially journalists, obviously. HEADLEE: You know, I wonder if you - you're thinking back to your coverage. And it hasn't been that long since it occurred, sadly. But I'm wondering what you would done differently if could. I mean, obviously, you've mentioned not letting the Dear Prudence thing go out, and maybe not tweeting the thing from the AP, though I don't know how you could avoided that. Is there anything else you would have changed? STAHL: We did retweet that New York Post - somebody tweeting that New York Post headline. We tweeted it as a report that the New York Post was saying - and we mentioned the fact that it was the New York Post saying this, a single source. But I would have been more skeptical with that, and I will specifically underline the fact that it was a single source that was saying this. I actually was on the news desk at the time of the Newtown shootings, as well. And I made a - what I consider to be a very significant and regrettable error that was - I would definitely take back in a second if I could, which was CNN was reporting that the shooter was - the shooter had been identified as Ryan Lanza. And after the fact, obviously, it turned out that Ryan Lanza was not the shooter. . . HEADLEE: His brother. STAHL: . . . but it was his brother, Adam Lanza. Exactly. But we ran with that report on the site Twitter feed, and we pointed to Ryan Lanza's Facebook page. And pointing to social media of suspects in major crimes like this is something that's going to be happening more and more, and it's very tricky, unexplored territory. But I would definitely be more cautious about that in the future. HEADLEE: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News. We have this tweet out from Derby(ph): Old school rule, confirm with two independent sources. Used Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn to find and contact Iowa runners in Boston yesterday, which is how this particular media person verified their facts, I guess. One of the last things you write in the piece that you wrote about this for Slate was don't retweet trolls. And this came up quite a bit, where people kept saying, stop trying to score political points - not necessarily all of us people were trolls. I don't want to imply that. But where do you draw the line between someone who's having an honest reaction to an event, and someone who is, as you say, either trying to score a point inappropriately, or is a troll? STAHL: For the trolls, I would say that it's pretty obvious to identify public figures who are - whose main role is to be, say, a shock jock, or something like that. And those shock jocks are going to say shocking, sometimes awful things in the media aftermath of an event, because that's just what they do. And I think right after something like yesterday happens, you want to avoid drawing attention to those people and do your best to draw attention to what facts you can find. In terms of political point-scoring, I think, you know, you just you - I avoid. . . HEADLEE: Avoid. STAHL: Yeah. That is a tough one. I would avoid pointing it out, I guess, because for the same reason that you would avoid pointing out the trolls. But, I mean, you want to avoid doing it altogether. You don't want to be the person who's making a point about the abortion debate or ATF nominees, which two people at major national newspapers did yesterday, connecting them to the horrific events that were unfolding. HEADLEE: We have a response here from Paul in Fort Collins, Colorado. Paul, how do you sift through what's real or not? (SOUNDBITE OF STATIC) PAUL: Well, a lot of times what we do is use Twitter to get pictures. For example, from the Aurora shooting, we wanted legitimate pictures as fast as we can get them, and Twitter was probably the fastest way to find the actual pictures from the spot that it was taken. HEADLEE: You worked for a paper in Colorado? PAUL: No. I work for a radio and Internet company, so I'm a morning show host on a music station with the Internet site that handles a little bit of news, mostly entertainment, but a lot of content. So anything that's happening in the area, we cover. HEADLEE: OK. And thank you so much for your call, Paul. But this is something I want to bring to you, Jeremy, because when you're pulling a photo off of Twitter, that has its own dangers, as well. There was a lot of reaction to some of the very graphic photos that people pulled from their Twitter feeds. STAHL: Absolutely. It's very tricky, and it's very difficult, and you want to, I think, know when something is going to be graphic. You want to say that upfront, and you don't want to go overboard in sharing those kinds of images because I'm not really sure of the news value in just sharing horrific image after horrific image. On-the-scene photos are a different story, obviously, and the caller was absolutely right, that that's - that Twitter is a great resource. That's another one, though, where you have to be careful. You need to trust, but verify. . . HEADLEE: Trust, but verify. What you're talking about, Jeremy, is the beauty of having editors, which I fully support. (LAUGHTER) HEADLEE: Jeremy Stahl is Slate's social media editor. He joined us from the Slate studio in Washington, D. C. Thank you so much. STAHL: Thank you very much, Celeste. HEADLEE: You can find a link to Jeremy's article at our website. Tomorrow, we're going to take a look at how the tragedy in Boston is affecting public safety plans in other cities around the globe.

I'm Ira Flatow. Up next, a look inside one of the most ambitious science and technology organizations no one really ever talks much about, DARPA. That's shorthand for Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. The agency is responsible for some of the most cutting-edge, game-changing technologies like the Internet. DARPA scientists are supposed to think just beyond what's currently possible and then get there before anybody else does. But they do it in a very quiet way. My guest Michael Belfiore got inside the organization for a firsthand look at some of the projects going on at DARPA. And he wrote a book about what he saw. He's here to talk about it. He's author of \"The Department of Mad Scientists: How DARPA is Remaking Our World, from the Internet to Artificial Limbs. \" He's here with us. Thanks for talking with us today, Michael. MICHAEL BELFIORE: Thanks for having me. Happy new year. FLATOW: Happy new year to you. If it's so top secret, how could you find out what's going on in there? BELFIORE: Well, that's certainly what makes DARPA unique. You see, they don't keep everything within their walls, much as they sometimes might like to. The way they work is, they don't have their own labs so they have to outsource everything. And that's partly how they got things done really quickly and get a lot of innovative projects going, but also leaves the door open for someone like me who wants to take a peek at what's going on. So it may be hard to get inside the office building where the ideas are hatched, which I did actually manage to do, but I spent most of my time out in the field at the universities and private companies that are working on these projects. They're looking for the far side, they call it. And Tony Tether, who is the director of DARPA while I was writing this book, he told me that one of the qualifications for the job as he saw it was that he was a former Fuller Brush man. And that, you know, here he was showing up at the door of military commanders - this is a military organization - so they're trying to basically sell the military on these new capabilities they're developing. And they're showing up with all these new gadgets and capabilities, much like someone banging on your door selling brushes back in the day and saying, hey, you need this - to people who may not necessarily think they do need that. So he saw that as a major part of his job. FLATOW: Why do you call them mad scientists? BELFIORE: Well they're mad because they think anyone who offers something truly innovative, something that's never been done before, has to be slightly mad, slightly out of step with the people around them. And some might offer that that's a requirement, someone like Edison or, you know, people like this creating entirely new things that no one's conceived of, has got to be somewhat mad. FLATOW: But we need people like this. I mean, if you look at other organizations, like, how would NASA, for example, work differently than DARPA would? BELFIORE: That's a good point of comparison, 'cause DARPA was created at the same time NASA was, for the same reason. It was in response to Sputnik, the launch of the first satellite by the Soviet Union back in 1957. And the Eisenhower administration saw this as a real challenge to the United States.  A lot of scientists were worried that we were falling behind, so Eisenhower and his team said, well let's do something fast. Let's reassure the public, first of all, that we are not falling behind and let's make sure we really don't get caught with our pants down again. So let's create this agency - it was called ARPA then -  that's going to prevent technological surprise. Now, that's been their mission ever since. They added the D for defense in the early '70s, but it's always been part of the Defense Department. And that was their mission, prevent technological surprise. And at the time, that was just in space 'cause that was where the threat came from - the perceived threat. And in the meantime though, there was much bigger organization kind of coalescing called - that was to be called NASA - that got started later in 1958. That essentially took over ARPA's mission - became the space agency. So ARPA was the first space agency, and NASA came along and took over the space mission and did things entirely differently. ARPA was created as a quick, sort of quick response. We're just going to get a bunch of, well, you know, mad scientists in an office building and get them to come up some with crazy ideas and then farm out those ideas to labs around the country. So we won't have to build new labs, we won't have to do anything like that. We'll just get those ideas out, get the funding out. Whereas NASA was an entirely different mold. It was, you know, let's create this huge infrastructure. Let's create these test stands and rocket centers and, you know, have them building things in-house, and they got the job done. They got people on the moon in 1969. Incidentally, the same year that DARPA created what became the Internet. But whereas NASA kind of, in my estimation, lost its footing after the moon landing - I mean, we beat the Soviets in space, we got the high ground, now what - NASA was left without an overriding mission. Well ARPA, since it didn't have this big bureaucracy and infrastructure holding it down, it could shift into other areas, which it did after NASA took the space mission and moved into information technology, and now they work in biomedicine and all kinds of different areas - robotics, artificial intelligence. FLATOW: What's interesting about a lot of the research you talk about in the book, \"The Department of Mad Scientists\" - talking with Michael Belfiore - it's how you don't know where this research is going to head. They're in such basic research that the invention of the Internet - they didn't set out to invent the Internet, did they? BELFIORE: It was one guy that originated - that's another thing about DARPA that makes it, I think, probably unique in the government - is the individual program managers and directors there have lots of autonomy about where things go. There's not a lot of forms to fill out. There's not a lot of layers of management to go through. So the Internet started out as this guy Bob Taylor - he's head of the information processing techniques office, which is still an office at DARPA - sitting in his office there in Washington and he sees - he's got a bunch of computer terminals, each one of which is linked to a different mainframe computer around the country. Every time he wants to use a different computer, he's got to go, you know, walk across the office and log into a different terminal. And he thought, well this is silly. Why can't I just have one terminal that I can log into any computer from? And so he went down the hall to  head of DARPA and pitched it as a program. And the guy said, well that sounds pretty good. Here's a million bucks. And he went back to his office and looked at his watch and he said, wow, that took 20 minutes. And that's typical of how things get going over there. Someone comes up with an idea, pitches it, gets it funded, and that's what makes an exciting place to work for the people there. FLATOW: And what do you say to people who will say, but yeah, but this is run by the Pentagon. These are all Defense Department - what do we get out of this as civilians? BELFIORE: What we get out of it is, to me, it's fascinating. And this is why I wrote this book. I wanted to - you know, the more I learned about DARPA, sort of by osmosis on another project I was working on, the more I was fascinated by this idea that this Pentagon agency had funded so many of the technologies that we as civilians use everyday, such as the Internet and a lot of the technologies behind GPS, things like this. It turns out that because DARPA doesn't have its own labs and then - and that it has to outsource everything, the groups that it funds are then free to market the technology, at least the ones that aren't secret, as they see fit. In fact, DARPA prefers that they do that 'cause that means that they don't have to continue nurturing those technologies. Once they're proven to be effective or possible, then they can move on to the next impossible task. And instead of having to worry about, okay, let's, you know, keep these other projects going to the point where everyone can use them. No, no, no, we've already proven that's possible. We've proven that cars can drive themselves, that you can put a GPS into a size of a cigarette pack, or we can network computers. Now it's up to the people we funded to go see what they can do with that and hopefully bring it to a marketplace where it can be then just be brought on the open market. FLATOW: Or create robotic artificial limbs for wounded soldiers. BELFIORE: That's one of the projects, yeah, that I followed in the book. Can we build a limb that is basically indistinguishable from a natural arm? So if you're missing an arm, you get this new prosthetic that can sense and move and operate like a natural arm. And that's typically ambitious, and they call that DARPA-hard. Let's try something that just seems completely insane, totally, you know, crazy ambitious. And in that case, they didn't get there. They didn't quite get to that point, but they did get a lot of these technologies in motion for controlling a robot with mind power alone, for instance. FLATOW: Yeah. How do they ensure that they keep getting new cutting-edge thoughts inside of DARPA? BELFIORE: That's one of the challenges, and that's one of the reasons I was able to write this book, too, because they need to get the word out. They need to find people out there who've got these ideas, who want to pitch them to DARPA. Or come to work for DARPA as a program manager because DARPA program managers, they all leave. After two to six years, they're gone. Their expiration dates are printed on their ID badges. So they've got this turnover, 25 percent every single year. FLATOW: And they also have a deadline, right? BELFIORE: The deadline. Everyone comes in there. They've got this project. Often they're recruited because they've got some idea that's been, basically, festering or stewing within them for years. You know, people got these pet projects, they come into DARPA, they get them done. They hit the ground running. They know they got to leave within, you know, four years, six years, something like that. So emphasis is on getting that stuff done, getting out there, but also getting the new ideas in. So Tony Tether, who was the director of DARPA while I was writing this book, he sort of saw this book as an opportunity to get the word out. We need ideas. In fact, he would actually give out his personal e-mail address, you know, his DARPA e-mail address, saying if you've an idea, send it to me. FLATOW: Yeah. So what is the budget for DARPA? BELFIORE: It's only about $3 billion. So compared to the whole Defense Department, which is, you know, 500 or more billion, or NASA, which is around 16 billion, or something. FLATOW: A couple of big bombers. BELFIORE: Yeah, one and a half B-2 bombers. That's it. I think DARPA should be inspiring to anyone who wants to create innovative things, come up with new ideas, do things that really make a difference, with a relatively small amount of money and resources. FLATOW: And what stuff do you think, percentage of stuff, that you actually saw going on? What couldn't you see that they wouldn't let you see inside of DARPA? BELFIORE: I'm told I had access to about half of what they do. The other half is secret, and I talked to Tether about this. You know, why is this all secret? You know, why am I only seeing half of the iceberg? He said, well, you know, our mission is to prevent technological surprise. So one of the ways you do that is you get there first, and if you let the word out, then it's not a surprise anymore. FLATOW: So we should assume that whenever we see something happening, or there's new technology or new ideas to combat terrorism, technology, medicine, life - that somewhere inside there, somebody's thinking about that. BELFIORE: Yeah, and that to me is one of the great, inspiring things about this research I did and the people I met. FLATOW: All right, Michael you're presenting it very well, yourself, the case for DARPA. So good luck to you. It's an interesting book. Michael Belfiore, author of \"The Department of Mad Scientists: How DARPA Is Remaking Our World, from the Internet to Artificial Limbs. \" Thanks for joining us. BELFIORE: Thanks for having me.

They didn't quite get to that point, but they did get a lot of these technologies in motion for controlling a robot with mind power alone, for instance. FLATOW: Yeah. How do they ensure that they keep getting new cutting-edge thoughts inside of DARPA? BELFIORE: That's one of the challenges, and that's one of the reasons I was able to write this book, too, because they need to get the word out. They need to find people out there who've got these ideas, who want to pitch them to DARPA. Or come to work for DARPA as a program manager because DARPA program managers, they all leave. After two to six years, they're gone. Their expiration dates are printed on their ID badges. So they've got this turnover, 25 percent every single year. FLATOW: And they also have a deadline, right? BELFIORE: The deadline. Everyone comes in there. They've got this project. Often they're recruited because they've got some idea that's been, basically, festering or stewing within them for years. You know, people got these pet projects, they come into DARPA, they get them done. They hit the ground running. They know they got to leave within, you know, four years, six years, something like that. So emphasis is on getting that stuff done, getting out there, but also getting the new ideas in. So Tony Tether, who was the director of DARPA while I was writing this book, he sort of saw this book as an opportunity to get the word out. We need ideas. In fact, he would actually give out his personal e-mail address, you know, his DARPA e-mail address, saying if you've an idea, send it to me. FLATOW: Yeah. So what is the budget for DARPA? BELFIORE: It's only about $3 billion. So compared to the whole Defense Department, which is, you know, 500 or more billion, or NASA, which is around 16 billion, or something. FLATOW: A couple of big bombers. BELFIORE: Yeah, one and a half B-2 bombers. That's it. I think DARPA should be inspiring to anyone who wants to create innovative things, come up with new ideas, do things that really make a difference, with a relatively small amount of money and resources. FLATOW: And what stuff do you think, percentage of stuff, that you actually saw going on? What couldn't you see that they wouldn't let you see inside of DARPA? BELFIORE: I'm told I had access to about half of what they do. The other half is secret, and I talked to Tether about this. You know, why is this all secret? You know, why am I only seeing half of the iceberg? He said, well, you know, our mission is to prevent technological surprise. So one of the ways you do that is you get there first, and if you let the word out, then it's not a surprise anymore. FLATOW: So we should assume that whenever we see something happening, or there's new technology or new ideas to combat terrorism, technology, medicine, life - that somewhere inside there, somebody's thinking about that. BELFIORE: Yeah, and that to me is one of the great, inspiring things about this research I did and the people I met. FLATOW: All right, Michael you're presenting it very well, yourself, the case for DARPA. So good luck to you. It's an interesting book. Michael Belfiore, author of \"The Department of Mad Scientists: How DARPA Is Remaking Our World, from the Internet to Artificial Limbs. \" Thanks for joining us. BELFIORE: Thanks for having me.

Federal officials reportedly sifted through terabytes of data - an unbelievable amount of data - much of it images and videos recorded near the finish line. Now, if you were to sit down and watch it all, it would take one person years to do. However, as NPR's Steve Henn reports, in past decades, technology has transformed how these large-scale investigations play out. STEVE HENN, BYLINE: In today's society, there are sensors almost everywhere - and I'm not just talking about surveillance cameras or even things like automatic license plate readers. Most of us walk around with a cell phone in our pocket, and it comes complete with a camera and microphone of its own. So, anytime you're in a crowd, chances are someone is rolling. (SOUNDBITE OF EXPLOSION)HENN: So, in Boston, Timothy Alben, who heads up the Massachusetts State Police, asked for help the day after the attack. TIMOTHY ALBEN: There have to be hundreds, if not thousands, of photographs or videos or observations that were made down at that finish line yesterday. And I would encourage you to bring forward anything. You might not think it's significant but it might have some value to this investigation. HENN: Alben clearly saw all these recordings as an opportunity for investigators. But the sheer volume also posed a challenge. BRIAN CUNNINGHAM: The availability of electronic data - in this case, video data, still photo data, cellular calling records, cell tower records. HENN: Brian Cunningham has worked at the CIA, the U. S. Department of Justice and on the national security staff at the White House. Today, he says, some of this information can be enormously valuable, but the quantity can be overwhelming. AL SHIPP: Most people don't understand that putting more cameras doesn't necessarily yield more information. HENN: Allen Shipp is the CEO of a company in San Francisco called 3VR. One of its first investors is In-Q-Tel, the CIA's venture capital fund. 3VR specializes in computerized video analytics, like facial recognition and object tracking. Shipp says often when investigators comb through videotapes, they're facing an information glut. SHIPP: So, what we've done is we've indexed that information. So, when we do a video, we extract things like size, shape, color, speed, direction and let you search against that and point back to the video. So, instead of watching hours and maybe days of video, you can ask questions like show me all the red cars that went east. HENN: Or look for anyone wearing a white baseball cap, like the suspect who allegedly set down his backpack at the site of the second explosion. Diego Simkin at 3VR says if you have high enough resolution images, their software can search by age or gender. He runs a search on the company's own security cameras looking for men. DIEGO SIMKIN: We'll do 20 to 25. HENN: That's pretty fine-grained. SIMKIN: Yeah. HENN: One of the hits is him. How old are you? SIMKIN: I'm actually 28. HENN: Not bad, but it's not perfect. And Shipp says this technology works best in controlled environments. SHIPP: Well, there are its limitations. And so, you know, one thing that this technology has had a history of is overpromising and underdelivering. HENN: The tools investigators have today are much more powerful than they were just a few years ago. But some who work in this field, like Amit Gavish, say the scene in Boston before the blast posed a challenge: it was crowded, a bit chaotic. AMIT GAVISH: Deploying analytics at that moment, or using it for that specific moment, is extremely difficult for computer vision technologies. HENN: At best, technologies like this make the work of human analysts go faster, perhaps help them find more images of their suspects - images they might otherwise have missed. Steve Henn, NPR News, Silicon Valley. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  And, again, it was a chaotic night in Boston. And we'll be following these fast-moving events as they unfold over the course of the morning. Let's just go through, one more time, what occurred. Police in Boston have been on a manhunt for two suspects they believe were involved in the bombing of the Boston Marathon on Monday. Police are saying that one suspect in the bombing is dead. A second suspect is at-large in the suburb of Watertown, and they are telling people to stay in their homes. Earlier in the evening - and we believe this was related - a police officer was killed on the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. We have reporters in Boston. We have reporters following the investigation, and we'll be hearing from them all day long here on NPR News.

This comes after several companies, including Germany's Siemens shut down their solar units. ABB says that falling prices for solar panels and rising energy costs all mean solar is now a competitive source of energy, and Power-One is the second largest maker of solar inverters, which allows solar power to be fed into energy grids. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Also on this Earth Day, the world's greenest office building officially opens its doors next week. It's called the Bullitt Center, and it's an ambitious project by the environmentally progressive Bullitt Foundation. The goal here is showcase an office building that is said to be entirely self-sustaining in energy and environmentally friendly in many other ways. The developers are hoping for a copycat effect here. But first, more on the new building from NPR's Wendy Kaufman in Seattle. WENDY KAUFMAN, BYLINE: The first thing that strikes you about the new Bullitt Center is the windows. Walking up to the building in the city's Capital Hill neighborhood, six stories of floor to ceiling glass soars above you. You notice I said walking up to the building - there is no on site parking and once inside, there's more walking. DENIS HAYES: In a building this size any place else in Seattle, we have two elevators and that's what would face you as you walked in the front door. Here, the stairway is obvious and it's attractive. That's Denis Hayes, president and CEO of the Seattle-based Bullitt foundation. He explains, there is an elevator, but it's tucked away. The staircase encourages exercise and the concept saves money both in energy use and construction  costs. KAUFMAN: This is but one of dozens of decisions and trade-offs that went into this building, a building Denis Hayes describes as a living organism. HAYES: It has eyes, it has ears , it has a nervous system, it has a brain and it responds to its environment in a way that seeks to optimize things. KAUFMAN: He points across the street to a mini weather station. It sends data back to the building so it can decide what it should do to maximize comfort and conserve energy. HAYES: Whether the windows should be open or closed and whether external shutters should be down or should be up, and if they're down, what angle they should be at to reflect as much sunlight as possible as far as possible into the building to give you day lighting at your desk. KAUFMAN: Just about everything in this building is off-the-shelf technology - from photovoltaic cells on the roof to composting toilets, but never before has all the technology been  integrated into a single building in  quite this way. CHRIS ROGERS: I think it's fair to say we were all a bit skeptical in the beginning. KAUFMAN: Chris Rogers is the founding partner of Point 32, the firm that developed the $30 million project in conjunction with the Bullitt Foundation. Rogers and the others set out to meet the rigorous goals of the Living Building Challenge - including total self-sufficiency in energy and water and building materials that are free of toxins. ROGERS: So down here in the basement is where you'll find the majority of the building systems. Our composting toilet system, our underground water storage cistern. KAUFMAN: But beyond the systems, the 160 or so people working inside will have a huge role in meeting the sustainability targets. The foundation occupies half of the top floor, the rest of the building is being leased out. The rent? Market rate for a top-tier building, though many amenities you might expect for the price don't exist and tenants have to live within an energy budget. Rob Pena of the University of Washington's integrated design lab says energy use can be measured down to an individual socket. ROB PENA: That's quite unusual. There probably isn't a building in the country that's metered to the extent that this building is metered. KAUFMAN: Clearly this building is not for everyone. If you think of this as simply an office building, it was relatively expensive to design and build, but if you view it as a laboratory, an educational center and a bold effort to change how things are built, the calculus changes. Still one could ask, is it possible to replicate the self-sustaining features at a reasonable cost? ROGERS: If this building isn't replicable, then this experiment will have failed. KAUFMAN: Developer Chris Rogers is optimistic others will follow their lead. He points out that over the past couple of decades many builders began incorporating green elements into their buildings. And Chris Cole, a construction cost analyst at the global engineering firm AECOM, adds. . . CHRIS COLE: The market changed. The market started to expect new buildings to have some of these features. KAUFMAN: And the supply chain began to adapt. New products and services were created and some costs began to fall. Cole believes the Bullitt project could foster additional shifts in the marketplace. COLE: As business and organizations seek to clean up their footprint. KAUFMAN: Tradeoffs between cost, fancy features and sustainably will undoubtedly be made and developers and tenants will make those decisions differently. Still, the Bullitt Foundation is encouraged by all the attention their building is getting from people around the world. Wendy Kaufman, NPR News, Seattle.

Many people listened and watched the Boston bombing coverage on their laptops. And on Friday as the manhunt came to a close, tens of thousands of people were listening to police dispatches live online. In the entertainment world, video streaming is also having a big impact. Try this. It's estimated that Netflix alone takes up a third of U. S. bandwidth between 9:00 PM and midnight. That's a lot. Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime all feature two kinds of programming - the movies and shows they all have like, for example, \"Lost,\" and a few things they have exclusively. In the case of Netflix, that could mean making and exclusively streaming the new season of a cult favorite. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW \"ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT\")GREENE: In today's Business Bottom-Line, NPR's Neda Ulaby says video streaming services seem to be adopting a strategy that was pioneered by pay cable. NEDA ULABY, BYLINE: Not too long ago, Annette Isaacson and her husband finally got around to watching the BBC show \"Downton Abbey\" on Netflix. ANNETTE ISAACSON: And we kind of got hooked on the show. ULABY: The Isaacsons streamed the first season but Netflix did not have the second one. ISAACSON: So we went out and subscribed with Hulu so we could basically watch that season. ULABY: The Isaacsons joined Hulu Plus just to see what happened to Lady Mary and Cousin Matthew, since they could not stream it on Netflix - a service they already had. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SERIES, \"DOWNTON ABBEY\")ULABY: As you can imagine, the fight among video streaming services for \"Downton Abbey\" has been intense. They don't need causal watchers. They need passionate fans, people who need to see their \"Downtown Abbey\" no matter what. A few months ago, Amazon Prime bought the rights to stream it exclusively. So soon that will be the only place to watch it. But research analyst Michael Pachter, of Wedbush Securities, says maybe that's not the best way to attract new subscribers. MICHAEL PACHTER: Exclusives are going to mean more if they are truly exclusive. ULABY: Meaning the only place you can watch them, ever, is on Hulu, or Netflix or Amazon Prime. That means paying more to make exclusive, original content. Pachter thinks the tradeoff is worth it - look at HBO. PACHTER: The only show I remember watching on HBO in the '90s was \"The Larry Sanders Show. \"(SOUNDBITE OF TV SERIES, \"THE LARRY SANDERS SHOW\")ULABY: At the time \"Larry Sanders Show\" was an exception, a rare original series on a channel then dominated by movies people had already seen in the theaters. PACHTER: Now I literally watch \"Boardwalk Empire, \"Newsroom,\" you know, \"Game of Thrones\" or \"Veep. \" They've just got me hooked. ULABY: That's a strategy Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime are trying to emulate, says Pachter. Now, those services have two kinds of exclusives - ones they've bought the rights to, like \"Downtown Abbey\" and the ones they make themselves. Netflix and Hulu are not exactly competing with HBO when it comes to original programming. At least not yet, says Hulu's senior vice president of content, Andy Forsell. ANDY FORSELL: Increasingly I think people are coming to services like Hulu to discover something new. ULABY: Hulu is slowly growing its slate of original series, including, soon, its first animated one. (SOUNDBITE OF ANIMATED TV SERIES, \"THE AWESOMES\")ULABY: Whether Forsell is developing an original program, like \"The Awesomes\" or negotiating an exclusive for an established show, he says he's looking for exactly the same thing. FORSELL: We want to find things familiar enough in the context of last nights TV. And it can stand up and look totally at home against the best of what was on TV last night. ULABY: So that might be \"Downtown Abbey\" or just something that seems like \"Downton Abbey. \" Research analyst Michael Pachter says the real question is: Will subscribers join these services? PACHTER: For a week or month or a quarter and then churn back out. ULABY: That's what happened with Annete Issacson and her husband with Hulu Plus. Once they finished watching \"Downton Abbey's\" second season, they canceled their subscription. When I asked if she was tempted by any of their other exclusives, she said no. Neda Ulaby, NPR News.

Now, those services have two kinds of exclusives - ones they've bought the rights to, like \"Downtown Abbey\" and the ones they make themselves. Netflix and Hulu are not exactly competing with HBO when it comes to original programming. At least not yet, says Hulu's senior vice president of content, Andy Forsell. ANDY FORSELL: Increasingly I think people are coming to services like Hulu to discover something new. ULABY: Hulu is slowly growing its slate of original series, including, soon, its first animated one. (SOUNDBITE OF ANIMATED TV SERIES, \"THE AWESOMES\") ULABY: Whether Forsell is developing an original program, like \"The Awesomes\" or negotiating an exclusive for an established show, he says he's looking for exactly the same thing. FORSELL: We want to find things familiar enough in the context of last nights TV. And it can stand up and look totally at home against the best of what was on TV last night. ULABY: So that might be \"Downtown Abbey\" or just something that seems like \"Downton Abbey. \" Research analyst Michael Pachter says the real question is: Will subscribers join these services? PACHTER: For a week or month or a quarter and then churn back out. ULABY: That's what happened with Annete Issacson and her husband with Hulu Plus. Once they finished watching \"Downton Abbey's\" second season, they canceled their subscription. When I asked if she was tempted by any of their other exclusives, she said no. Neda Ulaby, NPR News.

I'm Neal Conan, in Washington. Last Friday evening the Boston Police Department tweeted the news that the city and the nation had been waiting for. Captured. The hunt is over. The search is done. The terror is over and justice has won. Suspect in custody. Over the course of that long week, police and other law enforcement agencies also used tweets to correct misinformation that spread on Twitter and other media. Once suspects had been identified, their Twitter and Facebook accounts became part of the investigation, even an Amazon wish list. It's hardly the first time law enforcement has used social media, but it may have been the most watched. So if you work in law enforcement, how do you use social media? What are the pluses and minuses? Give us a call, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr. org. And yeah, we're on Twitter, talk - TALK OF THE NATION - talk - what's our Twitter account? Talk - @totn, that's what it is. I'll get there sooner or later, @totn. Later in the program, who is your Superman as the Man of Steel turns 75? Email us with the incarnation that speaks to you. The address is talk@npr. org. But first, Twitter and law enforcement. And of course we begin in Boston, as it happened. Lauri Stevens joins us from our member station there, WBUR. She trains law enforcement on social media. She's the founder of LAwS Communications. It's nice to have you on the program today. LAURI STEVENS: Thank you, Neal, glad to be here. CONAN: And let's start with public information. Is Twitter now the medium of choice for what used to be called a press release? STEVENS: Oh, I say if it isn't, it's sure going that way. You know, more people are checking Twitter. I know I myself, when I want to know what's going on, I don't turn on the television anymore. I look at Twitter. And certainly people did during the bombings. CONAN: And interesting that the arrest was announced on Twitter. STEVENS: Absolutely, but not such a surprise given that it's Boston police. They are - they're not new to social media, and they did a, you know, really great job of keeping the public informed during that entire week. CONAN: And keeping the public informed via Twitter on the assumption that everybody else in the media was looking at their Twitter account too. STEVENS: Oh sure, that's what happens. I mean this is how law enforcement does what I like to call controlling the virtual scene. You know, whenever anything happens, law enforcement is involved, a shooting, in this case a bombing, a protest, the earlier law enforcement can get out there and be part of the conversation and put out its messages of public safety, the better they're going to be at making sure things like what happened, you know, the things that are tweeted by others that are untrue or the rumors, can be put to rest, and the truth is put out there. CONAN: This requires an agility that police departments are not often credited with. STEVENS: Oh yes, it does. The police departments aren't known for agility for sure. They - you know, I've heard it said police departments hate two things, or cops hate two things: change and the way things are. (LAUGHTER)STEVENS: And that's certainly true, I think. But, you know, we're turning the curve on that, and Boston police did a great job of leading the way. I think - you know, having said that, I think the Boston police could be doing a whole lot more with social media. But they were - did an exemplary job of, you know, getting the messages out there in a time of crisis, when people really needed to get them. CONAN: So can you give us an example of something you thought worked pretty well? STEVENS: In the case of last week? Oh, I mean, I think that, you know, when people were tweeting that an arrest had been made, an arrest hadn't been made. Or I think especially issues of officer safety, the Boston police were out there asking the media not to be broadcasting their location. They were also trying to send out messages - they were sending out messages to people to not be broadcasting everything that's on their scanners. And I think that that - you know, people understood that they were part of it, and I think many, many people understood that they needed to dial it back too, and definitely played a part in doing that. Everybody wanted to cooperate. Everybody wanted to see those guys caught, and everybody did what they could to do that, and much to the great leadership of the Boston police. CONAN: Now, we've seen other occasions where police and social media have not mixed well. STEVENS: Oh sure, I have lost count. (LAUGHTER)CONAN: Well, perhaps the Dornan manhunt outside of Los Angeles just last month. STEVENS: Right, and that - you know, but I can tell you, you know, those officers out there, I don't know - I don't have intimate knowledge of, you know, what they were doing, but I can tell you what they were doing was monitoring and gaining a lot of intelligence. Were they engaging? Not so much. But they are very sophisticated as well out on the West Coast in the L. A. area. CONAN: They also told reporters to stop tweeting. STEVENS: Yeah, well, good luck with that. And that's - you know, that's never a good idea. We saw that in the Olympics, you know, in London. Some of the authorities there wanted to turn off Twitter. Well, you know, that's not going to happen. And of course the best thing to do is to use it to your advantage and be proactive and strategic about it. CONAN: There was also the case in San Francisco where after - worried that people would be gathering on subway platforms as part of a protest, police shut down Twitter. STEVENS: Yeah, they - well, they shut down the cell phone system. And - but, you know, that's a tough call. And I actually have met the officer that made that call, and he insists he'd do it again for public safety. And who wants to be an armchair quarterback on that? My best bet is with the law enforcement officers. CONAN: Well, joining us now by phone from Cincinnati is Dawn Keating, a police specialist with the Real Time Crimes Center Intelligence Unit at the Cincinnati Police Department. Good of you to be with us today. DAWN KEATING: Good afternoon, sir. CONAN: And can you tell us about a recent investigation where you used social media to find a suspect? KEATING: We've had actually multiple incidents. One big thing is we've had rape cases and burglaries where people were meeting each other via Facebook and became familiar with each other just through chats on the Internet. And when they would meet up with these individuals, the victim would then be either unfortunately a victim of a rape or robbery, and we were able to backtrack it through that. CONAN: So find out the identification of a suspect through their Facebook or Twitter account? KEATING: Yes, sir. CONAN: And are police allowed to walk a virtual beat to try to stop these things before they happen? KEATING: Yes, sir. It's no different than you getting onto the Internet today and logging into Facebook or Twitter or any of the hundreds of other social media sites out there and viewing what's out there. CONAN: So there are police officers in Cincinnati even as we speak trolling Twitter? KEATING: Yes, sir, we do the best we can here at the Real Time Crimes Center with monitoring all the different situations, especially if we have large events coming into Cincinnati or certain crimes that are occurring; we will take to the Internet. CONAN: And I wonder, do people contact you with concerns about, well, feeling that they're being, you know, watched by Big Brother? KEATING: We've had a few concerns, citizens that thought that, and I would sit down with them or another individual from our unit and explained to them really what we do, that it is no different than them going onto Google and doing a search. We've been able - very successful in using social media also to show that somebody was innocent in a crime. CONAN: And give us an example of that. KEATING: We've had individuals that were fraudulently taking money by checks in the downtown business area on multiple occasions, and the investigator contacted us and asked us to check the social media. We had the names and locations. Well, we were able to track the supposed suspect that was actually in Atlanta at the time that the crimes were happening. CONAN: So in that case it proved to be - well, investigations you tend to think of incriminating people, but obviously there's the other way too. KEATING: Correct. In this case we were able to prove the person was innocent, and not what they were being blamed of. CONAN: And do you keep track of court cases? I know there was a recent case in which the courts ruled that effectively Twitter was a public space, there's no expectation of privacy. KEATING: Yes, sir. I try to monitor the court cases as close as I can to keep on that for court purposes and the investigations. CONAN: And how do you think this is going to be changing over the weeks and months and years to come? KEATING: I think it's the types of cases that are going to come to the court's attention. It'll have to be a case-by-case judgment on the individuals. CONAN: Well, that's in terms of the courts. What about the police department? What are you anticipating? KEATING: In the five years I've been doing it, I'm seeing an increase of law enforcement showing an interest and using it as - it was stated earlier that police officers don't change. We are very reluctant to change, especially when it comes to computers and technology, because most officers want to be out chasing the bad guys and don't want to be behind the computer looking at things. But we're seeing a lot of officers becoming proactive with that and wanting to learn the proper way of vetting the information properly from the Internet. CONAN: And of course we also know not all the information on the Internet is entirely accurate. KEATING: Correct, correct. That's why when you see something on the Internet, you can't run with it right away. You have to actually take that information and try to verify it to the best that you can. CONAN: Lauri Stevens, we were talking earlier about Boston and here with Dawn Keating from Cincinnati. As you look at those departments, obviously they have resources that a lot of smaller police departments don't have. STEVENS: Absolutely. But I see some really good work being done by the small departments as well, especially when it comes to community engagement. There are many, many departments doing an outstanding job of really just in their day-to-day lives, officers tweeting or posting on Facebook just what they're doing, the kinds of work that they're doing and interacting with citizens and really building relationships. So, you know, when something bad happens in their town, they're going to have the support of those citizens because they've built those relationships. CONAN: We'd like to hear from those of you in law enforcement. How are you using social media? We'd also like to hear from those of you in the public. Do you have an example of the police department or law enforcement using social media well or maybe not so well? Give us a call, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr. org. And Dawn Keating there in Cincinnati, as you look at the possibilities here, do you consider that this is a force multiplier? Do you gain from using - the officers involved in Internet investigations are well-used? KEATING: Oh yes, and you're going to see it used more and more. Our officers are - even the beat officers are becoming more familiar with it every day and how to use it to assist them in their daily duties. CONAN: The beat officers, and are they supervised? Does someone from your department, for example, go back and say, Officer Smith, this was a good idea, maybe you could have done this one a little bit differently? KEATING: Oh, you know, as an officer you tend to do that with a lot of situations you're in, not just when it comes to social media. CONAN: And are there - there are also officers who want to have a private life, including social media, and that's not always, that's not always, you know, easy to do. KEATING: This is true, and we do talk to the officers about, you know, what you post is you may have it marked private, but somebody out there, if you put it in print, and you don't want anybody to know about it, it's probably not a good idea to be posting it. CONAN: And I just wonder: Do you have a private Facebook account or a Twitter account? KEATING: Not private, I do not. CONAN: Thanks very much. I appreciate your time today. Good luck to you. KEATING: Thank you, sir. CONAN: Dawn Keating is a police specialist with the Real Time Crimes Center Intelligence Unit in the Cincinnati Police Department. She joined us today by phone from her office there. And Lauri Stevens is still with us, she's a social media strategist for law enforcement. We'd like to hear from those of you in law enforcement. How do you use social media? And, well, those of you not in law enforcement, do you have an example of the police using it well or maybe not so well? Give us a call, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr. org. Stay with us. I'm Neal Conan. It's the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CONAN: This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan. As technology advances and the reach of social media grows, law enforcement has had to try to figure out how to handle it in times of crisis. Just two years ago, it came to a head after a Bay Area Transit officer shot Oscar Grant in a deadly confrontation on a subway platform. Activists planned a demonstration to protest that shooting, and police, for apparently the first time in the United States' history, shut down mobile Internet and phone service at four stations to interrupt communications and thwart the protest. Their strategy worked: Protests did not materialize. Constitutional scholars cried foul, though, calling it an unlawful suppression of First Amendment speech. If you work in law enforcement, call, tell us, how do you use social media to do your job? What are the pluses and minuses? Also those of you in the public, do you have an example of police using social media well or not so well? 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr. org. The email address is talk@npr. org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION. Lauri Stevens is social media strategist for law enforcement, with us from WBUR, our member station in Boston. And let's go to Brett(ph), and Brett's on the line with us from Waterford, Connecticut. BRETT: Yes, sir. CONAN: Go ahead, you're on the line. BRETT: I'm a lieutenant with the Waterford, Connecticut, police department. We have a Facebook page that we have rolled to a Twitter account and our web page. So it's a single-source entry for us. We, you know, we're a smaller community, about 20,000 people, and our - we have about 2,500 people on our Facebook page. So for a smaller agency, this is kind of our entry point for - recently had a blizzard, floods, hurricanes, et cetera. We update our page constantly through that let people know what roads are closed, if there's accidents, what areas of town are out of power, et cetera. CONAN: And when you say they're linked, so that means if you enter something on the Twitter page, it also shows up on Facebook, for example? BRETT: Vice versa, actually. We use Facebook as our entry point, and we find it easiest to attach photos and do all that. But - and it goes out from there. CONAN: And is it interactive? Do you have people contacting you with information or, well, comments for that matter? BRETT: Yeah, constantly, every single day. CONAN: And anything useful? BRETT: All the time. We post suspect photos of people that see a lot of our local retail outlets, and, you know, we put their photos up. We went through the FOI Commission to ask if that was OK. They said it was. And we solve the majority of our crimes that we post on Facebook, get solved through public information. CONAN: FOI, I assume, is freedom of information? BRETT: Yes, sir. CONAN: And any concerns about - well again, you're checking with lawyers, effectively? BRETT: We did. We did it at the start to ensure that we were within, you know, our police rights to do this. We've got some information that, you know, certainly we do not put out to social media, but, you know, anything that - any prominent arrest, press release, anything that we make we put up, and, you know, we're very cognizant of the arrest laws and the freedom of information laws. So we take the arrest photos down after a certain amount of time to ensure that there's no problems with the court process, et cetera. CONAN: Social media and the news media has had this problem, too. They seem to put pressure on you to do things faster than you might have otherwise done. Have you ever put something on the past and said, you know, in retrospect I wish we hadn't done that quite so quickly? BRETT: I would say that at the start, we were doing some things that, you know, we were a little leery of. But, you know, with the responses that we've gotten from both the press and the citizenry, it's fantastic. So, you know, you've got to weigh what you want out quickly versus what ramifications there may be down the line for you. So I can't say that we've put anything out where we've been oh, you know, darn it, we shouldn't have done that, but it doesn't matter - you're always good as your latest post. So I can't say that I'm not going to run into that in the future. CONAN: Yeah, the same with the news media, too. But thanks very much for the phone call. Good luck to you. BRETT: Thanks a lot. Have a good day. CONAN: And Lauri Stevens, I don't know if you're familiar with the Waterford, Connecticut, police department system, but is that an example of something that a smaller force can do? STEVENS: Oh absolutely, and the key words that the lieutenant said there to me were this is their entry point. And I think, you know, what I see everywhere is every agency goes through a process of comfort and feeling more comfortable with these tools and, you know, how to use them. And I'm sure we'll see Waterford doing, you know, more and more as they, you know, free up some resources. And hopefully we'll see their officers, you know, representing the department on Twitter and maybe their chief getting in there. And I liken it to email. You know, 15 years ago, I'm sure the chief looked around and wondered who they could trust with an email account. Now - you know, and so it's - to me I think we're going to see more and more of it being incorporated just into the regular day-to-day operations for community outreach especially. CONAN: Let's see if we can go next to Sean(ph), and Sean's on the line with us from Eugene in Oregon. SEAN: Hey, how are you doing, Neal? CONAN: Good, thanks. SEAN: Great. Hey, I just wanted to say that, you know, a couple of things. One, first, as a police officer, I've been a police officer here for quite a while, and I've seen other officers get in trouble about what they post on their Facebook. And right now I know our department, probably along with a lot of others, is in kind of a gray area between what they have a right to post or, you know, regarding freedom of speech and what is sort of an infringement on how they're portraying their department. So there's quite a bit of friction right now between where that line can be. CONAN: When you say friction, what do you mean exactly? SEAN: Well, you know, some officers feel like they should be able to post anything they want and maybe not speak so highly of the city or where they work. And other - and the department is saying people know you're a police office. You can't be saying certain things and expressing certain - you know, being too disgruntled because people know where you work. So there's really no - I guess there's no question about who they're speaking of. CONAN: I see, so it's a concern about exposure, too. SEAN: Yeah, exactly, and just I guess overall making the department look bad and griping and stuff like that. And, you know, our department is trying to figure out where that line is between what they have a right to say and what they shouldn't be saying per our policy, speaking poorly of the department and basically very disparagingly. CONAN: All right, interesting. Thanks very much, Sean, appreciate it. SEAN: All right, take care, thank you. CONAN: So long. Here's an email we have, this from a listeners called W: One important component in the Boston Twitter quote-unquote reporting was info from the police scanner being passed along via tweets. Now there are those using social media to their advantage, force multiplication, and others closing down. Why and what advantages or disadvantages from the point of view? Lauri Stevens, I wonder if you could help us there. STEVENS: Well, the disadvantage to the police obviously are every move they make is being broadcast out there. And, you know, they're talking about some real intricate details, and they don't necessarily want the world to know exactly where their men are and exactly what they're doing and when they're doing it. And so I think we've probably going to see something happen in that regard, with regard to encryption or something. I mean, I'm not an expert in that area at all, but I think. . . CONAN: So it's encrypted radio. STEVENS: I think it's a huge officer safety issue. CONAN: Encrypted radio messages that can. . . STEVENS: Something. Again, I don't pretend to have that kind of knowledge, but I think that, you know, not only the success of the operation but officer safety is of paramount importance, and I think that we're going to see a lot of, you know, improvement in that area. CONAN: Get one more caller in, let's go to Sean(ph), Sean's on the line with us from Portland. SEAN: Hi, yeah, so I had an interesting experience with social media recently in that I'm an actor and a writer, and I have been attached to a Web series that's shooting in Portland. And as part of our kind of marketing campaign, the Web series has to do with, you know, this kind of false civil war in the United States. And as part of the marketing campaign, I was writing about the tree of liberty being refreshed by the, you know, the sacrifice and blood of patriots and all this and all that. CONAN: That line from Thomas Jefferson, I think, yes. SEAN: Correct, correct. And literally an hour after I posted that, the Boston Marathon bombing happened. And it was interesting because after the bombing happened, you know, I was a little concerned, and I thought maybe I should take the post down, but I ended up leaving it up. It was part of a marketing campaign. I didn't think about it. And literally on Tuesday morning, I got a call from the local FBI field office wanting to know if I had any information regarding the bombing in Boston. CONAN: Interesting, so this was viewed as suspicious, so somebody was there watching an awful lot of postings. SEAN: Right, exactly. And, you know, to be honest, I hadn't really thought about - I hadn't really thought about Facebook being used very heavily for something like that. You know, I know it's always the public concern, but, you know, what I don't know is if an acquaintance of mine or a friend of a friend saw that and got concerned and called the FBI, or if the FBI was actually monitoring it. CONAN: Any idea there, Lauri Stevens, this walking I guess part of the virtual beat? STEVENS: Oh yeah, my - more than just a guess here, I'm sure that it was being monitored by the FBI and other law enforcement agencies. There's tools out there, some that are made specifically for law enforcement to just monitor - in the aggregate, not looking for any one person or, you know, just looking for illegal activity. And I'm sure that there must have been a magic word in that tweet that caught somebody's attention, and they took a look at it. CONAN: All right. Sean, good luck with the marketing campaign. (LAUGHTER)SEAN: Thank you. CONAN: It's interesting, because obviously, the medium is used for so many different things: personal communications, marketing campaigns and, obviously, these police and public information purposes, as well. Here's an email we have from William in Anchorage: As a community patrol member, I've used the following: My Tracks, Glympse, Waze, Evernote. Twitter is fine, but location tracking and multimedia notes describe and define local circumstance. Notes may be inserted in geographic display, location, time and position. In other words, people using GPS, I guess, Lauri Stevens. STEVENS: I'm not sure I understood all of those platforms that he was mentioning. But if he's speaking about geolocation, certainly, there - by default, your tweets have locations on them. And so if you don't want your latitude and longitude going out with every single tweet, you need to put - in your settings, you need to turn that off. And so that's the other thing, is that there's a - the jury's out on just what percentage of tweets are really - have this data still attached to them. It's not a huge number, but I think it's in the - the experts I talk to say 20, 25 percent of tweets may have geolocation data on them. And so, you know, law enforcement can use that to prove that somebody was where they were or weren't, but they can also get witnesses that way if they can see, you know, tweets that came, you know, near a time or near in location to where something happened. CONAN: Well, Lauri Stevens, thanks very much for your time today. Appreciate it. STEVENS: Thank you very much, Neal. CONAN: Lauri Stevens is a social media strategist for law enforcement, founder of LAwS Communications. She joined us today from our member station WBUR, in Boston. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News. And now to another Twitter-related event. On Tuesday, The Associated Press' Twitter feed was hacked, leading to a tweet that falsely reported two explosions at the White House, one of which injured the president. Those 140 characters triggered a cascade of effects on Wall Street. Algorithms that read tweets set off automatic trades, causing what's called a flash crash of the market. Heidi Moore is here to talk with us about it. She's The Guardian's U. S. finance and economics editor, and joins us now from our bureau in New York. Good of you to be with us today. HEIDI MOORE: Glad to be here. Thank you. CONAN: So what happened after that fake tweet was posted? MOORE: Well, there are a lot of theories. There are a lot of these flash crashes in the market. Of course, since this is Twitter, it has other names, like the Twitter Skitter, or the hash crash. But a lot of the time, the Dow Jones Industrial Average does respond, and the stock market does respond to what's happening in news, or some algorithm goes wrong and it crashes. So we can only piece what happened a little inexactly. But what people believe happened - one theory, at least - is that this errant tweet went out from The Associated Press' Twitter account, and it said, falsely, that there had been an explosion at the White House, and the president was injured. This is false. That was not true. And so that tweet went out. It did not go out on The Associated Press' usual service, which goes only to news organizations. So this went out on Twitter, where anyone can read it. And then, 15 seconds later, the market started to crash. You saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average fall 143 points. You saw the S&P 500 fall. There were other market indices that fell. And they would naturally respond to news of, you know, bad news, bombing, explosions, all of that. So the theory is that what happened is not exactly that the tweet was loaded into some computer and people started - and computers started trading on it. The theory is that one person or a few people saw the tweet, panicked, started selling, and then a lot of these computer programs or algorithms that scan the market for activity saw a lot of people selling, and then added more selling to it. And then that caused the crash. CONAN: So it became a cascade, or an avalanche. MOORE: Exactly. But all of that took three minutes. It was back in three minutes. (LAUGHTER)CONAN: And once the thing was over, the market responded, oh, no problem. But I wonder, in the course of that event, did anybody make or lose a lot of money? MOORE: Well, you know, off the Dow Jones Industrial Average, they probably lost something like $136 billion, which is real money, even on Wall Street. But the question of whether anyone actually lost money permanently, I think, is not only unanswerable, but is also questionable. I mean, the market rebounded. It's doing fine now. So even if they lose money for a little bit, they certainly got it back. CONAN: So what's the lesson of this? MOORE: Well, the lesson of this is that we do have to be careful about computers in the market. At least that's what a lot of people say. The way that a lot of news feeds into the market - as you know, the market is an emotional being. It's not, you know, this - you look at a stock market board, and it has all these red and green numbers, and it looks very official and scientific. But all of those numbers just indicate various emotions, positive and negative emotions about a company or a stock. So when Twitter goes into the market, all it does is add to that emotion. It adds news to that emotion. So, generally, Wall Street has been depending on Twitter for news since 2009. There's a company called StreamBase that takes tweets and makes them into computer code, and then adds a sentiment analysis - so whether it's positive or negative, usually on the scale of 100. And then all of those numbers and codes are sent to Wall Street trading firms, and they scan those for what's going - you know, what's happening in the world, what's happening in the news. But a lot of those computers that are programmed by humans, but don't respond right away to human directions can often go amok, can often run amok, as they did here. So a lot of people are saying this is a good example of why we need to look more closely at those computer programs that move billions of dollars and govern how well they read news, and also maybe increase the amount of human intervention between, you know, stock trades and the market, and not just depend on computers to do it all. CONAN: And briefly, any word on the investigation as to who hacked the AP account and who sent out that false message? MOORE: Well, the, quote-unquote, \"Syrian Electronic Army\" has taken credit, and I think right now, several agencies are investigating that claim. But we don't have any other candidates for the time being, as far as I know. CONAN: The Syrian Electronic Army? Do we know who they are? MOORE: We don't know who they are, but they have hacked other news accounts on Twitter. Of course, you know, Twitter, you just make up your own password, whether you're a news company or a person. So they've also hacked the BBC and other accounts. And I believe the idea is that they are trying to bring attention to what's happening in Syria. CONAN: Interesting. OK. Well, thanks very much. And by the way, the emotional state of the market today, apparently pretty good, up 71 points, the Dow Industrial average, at last glance. Heidi Moore, thanks very much for your time. MOORE: Thank you. CONAN: Heidi Moore is The Guardian's U. S. finance and economics editor. She joined us from our bureau in New York. Coming up next on TALK OF THE NATION, we're going to be talking with Glen Weldon about his new book, the unauthorized biography of Superman, who turned 75 years old last week - born on Krypton, of course. But which Superman speaks to you? Give us a call: 800-989-8255. Email us: talk@npr. org. Stay with us. I'm Neal Conan. It's the TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News. NEAL CONAN, HOST:  This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan, in Washington. Last Friday evening the Boston Police Department tweeted the news that the city and the nation had been waiting for. Captured. The hunt is over. The search is done. The terror is over and justice has won. Suspect in custody. Over the course of that long week, police and other law enforcement agencies also used tweets to correct misinformation that spread on Twitter and other media. Once suspects had been identified, their Twitter and Facebook accounts became part of the investigation, even an Amazon wish list. It's hardly the first time law enforcement has used social media, but it may have been the most watched. So if you work in law enforcement, how do you use social media? What are the pluses and minuses? Give us a call, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr. org. And yeah, we're on Twitter, talk - TALK OF THE NATION - talk - what's our Twitter account? Talk - @totn, that's what it is. I'll get there sooner or later, @totn. Later in the program, who is your Superman as the Man of Steel turns 75? Email us with the incarnation that speaks to you. The address is talk@npr. org. But first, Twitter and law enforcement. And of course we begin in Boston, as it happened. Lauri Stevens joins us from our member station there, WBUR. She trains law enforcement on social media. She's the founder of LAwS Communications. It's nice to have you on the program today. LAURI STEVENS: Thank you, Neal, glad to be here. CONAN: And let's start with public information. Is Twitter now the medium of choice for what used to be called a press release? STEVENS: Oh, I say if it isn't, it's sure going that way. You know, more people are checking Twitter. I know I myself, when I want to know what's going on, I don't turn on the television anymore. I look at Twitter. And certainly people did during the bombings. CONAN: And interesting that the arrest was announced on Twitter. STEVENS: Absolutely, but not such a surprise given that it's Boston police. They are - they're not new to social media, and they did a, you know, really great job of keeping the public informed during that entire week. CONAN: And keeping the public informed via Twitter on the assumption that everybody else in the media was looking at their Twitter account too. STEVENS: Oh sure, that's what happens. I mean this is how law enforcement does what I like to call controlling the virtual scene. You know, whenever anything happens, law enforcement is involved, a shooting, in this case a bombing, a protest, the earlier law enforcement can get out there and be part of the conversation and put out its messages of public safety, the better they're going to be at making sure things like what happened, you know, the things that are tweeted by others that are untrue or the rumors, can be put to rest, and the truth is put out there. CONAN: This requires an agility that police departments are not often credited with. STEVENS: Oh yes, it does. The police departments aren't known for agility for sure. They - you know, I've heard it said police departments hate two things, or cops hate two things: change and the way things are. (LAUGHTER) STEVENS: And that's certainly true, I think. But, you know, we're turning the curve on that, and Boston police did a great job of leading the way. I think - you know, having said that, I think the Boston police could be doing a whole lot more with social media. But they were - did an exemplary job of, you know, getting the messages out there in a time of crisis, when people really needed to get them. CONAN: So can you give us an example of something you thought worked pretty well? STEVENS: In the case of last week? Oh, I mean, I think that, you know, when people were tweeting that an arrest had been made, an arrest hadn't been made. Or I think especially issues of officer safety, the Boston police were out there asking the media not to be broadcasting their location. They were also trying to send out messages - they were sending out messages to people to not be broadcasting everything that's on their scanners. And I think that that - you know, people understood that they were part of it, and I think many, many people understood that they needed to dial it back too, and definitely played a part in doing that. Everybody wanted to cooperate. Everybody wanted to see those guys caught, and everybody did what they could to do that, and much to the great leadership of the Boston police. CONAN: Now, we've seen other occasions where police and social media have not mixed well. STEVENS: Oh sure, I have lost count. (LAUGHTER) CONAN: Well, perhaps the Dornan manhunt outside of Los Angeles just last month. STEVENS: Right, and that - you know, but I can tell you, you know, those officers out there, I don't know - I don't have intimate knowledge of, you know, what they were doing, but I can tell you what they were doing was monitoring and gaining a lot of intelligence. Were they engaging? Not so much. But they are very sophisticated as well out on the West Coast in the L. A. area. CONAN: They also told reporters to stop tweeting. STEVENS: Yeah, well, good luck with that. And that's - you know, that's never a good idea. We saw that in the Olympics, you know, in London. Some of the authorities there wanted to turn off Twitter. Well, you know, that's not going to happen. And of course the best thing to do is to use it to your advantage and be proactive and strategic about it. CONAN: There was also the case in San Francisco where after - worried that people would be gathering on subway platforms as part of a protest, police shut down Twitter. STEVENS: Yeah, they - well, they shut down the cell phone system. And - but, you know, that's a tough call. And I actually have met the officer that made that call, and he insists he'd do it again for public safety. And who wants to be an armchair quarterback on that? My best bet is with the law enforcement officers. CONAN: Well, joining us now by phone from Cincinnati is Dawn Keating, a police specialist with the Real Time Crimes Center Intelligence Unit at the Cincinnati Police Department. Good of you to be with us today. DAWN KEATING: Good afternoon, sir. CONAN: And can you tell us about a recent investigation where you used social media to find a suspect? KEATING: We've had actually multiple incidents. One big thing is we've had rape cases and burglaries where people were meeting each other via Facebook and became familiar with each other just through chats on the Internet. And when they would meet up with these individuals, the victim would then be either unfortunately a victim of a rape or robbery, and we were able to backtrack it through that. CONAN: So find out the identification of a suspect through their Facebook or Twitter account? KEATING: Yes, sir. CONAN: And are police allowed to walk a virtual beat to try to stop these things before they happen? KEATING: Yes, sir. It's no different than you getting onto the Internet today and logging into Facebook or Twitter or any of the hundreds of other social media sites out there and viewing what's out there. CONAN: So there are police officers in Cincinnati even as we speak trolling Twitter? KEATING: Yes, sir, we do the best we can here at the Real Time Crimes Center with monitoring all the different situations, especially if we have large events coming into Cincinnati or certain crimes that are occurring; we will take to the Internet. CONAN: And I wonder, do people contact you with concerns about, well, feeling that they're being, you know, watched by Big Brother? KEATING: We've had a few concerns, citizens that thought that, and I would sit down with them or another individual from our unit and explained to them really what we do, that it is no different than them going onto Google and doing a search. We've been able - very successful in using social media also to show that somebody was innocent in a crime. CONAN: And give us an example of that. KEATING: We've had individuals that were fraudulently taking money by checks in the downtown business area on multiple occasions, and the investigator contacted us and asked us to check the social media. We had the names and locations. Well, we were able to track the supposed suspect that was actually in Atlanta at the time that the crimes were happening. CONAN: So in that case it proved to be - well, investigations you tend to think of incriminating people, but obviously there's the other way too. KEATING: Correct. In this case we were able to prove the person was innocent, and not what they were being blamed of. CONAN: And do you keep track of court cases? I know there was a recent case in which the courts ruled that effectively Twitter was a public space, there's no expectation of privacy. KEATING: Yes, sir. I try to monitor the court cases as close as I can to keep on that for court purposes and the investigations. CONAN: And how do you think this is going to be changing over the weeks and months and years to come? KEATING: I think it's the types of cases that are going to come to the court's attention. It'll have to be a case-by-case judgment on the individuals. CONAN: Well, that's in terms of the courts. What about the police department? What are you anticipating? KEATING: In the five years I've been doing it, I'm seeing an increase of law enforcement showing an interest and using it as - it was stated earlier that police officers don't change. We are very reluctant to change, especially when it comes to computers and technology, because most officers want to be out chasing the bad guys and don't want to be behind the computer looking at things. But we're seeing a lot of officers becoming proactive with that and wanting to learn the proper way of vetting the information properly from the Internet. CONAN: And of course we also know not all the information on the Internet is entirely accurate. KEATING: Correct, correct. That's why when you see something on the Internet, you can't run with it right away. You have to actually take that information and try to verify it to the best that you can. CONAN: Lauri Stevens, we were talking earlier about Boston and here with Dawn Keating from Cincinnati. As you look at those departments, obviously they have resources that a lot of smaller police departments don't have. STEVENS: Absolutely. But I see some really good work being done by the small departments as well, especially when it comes to community engagement. There are many, many departments doing an outstanding job of really just in their day-to-day lives, officers tweeting or posting on Facebook just what they're doing, the kinds of work that they're doing and interacting with citizens and really building relationships. So, you know, when something bad happens in their town, they're going to have the support of those citizens because they've built those relationships. CONAN: We'd like to hear from those of you in law enforcement. How are you using social media? We'd also like to hear from those of you in the public. Do you have an example of the police department or law enforcement using social media well or maybe not so well? Give us a call, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr. org. And Dawn Keating there in Cincinnati, as you look at the possibilities here, do you consider that this is a force multiplier? Do you gain from using - the officers involved in Internet investigations are well-used? KEATING: Oh yes, and you're going to see it used more and more. Our officers are - even the beat officers are becoming more familiar with it every day and how to use it to assist them in their daily duties. CONAN: The beat officers, and are they supervised? Does someone from your department, for example, go back and say, Officer Smith, this was a good idea, maybe you could have done this one a little bit differently? KEATING: Oh, you know, as an officer you tend to do that with a lot of situations you're in, not just when it comes to social media. CONAN: And are there - there are also officers who want to have a private life, including social media, and that's not always, that's not always, you know, easy to do. KEATING: This is true, and we do talk to the officers about, you know, what you post is you may have it marked private, but somebody out there, if you put it in print, and you don't want anybody to know about it, it's probably not a good idea to be posting it. CONAN: And I just wonder: Do you have a private Facebook account or a Twitter account? KEATING: Not private, I do not. CONAN: Thanks very much. I appreciate your time today. Good luck to you. KEATING: Thank you, sir. CONAN: Dawn Keating is a police specialist with the Real Time Crimes Center Intelligence Unit in the Cincinnati Police Department. She joined us today by phone from her office there. And Lauri Stevens is still with us, she's a social media strategist for law enforcement. We'd like to hear from those of you in law enforcement. How do you use social media? And, well, those of you not in law enforcement, do you have an example of the police using it well or maybe not so well? Give us a call, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr. org. Stay with us. I'm Neal Conan. It's the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) CONAN: This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan. As technology advances and the reach of social media grows, law enforcement has had to try to figure out how to handle it in times of crisis. Just two years ago, it came to a head after a Bay Area Transit officer shot Oscar Grant in a deadly confrontation on a subway platform. Activists planned a demonstration to protest that shooting, and police, for apparently the first time in the United States' history, shut down mobile Internet and phone service at four stations to interrupt communications and thwart the protest. Their strategy worked: Protests did not materialize. Constitutional scholars cried foul, though, calling it an unlawful suppression of First Amendment speech. If you work in law enforcement, call, tell us, how do you use social media to do your job? What are the pluses and minuses? Also those of you in the public, do you have an example of police using social media well or not so well? 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr. org. The email address is talk@npr. org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION. Lauri Stevens is social media strategist for law enforcement, with us from WBUR, our member station in Boston. And let's go to Brett(ph), and Brett's on the line with us from Waterford, Connecticut. BRETT: Yes, sir. CONAN: Go ahead, you're on the line. BRETT: I'm a lieutenant with the Waterford, Connecticut, police department. We have a Facebook page that we have rolled to a Twitter account and our web page. So it's a single-source entry for us. We, you know, we're a smaller community, about 20,000 people, and our - we have about 2,500 people on our Facebook page. So for a smaller agency, this is kind of our entry point for - recently had a blizzard, floods, hurricanes, et cetera. We update our page constantly through that let people know what roads are closed, if there's accidents, what areas of town are out of power, et cetera. CONAN: And when you say they're linked, so that means if you enter something on the Twitter page, it also shows up on Facebook, for example? BRETT: Vice versa, actually. We use Facebook as our entry point, and we find it easiest to attach photos and do all that. But - and it goes out from there. CONAN: And is it interactive? Do you have people contacting you with information or, well, comments for that matter? BRETT: Yeah, constantly, every single day. CONAN: And anything useful? BRETT: All the time. We post suspect photos of people that see a lot of our local retail outlets, and, you know, we put their photos up. We went through the FOI Commission to ask if that was OK. They said it was. And we solve the majority of our crimes that we post on Facebook, get solved through public information. CONAN: FOI, I assume, is freedom of information? BRETT: Yes, sir. CONAN: And any concerns about - well again, you're checking with lawyers, effectively? BRETT: We did. We did it at the start to ensure that we were within, you know, our police rights to do this. We've got some information that, you know, certainly we do not put out to social media, but, you know, anything that - any prominent arrest, press release, anything that we make we put up, and, you know, we're very cognizant of the arrest laws and the freedom of information laws. So we take the arrest photos down after a certain amount of time to ensure that there's no problems with the court process, et cetera. CONAN: Social media and the news media has had this problem, too. They seem to put pressure on you to do things faster than you might have otherwise done. Have you ever put something on the past and said, you know, in retrospect I wish we hadn't done that quite so quickly? BRETT: I would say that at the start, we were doing some things that, you know, we were a little leery of. But, you know, with the responses that we've gotten from both the press and the citizenry, it's fantastic. So, you know, you've got to weigh what you want out quickly versus what ramifications there may be down the line for you. So I can't say that we've put anything out where we've been oh, you know, darn it, we shouldn't have done that, but it doesn't matter - you're always good as your latest post. So I can't say that I'm not going to run into that in the future. CONAN: Yeah, the same with the news media, too. But thanks very much for the phone call. Good luck to you. BRETT: Thanks a lot. Have a good day. CONAN: And Lauri Stevens, I don't know if you're familiar with the Waterford, Connecticut, police department system, but is that an example of something that a smaller force can do? STEVENS: Oh absolutely, and the key words that the lieutenant said there to me were this is their entry point. And I think, you know, what I see everywhere is every agency goes through a process of comfort and feeling more comfortable with these tools and, you know, how to use them. And I'm sure we'll see Waterford doing, you know, more and more as they, you know, free up some resources. And hopefully we'll see their officers, you know, representing the department on Twitter and maybe their chief getting in there. And I liken it to email. You know, 15 years ago, I'm sure the chief looked around and wondered who they could trust with an email account. Now - you know, and so it's - to me I think we're going to see more and more of it being incorporated just into the regular day-to-day operations for community outreach especially. CONAN: Let's see if we can go next to Sean(ph), and Sean's on the line with us from Eugene in Oregon. SEAN: Hey, how are you doing, Neal? CONAN: Good, thanks. SEAN: Great. Hey, I just wanted to say that, you know, a couple of things. One, first, as a police officer, I've been a police officer here for quite a while, and I've seen other officers get in trouble about what they post on their Facebook. And right now I know our department, probably along with a lot of others, is in kind of a gray area between what they have a right to post or, you know, regarding freedom of speech and what is sort of an infringement on how they're portraying their department. So there's quite a bit of friction right now between where that line can be. CONAN: When you say friction, what do you mean exactly? SEAN: Well, you know, some officers feel like they should be able to post anything they want and maybe not speak so highly of the city or where they work. And other - and the department is saying people know you're a police office. You can't be saying certain things and expressing certain - you know, being too disgruntled because people know where you work. So there's really no - I guess there's no question about who they're speaking of. CONAN: I see, so it's a concern about exposure, too. SEAN: Yeah, exactly, and just I guess overall making the department look bad and griping and stuff like that. And, you know, our department is trying to figure out where that line is between what they have a right to say and what they shouldn't be saying per our policy, speaking poorly of the department and basically very disparagingly. CONAN: All right, interesting. Thanks very much, Sean, appreciate it. SEAN: All right, take care, thank you. CONAN: So long. Here's an email we have, this from a listeners called W: One important component in the Boston Twitter quote-unquote reporting was info from the police scanner being passed along via tweets. Now there are those using social media to their advantage, force multiplication, and others closing down. Why and what advantages or disadvantages from the point of view? Lauri Stevens, I wonder if you could help us there. STEVENS: Well, the disadvantage to the police obviously are every move they make is being broadcast out there. And, you know, they're talking about some real intricate details, and they don't necessarily want the world to know exactly where their men are and exactly what they're doing and when they're doing it. And so I think we've probably going to see something happen in that regard, with regard to encryption or something. I mean, I'm not an expert in that area at all, but I think. . . CONAN: So it's encrypted radio. STEVENS: I think it's a huge officer safety issue. CONAN: Encrypted radio messages that can. . . STEVENS: Something. Again, I don't pretend to have that kind of knowledge, but I think that, you know, not only the success of the operation but officer safety is of paramount importance, and I think that we're going to see a lot of, you know, improvement in that area. CONAN: Get one more caller in, let's go to Sean(ph), Sean's on the line with us from Portland. SEAN: Hi, yeah, so I had an interesting experience with social media recently in that I'm an actor and a writer, and I have been attached to a Web series that's shooting in Portland. And as part of our kind of marketing campaign, the Web series has to do with, you know, this kind of false civil war in the United States. And as part of the marketing campaign, I was writing about the tree of liberty being refreshed by the, you know, the sacrifice and blood of patriots and all this and all that. CONAN: That line from Thomas Jefferson, I think, yes. SEAN: Correct, correct. And literally an hour after I posted that, the Boston Marathon bombing happened. And it was interesting because after the bombing happened, you know, I was a little concerned, and I thought maybe I should take the post down, but I ended up leaving it up. It was part of a marketing campaign. I didn't think about it. And literally on Tuesday morning, I got a call from the local FBI field office wanting to know if I had any information regarding the bombing in Boston. CONAN: Interesting, so this was viewed as suspicious, so somebody was there watching an awful lot of postings. SEAN: Right, exactly. And, you know, to be honest, I hadn't really thought about - I hadn't really thought about Facebook being used very heavily for something like that. You know, I know it's always the public concern, but, you know, what I don't know is if an acquaintance of mine or a friend of a friend saw that and got concerned and called the FBI, or if the FBI was actually monitoring it. CONAN: Any idea there, Lauri Stevens, this walking I guess part of the virtual beat? STEVENS: Oh yeah, my - more than just a guess here, I'm sure that it was being monitored by the FBI and other law enforcement agencies. There's tools out there, some that are made specifically for law enforcement to just monitor - in the aggregate, not looking for any one person or, you know, just looking for illegal activity. And I'm sure that there must have been a magic word in that tweet that caught somebody's attention, and they took a look at it. CONAN: All right. Sean, good luck with the marketing campaign. (LAUGHTER) SEAN: Thank you. CONAN: It's interesting, because obviously, the medium is used for so many different things: personal communications, marketing campaigns and, obviously, these police and public information purposes, as well. Here's an email we have from William in Anchorage: As a community patrol member, I've used the following: My Tracks, Glympse, Waze, Evernote. Twitter is fine, but location tracking and multimedia notes describe and define local circumstance. Notes may be inserted in geographic display, location, time and position. In other words, people using GPS, I guess, Lauri Stevens. STEVENS: I'm not sure I understood all of those platforms that he was mentioning. But if he's speaking about geolocation, certainly, there - by default, your tweets have locations on them. And so if you don't want your latitude and longitude going out with every single tweet, you need to put - in your settings, you need to turn that off. And so that's the other thing, is that there's a - the jury's out on just what percentage of tweets are really - have this data still attached to them. It's not a huge number, but I think it's in the - the experts I talk to say 20, 25 percent of tweets may have geolocation data on them. And so, you know, law enforcement can use that to prove that somebody was where they were or weren't, but they can also get witnesses that way if they can see, you know, tweets that came, you know, near a time or near in location to where something happened. CONAN: Well, Lauri Stevens, thanks very much for your time today. Appreciate it. STEVENS: Thank you very much, Neal. CONAN: Lauri Stevens is a social media strategist for law enforcement, founder of LAwS Communications. She joined us today from our member station WBUR, in Boston. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News. And now to another Twitter-related event. On Tuesday, The Associated Press' Twitter feed was hacked, leading to a tweet that falsely reported two explosions at the White House, one of which injured the president. Those 140 characters triggered a cascade of effects on Wall Street. Algorithms that read tweets set off automatic trades, causing what's called a flash crash of the market. Heidi Moore is here to talk with us about it. She's The Guardian's U. S. finance and economics editor, and joins us now from our bureau in New York. Good of you to be with us today. HEIDI MOORE: Glad to be here. Thank you. CONAN: So what happened after that fake tweet was posted? MOORE: Well, there are a lot of theories. There are a lot of these flash crashes in the market. Of course, since this is Twitter, it has other names, like the Twitter Skitter, or the hash crash. But a lot of the time, the Dow Jones Industrial Average does respond, and the stock market does respond to what's happening in news, or some algorithm goes wrong and it crashes. So we can only piece what happened a little inexactly. But what people believe happened - one theory, at least - is that this errant tweet went out from The Associated Press' Twitter account, and it said, falsely, that there had been an explosion at the White House, and the president was injured. This is false. That was not true. And so that tweet went out. It did not go out on The Associated Press' usual service, which goes only to news organizations. So this went out on Twitter, where anyone can read it. And then, 15 seconds later, the market started to crash. You saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average fall 143 points. You saw the S&P 500 fall. There were other market indices that fell. And they would naturally respond to news of, you know, bad news, bombing, explosions, all of that. So the theory is that what happened is not exactly that the tweet was loaded into some computer and people started - and computers started trading on it. The theory is that one person or a few people saw the tweet, panicked, started selling, and then a lot of these computer programs or algorithms that scan the market for activity saw a lot of people selling, and then added more selling to it. And then that caused the crash. CONAN: So it became a cascade, or an avalanche. MOORE: Exactly. But all of that took three minutes. It was back in three minutes. (LAUGHTER) CONAN: And once the thing was over, the market responded, oh, no problem. But I wonder, in the course of that event, did anybody make or lose a lot of money? MOORE: Well, you know, off the Dow Jones Industrial Average, they probably lost something like $136 billion, which is real money, even on Wall Street. But the question of whether anyone actually lost money permanently, I think, is not only unanswerable, but is also questionable. I mean, the market rebounded. It's doing fine now. So even if they lose money for a little bit, they certainly got it back. CONAN: So what's the lesson of this? MOORE: Well, the lesson of this is that we do have to be careful about computers in the market. At least that's what a lot of people say. The way that a lot of news feeds into the market - as you know, the market is an emotional being. It's not, you know, this - you look at a stock market board, and it has all these red and green numbers, and it looks very official and scientific. But all of those numbers just indicate various emotions, positive and negative emotions about a company or a stock. So when Twitter goes into the market, all it does is add to that emotion. It adds news to that emotion. So, generally, Wall Street has been depending on Twitter for news since 2009. There's a company called StreamBase that takes tweets and makes them into computer code, and then adds a sentiment analysis - so whether it's positive or negative, usually on the scale of 100. And then all of those numbers and codes are sent to Wall Street trading firms, and they scan those for what's going - you know, what's happening in the world, what's happening in the news. But a lot of those computers that are programmed by humans, but don't respond right away to human directions can often go amok, can often run amok, as they did here. So a lot of people are saying this is a good example of why we need to look more closely at those computer programs that move billions of dollars and govern how well they read news, and also maybe increase the amount of human intervention between, you know, stock trades and the market, and not just depend on computers to do it all. CONAN: And briefly, any word on the investigation as to who hacked the AP account and who sent out that false message? MOORE: Well, the, quote-unquote, \"Syrian Electronic Army\" has taken credit, and I think right now, several agencies are investigating that claim. But we don't have any other candidates for the time being, as far as I know. CONAN: The Syrian Electronic Army? Do we know who they are? MOORE: We don't know who they are, but they have hacked other news accounts on Twitter. Of course, you know, Twitter, you just make up your own password, whether you're a news company or a person. So they've also hacked the BBC and other accounts. And I believe the idea is that they are trying to bring attention to what's happening in Syria. CONAN: Interesting. OK. Well, thanks very much. And by the way, the emotional state of the market today, apparently pretty good, up 71 points, the Dow Industrial average, at last glance. Heidi Moore, thanks very much for your time. MOORE: Thank you. CONAN: Heidi Moore is The Guardian's U. S. finance and economics editor. She joined us from our bureau in New York. Coming up next on TALK OF THE NATION, we're going to be talking with Glen Weldon about his new book, the unauthorized biography of Superman, who turned 75 years old last week - born on Krypton, of course. But which Superman speaks to you? Give us a call: 800-989-8255. Email us: talk@npr. org. Stay with us. I'm Neal Conan.

And now, for the very first time, here he is imploring us to hear his own voice. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL: Hear my voice. Alexander Graham Bell. LYDEN: Did you get that? He just said: Hear my voice. Alexander Graham Bell. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BELL: Hear my voice. Alexander Graham Bell. LYDEN: You'll have to forgive the poor quality. It's amazing we have it at all. The recording is nearly 130 years old. Bell made it in 1885. It lets us know what the past was really like. It fills in a gap for people. That's Shari Stout, collections manager at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. Stout's part of a team that restored Bell's voice. One thing it reveals, though he hailed from Scotland, Bell spent enough time in the U. S. that he doesn't have much of an accent. And Bell came from a family of elocutionists, so you can tell he's speaking carefully and clearly. Here he is asserting his identity again. He's saying: This record has been made by Alexander Graham Bell. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BELL: This record has been made by Alexander Graham Bell. LYDEN: The Smithsonian has hundreds of experimental disks and cylinders made by Bell and his partners at the Volta Lab right here in Washington, D. C. Bell left them in the Smithsonian's care, evidently to protect himself against a patent dispute. They're all different materials. Sometimes they used plaster, sometimes tin foil, things that looked like cardboard. It's very bizarre. If we could show people a picture, they wouldn't believe what they were trying to do to get sound. But those disks have been collecting dust for more than a century. They were way too fragile for experts to try to extract the sound until now. This is new technology that's been developed by our partners at the Lawrence Berkeley Lab. It's a noninvasive technology using lasers. They started out recovering commercial records, and it turns out our curator read about it in The New York Times. They had a big break when they recovered \"Au Clair De La Lune. \"That recording from 1860 is the earliest that we know of. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"AU CLAIR DE LA LUNE\")LYDEN: And rather than record a French folk tune, Bell was a bit more mundane. Here he is counting in dollar denominations. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BELL: Half a dollar. A quarter dollar. Three dollars and a half. LYDEN: So with all the sterling words that Alexander Graham Bell could've left for posterity, why record himself counting money? We don't really know. One of the speculations is that they may have been inventing this technology with a hope towards using it as a business machine. And indeed, Sumner Tainter, who was one of the partners, did go on to use what came out of this technology for Dictaphones, and those were used in offices. And there are likely some more long-silent treasures we can look forward to eventually hearing. We have a few Berliner pieces, and we have some Edison tin foils. But the bulk of our collection is from the Bell collection, so we have plenty of things hiding in our cupboards. Alexander Graham Bell, hear my voice, a big thank you. We're ringing off now.

Tompkins has tried his fair share of soothing sounds to fall asleep, so we asked him to get some shut eye using the Sleep Machine app. He sent us this review. TOMPKINS: I had a great experience with this. There's a paid version and a free version. I sprang for the paid version because I'm worth it. It's got great things like - there's a timer so you can control how long you want the noises to go on for. You can have them fade out after a while. You can give yourself, you know, half an hour to fall asleep, and then you can have a totally different sound wake you up in 30 minutes or the next day, whenever you need it.

The problem for me with crickets is that they're always too loud, and they're - it's too constant. It's like it's not just, it's nighttime in the summer and there's crickets in the background. It's like you're in a cricket nest or a cricket hive. I don't know what they live in, but it's too many crickets. They really sound aggressive. But there's a lot of great machines like dishwasher and air purifier, air conditioner. There's ones that I thought would be good, but weren't that great. Like, foghorn ends up being not a relaxing sound. (SOUNDBITE OF A FOGHORN)TOMPKINS: Frog's not a relaxing sound. But you can mix and match the sounds. You can layer up to three different sounds together. So you can put the beach together with the rain. You can put your frogs and your crickets together if you want to, you know, make yourself insane. (SOUNDBITE OF FROGS AND CRICKETS)TOMPKINS: I mean, for the thing that you want it to do, it kind of has covered all of the bases. So I would have to say this is a great app for somebody like me.

I'm Melissa Block. Through most of human history, engineers have been building big - think pyramids, skyscrapers, rockets. But now, in the electronic age, the challenge is building small. As NPR's Geoff Brumfiel reports, some engineers are taking inspiration from some of Earth's smallest inhabitants. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: It seems like my smartphone can do anything, but it can't. Pick up that pen and hand it to me. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: I don't know what that means. If you like, I can search the Web. BRUMFIEL: Thanks, but no. Engineers would like to build little gadgets to do stuff in the real world. They'd be useful for a lot more than just picking up pens, but right now we don't know how to make them. MICHAEL DICKINSON: Gears and rotors and belts and pistons and all the things that, you know, work really well at large scales, they just don't work at small scales. BRUMFIEL: Michael Dickinson is not an engineer. He's a zoologist at the University of Washington. Dickinson's crazy about flies. His email is \"flyman. \" He'll tell you insects are the ultimate micromachines. They've got acute sensors, superfast reflexes and lots of little moving parts. DICKINSON: Insects just excel at small. They really do small well. BRUMFIEL: This week, two groups of engineers have unveiled new machines that rip off insects. The first, published in the journal Nature, is a miniature camera. It looks just like a bug's compound eye, and works like one, too. John Rogers, an engineer at the University of Illinois, developed the dime-sized camera by staring deep into the eyes of a bark beetle. JOHN ROGERS: It's just this amazing rainbow of colors and this amazing hemispherical shape in what is otherwise kind of an ugly beetle insect. And it only gets more interesting when you start to think about the details. BRUMFIEL: An insect's compound eye sees really well because each of its light-sensitive cells has its own dedicated lens. Insects have a huge field of view. They are highly sensitive to motion, and they keep everything in focus automatically. Copying that design lets Rogers' camera do things that no other camera can. ROGERS: So you place an object very close to a camera with this design or, you know, an insect's very close to an object, the object is in crisp focus and as it moves away, it stays in focus. BRUMFIEL: Rogers thinks his new camera could be used in hard-to-reach places - looking inside the human body, for example, or for surveillance. The second piece of insect imitation is published today in Science magazine. Robert Wood, an engineer at Harvard University, has spent more than a decade trying to make miniature robots that can fly. Individually, they might search through rubble of a collapsed building; swarms of them could help pollinate crops. Kevin Ma is one of Wood's graduate students. He says the team has drawn inspiration from insects' tiny flapping wings. KEVIN MA: Flapping wings seem to be a viable solution, seeing as there are trillions of insects taunting us with their abilities. BRUMFIEL: The team built their robot by layering different materials together and folding it up. MA: By hand, with tweezers under a microscope. BRUMFIEL: The result, a robotic fly. It looks like a toothpick with little fairy wings. They don't have room for a battery or a computer yet, so it flies while attached to a little power cable. For a while anyway. MA: Their flight muscles break, quite fragile flight muscles and also, the shoulder hinge of the wings will fatigue and fail after about 10 minutes. BRUMFIEL: It'll be a while before I can send the flybots out with their powerful bug eyes to grab my pen. In the meantime, zoologist Dickinson says that insects will continue to inspire engineers. And they should. DICKINSON: It's been the age of insects for about 400 million years, so I think it's, you know, it's very appropriate to spend some of our energy trying to figure out how they work and sort of see the world from their perspective. BRUMFIEL: Geoff Brumfiel, NPR News. BLOCK: And at NPR. org, you can see a video of that fly robot Geoff Brumfiel was talking about and something that's really cool - I'm looking at it now. It's a real fly in slow motion. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:  This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Melissa Block.

I'm Neal Conan, in Washington. Technology's already changed our lives in ways we couldn't have imagined just a few years ago, and now seems ready to reinvent our future. As we continue our series of conversations looking ahead, we've invited Farhad Manjoo to join us - he's Slate's technology columnist and a frequent guest on this program - on the latest gadgets, on the business of consumer electronics and on how we've adapted our lives, our jobs and our manners to all these changes. We want to hear from those of you who work in tech. What's changing, and how will it change us? Join us: 800-989-8255. Email us: talk@npr. org. You can also join the conversation on our website. That's at npr. org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION. Later in the program, NPR's Lourdes Garcia-Navarro joins us from her new post in Brazil. But first, looking ahead with Farhad Manjoo, who joins us now from his office in Palo Alto. Nice to have you back with us. FARHAD MANJOO: Hi, good to be here. CONAN: And that's rumblings of a Skype as we stumble a bit there. Farhad, we'll get to the new stuff in a bit. I wanted to start by asking you: What surprises you about how we use the devices that are now so omnipresent in our lives? MANJOO: Well, I think one of the things that surprises me is how quickly we've sort of gotten used to - they've integrated into our - they've - sorry, I think we a problem with Skype there for a second. CONAN: All right, we're on the phone now (unintelligible). MANJOO: Yes, we're on the phone now. I had to switch. This is - this sort of explains what I was trying to get at. We - technology kind of behaves in unexpected ways. It's integrated into our culture. But like as we saw with the way Reddit tried to capture the Boston bombers a couple weeks ago, all of a sudden, technology will sort of rear up in a way that we hadn't really expected, and then we'll all have to try to figure out, you know, what role it's playing in our lives these days. CONAN: So crowdsource the investigation. MANJOO: Yeah, that's what they tried to do a couple weeks ago, and as a result, they - you know, on - by looking at security camera pictures and other photos of the bombing, of the crowd around the bombing, they wrongly - people on Reddit wrongly fingered several, you know, innocent people as being possible suspects. That's the way in which - I think it suggests both the potential, you know, potentially, we could have gotten the bombers that way, but we didn't, and suggests the downside of technology in our lives. CONAN: As reporters, we're used to being in the situation where we're not necessarily experiencing something directly, but trying to record our observations, to communicate them to a wider audience. More and more, you see everybody is in that situation. People don't go to watch a ballgame. People go to take pictures of themselves watching a ballgame, and then send text messages. MANJOO: Yeah, I used to - that used to bother me when I would go - you notice this especially at, like, concerts, at rock concerts and other things, where people - you expect people to kind of experience the event. And now we want to record the event for, I think, some kind of posterity, but oftentimes, we don't ever go back to those videos. And so that used to bother me until I had kids. So, like, two years ago, you know, my son is two and a half, and now I actually have a small - a baby. And now, I try to - I get upset at myself for not recording. I try to record kind of every moment, because I think that it would be kind of magical in, you know, 10 years or 20 years to kind of go back to those videos. And I expect that those videos are going to be searchable, so that even if it seems like a mess right now, even if it seems like there's no kind of organization to all the little videos that I'm getting of my son, like, learning to talk, at some point, there will be some organization, and maybe I can make something coherent of it. And it will be interesting just to go back to some random day and figure out, like, what he was interested in when he was two and a half. CONAN: It will be curious to see the extent to which technology allows you to access that without going through it minute by minute and taking notes, the way we do it now. MANJOO: Yeah. I mean, I think that one of the things we're noticing is that, you know, companies like Google, companies that kind of analyze - whose mission it is to analyze and organize information are, you know, they started out cataloging the Web, public information. But more and more, they're focused on cataloging your private information. So, you know, my photos, I manage them in a program called Picasa, which is owned by Google, and it does face recognition. So now I can go through my photos based on pictures of, you know, my family and kind of see all the photos of my son or all the photos of my mom, which would have been very difficult, you know, 10 years ago. The technology didn't exist to organize photos in that way. And now - so I - now I don't spend any time organizing my photos. I just put everything on my computer, and I expect the software will organize it for me. And I think more and more, that's what's happening. We'll be able to organize all of our personal data in the kind of the way we're used to having, you know, public data organized. CONAN: Yet by doing that, you raise an interesting point. All of us talk about, well, we want privacy. We want to make sure these companies aren't hawking our images elsewhere or using our personal information to sell our identities in some way or another to advertisers. Yet we all put more and more of our personal lives on the Web. MANJOO: Yeah. This is the great paradox of social networking. You know, for the last six, seven years, as Facebook has become a bigger force in our lives, you know, every time Facebook made more - made some part of its site more public, there's been a huge outcry. And, you know, people get really upset, and they join groups on Facebook where they claim they're going to stop using Facebook, and they never do because - and what happens is Facebook's, sort of, traffic always goes up. And I think that indicates that while people say they want privacy, they're also, you know, as human beings, we're deeply social, and we like to share things. And so it's not that people want privacy all the time or want to share things all the time. What's difficult is figuring out when we want privacy and when we want to share things. And that line, I think, technology is helping that line move. So, you know, now people share things that they wouldn't have, you know, 10 years ago. They share very personal, intimate details of their lives and their medical histories and, you know, their romantic interests online in a way that would have, I think, seemed awkward 10 years ago, five years ago, even. And now it seems acceptable to people. CONAN: It's amazing what has become acceptable, the idea of people walking down the street apparently talking to themselves. It would have gotten you a quick ride to Bellevue in New York City a few years ago, but it's now commonplace. And it is the degree to which people are in communication with their friends, their universe via text messages in situations where you wouldn't think that would apply at all. MANJOO: Yeah. It's become commonplace. But I guess I would also say that we still haven't figure out the rules for these - the etiquette and the norms for how we should use these devices in life. So I read - I read a story recently about - that was interviewing HR managers, people who were hiring young people. And one of the complaints of these interviewers is that many young people, many college graduates are going into interviews and - into job interviews, and they don't realize that they're not supposed to text. And some people are kind of reaching for their phones and looking at their phones while they're in job interviews. And, you know, that's - at first, I found that hard to believe, but then when I thought about most people I meet every day, that seems very - that seemed, actually, like, not unsurprising. And then so what I think, you know, this will either - this will evolve in one of two ways. Either it will sort of have a rule, kind of an etiquette about how we should use our phones, and that etiquette might say if you're in a formal situation like a job interview, you should not use your phone, and people would sort of come to adhere to that. Or I think the opposite could happen, where, you know, people - job interviewers might just come to see it as just what young people do these days: They text in job interviews, and it's not a big deal. CONAN: We're talking with Farhad Manjoo from Slate. com about, well, the future of technology, not just what's happening to us, as we've been talking about, but, well, what's going to be coming down the pike in terms of gadgets and what's going to be coming down the pike in terms of the business that has become such an important part of our economy. If you work in tech, what's changing? How will that change us? 800-989-8255. Email us: talk@npr. org. Mary's on the line with us from Berkeley. MARY: Hi, there. CONAN: Hi. MARY: Thank you for (technical difficulties). The observations that I want to share, just from working in the industry, and one of the big forces that I'm seeing is this sort of subscription-based economy and how that is impacting large companies. So what we're seeing is that there's a real expectation from the marketplace, from other companies and large companies, small companies, to not buy hardware and infrastructure, but instead to consume as - on a monthly basis with whole different levels of price points and margins that are really challenging companies to rise to the occasion to be able to provide these services and also stay profitable. So I don't think that that has hit Wall Street to the degree it certainly has impacted the earnings of companies that we've seen over the last two years, but I think there is more to come in that area. And I think that's going to be a pretty major economic shift. CONAN: Well, you're talking about the sort of HBO model, where you have to subscribe to this service, and expanding that to all kinds of things where - in areas where people were used to getting things for free? MARY: Well, I don't think it's just free. I think it is - you know, we call it a CAPEX expenditure. So when a large company goes in and they decide to buy hardware for their company, that has a whole level of price points and margins. And now the expectation from companies is that they don't want to buy that hardware, they want to buy it as a capital expenditure, like a subscription, where they're buying these services that are being delivered in a whole new way, such as through the cloud - not just software, but also infrastructure as a service. And that. . . CONAN: Farhad, I just wanted to ask if you've been following this, as well. MANJOO: Yeah. I mean this is happening all over the tech world. We notice this. You know, there's a whole new kind of companies that are, as the caller said, called cloud companies, where, you know, they're providing services that companies - bigger companies used to buy as kind of hardware. So, like, now if you're a startup, instead of having to buy a whole bunch of servers or rent servers to store all your data that you're going to be using on your website, instead you use something called Amazon Web Services, which. . . CONAN: OK, Farhad Manjoo is with us. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CONAN: This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. I'm Neal Conan. In the 1960s, \"The Jetsons\" memorably predicted the future, the year 2063, to be exact. We're halfway there, and much of that - what that animated family had - routine camping trips on the moon, a nine-hour work week, flying cars - seems unlikely to materialize 50 years from now. But some of the things that seemed wild when the Jetsons were on TV have actually happened, in a way. The Roomba is a kind of household robot. Flat screens are almost everywhere. And we can watch TV on our phones. So for the next installment of our series Looking Ahead, Slate's technology columnist Farhad Manjoo is here to weigh in on how far we've come and where we're going next. If you work in the tech business, we want to hear from you. What's changing, and how will our technology change us in the future? 800-989-8255. Email talk@npr. org. Farhad is with us from his office in Palo Alto. And as we look at the companies that have so dominated this business, particularly smartphones, there are giants like Samsung and Apple, of course. Is there room anymore for startups or somebody with a good idea? MANJOO: Yeah, I think so. I mean, those companies, Apple and Samsung and Google and Facebook, are huge, and it's difficult to find markets where they're not operating in. But every year we see, you know, several new companies come along that give us new services that those big companies haven't thought of. We saw this a couple years ago with Instagram, the photo-sharing service that got wildly popular, and then it was purchased by Facebook. We saw it also recently with the really popular cataloging, sharing site called Pinterest. And I think, you know, in a strange way, in a way that people here in Silicon Valley are celebrating, these big companies kind of help the little companies because they're a market where the little companies can one day kind of sell their - sell out to. So, you know, Instagram didn't really have any business model. It didn't - it wasn't making much money. But it found a willing buyer, and the people, the founders of Instagram made a lot of money by selling to Facebook because Facebook felt that it could make money from Instagram at some point, and Facebook paid a billion dollars for it. So that helped everyone. You know, people - that was a big incentive for startup developers everywhere to keep working on new companies. CONAN: We all saw the tech bubble, which burst memorably. Things have been going much better since then. There is some concern, though, we're in a new bubble. MANJOO: Yeah, you - every time things kind of heat up in Silicon Valley, people worry that, I mean that that experience in the early - in the late '90s was kind of a searing experience for many in the Valley, especially venture capitalists, who lost a lot of money. And I think people don't want to repeat the, you know, the bubbles popping, but they do want to repeat kind of the good times. So they're always sort of on this high wire where they're trying to get as much from these technology companies, they're trying to get the market to kind of go as big as possible but to make sure that we don't sort of cross over into the excessive territory, where really, really dumb ideas like pets. com are being funded. So it's hard to say. I mean it's always hard to say if you're in a bubble until you're - until the bubble pops. CONAN: Until it bursts, yeah, right. MANJOO: Yeah, so at this point, I mean I think people worry about it, but I think it's sort of instructive and probably helpful that there are people who are worrying about it and perhaps trying to make sure that the stupidest things don't get funded. CONAN: Let's go to Thomas, Thomas with us from Domain in Massachusetts. THOMAS: Hi, I just wanted to say that I work with - I create software for Verizon Wireless, and pretty much what the future holds is that it's no longer going to be just a phone company. We're trying to become a technology company. We're trying to make sure that in the future we create software and software integration and pretty much apps and some hardware for everything: your car, you appliance, and by appliance I mean dryer, washer, water heater, toaster, et cetera, your TV. Right now it's your phone and a few other things. So you know, you can only go so far when you are selling a certain product. So for example, that's just one example of a company that has been meddling with all these technology companies, and it's trying to expand in the terms of software. Definitely I think software is the future when it comes to technology. Thank you. CONAN: Thomas, thanks very much for the call, and he's talking about something, Farhad, that we keep anticipating, yet our experience at the beginning of this broadcast with Skype suggests that these things are just not quite reliable enough. MANJOO: I agree. You know, one of the things that is - seems true of our age and technology right now is that we have a lot of ways to do a certain thing. We have a lot of ways to, like, hold this phone call, for example. They all kind of work sometimes, but they're not perfect. And we've gotten used to kind of the imperfection, because instead of sort of perfect fidelity, perfect quality, what's more important to us is kind of convenience or something that is available everywhere. We saw this happen with MP3s, with music. Like MP3s, any audiophile will tell you that, you know, MP3 files that you listen to on your iPod aren't as good. They don't sound as good as, you know, as vinyl records or even as CDs. But you can't listen to a vinyl record, you know, when you're on the subway, and you can do that with MP3s. And we trade, I think we often trade convenience for quality. So like I - the Skype call, it cut out, but the good thing about the Skype call, when it works, is that it's free. I can call anywhere in the world for very cheap. There's video. And, you know, it's kind of available everywhere you have an Internet connection. So you can do it anywhere. You're not tied to landline carriers or cellular carriers, or you can - it's sort of everywhere and ubiquitous. And that's sort of what the Internet is getting us, this ubiquity, convenience, sometimes at the cost of quality. CONAN: Let's go next to Brian, and Brian's on the line with us from Silicon Valley. BRIAN: Yeah, I was curious if anybody has comments about how commercials and commercialism is creeping and becoming more pervasive in the mobile platform and set-top boxes that we're using. I've developed a lot of these devices, and we're actually putting hooks in so that you can't turn the commercials off and that, for example, on a very cheap laptop in a third world country, you may have dedicated space on a display that always shows commercials, but you get it very inexpensive. And we're doing the same thing with mobile platforms. There are more commercial delivery devices rather than content delivery devices, or certainly not content creative devices at all. CONAN: And Farhad, this goes back to the eternal conundrum of how do we get somebody to pay for this. MANJOO: Yeah, I mean it - like anyone, it bothers me that there are ads everywhere now, and there are going to be more ads over time because all of these devices, many of the services that we use on these devices, like all the websites that Google runs or Facebook runs, those are going to get paid for primarily through ads. And so that means that we're going to be seeing a lot more ads. On the other hand, you know, I really like the fact  that I get completely free, really great email service from Google, and I - you know, it's great that I don't have to pay anything for it. A dozen years ago, me or the company I work for would have had to pay Microsoft a lot of money for something like Microsoft Outlook, and it wasn't available everywhere. You know, I couldn't run it on my phone. Now I can get a really wonderful service for free, and all I have to do is look at some ads. I think many people accept that tradeoff implicitly, and they're OK with that tradeoff, but if you ask them about it, they kind of don't like it. And there's, you know, there are lots of programs you can get for your phone or for your Web browser that block the ads; it's just kind of like a, you know, a subversive way to get the free service but not pay for it by looking at ads. CONAN: Ryan, thank you. BRIAN: Thank you. CONAN: Let's go next to - this is Will, Will's on the line with us from Boulder. WILL: Hey there. CONAN: Go ahead. WILL: OK. Well, you know, I just wanted to call and talk about real quick, about Google Apps and other cloud-based services. I heard you guys talked about Amazon cloud earlier. But I work for a company up in Boulder called iSupportU, and my owner recently in a meeting was talking about how our job is constantly changing and how we don't provide technology services, essentially, anymore. I mean, currently, I'm the PC technician. You have a broken PC, broken sound, broken hard drive, I'll fix it. But in five years, that's not going to be around. We're going to be using Internet gateways. So we're going to be moving toward an entirely cloud-based system where you access all of your items in the cloud. Your OS is going to be online, and you just need a computer or a phone to be able to access that content. And, you know, we're in this business of support now, and the business of actual hardware - you know, I completely agree with the idea that software is where it is. But it's very interesting to see, you know, the explosion of Google apps where you can entirely run your business off of this Google infrastructure. CONAN: Farhad, is this - is he right? Is he working himself out of a job? MANJOO: Yeah. CONAN: This was to Farhad. MANJOO: I think he is right. I feel bad for him and for IT people in general because, you know, the office IT person, the person who would help you with your technology, I think that role is, sort of, going away, because what often is going to happen in companies - what's happening right now is people are bringing their own technology. People just want to use their own phone and their own laptop, and they're kind of managing it through services like Google. And the companies themselves are signing up for services like Google apps, so that, you know, they can just outsource everything to this big company that manages everything, and they don't have to hire local people to, kind of, fix your email or fix your - you know, anything else that's going on with your computer. It's, you know, it's another one of those ways that technology is kind of getting rid of some jobs, like travel agents, for example. CONAN: Wil, what are you going to do next? WILL: Well, you know, as I said to you - explain that it's an ever-changing environment, and we're in the business of support. You know, me, I'm actually getting certified in Google apps now so that I can provide that kind of service for my business. I'm changing with the environment and, with that, trying to create my own product. So I'm going to school for computer science right now, trying to develop my own application on the Web, and software is the way to go. And the more that we can bring to the cloud, the more that - you know, the more money that I can make, personally, in the different areas. But the biggest thing is that we need to keep up with the change as IT individuals and stay in the business of support, not in the business of hardware. CONAN: Wil, thanks very much. Good luck to you. WILL: Thank you. CONAN: We're talking with Farhad Manjoo, one of our series of conversations, \"Looking Ahead. \" You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. And as we look ahead, we would not have anticipated 10 years ago the iPad, which has become almost universal. The smartphone has developed to the point where people say, well, you know, it's really not going to develop too much further. Where are we going? MANJOO: It's a good question. I think people who are kind of watching the way that smartphones and tablets are, you know, integrating into our lives and, for many people, replacing PCs, replacing sort of the functions that they used to do on traditional desktop or laptop computers, people who are watching this kind of wonder where it's going. I don't quite know, in two years or five years, how much of my computing I'll do on a device like the iPad versus the desktop computer I'm using to - I use to write most of my articles at this point. There are people I know already who write long stories on the iPad. They do it by just sort of attaching an external keyboard. And the fact that the iPad has, you know, 10 hours of battery life, obviously it can sort of connect to the Internet anywhere, and it's so small and light, makes it preferable to them over, you know, a large PC, even a small laptop. It's better than that. So I wonder if more people will, kind of, move to those kinds of devices because they're just - as I said, they may not be good enough for all tasks, but the fact that they're everywhere, they're convenient, makes them, maybe for some people, kind of preferable to old-school computers. CONAN: And are we going to finally get those breakthroughs that we continually get promised? Google Glasses, for one. MANJOO: We think Google Glasses are going to come out. Most people who watch Google thinks that this year or next year they'll release this product to the public. So these are glasses that you wear that - they're not actual glasses. They don't have like a - they don't block out most of your vision with glass. Instead, there's a small, tiny screen that kind of sits a little bit above your eye so you can look at it from your - when you tilt your eye up. And it shows you, you know, a digital screen. It kind of superimposes information that you used to kind of get from your cell phone, like a text message or maps. It superimposes that onto your field of vision. That's going to come out. The question is whether people will take to it. I think some people will use it, but I wonder if it's going to be as - if it's going to sort of take off in the way that the smartphone has, you know, where it's something that everyone got - and people - lots of people use and it's not seen as kind of lame. Or, you know, like the other technology is like Bluetooth headsets. Like lots of people use them, but I think that in kind of polite company, they're considered - it's a little like a faux pas to wear a Bluetooth headset to a fancy dinner, and people who do it, they're marked as a certain kind of person that you maybe not - don't want to be friends with. CONAN: There's another promise we've all been made. Typing, we will no longer have to do. The touch screen will go away. All we have to do is talk to our computers. MANJOO: Yeah. That - I mean, that's definitely going to come. The - I don't think typing is going to go away, but there are going to be more and more situations where we'll talk to our computers and - than, you know, where we type. That's because the technology is getting much better so speech recognition systems now can, you know, detect what you're saying even if you have an accent. And they're getting better at, kind of, just figuring out what you're saying but also at coming up with like holding conversations with these, so they understand pronouns. There's like Google search engine, if you use it on your mobile phone, you can ask it a question like who is Barack Obama, it'll tell you he's the president. And then you can say who is his wife? They used like a pronoun there referring to Obama. The computer will understand that you meant Barack Obama's wife and it'll tell you, you know, he's married to Michelle Obama. CONAN: Well, Farhad, as usual, it's a revelation. Thank you so much for the conversation. MANJOO: Thanks a lot. Good to be here. CONAN: Farhad Manjoo is with us from his office in Palo Alto. He tried to get on by Skype, we trusted him. Coming up next, we'll be talking to NPR's Lourdes Garcia-Navarro who's got a new gig in Brazil. She joins us to talk about changing beats - reporting beats that is, not bossa nova. Stay with us. It's the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. NEAL CONAN, HOST:  This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan, in Washington. Technology's already changed our lives in ways we couldn't have imagined just a few years ago, and now seems ready to reinvent our future. As we continue our series of conversations looking ahead, we've invited Farhad Manjoo to join us - he's Slate's technology columnist and a frequent guest on this program - on the latest gadgets, on the business of consumer electronics and on how we've adapted our lives, our jobs and our manners to all these changes. We want to hear from those of you who work in tech. What's changing, and how will it change us? Join us: 800-989-8255. Email us: talk@npr. org. You can also join the conversation on our website. That's at npr. org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION. Later in the program, NPR's Lourdes Garcia-Navarro joins us from her new post in Brazil. But first, looking ahead with Farhad Manjoo, who joins us now from his office in Palo Alto. Nice to have you back with us. FARHAD MANJOO: Hi, good to be here. CONAN: And that's rumblings of a Skype as we stumble a bit there. Farhad, we'll get to the new stuff in a bit. I wanted to start by asking you: What surprises you about how we use the devices that are now so omnipresent in our lives? MANJOO: Well, I think one of the things that surprises me is how quickly we've sort of gotten used to - they've integrated into our - they've - sorry, I think we a problem with Skype there for a second. CONAN: All right, we're on the phone now (unintelligible). MANJOO: Yes, we're on the phone now. I had to switch. This is - this sort of explains what I was trying to get at. We - technology kind of behaves in unexpected ways. It's integrated into our culture. But like as we saw with the way Reddit tried to capture the Boston bombers a couple weeks ago, all of a sudden, technology will sort of rear up in a way that we hadn't really expected, and then we'll all have to try to figure out, you know, what role it's playing in our lives these days. CONAN: So crowdsource the investigation. MANJOO: Yeah, that's what they tried to do a couple weeks ago, and as a result, they - you know, on - by looking at security camera pictures and other photos of the bombing, of the crowd around the bombing, they wrongly - people on Reddit wrongly fingered several, you know, innocent people as being possible suspects. That's the way in which - I think it suggests both the potential, you know, potentially, we could have gotten the bombers that way, but we didn't, and suggests the downside of technology in our lives. CONAN: As reporters, we're used to being in the situation where we're not necessarily experiencing something directly, but trying to record our observations, to communicate them to a wider audience. More and more, you see everybody is in that situation. People don't go to watch a ballgame. People go to take pictures of themselves watching a ballgame, and then send text messages. MANJOO: Yeah, I used to - that used to bother me when I would go - you notice this especially at, like, concerts, at rock concerts and other things, where people - you expect people to kind of experience the event. And now we want to record the event for, I think, some kind of posterity, but oftentimes, we don't ever go back to those videos. And so that used to bother me until I had kids. So, like, two years ago, you know, my son is two and a half, and now I actually have a small - a baby. And now, I try to - I get upset at myself for not recording. I try to record kind of every moment, because I think that it would be kind of magical in, you know, 10 years or 20 years to kind of go back to those videos. And I expect that those videos are going to be searchable, so that even if it seems like a mess right now, even if it seems like there's no kind of organization to all the little videos that I'm getting of my son, like, learning to talk, at some point, there will be some organization, and maybe I can make something coherent of it. And it will be interesting just to go back to some random day and figure out, like, what he was interested in when he was two and a half. CONAN: It will be curious to see the extent to which technology allows you to access that without going through it minute by minute and taking notes, the way we do it now. MANJOO: Yeah. I mean, I think that one of the things we're noticing is that, you know, companies like Google, companies that kind of analyze - whose mission it is to analyze and organize information are, you know, they started out cataloging the Web, public information. But more and more, they're focused on cataloging your private information. So, you know, my photos, I manage them in a program called Picasa, which is owned by Google, and it does face recognition. So now I can go through my photos based on pictures of, you know, my family and kind of see all the photos of my son or all the photos of my mom, which would have been very difficult, you know, 10 years ago. The technology didn't exist to organize photos in that way. And now - so I - now I don't spend any time organizing my photos. I just put everything on my computer, and I expect the software will organize it for me. And I think more and more, that's what's happening. We'll be able to organize all of our personal data in the kind of the way we're used to having, you know, public data organized. CONAN: Yet by doing that, you raise an interesting point. All of us talk about, well, we want privacy. We want to make sure these companies aren't hawking our images elsewhere or using our personal information to sell our identities in some way or another to advertisers. Yet we all put more and more of our personal lives on the Web. MANJOO: Yeah. This is the great paradox of social networking. You know, for the last six, seven years, as Facebook has become a bigger force in our lives, you know, every time Facebook made more - made some part of its site more public, there's been a huge outcry. And, you know, people get really upset, and they join groups on Facebook where they claim they're going to stop using Facebook, and they never do because - and what happens is Facebook's, sort of, traffic always goes up. And I think that indicates that while people say they want privacy, they're also, you know, as human beings, we're deeply social, and we like to share things. And so it's not that people want privacy all the time or want to share things all the time. What's difficult is figuring out when we want privacy and when we want to share things. And that line, I think, technology is helping that line move. So, you know, now people share things that they wouldn't have, you know, 10 years ago. They share very personal, intimate details of their lives and their medical histories and, you know, their romantic interests online in a way that would have, I think, seemed awkward 10 years ago, five years ago, even. And now it seems acceptable to people. CONAN: It's amazing what has become acceptable, the idea of people walking down the street apparently talking to themselves. It would have gotten you a quick ride to Bellevue in New York City a few years ago, but it's now commonplace. And it is the degree to which people are in communication with their friends, their universe via text messages in situations where you wouldn't think that would apply at all. MANJOO: Yeah. It's become commonplace. But I guess I would also say that we still haven't figure out the rules for these - the etiquette and the norms for how we should use these devices in life. So I read - I read a story recently about - that was interviewing HR managers, people who were hiring young people. And one of the complaints of these interviewers is that many young people, many college graduates are going into interviews and - into job interviews, and they don't realize that they're not supposed to text. And some people are kind of reaching for their phones and looking at their phones while they're in job interviews. And, you know, that's - at first, I found that hard to believe, but then when I thought about most people I meet every day, that seems very - that seemed, actually, like, not unsurprising. And then so what I think, you know, this will either - this will evolve in one of two ways. Either it will sort of have a rule, kind of an etiquette about how we should use our phones, and that etiquette might say if you're in a formal situation like a job interview, you should not use your phone, and people would sort of come to adhere to that. Or I think the opposite could happen, where, you know, people - job interviewers might just come to see it as just what young people do these days: They text in job interviews, and it's not a big deal. CONAN: We're talking with Farhad Manjoo from Slate. com about, well, the future of technology, not just what's happening to us, as we've been talking about, but, well, what's going to be coming down the pike in terms of gadgets and what's going to be coming down the pike in terms of the business that has become such an important part of our economy. If you work in tech, what's changing? How will that change us? 800-989-8255. Email us: talk@npr. org. Mary's on the line with us from Berkeley. MARY: Hi, there. CONAN: Hi. MARY: Thank you for (technical difficulties). The observations that I want to share, just from working in the industry, and one of the big forces that I'm seeing is this sort of subscription-based economy and how that is impacting large companies. So what we're seeing is that there's a real expectation from the marketplace, from other companies and large companies, small companies, to not buy hardware and infrastructure, but instead to consume as - on a monthly basis with whole different levels of price points and margins that are really challenging companies to rise to the occasion to be able to provide these services and also stay profitable. So I don't think that that has hit Wall Street to the degree it certainly has impacted the earnings of companies that we've seen over the last two years, but I think there is more to come in that area. And I think that's going to be a pretty major economic shift. CONAN: Well, you're talking about the sort of HBO model, where you have to subscribe to this service, and expanding that to all kinds of things where - in areas where people were used to getting things for free? MARY: Well, I don't think it's just free. I think it is - you know, we call it a CAPEX expenditure. So when a large company goes in and they decide to buy hardware for their company, that has a whole level of price points and margins. And now the expectation from companies is that they don't want to buy that hardware, they want to buy it as a capital expenditure, like a subscription, where they're buying these services that are being delivered in a whole new way, such as through the cloud - not just software, but also infrastructure as a service. And that. . . CONAN: Farhad, I just wanted to ask if you've been following this, as well. MANJOO: Yeah. I mean this is happening all over the tech world. We notice this. You know, there's a whole new kind of companies that are, as the caller said, called cloud companies, where, you know, they're providing services that companies - bigger companies used to buy as kind of hardware. So, like, now if you're a startup, instead of having to buy a whole bunch of servers or rent servers to store all your data that you're going to be using on your website, instead you use something called Amazon Web Services, which. . . CONAN: OK, Farhad Manjoo is with us. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) CONAN: This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. I'm Neal Conan. In the 1960s, \"The Jetsons\" memorably predicted the future, the year 2063, to be exact. We're halfway there, and much of that - what that animated family had - routine camping trips on the moon, a nine-hour work week, flying cars - seems unlikely to materialize 50 years from now. But some of the things that seemed wild when the Jetsons were on TV have actually happened, in a way. The Roomba is a kind of household robot. Flat screens are almost everywhere. And we can watch TV on our phones. So for the next installment of our series Looking Ahead, Slate's technology columnist Farhad Manjoo is here to weigh in on how far we've come and where we're going next. If you work in the tech business, we want to hear from you. What's changing, and how will our technology change us in the future? 800-989-8255. Email talk@npr. org. Farhad is with us from his office in Palo Alto. And as we look at the companies that have so dominated this business, particularly smartphones, there are giants like Samsung and Apple, of course. Is there room anymore for startups or somebody with a good idea? MANJOO: Yeah, I think so. I mean, those companies, Apple and Samsung and Google and Facebook, are huge, and it's difficult to find markets where they're not operating in. But every year we see, you know, several new companies come along that give us new services that those big companies haven't thought of. We saw this a couple years ago with Instagram, the photo-sharing service that got wildly popular, and then it was purchased by Facebook. We saw it also recently with the really popular cataloging, sharing site called Pinterest. And I think, you know, in a strange way, in a way that people here in Silicon Valley are celebrating, these big companies kind of help the little companies because they're a market where the little companies can one day kind of sell their - sell out to. So, you know, Instagram didn't really have any business model. It didn't - it wasn't making much money. But it found a willing buyer, and the people, the founders of Instagram made a lot of money by selling to Facebook because Facebook felt that it could make money from Instagram at some point, and Facebook paid a billion dollars for it. So that helped everyone. You know, people - that was a big incentive for startup developers everywhere to keep working on new companies. CONAN: We all saw the tech bubble, which burst memorably. Things have been going much better since then. There is some concern, though, we're in a new bubble. MANJOO: Yeah, you - every time things kind of heat up in Silicon Valley, people worry that, I mean that that experience in the early - in the late '90s was kind of a searing experience for many in the Valley, especially venture capitalists, who lost a lot of money. And I think people don't want to repeat the, you know, the bubbles popping, but they do want to repeat kind of the good times. So they're always sort of on this high wire where they're trying to get as much from these technology companies, they're trying to get the market to kind of go as big as possible but to make sure that we don't sort of cross over into the excessive territory, where really, really dumb ideas like pets. com are being funded. So it's hard to say. I mean it's always hard to say if you're in a bubble until you're - until the bubble pops. CONAN: Until it bursts, yeah, right. MANJOO: Yeah, so at this point, I mean I think people worry about it, but I think it's sort of instructive and probably helpful that there are people who are worrying about it and perhaps trying to make sure that the stupidest things don't get funded. CONAN: Let's go to Thomas, Thomas with us from Domain in Massachusetts. THOMAS: Hi, I just wanted to say that I work with - I create software for Verizon Wireless, and pretty much what the future holds is that it's no longer going to be just a phone company. We're trying to become a technology company. We're trying to make sure that in the future we create software and software integration and pretty much apps and some hardware for everything: your car, you appliance, and by appliance I mean dryer, washer, water heater, toaster, et cetera, your TV. Right now it's your phone and a few other things. So you know, you can only go so far when you are selling a certain product. So for example, that's just one example of a company that has been meddling with all these technology companies, and it's trying to expand in the terms of software. Definitely I think software is the future when it comes to technology. Thank you. CONAN: Thomas, thanks very much for the call, and he's talking about something, Farhad, that we keep anticipating, yet our experience at the beginning of this broadcast with Skype suggests that these things are just not quite reliable enough. MANJOO: I agree. You know, one of the things that is - seems true of our age and technology right now is that we have a lot of ways to do a certain thing. We have a lot of ways to, like, hold this phone call, for example. They all kind of work sometimes, but they're not perfect. And we've gotten used to kind of the imperfection, because instead of sort of perfect fidelity, perfect quality, what's more important to us is kind of convenience or something that is available everywhere. We saw this happen with MP3s, with music. Like MP3s, any audiophile will tell you that, you know, MP3 files that you listen to on your iPod aren't as good. They don't sound as good as, you know, as vinyl records or even as CDs. But you can't listen to a vinyl record, you know, when you're on the subway, and you can do that with MP3s. And we trade, I think we often trade convenience for quality. So like I - the Skype call, it cut out, but the good thing about the Skype call, when it works, is that it's free. I can call anywhere in the world for very cheap. There's video. And, you know, it's kind of available everywhere you have an Internet connection. So you can do it anywhere. You're not tied to landline carriers or cellular carriers, or you can - it's sort of everywhere and ubiquitous. And that's sort of what the Internet is getting us, this ubiquity, convenience, sometimes at the cost of quality. CONAN: Let's go next to Brian, and Brian's on the line with us from Silicon Valley. BRIAN: Yeah, I was curious if anybody has comments about how commercials and commercialism is creeping and becoming more pervasive in the mobile platform and set-top boxes that we're using. I've developed a lot of these devices, and we're actually putting hooks in so that you can't turn the commercials off and that, for example, on a very cheap laptop in a third world country, you may have dedicated space on a display that always shows commercials, but you get it very inexpensive. And we're doing the same thing with mobile platforms. There are more commercial delivery devices rather than content delivery devices, or certainly not content creative devices at all. CONAN: And Farhad, this goes back to the eternal conundrum of how do we get somebody to pay for this. MANJOO: Yeah, I mean it - like anyone, it bothers me that there are ads everywhere now, and there are going to be more ads over time because all of these devices, many of the services that we use on these devices, like all the websites that Google runs or Facebook runs, those are going to get paid for primarily through ads. And so that means that we're going to be seeing a lot more ads. On the other hand, you know, I really like the fact  that I get completely free, really great email service from Google, and I - you know, it's great that I don't have to pay anything for it. A dozen years ago, me or the company I work for would have had to pay Microsoft a lot of money for something like Microsoft Outlook, and it wasn't available everywhere. You know, I couldn't run it on my phone. Now I can get a really wonderful service for free, and all I have to do is look at some ads. I think many people accept that tradeoff implicitly, and they're OK with that tradeoff, but if you ask them about it, they kind of don't like it. And there's, you know, there are lots of programs you can get for your phone or for your Web browser that block the ads; it's just kind of like a, you know, a subversive way to get the free service but not pay for it by looking at ads. CONAN: Ryan, thank you. BRIAN: Thank you. CONAN: Let's go next to - this is Will, Will's on the line with us from Boulder. WILL: Hey there. CONAN: Go ahead. WILL: OK. Well, you know, I just wanted to call and talk about real quick, about Google Apps and other cloud-based services. I heard you guys talked about Amazon cloud earlier. But I work for a company up in Boulder called iSupportU, and my owner recently in a meeting was talking about how our job is constantly changing and how we don't provide technology services, essentially, anymore. I mean, currently, I'm the PC technician. You have a broken PC, broken sound, broken hard drive, I'll fix it. But in five years, that's not going to be around. We're going to be using Internet gateways. So we're going to be moving toward an entirely cloud-based system where you access all of your items in the cloud. Your OS is going to be online, and you just need a computer or a phone to be able to access that content. And, you know, we're in this business of support now, and the business of actual hardware - you know, I completely agree with the idea that software is where it is. But it's very interesting to see, you know, the explosion of Google apps where you can entirely run your business off of this Google infrastructure. CONAN: Farhad, is this - is he right? Is he working himself out of a job? MANJOO: Yeah. CONAN: This was to Farhad. MANJOO: I think he is right. I feel bad for him and for IT people in general because, you know, the office IT person, the person who would help you with your technology, I think that role is, sort of, going away, because what often is going to happen in companies - what's happening right now is people are bringing their own technology. People just want to use their own phone and their own laptop, and they're kind of managing it through services like Google. And the companies themselves are signing up for services like Google apps, so that, you know, they can just outsource everything to this big company that manages everything, and they don't have to hire local people to, kind of, fix your email or fix your - you know, anything else that's going on with your computer. It's, you know, it's another one of those ways that technology is kind of getting rid of some jobs, like travel agents, for example. CONAN: Wil, what are you going to do next? WILL: Well, you know, as I said to you - explain that it's an ever-changing environment, and we're in the business of support. You know, me, I'm actually getting certified in Google apps now so that I can provide that kind of service for my business. I'm changing with the environment and, with that, trying to create my own product. So I'm going to school for computer science right now, trying to develop my own application on the Web, and software is the way to go. And the more that we can bring to the cloud, the more that - you know, the more money that I can make, personally, in the different areas. But the biggest thing is that we need to keep up with the change as IT individuals and stay in the business of support, not in the business of hardware. CONAN: Wil, thanks very much. Good luck to you. WILL: Thank you. CONAN: We're talking with Farhad Manjoo, one of our series of conversations, \"Looking Ahead. \" You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. And as we look ahead, we would not have anticipated 10 years ago the iPad, which has become almost universal. The smartphone has developed to the point where people say, well, you know, it's really not going to develop too much further. Where are we going? MANJOO: It's a good question. I think people who are kind of watching the way that smartphones and tablets are, you know, integrating into our lives and, for many people, replacing PCs, replacing sort of the functions that they used to do on traditional desktop or laptop computers, people who are watching this kind of wonder where it's going. I don't quite know, in two years or five years, how much of my computing I'll do on a device like the iPad versus the desktop computer I'm using to - I use to write most of my articles at this point. There are people I know already who write long stories on the iPad. They do it by just sort of attaching an external keyboard. And the fact that the iPad has, you know, 10 hours of battery life, obviously it can sort of connect to the Internet anywhere, and it's so small and light, makes it preferable to them over, you know, a large PC, even a small laptop. It's better than that. So I wonder if more people will, kind of, move to those kinds of devices because they're just - as I said, they may not be good enough for all tasks, but the fact that they're everywhere, they're convenient, makes them, maybe for some people, kind of preferable to old-school computers. CONAN: And are we going to finally get those breakthroughs that we continually get promised? Google Glasses, for one. MANJOO: We think Google Glasses are going to come out. Most people who watch Google thinks that this year or next year they'll release this product to the public. So these are glasses that you wear that - they're not actual glasses. They don't have like a - they don't block out most of your vision with glass. Instead, there's a small, tiny screen that kind of sits a little bit above your eye so you can look at it from your - when you tilt your eye up. And it shows you, you know, a digital screen. It kind of superimposes information that you used to kind of get from your cell phone, like a text message or maps. It superimposes that onto your field of vision. That's going to come out. The question is whether people will take to it. I think some people will use it, but I wonder if it's going to be as - if it's going to sort of take off in the way that the smartphone has, you know, where it's something that everyone got - and people - lots of people use and it's not seen as kind of lame. Or, you know, like the other technology is like Bluetooth headsets. Like lots of people use them, but I think that in kind of polite company, they're considered - it's a little like a faux pas to wear a Bluetooth headset to a fancy dinner, and people who do it, they're marked as a certain kind of person that you maybe not - don't want to be friends with. CONAN: There's another promise we've all been made. Typing, we will no longer have to do. The touch screen will go away. All we have to do is talk to our computers. MANJOO: Yeah. That - I mean, that's definitely going to come. The - I don't think typing is going to go away, but there are going to be more and more situations where we'll talk to our computers and - than, you know, where we type. That's because the technology is getting much better so speech recognition systems now can, you know, detect what you're saying even if you have an accent. And they're getting better at, kind of, just figuring out what you're saying but also at coming up with like holding conversations with these, so they understand pronouns. There's like Google search engine, if you use it on your mobile phone, you can ask it a question like who is Barack Obama, it'll tell you he's the president. And then you can say who is his wife? They used like a pronoun there referring to Obama. The computer will understand that you meant Barack Obama's wife and it'll tell you, you know, he's married to Michelle Obama. CONAN: Well, Farhad, as usual, it's a revelation. Thank you so much for the conversation. MANJOO: Thanks a lot. Good to be here. CONAN: Farhad Manjoo is with us from his office in Palo Alto. He tried to get on by Skype, we trusted him. Coming up next, we'll be talking to NPR's Lourdes Garcia-Navarro who's got a new gig in Brazil. She joins us to talk about changing beats - reporting beats that is, not bossa nova. Stay with us.

It's called the Marketplace Fairness Act. And proponents say it's necessary to level the playing field with brick-and-mortar stores, as well as to raise revenue for states. But some online retailers are crying foul. They say that with 9,600 tax jurisdictions around the country, collecting sales taxes will b a nightmare. NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Simply put, the new law would require any online retailer with over a million dollars in annual sales to collect and remit sales tax. Joseph Henchman, a vice president at the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, says it's not that simple. He says at about five pages of text, the bill is unusually brief. And, he says, it doesn't come close to matching how complex collecting sales tax can get. JOSEPH HENCHMAN: It also doesn't include a lot of detail about implementation. NOGUCHI: For example, the bill says states will have to provide businesses automated tax software free of charge. But what if a business' existing systems don't work with the available tax software? Who pays? What if a state doesn't provide adequate software? Where does a business takes its complaint? These are the types of questions that dog Stacey Strawn. She's president of Silver Gallery, a gift shop that has a small storefront in Waynesboro, Virginia, but which does the lion's share of its $3 million in annual sales online and over the phone. She says trying to comply would be daunting. STACEY STRAWN: It's going to be a nightmare. NOGUCHI: If the law passes, she'd have to collect taxes for every purchase, then remit them to every state and local government where her customers live. She says software that automates tax collection is not a plug-and-play solution that meets all needs. STRAWN: Something gets exchanged, then it's sent to another state, then we have to figure out how to refund the taxes from the first state, collect our refund from that state, then charge the customer the new tax. NOGUCHI: Strawn estimates it would cost $15,000 to set up, plus ongoing tech support, costs, she says, she can't pass along to her customers without losing business. And let's say she gets audited out of state. What then, she asks? STRAWN: As a small business owner, accountants are - whoo - not only is it expensive but hard to find one people who are in tune with your business to begin with. NOGUCHI: Proponents of the law say automated tax software has been around for years and works, despite the huge variability in tax rates across the country. Charles Collins is director of government affairs for Taxware, a tax software maker. He says a lot of Strawn's concerns are misplaced. For one thing, companies like his would provide tech support to businesses. Also, he argues, technology simplifies most processes, including returns and exchanges, as well as handling audits. Under the bill, Collins says if a business gets audited, the state and the software company would largely handle the burden. CHARLES COLLINS: We or the state would be responsible for resolving those issues. It wouldn't be any issue that the seller would have to pay. NOGUCHI: Scott McFarlane is CEO of another automated taxware firm called Avalara. He agrees details of the law need to be fleshed out. But the complexities, he says, are overstated. SCOTT MCFARLANE: There are certainly questions. But I think that they're probably not as difficult of an issue as people are making them. NOGUCHI: But the Tax Foundation's Henchman says he has another bigger beef with the bill. He argues it's forging an entirely new frontier for taxes. Historically, taxes have always been tied to a physical location. People pay income tax where they live because that's where they use social services. Stores have paid taxes where they operate because they use local roads and so forth. But this bill is a proposal to collect taxes beyond geographic location. HENCHMAN: And that creates a lot of implications for where are we going with everything else. Do we apply that to income tax too? If you're a business traveler who are just in the state, or if you participate in conference calls with the state, is that enough to bring you within the scope? NOGUCHI: The bill now faces more opposition in the Republican-controlled House. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News, Washington.

I'm Melissa Block. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: I'm Audie Cornish. And it's time now for All Tech Considered. (SOUNDBITE OF THEME MUSIC)CORNISH: YouTube, the website that made its name as the place where you can broadcast yourself, is on the verge of launching a subscription service. NPR's Laura Sydell joins us now to talk more about it. And, Laura, what is YouTube up to? LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE: My sources are telling me that initially, this is going to be kind of a limited. But essentially, what they're going to do is put up a paywall, meaning, if you want to see certain content, you're going to have to put in your credit card and pay a fee. And according to several reports, viewers could subscribe to a channel for as little as $1. 99 a month. CORNISH: But why are they doing it? SYDELL: I think it's been a planned evolution. Back in 2011, YouTube added a pay-for-movies feature. A couple years ago, they laid out more than $100 million and gave it to professionals to create content for YouTube. So Madonna oversaw the development of a dance channel, and the money from those channels has been coming from advertising. But the revenue remains well below what traditional TV makes from advertising, so I think this is an opportunity, perhaps, to try a different kind of pay model. CORNISH: But we're all used to getting content for free on YouTube. What sort of content do they think someone's going to pay for? SYDELL: Hah, good question. You know, I spoke with one analyst, and that's exactly what he was wondering. But he also mentioned some intriguing possibilities. For example, you could have a San Francisco Giants channel that had backstories about the players, conversations about what was going on in the locker room -before and after - and it's the kind of content that, you know, a die hard fan might really pay for but wouldn't really work on traditional TV because it's kind of too narrowly focused. CORNISH: And it seems like the world of online content that you can pay for is growing - I mean, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and now YouTube. SYDELL: Exactly. And the number of subscribers to Hulu doubled to four million. And Netflix has been growing, so I think it's a question now of how many places do you want to subscribe as we move forward. But there's going to be a lot more of this. CORNISH: That's NPR's Laura Sydell. Laura, thank you. SYDELL: You're welcome. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:  This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Melissa Block. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  I'm Audie Cornish. And it's time now for All Tech Considered. (SOUNDBITE OF THEME MUSIC) CORNISH: YouTube, the website that made its name as the place where you can broadcast yourself, is on the verge of launching a subscription service. NPR's Laura Sydell joins us now to talk more about it. And, Laura, what is YouTube up to? LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE: My sources are telling me that initially, this is going to be kind of a limited. But essentially, what they're going to do is put up a paywall, meaning, if you want to see certain content, you're going to have to put in your credit card and pay a fee. And according to several reports, viewers could subscribe to a channel for as little as $1. 99 a month. CORNISH: But why are they doing it? SYDELL: I think it's been a planned evolution. Back in 2011, YouTube added a pay-for-movies feature. A couple years ago, they laid out more than $100 million and gave it to professionals to create content for YouTube. So Madonna oversaw the development of a dance channel, and the money from those channels has been coming from advertising. But the revenue remains well below what traditional TV makes from advertising, so I think this is an opportunity, perhaps, to try a different kind of pay model. CORNISH: But we're all used to getting content for free on YouTube. What sort of content do they think someone's going to pay for? SYDELL: Hah, good question. You know, I spoke with one analyst, and that's exactly what he was wondering. But he also mentioned some intriguing possibilities. For example, you could have a San Francisco Giants channel that had backstories about the players, conversations about what was going on in the locker room -before and after - and it's the kind of content that, you know, a die hard fan might really pay for but wouldn't really work on traditional TV because it's kind of too narrowly focused. CORNISH: And it seems like the world of online content that you can pay for is growing - I mean, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and now YouTube. SYDELL: Exactly. And the number of subscribers to Hulu doubled to four million. And Netflix has been growing, so I think it's a question now of how many places do you want to subscribe as we move forward. But there's going to be a lot more of this. CORNISH: That's NPR's Laura Sydell. Laura, thank you. SYDELL: You're welcome.", "section": "Technology", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2013 NPR.

For centuries, explorers tried to find the fabled city in the jungle of Nicaragua and Honduras. Protected by white water, coral snakes, stinging plants and brutal topography, the White City remained an archeologist dream. But with a new application of recent technology, a documentary filmmaker, not an archeologist, found the White City. In The New Yorker magazine, Douglas Preston tells the story of Steve Elkin's amazing discoveries. Doug Preston is an author and contributing writer at National Geographic, The Atlantic and Smithsonian magazine. His piece, \"The El Dorado Machine,\" is in the May 6th edition of The New Yorker, and he joins us from his home in Santa Fe. Welcome to TALK OF THE NATION. DOUGLAS PRESTON: Thank you. CONAN: And the El Dorado Machine, well, it turns out it's an old Cessna with a new piece of equipment in it. PRESTON: That's right. It has a huge box that they call the LiDAR machine which basically can pierce through the jungle's foliage and map whatsoever on the ground underneath. CONAN: And this LiDAR machine can penetrate even triple canopy rainforest. PRESTON: It's absolutely incredible. It strips it out completely. And you can actually see something as small as a meter on a side, sitting on the ground underneath this incredibly dense rainforest. CONAN: And this rainforest, it turns out even sites that had been discovered by archeologists before that the LiDAR technique from the air found vastly more than the archeologists ever suspected. PRESTON: It's absolutely incredible. It's a revolution in archeology that, for example, they recently mapped the Mayan city of Caracol in Belize. And archeologists had been mapping this city for 25 years and they flew - for five days they flew this machine over the city of Caracol and they found that the archeologists had missed 90 percent of what was there. The archeologists had missed temples, pyramids, roads, terracing, caves, tombs - it was unbelievable what the LiDAR machine was able to see that the archeologists had missed. CONAN: Well, that brings us to the story of the White City which had been, well, an archeologists dream as we suspect - as we said, for centuries. And well, it's sort of a legend in Guatemala. PRESTON: Well, it really is a legend. In fact, most archeologists really didn't believe it existed. It was first mentioned by Cortez when he was exploring the coast. He heard about golden provinces in the interior. There are a lot of Spanish rumors. And in the early part of the 20th century, a number of American explorers and adventurers went into the jungles of Honduras looking for the White City. They also called it the Lost City of a Monkey God. And there are a bunch of explorers who claim to have found it actually but they were just finding large ruins. So about 20 years ago, or 15 years ago, a scientist at the jet propulsion laboratory in Pasadena noticed from looking at satellite imagery that this very remote valley in the mountains of Honduras showed what he thought were unnatural curvilinear and rectilinear features that might hide a city. And - but no one has ever been able to get to this valley. It's absolutely - it's almost impossible to get there. The jungle is so thick, the mountains are so high and there's so much, you know, dangerous animals and white water and so forth. So no one was able to explore this valley. So Steve Elkins managed to persuade the National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping which is a group at the University of Houston, financed by the National Science Foundation, to explore the city from the air and map it or map the valley from the air to see if anything was there. CONAN: And that raises a question. Some of the scientist you talk to sniffed contemptuously that this was an adventure, an Indiana Jones-type. This wasn't real science. PRESTON: Well, there's a lot of controversy now in archaeology over the use of LIDAR. I mean, LIDAR is an extremely expensive technology. It cost half a million dollars to survey this valley, and archaeologists are a very impecunious group. They don't have a lot of money. They don't have the kind of financing that some of the other scientists get. So they look at LIDAR as being too expensive. It's a technology that they don't understand - some of them. Engineers run it, not archaeologists. So there was a - so a number of archaeologists look askance at this search. They didn't think that anything would be found. Or if they find something, it wouldn't be very important. CONAN: Tell us a little bit about Steve Elkins. PRESTON: Well, he's a filmmaker. He's an amazing person. He's one of these - he's a true adventurer. I guess he's sort of a kid who never grew up. I'm kind of like that too. I mean, I never stopped dreaming about finding lost cities and being the first one in Egyptian tombs and that sort of thing. And he's sort of like that. And he had fallen in love 20 years ago with this whole White City legend and had been trying to find a way into this valley where this JPL Scientist has been seeing something for 20 years. And he organized an expedition. It was washed out by Hurricane Mitch. And then he heard about LIDAR, and he said, wow, this is the way to find stuff in the jungle. Instead of sliding on the ground, let's fly over this valley and see if there's anything in there. So he called me up and he said, hey, do you want to be part of this expedition? CONAN: And you, of course, agreed and ran down to Central America and ended up as, well, I guess, extra cargo in the back of a very rickety old plane. PRESTON: Well, you know, I have to be honest with you. I really didn't believe that they were going to find anything in this valley. It was such a crazy idea. I mean - and when I looked at the images that the JPL scientists had been looking at, to me, they look like a Rorschach test. I mean, you stared at it long enough and you could see anything in there. I mean, I could see Jimmy Hoffa's body if I looked long enough. But - so I didn't think we're going to find anything. But I thought, well, gee, you know, I'm a journalist, like, you know, I got to do my job. So they jammed me in the back of this plane. There was no place for me. They actually had to remove some safety equipment to get me in there. And we took off. We were flying out of the island of Roatan, which is off the coast of Honduras, deep into the interior mountains, absolutely, incredibly remote. I just couldn't believe how remote this was. And so, you know, we flew to the mainland and inland and then picked our way through the mountains and then pretty soon arrived at this valley which has never been explored. There's no evidence that anyone has ever been in there - and started mapping. CONAN: And it is amazing because the LIDAR shoots billions of bursts of energy down to the ground. And then there's computer magic that can measure exactly how far off the surface of the ground the signal is returned so it can eliminate all the leaves and the wood from the trees and that sort of thing and then give you a picture of the ground. PRESTON: That's it. It's a very interesting technology. It shoots this - 125,000 laser pulses a second down at the rainforest canopy. Now - and then it measures the reflections. Now, 99 percent of what's reflected comes off leaves. But here and there, there are tiny gaps in the canopy where a laser beam can reach the ground, bounce off and go back up to the plane. And then with massive software processing, they're able to remove all the reflections from leaves, leaving only the ground. And it's just incredible to see these scientists at work. I mean, you see this impenetrable rainforest canopy. And then with a press of a button, it disappears and you see everything on the ground. It's absolutely amazing. CONAN: Well, it's a little more complicated than that. They have to then process the signals that they receive back from the ground. As you say, most of them come back from leaves. And I think, what, they handed you the disc and you flew it out and gave it to the computer guy. PRESTON: Well, that's right. And in fact, it is very complicated. The LIDAR machine has inside it a highly classified thing called an IMU, an Inertial Measurement Unit that was developed for the military for use in guided missiles. And in order to get an export permit for the plane, the State Department required that the plane be guarded by armed soldiers at all times when it was on the ground because this is a very highly classified piece of equipment. Because it's important to locate the plane in the air in three dimensions as it's flying to within an accuracy of about a centimeter. I mean, that's incredible. CONAN: Mm-hmm. So you rushed this data off to the computer guy and he did his magic. How did you - what did you - when did you actually see the picture? PRESTON: Well, I brought it back from that evening on the island of Roatan, and he processed it. He had to crunch the data. There was also data that had to come from Houston that had been collected by them, and all those had to be combined to make this map. And he was working till the wee hours of the morning making these maps. And then the Internet connection was down so he went to bed. His name is Michael Sartori, by the way. He was a really fascinating guy. But then he uploaded those images in the morning to Houston and the - one of the directors of NCALM, this organization, the National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping, a guy named Bill Carter, was the first one to look at the images and he was in West Virginia. He was about to go out and buy a refrigerator or something, and this email came in with these images attached. He looked at them, and he said, oh, my God. He was thunderstruck. He almost immediately saw in this valley pyramids, structures, buildings, plazas, terracing, roads. He saw this incredible amount of archaeological features that he recognized immediately even though he's not an archaeologist. CONAN: So not just a lost city, a lost civilization? PRESTON: That's right. He emailed Michael back in Roatan, and I'll never forget we were returning from breakfast and this normally phlegmatic kind of skeptical scientist who is rolling his eyes at the whole idea that there is going to be lost city comes running out of his room, racing in his flip-flops, waving his arms and yelling, there's something in the valley. My God, I don't know what it is, but you've got to come and look at it. So we all went rushing over to this room and looked at these images. And I looked at them and I was actually thunderstruck myself. I mean, there is no mistaking what we were looking at. CONAN: We're talking with Doug Preston, an author and contributing writer at National Geographic, The Atlantic and Smithsonian magazines. He also writes for The New Yorker. \"The El Dorado Machine\" is in the May 6th edition. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. And eventually, other target areas were also mapped and also revealed enormous structures - entire cities. PRESTON: Well, that's the thing. Three areas we've looked at - covering about 55 square miles of the jungle - target one, target two and target three. And the first one was target one, and we found these all these archeological features. They covered hundreds of acres, maybe even thousands of acres, and this is gigantic. And then they moved on to target two, and they marked that, and then they moved on to target three. And target three showed even more striking features. And we've - an archaeologist has been looking at them and a guy named Chris Fisher, who is an archaeologist at the Colorado State University, who's an expert on LIDAR, and he tells us that there is a city in T3 that is comparable in area to the city of Copan. It's absolutely enormous. The track is two square - five square kilometers. CONAN: And if these valleys are so remote, how did these civilizations develop in this unforgiving area? PRESTON: Well, that's the thing. We're only now starting to realize that this so-called virgin or impenetrable jungle in prehistoric times was anything but. It was very heavily settled. There were many thousands of people living in these areas, and it wasn't virgin jungle. It was more like a tended garden. They cleared huge areas for farming. They terraced. They built irrigation canals. They built roads. They built enormous pyramids and structures. And the idea that the rainforest of Central and South America - the soils were too poor to support major agriculture and large populations turns out to be a false idea. In fact, even in Amazonia, they're now realizing that these supposedly impenetrable jungles in Amazonia were, in fact, heavily settled by people in prehistoric times. CONAN: And they are remote today, but not too remote to be of interest to loggers. PRESTON: Well, that's the unfortunate thing. Illegal logging is destroying huge areas of the rainforest and Honduras is, you know, because these mountains are so difficult to get into, the rainforest has been sort of protected by the geography. But, you know, a single mahogany tree can be worth hundreds, even thousands of dollars and people are very poor. And so when we flew into these mountains they could see incredible amounts of illegal logging, you know, plumes of smoke rising as far as the eye could see. Now, when we actually flew into these valleys, there was no illegal logging, it hadn't been touched yet. They didn't seem to have been penetrated by human beings. But all around, surrounding it, you could see where illegal logging was just eating away at the jungle and exposing these areas to looting and, you know, destruction. CONAN: And, in fact, you wrote that this city discovered in the T3 area, well, it might be gone and destroyed by logging before it can be surveyed by archaeologists. PRESTON: Well, that's right. These areas are very vulnerable. These ruins, as soon as loggers get in there, they open them up and there's looting, destruction, fires, you know, they burn, slash and burn. There's agriculture taking place. And, you know, Chris Fisher, the archaeologist working with us said, gee, you know, we've got to get into these areas right away because who knows how long they're going to last. CONAN: And are there plans to send people in on the ground? And if so, are you going with them? PRESTON: Yes. As a matter of fact there's a major expedition planned to one of these lost cities. They'll go in by helicopter, probably, in the early part of 2014. And I'll be - they promised me a berth on the chopper so I'll be one of the - one of those guys setting foot into the lost city for the first time in a thousand years. CONAN: Well, good luck and bring out pictures. PRESTON: Well, thank you. I'm looking forward to it. CONAN: Doug Preston is a fiction and non-fiction writer, and author, and fellow of the Royal Geographic Society.

S. computer systems, to steal technology that its own companies have not yet developed. This charge came in an annual report to Congress on Chinese military developments that was released yesterday. This problem of cyber-espionage has lately risen to the top of the U. S. agenda with China. U. S. officials say China is relying on theft to modernize its military, and to develop its industrial base. Private U. S. businesses are among the victims; and they're losing valuable trade and technology secrets, as NPR's Tom Gjelten reports. TOM GJELTEN, BYLINE: The stories from American businessmen dealing with China are endless - laptops compromised, emails intercepted, blueprints stolen.  A recent survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in China found that 1 out of 4 U. S. companies there reported somebody stealing data from their computers. Greg Gilligan is the chamber chairman. GREG GILLIGAN: They know they're under attack. They just don't know who's attacking. GJELTEN: Yesterday's Pentagon report suggests a possible answer. Some computer intrusions, it says, quote, \"appear to be attributable directly to the Chinese government and military. \" Another report last February, from the cybersecurity firm Mandiant, went further, saying a cyber unit of the Chinese army is systematically taking intellectual property - that would include technology blueprints, manufacturing secrets or negotiation plans - from the U. S. companies it targets. Much of this is above and beyond China stealing military secrets. Greg Gilligan says if true, it's even more alarming than traditional government-on-government espionage. GILLIGAN: Some organized effort by some group that is attacking business interests. So this is not government to government; it's not military to military. It's attacking economic interests of United States companies. GJELTEN: U. S. companies have long known it's risky to do business in China. But there is that huge opportunity - more than a billion Chinese ready to buy American goods. Adam Segal, a China expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, says the business temptation has so far been irresistible, no matter the likelihood of being hacked. ADAM SEGAL: For the last 15, 20 years, companies have been willing to make the bet or the bargain that oh yes, we know we're going to lose our technology in China, but being in the China market is so important that we're going to take that bet. GJELTEN: But the odds are getting worse. A classified National Intelligence Estimate earlier this year concluded that cyber-espionage from China is now threatening U. S. economic competitiveness. Here's why - the one big advantage that U. S. companies have in the global economy is they are inventive and creative. It's no accident that companies like Microsoft, Apple or Google originated in the United States, not in China. The business culture in China does not favor creativity. The Chinese cannot match U. S. technological innovation. But Undersecretary of State Robert Hormats says Chinese companies can get around that U. S. advantage by stealing U. S. ideas and technology. ROBERT HORMATS: There are certainly some companies that are seeing this as part of a strategy for becoming more competitive internationally, taking innovation from somewhere else and incorporating it in their products. We want to make the Chinese know that we regard this as a threat to our most innovative companies, and are very serious about insisting that they stop it. GJELTEN: Chinese authorities deny there is a state policy of cyber-espionage. But U. S. officials aren't buying it. Yesterday's Pentagon report is only the latest example of U. S. government complaints about Chinese cyber-espionage. President Obama raised concerns in a phone call in March, to China's president. Next came a parade of senior U. S. officials in Beijing, complaining in person - the secretary of the treasury, the secretary of state, the chairman of the joint chiefs. Robert Hormats was also there. The message: The U. S. is running out of patience, and wants China to end its cyber-espionage now. HORMATS: Having a prolonged dialogue is not our goal. A dialogue that leads to results - that's our goal. GJELTEN: And you told them that? HORMATS: Yes. GJELTEN: Quick results, or else what? HORMATS: Well, we're trying to figure out what we can do. We're having discussions within our government, to figure out how to respond. Our hope is that the Chinese will take action, but we're certainly considering various options that we will take if that doesn't work. GJELTEN: One option: Identify the individual Chinese who are stealing business secrets and if possible, prosecute them. Attorney General Eric Holder highlighted several such cases at a White House event in February. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED AUDIO)ERIC HOLDER: Last September in New Jersey, a jury convicted another Chinese native of trade-secret theft and other charges, for stealing information from. . . GJELTEN: Another option: Deny U. S. visas to anyone in China found to be stealing economic secrets. That would hurt Chinese who want their children educated in U. S. universities. Congress could also punish China by imposing new trade restrictions. Finally, if all else fails and Chinese cyberwarriors continue to steal secrets from American companies, the U. S. military's Cyber Command could intervene in defense of the targeted U. S. firms, hacking back into the Chinese computers and taking their data. So far, virtually no one in the U. S. government is ready to endorse that approach. But Adam Segal, at the Council on Foreign Relations, can imagine a point where U. S. companies in China are so penetrated, and have lost so many of their secrets to their Chinese rivals, that they no longer have an advantage in the Chinese market and simply call it quits. SEGAL: Either the Chinese catch the U. S. companies, or the cost from the theft becomes so burdensome that the U. S. companies decide that it's not worth it any longer. GJELTEN: In fact, the American warnings may have had at least a temporary effect.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:  Google, Facebook - they track what you're watching, and try to deliver ads tailored to your interests. It can be irritating but maybe also reassuring when the computers get it wrong because it means they don't have you figured out just yet. INSKEEP: Today, we're going to meet an engineer who thinks a lot about how computers will interact with humans in the future. She spoke with NPR's Joe Palca as he continues his series \"Joe's Big Idea. \"JOE PALCA, BYLINE: In the TV show \"Star Trek: The Next Generation,\" the ultimate evil enemy threatening to destroy humanity was an alien species known as the Borg Collective. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION\")PALCA: One of the things that made the Borg so lethal was that they had a collective consciousness. Every Borg was connected neurally with every other Borg, so they could share knowledge. CORINNA LATHAN: If you could spin the Borg Collective in a positive way, that's almost exactly how I envision the future. PALCA: That's Corinna Lathan. Sharp as a tack and quick to laugh, she's not interested in world domination. But she is interested in technologies that allow people to connect through computers to each other. Sharing consciousness is still in the future, but Lathan says there are technologies heading in that direction that are available now - for example, pop-up displays in your eyeglasses that will tell you about the people and places you're walking past; or sensors in your clothing that could kind of tap you on the shoulder when there's a friend of yours behind you. To pursue her interests, she founded a company called AnthroTronix. Around 15 engineers and designers work with her to dream up, build and test the kind of technologies Lathan thinks the future needs. LATHAN: When you walk through a mall, everyone's looking at their cell phone, and they're on the Internet, they're texting, they're doing whatever. They're completely disconnected from the crowd. PALCA: But what if instead of going to your smartphone screen, all that information you shared about yourself on Facebook - or your friends have shared about themselves - could just flow into your body? And what if Facebook not only knew what you were doing but how you were feeling? LATHAN: Imagine if Facebook where now you're connected to it physiologically as well. So when you're Facebooking your friends in real-time, you know their emotional state, you know their physical state. You know they're tired and they're depressed or you know they're euphoric because something great just happened. PALCA: Now, this may sound a bit scary and invasive. But Lathan doesn't see it that way. Knowing exactly how your friends or others around you are feeling could make you more empathetic, better able to get on their wavelength, so to speak. And besides, you can already tell if someone you're standing next to is depressed or euphoric. Lathan just sees this as making a virtual togetherness, bringing your friends into your personal space, even though they're far away. Hi. LATHAN: Hello. PALCA: How are you? Good to see you again. LATHAN: Good to see you. PALCA: This kind of intimate connection with computers is still a ways off. For now, Lathan's company is taking smaller steps, using available technology to explore ways for humans and computers to get along and work together. LATHAN: Well, let me take you right to the back, right to the heart of where a lot of our work is done and then we'll circle back and talk about some of the projects out here. PALCA: We enter a large room cluttered with computer parts, kids' toys, wiring harnesses. LATHAN: You can see bits and pieces of robots, of homemade testing devices. You can see our 3-D printer so we can do prototyping, workstations for soldering and electronics. PALCA: If you want to see what all this stuff looks like, there's a video on the Joe's Big Idea page on NPR. org. Lathan says she founded the company back in 1999 with a contract from the Department of Defense and a grant from the Department of Education to make instrumented gloves. LATHAN: We have drawers and drawers of gloves. PALCA: Gloves with sensors in them for controlling computers and robots. And she made robots. LATHAN: Our original robot was Jesterbot, which was literally made out of foam and an old remote-control car. Uh-oh. PALCA: Jesterbot's head falls off. LATHAN: Not very stable right now. And then our first generation of cosmobot actually had a compact iPack as its guts in the inside. PALCA: These early inventions came out of Lathan's work when she was an engineering professor at Catholic University. Since my new project, Joe's Big Idea, is about understanding the minds and motivations of scientists and inventors, I had to ask Lathan why she turned away from basic research. LATHAN: I think that's really important. I see the value to it. But I really liked the idea of being accountable to a customer. PALCA: For Lathan, the idea that people were prepared to put money behind her ideas was more important than rising through the ranks in a university. LATHAN: I think entrepreneurs tend to be very passionate about what they're working on. You have to believe very deeply in what you're doing so it becomes - it's more a part of your life and who you are than a day job. PALCA: Another thing Lathan is passionate about is making sure girls get the same support and encouragement for going into science and engineering as boys. She says she was surprised to learn that many girls didn't get the same kind of career support from their families and teachers that she did. She even started an organization called Keys to Empower Youth, a science and technology mentoring program for middle-school girls. LATHAN: When I was in grad school, I mean I was very often the only woman in my class. I was the only woman professor in the entire school of engineering at Catholic University. And so I think I've always been very sensitive to the fact that I need to be a role model and also make an environment that is friendly to women coming into the profession. PALCA: One of the projects Lathan is focusing on these days is making tools for helping the military decide when someone has suffered a brain injury. LATHAN: We've put together a tool called the Defense Automated Neurobehavioral Assessment Tool. PALCA: It's a low-tech way of assessing the health of someone's brain. She hands me what looks like an armored cell phone - which in fact it is - and has me start one of the assessment tasks. So all I'm doing here is I'm touching a screen every time a little star-shaped thing shows up. LATHAN: It's called simple reaction time. PALCA: Turns out your reaction time can slow considerably when you've had a brain injury. LATHAN: So the next one's a little bit harder. PALCA: It's also a reaction time test, but with a decision. One of two colored stick figures will pop up on the screen. LATHAN: The white figure is a foe, the green figure is a friend. And you press fire only if the foe appears. So only if the white target appears; do nothing if the green appears. PALCA: Some people with brain injuries seem to have a hard time doing nothing when the green appears. These simple tests are a pretty rudimentary way of peering into someone's brain, but Lathan sees them as a start. The technology to more directly read someone's thoughts could certainly be useful, but it's easy to see how it could be misused as well. Lathan says that's an issue with any new technology. LATHAN: It's our responsibility to make sure A) that it's used for good, and B) that we can defend against it not being used for good. PALCA: Otherwise we could fall prey to this. . .

It is a state-of-the-art smart-chip ID card. The government believes creating one might make it easier to collect census data, register voters and deliver health care. But this idea is also fueling a debate over ethnicity and identity, at a time when tensions are already high because of the drawdown of NATO troops. NPR's Sean Carberry reports. SEAN CARBERRY, BYLINE: Each citizen's ethnicity will be embedded in the electronic data in the new ID, or e-taskera, rather than on the face of the card. Senator Mohammad Alam Ezedayar was among politicians who debated the issue recently. He doesn't think the new card goes far enough. SENATOR MOHAMMAD ALAM EZEDAYAR: (Through interpreter) It's the right of all Afghans to have their ethnicity listed on the card. Ethnicity is mentioned in the constitution and in the national anthem, so it should be on the card, too. CARBERRY: Ezedayar says that previous ID cards, or taskeras, had identity listed on the face. He says the new e-taskera should, too. He and other prominent politicians from minority groups say they will refuse to register for the new card if it doesn't list identity. There are as many as 14 recognized ethnic groups in the country, with Pashtuns making up somewhere from 40 percent to 50 percent of the population. Tajiks are around 25 percent.  Hazaras and Uzbeks are around 9 percent each. Then there are a handful of other groups in smaller numbers. The Taliban, President Hamid Karzai and many prominent government officials are Pashtun. Senator Ezedayar is a Tajik from the Panjshir Valley. That's the home of the legendary mujahedeen commander Ahmad Shah Massood and the heart of anti-Taliban resistance. Tajiks have battled Pashtuns militarily and politically for influence in Afghanistan over the years. SENATOR BILQEES ROSHAN: (Foreign language spoken)CARBERRY: Senator Bilqees Roshan is a Pashtun from western Farah province. She says only a handful of senators from minority groups support putting ethnicity on the card. ROSHAN: (Through interpreter) I think it's very harmful. In the past 30 years, ethnicity has been misused by people trying to gain more power in the government. CARBERRY: In the '90s, Afghanistan's civil war broke down largely along ethnic lines. To this day, each ethnic group has its chief power broker: Most are former warlords who cut deals over the distribution of government posts. Roshan says Afghanistan needs to move beyond ethnic divisions and quota-based thinking. She says keeping ethnicity off the e-taskera is an important step in that direction. Opinions on the street are equally divided. Dashti Barchi is a gritty, blue-collar section of Kabul. The population here is overwhelmingly Hazara. They're the third-largest ethnic group in the country, and they've long felt marginalized as the lower class in Afghanistan. Saeed Mohsen is a university student in Kabul. SAEED MOHSEN: (Through interpreter) In Afghanistan, everything is divided according to population size of the ethnicities. The military, government jobs, spots in universities, if we are shown as less, then we get less. CARBERRY: He argues it's critical to list ethnicity, so that the government and society know the exact percentage of each group. He and many others argue the percentage of Pashtuns is overstated, and as a result, they get a larger share of power and jobs. MOHSEN: (Through interpreter) It is a competition. We want to have more power over other ethnicities. CARBERRY: Saeed Mobeen, who works as an interpreter, says that there is discrimination in Afghan society. But he says the solution isn't to reinforce ethnic identity. SAEED MOBEEN: All the problems that we have is coming from the ethnicities that we have. We are all Afghan, and we should be equal at the same level, no matter if we are Hazara, Tajik, Uzbek or Pashtun. CARBERRY: The Ministry of Communications says it plans to start issuing the new smart-chip ID cards without ethnicity on the face as soon as parliament passes the law authorizing the program. Sean Carberry, NPR News, Kabul. DAVID GREENE, HOST:   In neighboring Afghanistan, most people live in areas without paved roads or regular electricity, which makes the proposal we're about to hear about seem pretty extravagant. It is a state-of-the-art smart-chip ID card. The government believes creating one might make it easier to collect census data, register voters and deliver health care. But this idea is also fueling a debate over ethnicity and identity, at a time when tensions are already high because of the drawdown of NATO troops. NPR's Sean Carberry reports. SEAN CARBERRY, BYLINE: Each citizen's ethnicity will be embedded in the electronic data in the new ID, or e-taskera, rather than on the face of the card. Senator Mohammad Alam Ezedayar was among politicians who debated the issue recently. He doesn't think the new card goes far enough. SENATOR MOHAMMAD ALAM EZEDAYAR: (Through interpreter) It's the right of all Afghans to have their ethnicity listed on the card. Ethnicity is mentioned in the constitution and in the national anthem, so it should be on the card, too. CARBERRY: Ezedayar says that previous ID cards, or taskeras, had identity listed on the face. He says the new e-taskera should, too. He and other prominent politicians from minority groups say they will refuse to register for the new card if it doesn't list identity. There are as many as 14 recognized ethnic groups in the country, with Pashtuns making up somewhere from 40 percent to 50 percent of the population. Tajiks are around 25 percent.  Hazaras and Uzbeks are around 9 percent each. Then there are a handful of other groups in smaller numbers. The Taliban, President Hamid Karzai and many prominent government officials are Pashtun. Senator Ezedayar is a Tajik from the Panjshir Valley. That's the home of the legendary mujahedeen commander Ahmad Shah Massood and the heart of anti-Taliban resistance. Tajiks have battled Pashtuns militarily and politically for influence in Afghanistan over the years. SENATOR BILQEES ROSHAN: (Foreign language spoken) CARBERRY: Senator Bilqees Roshan is a Pashtun from western Farah province. She says only a handful of senators from minority groups support putting ethnicity on the card. ROSHAN: (Through interpreter) I think it's very harmful. In the past 30 years, ethnicity has been misused by people trying to gain more power in the government. CARBERRY: In the '90s, Afghanistan's civil war broke down largely along ethnic lines.

But when he logs into his son John's account, he has more than a thousand. He only does that once or twice a year, like the day before I spoke with him, which was the second anniversary of John's suicide. DR. STEPHEN KELLY: It's a little bit unusual. I do leave a message. I post a message from us. Just thanking people for remembering him. ALCORN: The message appears to come from John but Dr. Kelly signs it himself. KELLY: Let me just get it exactly. I'll have to get online for a second. ALCORN: He also reads messages that others leave for his son. Like this one from an organization that John volunteered with to try to stop war crimes in Africa. KELLY: (Reading) John, we miss you so much. We are deeply thankful that we got to know you and seek justice alongside of you. (SOUNDBITE OF WEEPING)KELLY: So things like that come up. ALCORN: Dr. Kelly is only able to stay in touch like this because he could log in using John's password. That's not recommended by Jim Lamm, an estate planning lawyer and digital property expert. JIM LAMM: Do people do this? Yes, because it's easy and people think they're not going to get caught. And they may be right. I can't advise people to potentially break the law. ALCORN: There are two kinds of law that Lamm says make digital property different. One kind is about data privacy. For example, after the death of a British model, Facebook successfully fought turning over her account to her mother, by saying these privacy laws made that, quote, \"unauthorized access. \"But the second kind of law goes even further. LAMM: Even if I leave my password to my spouse or my personal representative of my estate, I may be violating my contract with Facebook. ALCORN: If you violate your contract with Facebook, or Google or Yahoo! , you could be breaking the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. It's kind of a mess, but a mess that a number of businesses are taking advantage of. At Internet Media Labs in the Flatiron district of New York City, 17 companies share a big open office.

Last month, Google announced a kind of digital estate planner that you can set to delete or share data from your Google account, if you haven't logged on in a while.

Instead of waiting until the end of your career, why not use some of your savings to take a year off every once in a while, during your career? A Massachusetts man did that, and took his family to live on an island above the Arctic Circle for what counted as a retirement year. From member station WBUR in Boston, Curt Nickisch has their story. CURT NICKISCH, BYLINE: By all the laws of anything, Winston Chen should not have quit his well-paying, mid-career job at a software company. But one day he was watching one of those online video presentations. . . (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)NICKISCH: A TED talk by a New York designer. WINSTON CHEN: He presented this absolutely irresistible idea. He said, why don't we take five years out of retirement and spread them throughout your working life? NICKISCH: Chen told his wife about it. At first, convention held them at bay. CHEN: We feel the gravitational pull of what you should do as well as anybody. NICKISCH: Two summers ago, they broke that gravitational pull. Chen took his family about three-and-a-half thousand miles away to Rodoy, a small granite island jutting from the Norwegian Sea north of the Arctic Circle. Chen's wife, Kristin Botnen, was born in Norway. But she says it wasn't about returning home or leaving home. KRISTIN BOTNEN: For us, this was not an escape. We really liked our lives. Like, but we still wanted once a year where we could just do something completely different. NICKISCH: Completely different. Winston and Kristin and their two kids, four and six, used the daylight that burns into the wee hours of the morning that far north to explore the island of fewer than 200 residents. In their home videos, they discovered beaches so pristine, they looked tropical - except the water was really cold. (SOUNDBITE OF KIDS SCREAMING)UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: Cold. NICKISCH: And they went out on the water to fish for the big cod that roam the Barents Sea. CHEN: Holy moly. NICKISCH: They made chips by frying fish skin. They picked berries that bulged under the long Arctic sun and they plucked eggs from seagull nests to cook for breakfast. It was wild. It was pristine. And it got dark. During the deep Arctic winter, the horizon held the sun down for months. JACK COHEN: I say the northern lights are the only consolation for the Arctic winter - which is otherwise dark, and stormy and cold. BOTNEN: I don't think that the cold got any of us. But the darkness, I think that could make any stable soul a little bit shaky. NICKISCH: To keep things stable, Chen mapped out an hourly schedule in a color-coded spreadsheet. Basically, a to-do list for his one-year, early retirement. CHEN: I had oil painting, photography, blogging, learning Norwegian, learning how to play the ukulele, reading long books that I haven't had time to read. NICKISCH: He also taught himself something new. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: While the atmosphere was cordial, the men assembled were hardly friends. NICKISCH: He wrote an iPhone application that reads text out loud. CHEN: So part of that was occupying my time when it got dark. So I wrote it without knowing that it would ever see the light of day. NICKISCH: But it did see the light of day. Chen posted it on Apple App Store under the name Voice Dream, and people started buying it. Now selling more than 500 copies a week, at 10 bucks apiece, it's sustaining the family on their return to Boston. (LAUGHTER)UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: That's the Vaskebjorn.

Coming up, you've probably heard that the stock market is seeing record highs, but there's also a new poll that shows that fewer Americans are participating. We'll try to find out why, in just a few minutes. But first, we want to tell you about a major data breach affecting thousands of participants of a major government program. The program is called Lifeline; it reimburses phone companies for providing service to low-income Americans. A new investigation found detailed personal information from one of those private companies available online. That includes the Social Security numbers, birth dates, home addresses, even copies of nutrition assistance and welfare cards, of more than 100,000 applicants. Isaac Wolf is a national reporter for Scripps Howard News Service. He led the investigation, and he's with us now to tell us more. Welcome. Thank you for joining us. ISAAC WOLF: Thank you so much for having me. MARTIN: Tell us just a little bit about the Lifeline program, if you would. How did it start? Who is it for? WOLF: Sure. The Lifeline program actually dates back to 1985, during the Reagan administration, and it was created to make sure that phone service was accessible to the poor, the needy. It's continued for just about 30 years; and it was expanded in 2005 to include cellphone service. And this has created a lot of problems. There have been a lot of concerns toward waste, fraud and abuse. You've heard stories over the past few years of people getting multiple phones, phone carriers enrolling folks who maybe were dead or didn't live at those addresses because of course, the phone companies are making money per individual that they have signed up for the service. MARTIN: So how did you get into this investigation? I mean, were you looking for something else, or had you gotten a tip or something that. . . WOLF: No. There was. . . MARTIN: . . . this kind of personal information was available online? WOLF: No, no. Nothing of the sort. A couple other reporters and I at Scripps were just looking into this program; you know, just looking up what was going on. There's been many new rules that have come down the pike, and we just wanted to see what was going on there. And over the course of doing some Internet searches earlier this spring, we stumbled across about 170,000 personal records that were posted online, and those involve two companies that are participating carriers within this program. It's TerraCom Inc. and its affiliate, YourTel America. MARTIN: And for people who might not understand why this is a problem, why is this a problem that people's Social Security numbers and birth dates and addresses - and all of that stuff, was so readily available? WOLF: Well, your Social Security number is really the most important sensitive piece of information about yourself that can be used by identity thieves to open accounts in your name, to pass themselves off as you. Social Security numbers, we know, also are used by people who aren't you, to get jobs. MARTIN: So it's basically an open door to identity theft. So as far as you know, how did this happen? WOLF: You know, TerraCom, the parent company behind this, has not given us a straight answer. We are still trying to understand what led these records to be posted publicly online. MARTIN: Now, we reached out to TerraCom and its affiliate, YourTel America, which are the companies that you say were responsible for the breach. You said that they wouldn't give you an interview. They didn't give us an interview either, but they did issue a statement, and TerraCom says that the company deeply regrets, in quotes, that this information was accessed. It says it has implemented security measures and notified federal and state regulators. It says that that information has now been taken offline. But they also say that you did not just use simple Internet searches. In their statement they quote that a digital forensics investigation by TerraCom has revealed that the news service used sophisticated computer techniques and non-public information to view and download the personal information of applicants. And your response to that is? WOLF: My response to that is everything that we did and everything that we looked at was publicly accessible. We stumbled across these records through a Google search. We've posted online video of how we accessed these records and we have also written about how we accessed these records. We've asked the company to sit down with us. We've told them that we would show them exactly how we accessed these records, and they have refused for nearly a month our sit-down interview requests. And, frankly, I would just say, you know, if their story really does hold up, which it doesn't, then why aren't they here answering questions? They're not. MARTIN: We're talking with Isaac Wolf of Scripps Howard News Service and we're talking about his reporting. He and his team found thousands of applications with detailed personal information posted online for participants in a government program to provide phone service for low income Americans. You also talked to some of the participants in the program, people whose data was accessed. What did they say about this? Did they have any idea? WOLF: No. They didn't have any idea. They were shocked. You know, I spoke with one woman, Linda Mendez(ph),  in San Antonio. She works the night shift cleaning a gym and she uses her Lifeline cell phone, her TerraCom cell phone, to call, check in on her husband and four kids, make sure that they've done their homework, that they're ready for bed. She also uses her phone to coordinate appointments for her kids, including one of her daughters who has Down syndrome, and this is a stumbling block for her. I would just also add that prior to the TerraCom information release, her family has experienced identity theft. Her husband has had his Social Security number misused by others over the past several years, so this is something that people really get. And I would just also add that this program, these applications, are for folks who are among the most vulnerable. They are the poorest. They oftentimes have disabilities, and so you or I - you know, it might be an inconvenience for us to have to spend the dozens of hours calling credit reporting agencies and banks, but we're talking about folks who are working the overnight shift or, you know, maybe they just don't have the wherewithal to fight this and they're the ones who've been exposed here. MARTIN: Did your reporting indicate any hypothesis of how this could have happened? WOLF: I can't speculate on behalf of TerraCom and I would just also add that the records were being held by a third party contractor, an Indian company called Call Centers India. We've reached out to them for comment; they also have not responded, but I would just say your question is a fantastic one. It's the top of the list of things that we're waiting to hear back from. There's a couple other questions that we really think that Linda Mendez and others need answers to, I would say. The second question that others need answers to is: Why did TerraCom have these records in the first place? As we report, the Federal Communications Commission actually forbids TerraCom and other companies from keeping copies of food stamp cards, drivers' licenses, of pieces of proof that these applicants are eligible. Well, the vast majority of the records that we found were precisely these types of scans, iPhone camera shots, so and so forth. Why'd they have them? It's not clear. MARTIN: So basically they're allowed to have certain information in order to be sure that the applicant is qualified, but once the applicant has been qualified, they're not supposed to keep this stuff? WOLF: Well, according to the regulations, the companies are not supposed to retain these records. Exactly what that means is unclear. We've reached out to the FCC for an explanation; they haven't given us one. But what we can say is that many of these pieces of evidence date back to last year, so whether or not these folks were approved or still in some sort of limbo or they've been rejected, they have records that appear to go back well into last year. You know, these types of photocopies, these scans of people's Social Security cards, drivers' licenses, food stamp cards, and it's not really clear why they had them in the first place. MARTIN: Final question. Is there any broader lesson here that you think we all need to take note of? WOLF: Well, our reporting doesn't only look at these release of personal records from TerraCom. We actually look at some other privacy issues associated with the Lifeline program, including a database that's being built out through the FCC and it's going to include personal information from social welfare programs across the country; for many different social welfare programs there's concerns there about privacy issues. MARTIN: Isaac Wolf is a national reporter for Scripps Howard News Service. He was kind enough to join us here in our Washington, D. C. studios. Isaac Wolf, thank you so much for joining us. WOLF: Sure. It's been my pleasure. MARTIN: To read Isaac Wolf's full story and then the full statement from TerraCom, just visit our website. Go to NPR. org/TellMeMore. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  I'm Michel Martin, and this is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. Coming up, you've probably heard that the stock market is seeing record highs, but there's also a new poll that shows that fewer Americans are participating. We'll try to find out why, in just a few minutes. But first, we want to tell you about a major data breach affecting thousands of participants of a major government program. The program is called Lifeline; it reimburses phone companies for providing service to low-income Americans. A new investigation found detailed personal information from one of those private companies available online. That includes the Social Security numbers, birth dates, home addresses, even copies of nutrition assistance and welfare cards, of more than 100,000 applicants. Isaac Wolf is a national reporter for Scripps Howard News Service. He led the investigation, and he's with us now to tell us more. Welcome. Thank you for joining us.

(SOUNDBITE OF RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: I am Mr. Edward Impoya(ph), a member of the Movement for Democratic Change in Zimbabwe. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: We are members of the special committee. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: I am Mr. Ahmed Guraba(ph), the bills and exchange director at the Foreign Remittance Department. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: I am David Mapalay(ph), the first son of Dr. Jonathan Mapalay(ph). UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: I am Mrs. Inkinuga(ph). . . UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: I am Mr. Samson Imanatay(ph), a former. . . UNIDENTIFIED MAN #5: I am Eduard William(ph), the only son of Porti William(ph). . . UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: I am a member of the federal government of Nigeria, National Petroleum Corporation. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #4: I am so troubled. My spirit refused to be at rest. The quick need for contacting you is because my husband has been killed unjustly, and I am sure if we don't act fast, head of the Emirates must come for our wealth and millions of American dollars will be seized. About $83 million U. S. my husband had in his private vault has been successfully deposited. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #6: What we need from you, sir, is to provide a very vital account in which the funds will be transferred. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #5: For this reason, kindly furnish us your contact information; that is, your personal telephone. . . UNIDENTIFIED MAN #7: However, we will sign a binding agreement to bind us together. I got your contact address from the girl who operates. . . UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #6: You will give us our own fare share of 70% without running away with the money or sitting on it. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #8: The finance company is standing by to receive my instructions on this and I will link you up with them as soon as you are ready to take possession of the 3 32 million. Finally, you are to note that in your reply you are to state your residential or company address and if possible send a copy of your international passport so as to assure me that my money is safe in your hands. CONAN: That letter has become familiar to us as the Nigerian Prince scam, and it's become a punchline. But this con game has a lot of names, including 419 and the Spanish Prisoner. It dates back at least 200 years, before the Internet age. In a piece for The Boston Globe this past weekend, Finn Brunton wrote the scam's long and twisting story offers a kind of negative portrait of world history. So tell us, which version of the scam has landed in your inbox? 800-989-8255. Email us: talk@npr. org. You can join the conversation on our website, go to npr. org, click on TALK OF THE NATION. Finn Brunton is an assistant professor of information at the University of Michigan and author of, \"Spam: A Shadow History of the Internet. \" He joins us from a studio at the University of Michigan. Nice to have on TALK OF THE NATION today. FINN BRUNTON: It's a great pleasure to be here. Thank you for having me. CONAN: 419, why is it known as 419? BRUNTON: 419 is the Nigerian legal designation for fraud. So there's actually a much larger culture of fraud in Nigeria that's known as 419. That's fraud perpetuated by Nigerians on other Nigerians that range from illegal tolls to people pretending to rent out fake houses, all kinds of houses that are not legally in their possession, all kinds of things along those lines. But to people outside of Nigeria, 419 has become the default term for this kind of email scamming. CONAN: Yet it was the same scam in the past, as you note, known as the Spanish Prisoner. BRUNTON: Yes, yes, one of my favorite weird sidelights in the history of human fraud. CONAN: Now, what is the Spanish Prisoner? What's the origin of that? BRUNTON: The Spanish Prisoner goes back quite far, but the place that we get the name from is actually from the Spanish-American War, which was one of the sort of first great media wars. It was a war partially fomented in the media, in Hearst papers. . . CONAN: You'll provide the pictures, I'll provide the war. BRUNTON: Exactly, precisely, yes. It's very well dramatized by \"Citizen Kane. \" And one of the side effects of that was that there was this kind of reservoir of common knowledge, of like a day to day near real-time understanding of things that were going on and the fact that there were, you know, mercenaries and adventurers and money and so on and so forth. And that provided a fantastic background, a sort of reality scenario inside which a syndicate of scam artists could create very plausible seeming letters that would build on real world events and create this narrative that someone could then fall for. CONAN: Yeah. I have his horde of Cuban gold, but to get it I need a little help. (LAUGHTER)BRUNTON: Exactly, exactly. CONAN: And it's the same scam. But it was perpetrated by Americans through the mail. BRUNTON: Mm-hmm. CONAN: And yet you also trace it back to the French Revolution. This is a French export. BRUNTON: This is the earliest version of this that I've been able to find, partially because up to that point, you know, there's only so far that the Postal Service itself can function for purposes of doing these kinds of blind mailings. But in the memoirs of Eugene Vidocq, who's a figure who I really think is waiting for his own fantastic HBO miniseries. . . (LAUGHTER)BRUNTON: . . . he was this incredible criminal who reformed and became the first private detective and kind of invented modern police work, and there's lots of prison escapes and so on. So he kept a comprehensive log of all of these forms of criminal activity that were taking place during his lifetime, and one of them was post-revolutionary phenomenon known as the Jerusalem Letters. And these were - so during the revolution, aristocrats, of course, you know, were being executed and their property was being seized, so many of them fled the country. So after the revolution, letters started to trickle in, sent to, you know, private individuals, saying, I was once, you know, I'm the valet of this aristocrat who was once a vital figure in your province, you know, the Marquis de Blanc, and he fled the country and he had to deposit his treasure in a lake or in a well or he, you know, plastered it up in the walls of his house. And he lives in exile and I, his loyal servant, have come to recover it, except, you know, I got busted for vagrancy, and now I'm in prison, and all I need is a little help from you. I just need you to, you know, help fund X,Y and Z, and then we'll split some of the treasure, and I'll take it back to my master. And it played on people's affection, occasionally, for - sort of for the old order. But yeah, it also had precisely the same structure, precisely - working on precisely the same sort of cognitive tricks that the contemporary con works on. CONAN: So you would not be surprised if evidence turned up of some ancient letter, back to the Roman days: We escaped with some Gaulish treasure before Caesar crush us, and we just need a little help. BRUNTON: Yes, absolutely. I mean, honestly, at this point I would not be surprised to find like cave paintings. (LAUGHTER)BRUNTON: You know, like, we have a lot of extra obsidian, but we had to leave it in a cave and. . . CONAN: Yeah. So this plays - one of the things that is consistent through this story, what you call that negative history, is these are all very troubled places where these stories originate from. BRUNTON: Yes. They take advantage of - well, there's actually a really - one of the sort of most perfect examples of this that I encountered was actually in the work of an anthropologist named Jenna Burrell, who did studies of Internet cafe use in Ghana and where there's sort of phenomena that kind of relate - very closely related to this. And one of the things that she observed among some of the people that she talked to was they were like, well, actually I need money to, you know, take IT classes or as a kind of investment to start a project, to, you know, set up life in my own apartment or set up my business. But that's never going to fly because Westerners don't think Africa is like that. So instead I have to come up with this story of corruption and horror, you know - you know the situation in Africa is how one of them begins his letter. We - into these sort of bad historically chaotic situations we know there's greed and graft going on, and the con takes advantage of our misplaced sense of how much of it there is and that we finally could stand to do a little business out of it. CONAN: Here's an email we have from John in Boone, North Carolina: I'm trying to rent a house in rural North Carolina, three times responded to Craig's ad lists to get - Craigslist ads - to get a response. I am currently in Nigeria. But if you transfer $700 for a deposit, I will send the key. The scammer had taken real over house ads, and the real owners were quite surprised when I showed up at one ready to rent. I've not heard about that one before either. And this is someone who has sent us from FraudWatchers a monkey scam. This is - hello, everyone. We now have four capuchin monkeys in our home. This is too much for us to keep. And I understand this is what Jay wants to talk about. Jay is on the line with us from Fayetteville in Arkansas. JAY: Yeah. You were talking about the monkey scam. I actually ran across that on the Internet. CONAN: And how does that work? JAY: Well, what they do is they just - they say you send us some money, we'll send you the monkey. But it's at way lower price than you would ever even imagine paying. . . CONAN: Ah. Thereby the greed. BRUNTON: Mm-hmm. JAY: Yeah. I mean they're cutting it less than half, less than 50 percent of the actual price that you would pay, 'cause I was looking to go buy a capuchin monkey, actually, and I ran across that ad or one like it, probably, and I looked at it and I reported it and everything because I knew instantly - I mean I'm looking at monkeys coming from Africa for $600, shipping included. That's not going to happen. (LAUGHTER)CONAN: OK. JAY: So it's just one - it's one of those things that you have to keep an eye open for. CONAN: And almost any - well - and thanks very much for the call, Jay. In Hitchcock movies, he used to talk about the MacGuffin. It could be a monkey. It could be a hoard of gold. It could be anything. BRUNTON: Precisely. Precisely. And that is kind of the core of this. That's exactly how this works, is that on some level the actual object that you're being, you know, sold or offered a cut of or whatever doesn't really matter. What matters is getting you into this loop that's all about the initial fee that you produce. But then trying to say, like, well, to recover that initial fee plus, you know, all the rest that you'll receive, we need just a little more and a little more and a little more. And soon you're trying to spend money just to recover what you've already lost. That's the ultimate goal. CONAN: That's the ultimate goal and you can extract tremendous amounts of money from some people who are gullible. BRUNTON: Oh, just shocking amounts. I mean, the average loss, it's a little hard to calculate because of all scams this one is particularly underreported, because, you know, obviously it's both kind of shameful. But also, you're generally admitting to criminal wrongdoing, you know, or trying to engage in some sort of very duplicitous, fraudulent practice by getting involved in this scam in the first place. But that said, the numbers that we have from several years ago are that the average loss per American who falls for it is a bit more than $5,000. But people have been on record as having lost upwards of millions. There was a significant American criminal case in which a businessman actually sued to recover the $5. 6 million he had lost in the course of one of these scams. And his case was fantastically hilarious in retrospect because his suit was structured around the fact that he was trying to illegally get bribery money that had been set aside for him, which the judge was not super-amused by. CONAN: We're talking about the Spanish Prisoner, the 419 scam. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. Here's an email from Steven in Bakersfield: Going through my late father's papers sometimes back, I found a letter dated from 1947. It's for someone wanting to share a fortune if only he would provide his bank information. The language is almost word for word like what has filled my spam mail for years. Now there is nothing new under the sun. And it's interesting, you noted in your piece that there are often obvious grammatical errors or misspellings in these letters. And there was a piece we did a few years ago in which someone came to the conclusion - there is a reason for that. By making them really obviously fraudulent, you're weeding out the skeptics. You're only getting truly gullible responses. BRUNTON: I think that's exactly true. I think the - it was a Microsoft research study I believe. CONAN: I think so, yes. BRUNTON: Yeah. They made a really excellent - and to my mind, well, there are variations on the scam, some of which are about presenting certain kinds of plausibility. But, yeah, they actually - they - I think they proved that many of the scammers realize that you want to sort the field first. You want to make sure that you end with the real suckers in the same way that, back in the earlier days of spam, spammers would often sell and resell at higher value collections of addresses that were gotten from the databases of, for example, you know, New Age pharmaceutical manufacturers or what have you because they knew that those clients would be - to put it gently - easier to fool. CONAN: A target rich environment. (LAUGHTER)BRUNTON: Yes. That's very nicely put, yes. CONAN: Here's one from Nicola: I received one and wrote back, telling the author that we're mean-spirited, cruel vultures preying on the weak and deserved to be left in the dessert for a week. I also told them I'd reported his email to various police and scam departments. Hilariously he wrote back, telling me he had cursed my family. My future children would be all be shriveled and unable to reproduce. I laughed so hard. I wrote back telling him his narrative was so inventive, could we keep up the discourse? He never wrote back. (LAUGHTER)CONAN: Let's go to David. David is on the line with us from Syracuse. DAVID: Yes. My favorite 419 - this was in my inbox five or six years ago. It was - excuse me - somebody saying that they were the daughter of Wormtoungue from \"Lord of the Rings. \"(LAUGHTER)DAVID: Her father had been killed by a band northern orcs. She'd hidden $25 million worth of gold doubloons. And if you did the usual stuff they would share it with you. I didn't forward it. I figured the message was probably full of viruses. I didn't preserve it, but I couldn't do anything with it for five minutes laughing. I don't know if it was a legitimate attempt or a spoof. CONAN: It's sometimes hard to find the line there, I guess. BRUNTON: It may well have fallen somewhere between those two, you know? It might have just been an actual scammer having a laugh or a scammer just being like, nah. . . CONAN: You never know. BRUNTON: You never know. Yeah. (LAUGHTER)CONAN: All right. Thanks very much for the call, David. DAVID: (Unintelligible) sent the doubloons. (LAUGHTER)CONAN: Let's see if we get - this is an email that we have from Joseph: I'm a natural born Nigerian. My experience came about two years ago while I was trying to sell a motorcycle I owned. I posted my ad on Craigslist for $3,000. I got an email a few days later asking me to send my bike down to North Carolina after a check for $6,000 was sent to me. The guy said he was in Nigeria. He couldn't come to pick up the bike but asked that I ship the bike. Knowing it was a scam, I asked him to send the check to my office and gave him my cellphone. A few days later, I was at a company softball game with some co-workers, some of whom I had informed of this situation. When I got a call from the guy asking if I got the check, sensing his accent, knowing that we were from the same tribe, I began to tell him in my language, Yoruba, that the FBI was after him. It probably took him less than a second before he hung up. And we do call it the Nigerian prince scam because those are, you know, a lot of trouble in Nigeria. Everybody knows it's an oil rich - anyway, a lot of these people clearly aren't from Nigeria. The scam didn't originate there, probably didn't originate anywhere. BRUNTON: Yeah. No, it's - well, that is something that actually brings up a really important point, which is that it's kind of a tragedy in some ways that it has become so heavily associated with Nigeria, precisely because many Nigerians within the country and without are outraged by the fact that this, you know, fairly small group of extremely visible criminals have made their country synonymous with fraud in a way that almost no other country in human history has ever been associated with fraud. There is fantastic movies - I actually strongly recommend them, they're really entertaining - from the Nigerian film industry that are tales of like the 419 lifestyle and studies of how these people come to a bad end and mislead the country. There's an excellent one called \"The Master,\" which is different from the Paul Thomas Anderson movie. CONAN: Let's hope so, yes. (LAUGHTER)BRUNTON: But they provided really fascinating other side of this. The side of the people who can see their country being sort of traduced on the world stage by this group of scammers. CONAN: When, in fact, what all these scammers from the French Revolution right on down to the present day are doing is illuminating human nature. BRUNTON: Yes, yes, very much so. Illuminating our capacity to believe in fairy tales, our desire to finally take advantage of the crime that we're sure is going on around us all the time, our ability to - something that always just amazes me about this, completely setting aside people falling for the scam in the first place, it's also the people who, with all due respect to the victims, you know, who have - who are often been direly misled, who just sort of believe that the money will be theirs, you know, they'll just sort of have it, you know? Somehow millions will show up and the IRS will never ask about it and, you know, it will never become an issue. CONAN: Finn Brunton, thanks very much. BRUNTON: Thank you so much for having me. CONAN: Finn Brunton will start as assistant professor of information at New York University's Department of Media, Culture and Communication this fall. His piece was in the Boston Globe on Sunday. He joined us from the University of Michigan. It's the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. I'm Neal Conan in Washington. NEAL CONAN, HOST:  If you have an email account, you've almost certainly received a message that sounds something like this. (SOUNDBITE OF RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: I am Mr. Edward Impoya(ph), a member of the Movement for Democratic Change in Zimbabwe. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: We are members of the special committee. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: I am Mr. Ahmed Guraba(ph), the bills and exchange director at the Foreign Remittance Department. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: I am David Mapalay(ph), the first son of Dr. Jonathan Mapalay(ph). UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: I am Mrs. Inkinuga(ph). . . UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: I am Mr. Samson Imanatay(ph), a former. . . UNIDENTIFIED MAN #5: I am Eduard William(ph), the only son of Porti William(ph). . . UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: I am a member of the federal government of Nigeria, National Petroleum Corporation. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #4: I am so troubled. My spirit refused to be at rest. The quick need for contacting you is because my husband has been killed unjustly, and I am sure if we don't act fast, head of the Emirates must come for our wealth and millions of American dollars will be seized. About $83 million U. S. my husband had in his private vault has been successfully deposited. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #6: What we need from you, sir, is to provide a very vital account in which the funds will be transferred. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #5: For this reason, kindly furnish us your contact information; that is, your personal telephone. . . UNIDENTIFIED MAN #7: However, we will sign a binding agreement to bind us together. I got your contact address from the girl who operates. . . UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #6: You will give us our own fare share of 70% without running away with the money or sitting on it. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #8: The finance company is standing by to receive my instructions on this and I will link you up with them as soon as you are ready to take possession of the 3 32 million. Finally, you are to note that in your reply you are to state your residential or company address and if possible send a copy of your international passport so as to assure me that my money is safe in your hands. CONAN: That letter has become familiar to us as the Nigerian Prince scam, and it's become a punchline. But this con game has a lot of names, including 419 and the Spanish Prisoner. It dates back at least 200 years, before the Internet age. In a piece for The Boston Globe this past weekend, Finn Brunton wrote the scam's long and twisting story offers a kind of negative portrait of world history. So tell us, which version of the scam has landed in your inbox? 800-989-8255. Email us: talk@npr. org. You can join the conversation on our website, go to npr. org, click on TALK OF THE NATION. Finn Brunton is an assistant professor of information at the University of Michigan and author of, \"Spam: A Shadow History of the Internet. \" He joins us from a studio at the University of Michigan. Nice to have on TALK OF THE NATION today. FINN BRUNTON: It's a great pleasure to be here. Thank you for having me. CONAN: 419, why is it known as 419? BRUNTON: 419 is the Nigerian legal designation for fraud. So there's actually a much larger culture of fraud in Nigeria that's known as 419. That's fraud perpetuated by Nigerians on other Nigerians that range from illegal tolls to people pretending to rent out fake houses, all kinds of houses that are not legally in their possession, all kinds of things along those lines. But to people outside of Nigeria, 419 has become the default term for this kind of email scamming. CONAN: Yet it was the same scam in the past, as you note, known as the Spanish Prisoner. BRUNTON: Yes, yes, one of my favorite weird sidelights in the history of human fraud. CONAN: Now, what is the Spanish Prisoner? What's the origin of that? BRUNTON: The Spanish Prisoner goes back quite far, but the place that we get the name from is actually from the Spanish-American War, which was one of the sort of first great media wars. It was a war partially fomented in the media, in Hearst papers. . . CONAN: You'll provide the pictures, I'll provide the war. BRUNTON: Exactly, precisely, yes. It's very well dramatized by \"Citizen Kane. \" And one of the side effects of that was that there was this kind of reservoir of common knowledge, of like a day to day near real-time understanding of things that were going on and the fact that there were, you know, mercenaries and adventurers and money and so on and so forth. And that provided a fantastic background, a sort of reality scenario inside which a syndicate of scam artists could create very plausible seeming letters that would build on real world events and create this narrative that someone could then fall for. CONAN: Yeah. I have his horde of Cuban gold, but to get it I need a little help. (LAUGHTER) BRUNTON: Exactly, exactly. CONAN: And it's the same scam. But it was perpetrated by Americans through the mail. BRUNTON: Mm-hmm. CONAN: And yet you also trace it back to the French Revolution. This is a French export. BRUNTON: This is the earliest version of this that I've been able to find, partially because up to that point, you know, there's only so far that the Postal Service itself can function for purposes of doing these kinds of blind mailings. But in the memoirs of Eugene Vidocq, who's a figure who I really think is waiting for his own fantastic HBO miniseries. . . (LAUGHTER) BRUNTON: . . . he was this incredible criminal who reformed and became the first private detective and kind of invented modern police work, and there's lots of prison escapes and so on. So he kept a comprehensive log of all of these forms of criminal activity that were taking place during his lifetime, and one of them was post-revolutionary phenomenon known as the Jerusalem Letters. And these were - so during the revolution, aristocrats, of course, you know, were being executed and their property was being seized, so many of them fled the country. So after the revolution, letters started to trickle in, sent to, you know, private individuals, saying, I was once, you know, I'm the valet of this aristocrat who was once a vital figure in your province, you know, the Marquis de Blanc, and he fled the country and he had to deposit his treasure in a lake or in a well or he, you know, plastered it up in the walls of his house. And he lives in exile and I, his loyal servant, have come to recover it, except, you know, I got busted for vagrancy, and now I'm in prison, and all I need is a little help from you. I just need you to, you know, help fund X,Y and Z, and then we'll split some of the treasure, and I'll take it back to my master. And it played on people's affection, occasionally, for - sort of for the old order. But yeah, it also had precisely the same structure, precisely - working on precisely the same sort of cognitive tricks that the contemporary con works on. CONAN: So you would not be surprised if evidence turned up of some ancient letter, back to the Roman days: We escaped with some Gaulish treasure before Caesar crush us, and we just need a little help. BRUNTON: Yes, absolutely. I mean, honestly, at this point I would not be surprised to find like cave paintings. (LAUGHTER) BRUNTON: You know, like, we have a lot of extra obsidian, but we had to leave it in a cave and. . . CONAN: Yeah. So this plays - one of the things that is consistent through this story, what you call that negative history, is these are all very troubled places where these stories originate from. BRUNTON: Yes. They take advantage of - well, there's actually a really - one of the sort of most perfect examples of this that I encountered was actually in the work of an anthropologist named Jenna Burrell, who did studies of Internet cafe use in Ghana and where there's sort of phenomena that kind of relate - very closely related to this. And one of the things that she observed among some of the people that she talked to was they were like, well, actually I need money to, you know, take IT classes or as a kind of investment to start a project, to, you know, set up life in my own apartment or set up my business. But that's never going to fly because Westerners don't think Africa is like that. So instead I have to come up with this story of corruption and horror, you know - you know the situation in Africa is how one of them begins his letter. We - into these sort of bad historically chaotic situations we know there's greed and graft going on, and the con takes advantage of our misplaced sense of how much of it there is and that we finally could stand to do a little business out of it. CONAN: Here's an email we have from John in Boone, North Carolina: I'm trying to rent a house in rural North Carolina, three times responded to Craig's ad lists to get - Craigslist ads - to get a response. I am currently in Nigeria. But if you transfer $700 for a deposit, I will send the key. The scammer had taken real over house ads, and the real owners were quite surprised when I showed up at one ready to rent. I've not heard about that one before either. And this is someone who has sent us from FraudWatchers a monkey scam. This is - hello, everyone. We now have four capuchin monkeys in our home. This is too much for us to keep. And I understand this is what Jay wants to talk about. Jay is on the line with us from Fayetteville in Arkansas. JAY: Yeah. You were talking about the monkey scam. I actually ran across that on the Internet. CONAN: And how does that work? JAY: Well, what they do is they just - they say you send us some money, we'll send you the monkey. But it's at way lower price than you would ever even imagine paying. . . CONAN: Ah. Thereby the greed. BRUNTON: Mm-hmm. JAY: Yeah. I mean they're cutting it less than half, less than 50 percent of the actual price that you would pay, 'cause I was looking to go buy a capuchin monkey, actually, and I ran across that ad or one like it, probably, and I looked at it and I reported it and everything because I knew instantly - I mean I'm looking at monkeys coming from Africa for $600, shipping included. That's not going to happen. (LAUGHTER) CONAN: OK. JAY: So it's just one - it's one of those things that you have to keep an eye open for. CONAN: And almost any - well - and thanks very much for the call, Jay. In Hitchcock movies, he used to talk about the MacGuffin. It could be a monkey. It could be a hoard of gold. It could be anything. BRUNTON: Precisely. Precisely. And that is kind of the core of this. That's exactly how this works, is that on some level the actual object that you're being, you know, sold or offered a cut of or whatever doesn't really matter. What matters is getting you into this loop that's all about the initial fee that you produce. But then trying to say, like, well, to recover that initial fee plus, you know, all the rest that you'll receive, we need just a little more and a little more and a little more. And soon you're trying to spend money just to recover what you've already lost. That's the ultimate goal. CONAN: That's the ultimate goal and you can extract tremendous amounts of money from some people who are gullible. BRUNTON: Oh, just shocking amounts. I mean, the average loss, it's a little hard to calculate because of all scams this one is particularly underreported, because, you know, obviously it's both kind of shameful. But also, you're generally admitting to criminal wrongdoing, you know, or trying to engage in some sort of very duplicitous, fraudulent practice by getting involved in this scam in the first place. But that said, the numbers that we have from several years ago are that the average loss per American who falls for it is a bit more than $5,000. But people have been on record as having lost upwards of millions. There was a significant American criminal case in which a businessman actually sued to recover the $5. 6 million he had lost in the course of one of these scams. And his case was fantastically hilarious in retrospect because his suit was structured around the fact that he was trying to illegally get bribery money that had been set aside for him, which the judge was not super-amused by. CONAN: We're talking about the Spanish Prisoner, the 419 scam. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. Here's an email from Steven in Bakersfield: Going through my late father's papers sometimes back, I found a letter dated from 1947. It's for someone wanting to share a fortune if only he would provide his bank information. The language is almost word for word like what has filled my spam mail for years. Now there is nothing new under the sun. And it's interesting, you noted in your piece that there are often obvious grammatical errors or misspellings in these letters. And there was a piece we did a few years ago in which someone came to the conclusion - there is a reason for that. By making them really obviously fraudulent, you're weeding out the skeptics. You're only getting truly gullible responses. BRUNTON: I think that's exactly true. I think the - it was a Microsoft research study I believe. CONAN: I think so, yes. BRUNTON: Yeah. They made a really excellent - and to my mind, well, there are variations on the scam, some of which are about presenting certain kinds of plausibility. But, yeah, they actually - they - I think they proved that many of the scammers realize that you want to sort the field first. You want to make sure that you end with the real suckers in the same way that, back in the earlier days of spam, spammers would often sell and resell at higher value collections of addresses that were gotten from the databases of, for example, you know, New Age pharmaceutical manufacturers or what have you because they knew that those clients would be - to put it gently - easier to fool. CONAN: A target rich environment. (LAUGHTER) BRUNTON: Yes. That's very nicely put, yes. CONAN: Here's one from Nicola: I received one and wrote back, telling the author that we're mean-spirited, cruel vultures preying on the weak and deserved to be left in the dessert for a week. I also told them I'd reported his email to various police and scam departments. Hilariously he wrote back, telling me he had cursed my family. My future children would be all be shriveled and unable to reproduce. I laughed so hard. I wrote back telling him his narrative was so inventive, could we keep up the discourse? He never wrote back. (LAUGHTER) CONAN: Let's go to David. David is on the line with us from Syracuse. DAVID: Yes. My favorite 419 - this was in my inbox five or six years ago. It was - excuse me - somebody saying that they were the daughter of Wormtoungue from \"Lord of the Rings. \" (LAUGHTER) DAVID: Her father had been killed by a band northern orcs. She'd hidden $25 million worth of gold doubloons. And if you did the usual stuff they would share it with you. I didn't forward it. I figured the message was probably full of viruses. I didn't preserve it, but I couldn't do anything with it for five minutes laughing. I don't know if it was a legitimate attempt or a spoof. CONAN: It's sometimes hard to find the line there, I guess. BRUNTON: It may well have fallen somewhere between those two, you know? It might have just been an actual scammer having a laugh or a scammer just being like, nah. . . CONAN: You never know. BRUNTON: You never know. Yeah. (LAUGHTER) CONAN: All right. Thanks very much for the call, David. DAVID: (Unintelligible) sent the doubloons. (LAUGHTER) CONAN: Let's see if we get - this is an email that we have from Joseph: I'm a natural born Nigerian. My experience came about two years ago while I was trying to sell a motorcycle I owned.

NPR's Geoff Brumfiel takes a look at the next generation of computing technology. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: This new quantum computer is literally a black box the size of a small room, or to be more precise, a black cube. Geordie Rose is chief technology officer with D-Wave Systems, the Canadian company that made the machine. GEORDIE ROSE: Inside that black cube is a machine called a dilution refrigerator which cools the brains of the computer down to just a fraction above absolute zero. BRUMFIEL: At these extremely low temperatures, the rules of quantum mechanics take over. These rules are very different from those used in a normal computer. For example, a regular computer can only work with separate bits of information: ones and zeros. But in a quantum computer. . . CHRISTOPHER MONROE: There's a certain intrinsic wiring between the bits that sort of comes for free. It's called quantum entanglement. BRUMFIEL: Christopher Monroe is a physicist at the University of Maryland's Joint Quantum Institute. MONROE: Quantum computers use, they exploit this resource called entanglement to do certain tasks that can be shown for certain problems to be exponentially faster than what could be done without a quantum computer. BRUMFIEL: What might take decades can be done in hours. D-Wave claims its latest processor has 512 quantum bits. That's enough to tackle some really tough problems, says Geordie Rose. In particular, problems that require sifting through lots and lots of possible answers. ROSE: The best answer or the highest or the lowest or the smallest or the meatiest, you know, no matter what. If it's got an iest at the end and you can write down a mathematical equation for what you mean about that, then you can attack it with one of our machines. BRUMFIEL: And that's why Google and NASA are interested. They've partnered with an independent research association to start a quantum artificial intelligence lab centered around the D-Wave computer. Both organizations want to develop systems that can learn to spot patterns in massive, messy datasets. ROSE: They want to continue to understand how to increase the intelligence of machines. BRUMFIEL: But many scientists still have questions about how well the D-Wave computer really works. Until now, most quantum computing has been done on a small scale. And physicist Chris Monroe says that D-Wave's 512-bit chip may be too big to keep everything entangled. MONROE: If you make the system bigger, in every platform I know of it gets harder, and in fact, the entanglement goes away faster. BRUMFIEL: Too fast to do any calculations. D-Wave's computer is solving tough problems and for specific cases it can beat a conventional rival. But the company hasn't been able to convince Monroe that entanglement is doing the work. MONROE: They've shown no evidence of entanglement, now that doesn't mean to say that what they're doing is not interesting. BRUMFIEL: Monroe says this new chip is so unusual in its design that it might be working in a way that can sometimes beat other computers, even without entanglement. D-Wave's Geordie Rose says that's fine with him. ROSE: Academic groups tend to want to focus more on the quantum part than the computing part, and that's fine. It's just not what we do. What we do is build computers, and if we can build the fastest computers the world has ever known, you can call them whatever you like and I'll be happy. BRUMFIEL: Regardless of what D-Wave's machine is doing, quantum computing is not going away. The strange rules of quantum physics are just too tempting for technology companies to ignore.

I'm Flora Lichtman. Up next, going digital in the golden years. Fans of the movie \"Babe\" might remember this scene, which is coming - coming at you soon. Essentially in this scene, the main character's wife gets a fax machine from a daughter, and while it was the '90s, so that's why - well let's hear it. (SOUNDBITE OF MOVIE, \"BABE\")(SOUNDBITE OF PIG)MAGDA SZUBANSKI: (As Mrs. Hoggett) I've got a washing machine, a radio, a new alarm clock. I think it's a lovely fax machine, darling, but can't you use it? ZOE BURTON: (As the Hoggetts' Daughter) We already have one, Mom. That's the whole idea. We can send faxes to each other. Now don't be afraid of it just because it's new. LICHTMAN: Oh, the '90s. So while technologies come and go, the sentiment may be timeless: If you, the parent, would only learn to use this new device, smartphone, iPad, computer, insert gadget of choice here, communicating with you would be a breeze. So why haven't more older adults signed on? According to a recent Pew survey, just over half of Americans 65 and older are online. Compare that to 18- to 29-year-olds. Over 90 percent of them are online. You can guess the reasons why: cost, a steep learning curve. But if you've been thinking about trying out one of these devices, or maybe your kids gave one, or maybe you've been wanting to help your grandparent go digital, we have some practical advice for you today, experts to tell you how to get started and even how to MacGyver those devices to make them older-adult friendly. And we want to hear from you. If you're an older adult and would like to share your story or trying successfully or not to use this new technology or to get a parent or grandparent online, give us a call, 1-800-989-8255, that's 1-800-989-TALK. And if you're on Twitter, you can tweet us @scifri. Now let me introduce my guests. Tom Kamber is the founder and executive director of OATS, that stands for Older Adults Technology Service. Check out their website at seniorplanet. org. And Dr. Kamber here is in our New York studio. Thanks for coming in today. TOM KAMBER: Thanks for having me, Flora. LICHTMAN: And Therese Willkomm, is an assistant professor in the Department of Occupational Therapy at the University of New Hampshire. She's also the author of her newest book, which is \"Assistive Technology Solutions in Minutes,\" too, which is coming out June 1. She's also the director of New Hampshire's State Assistive Technology Program with the Institute on Disability at the University of New Hampshire. And the book I mentioned has a whole chapter on 50 ways to adapt your iPad. Thanks for joining us today. THERESE WILLKOMM: Thank you. LICHTMAN: Tom Kamber, why does it matter if older people get online or use a smartphone? Are we just imposing sort of a lifestyle choice, or is there a meaningful difference to quality of life, do you think? KAMBER: I think it matters a lot to older people to be adopting technologies, and there's certainly some people that are by choice not going online and don't want to become digitally plugged in. But for the vast majority of older people that we've worked with, they're finding that access to things like, you know, ecommerce or services online or, you know, any kinds of things related to their health or their social connectivity are all mediated by technology. So for people who don't adopt, they're blocked in a lot of their basic life processes now. LICHTMAN: What are some of the barriers for seniors? KAMBER: The principal barriers for seniors are first of all just figuring out what platforms to work with. There are so many different, myriad things to choose from. And so trying to decide what's appropriate for them and kind of matching up what their personal interests are with the right technologies and then finding an appropriate place to learn new devices and technologies. Sometimes it can take months to get comfortable on a PC or an iPad or a new thing, and people often don't set themselves up or haven't found the right path to do the learning in places where they'll be appropriately supported. LICHTMAN: Therese Willkomm, has that been your experience, too? WILLKOMM: Yes, I would agree. But there's also some other challenges. As we get older, we often experience conditions that result in low vision, hearing loss, holding the device, interacting with the device, even conductivity with our fingers, hitting the device. And so while it's a great universally designed tool, there are some additional adaptations that often need to be made and particularly individuals who experience disabilities, perhaps maybe a stroke, again arthritis, blindness, low vision, et cetera. And - but it's a fabulous, fabulous tool. LICHTMAN: Yeah, I can imagine it would be - I mean, I find it hard to use touch screens sometimes, and I have very good vision and very tiny fingers with pretty good dexterity. I can imagine that it would be challenging. WILLKOMM: Absolutely. LICHTMAN: And there ways to adapt these devices? Do the devices need to be designed in a different way? WILLKOMM: Well, it all depends. One of the first things we look at it is simple adaptations, for example holding of an iPad and even holding of an iPhone. If we're looking at holding of an iPad, there's a variety of different stands, different laptops. We find that a lot of seniors like their - what we call a nest, it could be a recliner chair, an armchair where the remote control, their water, everything's all set up. When you add an iPad to that mix, it's just another item, and your hands get tired holding it. And then you're trying to put it on your lap, you have issues with glare and also the need to often have that iPad closer to you so you can see it. And so there's some real simple adaptations that can be made using corrugated plastic. We have different stands that we can make for like two bucks worth of material. Things that we use - hands-free solutions so that if you can't, or your arms get tired of holding the iPad, something that will hold it up in the right position for you. Even with - as far as the buttons. One of the nice things with the iPad and the iPhone 5, with Siri, of being able to push that button and being able to speak into your iPad, being able to say what's the temperature going to be today or find - open NPR, and how Siri will take over. That whole thing on controlling our environment, controlling the use of the iPad just with our voice, and that's just a few of the different ways to, you know, to accommodate because the tiny little buttons, you're right, they're harder to see. The other thing is with vision, many individuals who have lost their eyesight, how do you see all the pictures, all the graphics that are on the iPad? And yes the iPad came out with voiceover to read texts to you, but there's so much graphical images on the iPad and creating tactile graphic overlaps that lay over the glass that you can simply feel the lines, feel the images with your figures to be able to interact with. LICHTMAN: Like a sticker? WILLKOMM: Well, stickers I use, I use these tiny little stickers when somebody has low vision and for contrast. That black glass, it's really hard to find the hold button or find the volume button or power on/off button, and just by getting high-contrast little stickers to place over the home button or right above the volume button I think really helps everybody trying to figure out where's those buttons to turn the volume up or down. That's something, you know, very simple that anybody could add. LICHTMAN: I guess this is why you've been called the MacGyver of assisted technologies. It seems like you have a lot of tricks at your disposal. WILLKOMM: Yes, and ways to hold the iPad or hang the iPad on a variety of different appliances such as using just a simple, 75-cent padded industrial twist tie and sliding it underneath one of the cases for the iPad and sliding to over a chair, the back rest. There's just, you know, just a ton of different things that can be done to make that more accessible. And then sometimes with arthritis or when your hand kind of just rests on the glass, and unfortunately if your hand is resting on the glass on the iPad, you're going to inadvertently hit buttons that you didn't want to hit. And just taking a knit glove from the dollar store, and we find is if you cut off the tip of the middle finger on the knit glove, then the hand can rest on the glass, and then the middle finger can access various interactive points on the iPad without accidentally hitting something that you didn't want to hit with your finger. And that's something we frequently see people do, and they get really frustrated. They have no idea how they got to a particular screen because they accidentally touched something that they didn't think they were going to touch. Even the accessibility, the reader button that is built in when you do a URL search, you're searching maybe a news article has come up. And in the URL on the top of the screen is a purple reader button that shows up. If you tap on that, what it will do, is it will strip out all the advertisement, and the text will come up. You can enlarge that to whatever size that you needed. And you can also have it read out loud to you. Just some fabulous things that are coming out now with the iPad and the accessibility features. LICHTMAN: Tom Kamber, what's your experience been as the best way to teach people who may be reticent or unfamiliar with this technology? KAMBER: Well, we have a center in New York, the Senior Planet Exploration Center, and we've got about 2,500 people coming in every calendar quarter, just walking off the street for programming. It's on 25th Street if anybody is in the city they can come visit it between - it's on 127 West 25th. And when people come in for iPad training, many of them are - their barriers that that they're experiencing as older people start with the social barriers for people. They start with the barriers of being an older individual who may have - not really have connections with their own friends and peers that are using these devices. So they haven't been able to observe people succeeding with them. They haven't been able to see what people are getting out of the use of these new tools. And so one of the first things that we really need to do is work with them around understanding the value and understanding what you're going to do with a device. So before people get to the notion of whether they need an assistive tool of some sort, the vast majority of older folks actually can just take a regular iPad and learn how to use it with the appropriate support. And there certainly is a group that needs that kind of assistive support that Therese was talking about, but most of the people that come to us are really saying I don't even know what this thing does. You know, I've been hearing about email, and I'm hearing about W-W-W this. Can you show me and get us started? And so we work with them for - we have a 20-session class for iPad basics. We're also doing a social engagement version of that in partnership with the AARP Foundation in Washington, D. C. And what we're doing with folks is really getting them comfortable with the device itself, learning how to do things like just build up your contacts in the contact field and connect with your friends and family so that you can just send an email, or you can do a video chat with somebody, just kind of getting them over that hurdle is critical for most people to get started. WILLKOMM: And that social engagement piece is so huge, about being able to connect with family and friends using FaceTime is so powerful on having real-life conversations, real-time conversations. And one of the most creative things we did was for an individual that has Parkinson's, who's in an assisted-living facility, she has a very difficult time lifting her head, she has a hard time leaving the assisted-living facility, but wants to take tours of the new nursing department that we have at the university. And so what we did was we mounted an iPhone on top of a bicycle helmet and sent a student around, and she could say move to the left, let me see what changes have been made with perhaps the new I. V. pole, move to the right and so real-time. Or perhaps she wants to go on an adventure, kayaking, and being able to say I think I heard a pileated woodpecker, can you paddle to the left or paddle to the right. LICHTMAN: So like a surrogate explorer. WILLKOMM: Yes, it's a virtual, yeah, explorer. LICHTMAN: Let me give - let me do - take an ID break here. I'm Flora Lichtman, and this is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. I want to go to the phones. Let's go to Andy(ph) in Manhattan. ANDY: Well, they got me, honey. Hi. LICHTMAN: Hi. ANDY: Hello. LICHTMAN: Go ahead. ANDY: Love your show. LICHTMAN: Yes. ANDY: I just want to say that my dad is 94 years old, and he's a veteran of World War II. And about three years ago, I gave him an old Macintosh computer that I had because I recognized the desire in him to continue learning, and he's always had that. And since then, he's able to get online and read his Google news and also get CDs and create iTunes lists. He also has been making videos of his life, his stories from the war, his stories growing up in the Depression. And the one thing I could say is I try to create analogies that he can understand. He was a mechanic. And so when I talk about the Windows and things, I talk about opening up folders like opening up different - using different tools, things that connect to his life, not to try to have him learn all the new technology, you know, the words, but connected to things he already knows so that that learning curve is less. And he just can - and also to be available for his calls. Sometimes, he'll open up, and he said I got all these screens all over the place. What can I do? And then, little by little, one step at a time, I walked him through, and he calms down, and he actually continues to learn. LICHTMAN: Yeah, that's interesting. ANDY: It also helped me to connect to him too in a way that I never had before, in a very intense intimate way. LICHTMAN: Thank you, Andy, for calling. That's a great comment. ANDY: Thank you. LICHTMAN: So does that sound right to you, getting rid some of this jargon as a way to help people get online? KAMBER: Yeah, that really reflects the kind of experience we've been having with older adults in our classes. The - one of the things that Andy was talking about that really strikes me here, is that when you work with older individuals around technology, it's not about being a technology expert. You know, people often say, oh, you know, I needed somebody to teach me how to use an iPad or do email. And so they go to - try to find somebody with a computer science degree. And really what you want is somebody who is much like Andy here who enjoys the experience of talking and being patient with an older person on their learning track and their learning pace, and can relate it to the things that older people need. I mean this notion of relevance is so powerful and so important for older learners. Many of whom feel really alienated by the technology and the way that we market it and design it. And so being able to relate it to something that somebody cares about, both tells that person that it's something that they can engage with, but also makes it clear to the older person who often lives in a sort of ageist environment that you're paying attention to them and that you know what they care about. And that creates a really positive learning feedback dynamic and they make progress. LICHTMAN: And what's that point about how it's a way to have a new relationship or to keep in touch in a new way? That seems very powerful. KAMBER: It is. And one of the best parts about my jobs is really that, you know, technology for us is really a path to a sort of opportunity for really socially engaging with older people and honestly enriching our own lives. You know, I've been doing this for nine years at OATS, and working so much with it, and it's just such a blast. I went into the center today and a woman was showing me that she just sold something on Etsy, and it just changed my experience to do that kind of work with someone. LICHTMAN: That's wonderful, Tom Kamber and Therese Willkomm. Stay with us. We're going to be talking more about this when we come back. 1-800-989-TALK if you have a story you want to share. Don't go away. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LICHTMAN: This is SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Flora Lichtman. We're talking this hour about older adults and technology, and we want to hear from you. What is your experience been like going digital? Or have you tried to get your parent or grandparent online? Give us a call, 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-TALK. And let's start up going to the phones. Becky in Norman, Oklahoma, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. BECKY: Hi, Flora. I'm a grandparent and I wanted to tell you how I use my new iPhone. When my grandchildren were small, I drove them to elementary school every day. And when they got out of the car, I would say, get good grades and A's, and that's all I think they heard every day. And it was really positive for them. And they're a little older now. They're in middle school and high school, and they take the bus. And they don't have time in the morning, you know, to either make a phone or anything like that, but I have begun texting them. And so I text them in the mornings - get good grades and A's. And on Friday, I text, you know, TGIF, you know, have a great weekend, and they always text me back. And it's neat that we have continued this relationship electronically. And I have a lot of friends that complain, oh, all my grandkids do is text. They send me messages, but I'm not going to use that, and I'm not going to text them back. But I found, you know, that I can really use it positively and I'm enjoying it. LICHTMAN: Do you hear from them more because you - because you're open to texting? BECKY: Yes, yes. They will send me more text messages, and they send me photos and my granddaughter put me in Instagram. And they're far more advance than I am, but, yes, they're teaching me a lot. (LAUGHTER)LICHTMAN: Tom Kamber, did you have something you wanted to add? KAMBER: Yeah. I love the story. You know, my daughter, Phoebe, gets to the Brooklyn New School here in New York, and we do a lot of texting back and forth as well. And one of the things that we've explored with our older learners at the Senior Planet Center is how they used text to supplement other forms of communication. You know, we do a study a few years ago with an external group that came in to look at the seniors that we're training. And they asked them, what are you using that technology for after you go online? And one senior said was, I am actually still calling my grandkids. I'm still calling my family members, but I'm also emailing and now texting them more. And so it becomes a supplemental way for them to communicate, and it adds another layer of richness to the interaction that people are having. So it's been a, really, a great way for people to kind of flesh out and strengthen that relationship to their family members. LICHTMAN: Tom. . . WILLKOMM: And. . . LICHTMAN: Go ahead, Therese. WILLKOMM: And one of the great things with texting - so let's say you have a hard time on that iPhone finding those letters or typing those letters, now with that built-in microphone right on the keyboard, you can just hit that microphone and that you speak into it and have speech to text. And so it makes it so much faster to do texting without having to hit all those buttons. LICHTMAN: Talking with Tom Kamber and Therese Willkomm. Let's go back to the phones. Bob in Pleasant Hill, California, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. BOB: Thank you. Thank you. So my dad is 80 years old. He is probably the last living accountant who has never used a computer, does all of his work on paper exclusively. Starting in the 1980s, my siblings and I have been buying him computers, buying him software, offering training classes, trying to get him to use the computer and/or the Internet. He absolutely refused it. I don't know whether he's scared of it, whether he has some kind of mental block, whether he's just being stubborn. But I wonder if your experts there have any advice on how to deal with a person like that. LICHTMAN: Tom Kamber? KAMBER: Sure. You know, what you're experiencing there is a phenomenon that geriatric specialists call a problem of resilience. A lot of older adults - as people get older, our ability to bounce back from setbacks or kind of recover from things that go wrong diminishes a little bit. You have few resources physically and financially, and even in terms of time. And so one of the things that may be going on for your dad there, is that he is, you know, he knows that the way he's been doing things for years professionally has been working. He's still able to function with it. And when he looks at the idea of using, you know, QuickBooks or any of these tax preparation devices actually that are online now is something to, you know, he's choosing between different platforms. And so if one platform doesn't work out, he might spend a year or two learning that platform and hundreds of dollars, even thousands of dollars, trying to adopt that - adopt it. And if doesn't go well for him, he doesn't have a lot of years of professional life left to then recover from that and try something different. And So you need to find ways to reduce the risks for your dad when he's working at those tools, maybe find somebody who also is an older adult who has used those kinds of tools and has a platform that they really like. And give them a chance to try it in a sort of trial basis where he doesn't have to invest a lot of time and money into it to have some kind of success with it just to get him in a mood of learning step by step without having to invest so much. We often underestimate how much anxiety older people have about adopting new things. It take a big investment of time and money. LICHTMAN: Did that help, Bob? BOB: Well, you know, the thing is that he was 50 when we started to try to get him to use computers. And since - because of his refusal, he's been unemployed - underemployed for the last 30 years. And I mean, we've never even got to the point of having him sit down at a computer and be willing to turn it on. KAMBER: Does he use any technology devices at all? BOB: He has a simple cellphone that he got within the last couple of years, and he watches TV, cable TV, but that's about it. KAMBER: I think, you know, one of the things that you might try is to pick something where he has a very immediate need. Maybe his phone isn't quite as robust as he'd like it to be or even his cable TV. You know, you can add something like Netflix onto the cable TV and give him a sense that there's - the Internet is connecting to that. So it extends something that he's already using and gives him a kind of small step into technology adoption where you're really working closely with and make sure he has a good, positive experience with that. I think creating momentum and creating at least a little bit of positive feedback makes a difference. And one other suggestion, I have to say I've never been able to teach my own parents to use technology, and many, many, many people have a hard time learning from their family members. And so bringing in an outsider and giving him an hour a week of technology support from anybody who's just patient and will sit with them is - really can make a big difference for somebody. You might try that route as well. LICHTMAN: Thanks, Bob. In the 20 seconds we have left, is there - are there places people can go if they don't live in New York City? Where should people look, Therese Willkomm, for advice on how to help their parents or if they're an older person themselves and want help using new devices? WILLKOMM: There is a number of different websites. As far as learning to use new devices and adaptations, every state has a statewide assistive technology program. And so they can look at, you know, within their own state for who's their assistive technology provider. I think Tom's got probably some ideas on just, you know, where they can go learning as far as technology. Tom? KAMBER: Sure. There are two principal places that people go. And the first place most people look is the library. And the libraries really are the first point of access for so many older people that are trying to learn technologies. And the second area really are the wide range of senior services programs that proliferate throughout states and cities. Every city has a department of senior services. And I should mention that, you know, we - because of the investment from the Department of Commerce in the stimulus package over the last few years, we've built 3,000 free access, public access computer labs all across the country, not OATS but a program called Broadband Technology Opportunities Program. And here in New York, OATS has built 23 of those, but they're everywhere out there now. So if you call your local city or state government and ask where they might be a free computer lab with the senior services trainings now, there's a lot more out there than there was just a few years ago, and you're likely to find a program right in your community. LICHTMAN: Well, thank you both for taking time to talk to us today. KAMBER: Thank you. WILLKOMM: Thank you. LICHTMAN: Tom Kamber, the executive director of OATS. That stands for Older Adults Technology Service. And Therese Willkomm is the director of New Hampshire's State Assistive Technology program with the Institute on Disability at the University of New Hampshire. FLORA LICHTMAN, HOST:  This is SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Flora Lichtman. Up next, going digital in the golden years. Fans of the movie \"Babe\" might remember this scene, which is coming - coming at you soon. Essentially in this scene, the main character's wife gets a fax machine from a daughter, and while it was the '90s, so that's why - well let's hear it. (SOUNDBITE OF MOVIE, \"BABE\") (SOUNDBITE OF PIG) MAGDA SZUBANSKI: (As Mrs. Hoggett) I've got a washing machine, a radio, a new alarm clock. I think it's a lovely fax machine, darling, but can't you use it? ZOE BURTON: (As the Hoggetts' Daughter) We already have one, Mom. That's the whole idea. We can send faxes to each other. Now don't be afraid of it just because it's new. LICHTMAN: Oh, the '90s. So while technologies come and go, the sentiment may be timeless: If you, the parent, would only learn to use this new device, smartphone, iPad, computer, insert gadget of choice here, communicating with you would be a breeze. So why haven't more older adults signed on? According to a recent Pew survey, just over half of Americans 65 and older are online. Compare that to 18- to 29-year-olds. Over 90 percent of them are online. You can guess the reasons why: cost, a steep learning curve. But if you've been thinking about trying out one of these devices, or maybe your kids gave one, or maybe you've been wanting to help your grandparent go digital, we have some practical advice for you today, experts to tell you how to get started and even how to MacGyver those devices to make them older-adult friendly. And we want to hear from you. If you're an older adult and would like to share your story or trying successfully or not to use this new technology or to get a parent or grandparent online, give us a call, 1-800-989-8255, that's 1-800-989-TALK. And if you're on Twitter, you can tweet us @scifri. Now let me introduce my guests. Tom Kamber is the founder and executive director of OATS, that stands for Older Adults Technology Service. Check out their website at seniorplanet. org. And Dr. Kamber here is in our New York studio. Thanks for coming in today. TOM KAMBER: Thanks for having me, Flora. LICHTMAN: And Therese Willkomm, is an assistant professor in the Department of Occupational Therapy at the University of New Hampshire. She's also the author of her newest book, which is \"Assistive Technology Solutions in Minutes,\" too, which is coming out June 1. She's also the director of New Hampshire's State Assistive Technology Program with the Institute on Disability at the University of New Hampshire. And the book I mentioned has a whole chapter on 50 ways to adapt your iPad. Thanks for joining us today. THERESE WILLKOMM: Thank you. LICHTMAN: Tom Kamber, why does it matter if older people get online or use a smartphone? Are we just imposing sort of a lifestyle choice, or is there a meaningful difference to quality of life, do you think? KAMBER: I think it matters a lot to older people to be adopting technologies, and there's certainly some people that are by choice not going online and don't want to become digitally plugged in. But for the vast majority of older people that we've worked with, they're finding that access to things like, you know, ecommerce or services online or, you know, any kinds of things related to their health or their social connectivity are all mediated by technology. So for people who don't adopt, they're blocked in a lot of their basic life processes now. LICHTMAN: What are some of the barriers for seniors? KAMBER: The principal barriers for seniors are first of all just figuring out what platforms to work with. There are so many different, myriad things to choose from. And so trying to decide what's appropriate for them and kind of matching up what their personal interests are with the right technologies and then finding an appropriate place to learn new devices and technologies. Sometimes it can take months to get comfortable on a PC or an iPad or a new thing, and people often don't set themselves up or haven't found the right path to do the learning in places where they'll be appropriately supported. LICHTMAN: Therese Willkomm, has that been your experience, too? WILLKOMM: Yes, I would agree. But there's also some other challenges. As we get older, we often experience conditions that result in low vision, hearing loss, holding the device, interacting with the device, even conductivity with our fingers, hitting the device. And so while it's a great universally designed tool, there are some additional adaptations that often need to be made and particularly individuals who experience disabilities, perhaps maybe a stroke, again arthritis, blindness, low vision, et cetera. And - but it's a fabulous, fabulous tool. LICHTMAN: Yeah, I can imagine it would be - I mean, I find it hard to use touch screens sometimes, and I have very good vision and very tiny fingers with pretty good dexterity. I can imagine that it would be challenging. WILLKOMM: Absolutely. LICHTMAN: And there ways to adapt these devices? Do the devices need to be designed in a different way? WILLKOMM: Well, it all depends. One of the first things we look at it is simple adaptations, for example holding of an iPad and even holding of an iPhone. If we're looking at holding of an iPad, there's a variety of different stands, different laptops. We find that a lot of seniors like their - what we call a nest, it could be a recliner chair, an armchair where the remote control, their water, everything's all set up. When you add an iPad to that mix, it's just another item, and your hands get tired holding it. And then you're trying to put it on your lap, you have issues with glare and also the need to often have that iPad closer to you so you can see it. And so there's some real simple adaptations that can be made using corrugated plastic. We have different stands that we can make for like two bucks worth of material. Things that we use - hands-free solutions so that if you can't, or your arms get tired of holding the iPad, something that will hold it up in the right position for you. Even with - as far as the buttons. One of the nice things with the iPad and the iPhone 5, with Siri, of being able to push that button and being able to speak into your iPad, being able to say what's the temperature going to be today or find - open NPR, and how Siri will take over. That whole thing on controlling our environment, controlling the use of the iPad just with our voice, and that's just a few of the different ways to, you know, to accommodate because the tiny little buttons, you're right, they're harder to see. The other thing is with vision, many individuals who have lost their eyesight, how do you see all the pictures, all the graphics that are on the iPad? And yes the iPad came out with voiceover to read texts to you, but there's so much graphical images on the iPad and creating tactile graphic overlaps that lay over the glass that you can simply feel the lines, feel the images with your figures to be able to interact with. LICHTMAN: Like a sticker? WILLKOMM: Well, stickers I use, I use these tiny little stickers when somebody has low vision and for contrast. That black glass, it's really hard to find the hold button or find the volume button or power on/off button, and just by getting high-contrast little stickers to place over the home button or right above the volume button I think really helps everybody trying to figure out where's those buttons to turn the volume up or down. That's something, you know, very simple that anybody could add. LICHTMAN: I guess this is why you've been called the MacGyver of assisted technologies. It seems like you have a lot of tricks at your disposal. WILLKOMM: Yes, and ways to hold the iPad or hang the iPad on a variety of different appliances such as using just a simple, 75-cent padded industrial twist tie and sliding it underneath one of the cases for the iPad and sliding to over a chair, the back rest. There's just, you know, just a ton of different things that can be done to make that more accessible. And then sometimes with arthritis or when your hand kind of just rests on the glass, and unfortunately if your hand is resting on the glass on the iPad, you're going to inadvertently hit buttons that you didn't want to hit. And just taking a knit glove from the dollar store, and we find is if you cut off the tip of the middle finger on the knit glove, then the hand can rest on the glass, and then the middle finger can access various interactive points on the iPad without accidentally hitting something that you didn't want to hit with your finger. And that's something we frequently see people do, and they get really frustrated. They have no idea how they got to a particular screen because they accidentally touched something that they didn't think they were going to touch. Even the accessibility, the reader button that is built in when you do a URL search, you're searching maybe a news article has come up. And in the URL on the top of the screen is a purple reader button that shows up. If you tap on that, what it will do, is it will strip out all the advertisement, and the text will come up. You can enlarge that to whatever size that you needed. And you can also have it read out loud to you. Just some fabulous things that are coming out now with the iPad and the accessibility features. LICHTMAN: Tom Kamber, what's your experience been as the best way to teach people who may be reticent or unfamiliar with this technology? KAMBER: Well, we have a center in New York, the Senior Planet Exploration Center, and we've got about 2,500 people coming in every calendar quarter, just walking off the street for programming. It's on 25th Street if anybody is in the city they can come visit it between - it's on 127 West 25th. And when people come in for iPad training, many of them are - their barriers that that they're experiencing as older people start with the social barriers for people. They start with the barriers of being an older individual who may have - not really have connections with their own friends and peers that are using these devices. So they haven't been able to observe people succeeding with them. They haven't been able to see what people are getting out of the use of these new tools. And so one of the first things that we really need to do is work with them around understanding the value and understanding what you're going to do with a device. So before people get to the notion of whether they need an assistive tool of some sort, the vast majority of older folks actually can just take a regular iPad and learn how to use it with the appropriate support. And there certainly is a group that needs that kind of assistive support that Therese was talking about, but most of the people that come to us are really saying I don't even know what this thing does. You know, I've been hearing about email, and I'm hearing about W-W-W this. Can you show me and get us started? And so we work with them for - we have a 20-session class for iPad basics. We're also doing a social engagement version of that in partnership with the AARP Foundation in Washington, D. C. And what we're doing with folks is really getting them comfortable with the device itself, learning how to do things like just build up your contacts in the contact field and connect with your friends and family so that you can just send an email, or you can do a video chat with somebody, just kind of getting them over that hurdle is critical for most people to get started. WILLKOMM: And that social engagement piece is so huge, about being able to connect with family and friends using FaceTime is so powerful on having real-life conversations, real-time conversations. And one of the most creative things we did was for an individual that has Parkinson's, who's in an assisted-living facility, she has a very difficult time lifting her head, she has a hard time leaving the assisted-living facility, but wants to take tours of the new nursing department that we have at the university. And so what we did was we mounted an iPhone on top of a bicycle helmet and sent a student around, and she could say move to the left, let me see what changes have been made with perhaps the new I. V. pole, move to the right and so real-time. Or perhaps she wants to go on an adventure, kayaking, and being able to say I think I heard a pileated woodpecker, can you paddle to the left or paddle to the right. LICHTMAN: So like a surrogate explorer. WILLKOMM: Yes, it's a virtual, yeah, explorer. LICHTMAN: Let me give - let me do - take an ID break here. I'm Flora Lichtman, and this is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. I want to go to the phones. Let's go to Andy(ph) in Manhattan. ANDY: Well, they got me, honey. Hi. LICHTMAN: Hi. ANDY: Hello. LICHTMAN: Go ahead. ANDY: Love your show. LICHTMAN: Yes. ANDY: I just want to say that my dad is 94 years old, and he's a veteran of World War II. And about three years ago, I gave him an old Macintosh computer that I had because I recognized the desire in him to continue learning, and he's always had that. And since then, he's able to get online and read his Google news and also get CDs and create iTunes lists. He also has been making videos of his life, his stories from the war, his stories growing up in the Depression. And the one thing I could say is I try to create analogies that he can understand. He was a mechanic. And so when I talk about the Windows and things, I talk about opening up folders like opening up different - using different tools, things that connect to his life, not to try to have him learn all the new technology, you know, the words, but connected to things he already knows so that that learning curve is less. And he just can - and also to be available for his calls. Sometimes, he'll open up, and he said I got all these screens all over the place. What can I do? And then, little by little, one step at a time, I walked him through, and he calms down, and he actually continues to learn. LICHTMAN: Yeah, that's interesting. ANDY: It also helped me to connect to him too in a way that I never had before, in a very intense intimate way. LICHTMAN: Thank you, Andy, for calling. That's a great comment. ANDY: Thank you. LICHTMAN: So does that sound right to you, getting rid some of this jargon as a way to help people get online? KAMBER: Yeah, that really reflects the kind of experience we've been having with older adults in our classes. The - one of the things that Andy was talking about that really strikes me here, is that when you work with older individuals around technology, it's not about being a technology expert. You know, people often say, oh, you know, I needed somebody to teach me how to use an iPad or do email. And so they go to - try to find somebody with a computer science degree. And really what you want is somebody who is much like Andy here who enjoys the experience of talking and being patient with an older person on their learning track and their learning pace, and can relate it to the things that older people need. I mean this notion of relevance is so powerful and so important for older learners. Many of whom feel really alienated by the technology and the way that we market it and design it. And so being able to relate it to something that somebody cares about, both tells that person that it's something that they can engage with, but also makes it clear to the older person who often lives in a sort of ageist environment that you're paying attention to them and that you know what they care about. And that creates a really positive learning feedback dynamic and they make progress. LICHTMAN: And what's that point about how it's a way to have a new relationship or to keep in touch in a new way? That seems very powerful. KAMBER: It is. And one of the best parts about my jobs is really that, you know, technology for us is really a path to a sort of opportunity for really socially engaging with older people and honestly enriching our own lives. You know, I've been doing this for nine years at OATS, and working so much with it, and it's just such a blast. I went into the center today and a woman was showing me that she just sold something on Etsy, and it just changed my experience to do that kind of work with someone. LICHTMAN: That's wonderful, Tom Kamber and Therese Willkomm. Stay with us. We're going to be talking more about this when we come back. 1-800-989-TALK if you have a story you want to share. Don't go away. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) LICHTMAN: This is SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Flora Lichtman. We're talking this hour about older adults and technology, and we want to hear from you. What is your experience been like going digital? Or have you tried to get your parent or grandparent online? Give us a call, 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-TALK. And let's start up going to the phones. Becky in Norman, Oklahoma, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. BECKY: Hi, Flora. I'm a grandparent and I wanted to tell you how I use my new iPhone. When my grandchildren were small, I drove them to elementary school every day. And when they got out of the car, I would say, get good grades and A's, and that's all I think they heard every day. And it was really positive for them. And they're a little older now. They're in middle school and high school, and they take the bus. And they don't have time in the morning, you know, to either make a phone or anything like that, but I have begun texting them. And so I text them in the mornings - get good grades and A's. And on Friday, I text, you know, TGIF, you know, have a great weekend, and they always text me back. And it's neat that we have continued this relationship electronically. And I have a lot of friends that complain, oh, all my grandkids do is text. They send me messages, but I'm not going to use that, and I'm not going to text them back. But I found, you know, that I can really use it positively and I'm enjoying it. LICHTMAN: Do you hear from them more because you - because you're open to texting? BECKY: Yes, yes. They will send me more text messages, and they send me photos and my granddaughter put me in Instagram. And they're far more advance than I am, but, yes, they're teaching me a lot. (LAUGHTER) LICHTMAN: Tom Kamber, did you have something you wanted to add? KAMBER: Yeah. I love the story. You know, my daughter, Phoebe, gets to the Brooklyn New School here in New York, and we do a lot of texting back and forth as well. And one of the things that we've explored with our older learners at the Senior Planet Center is how they used text to supplement other forms of communication. You know, we do a study a few years ago with an external group that came in to look at the seniors that we're training. And they asked them, what are you using that technology for after you go online? And one senior said was, I am actually still calling my grandkids. I'm still calling my family members, but I'm also emailing and now texting them more. And so it becomes a supplemental way for them to communicate, and it adds another layer of richness to the interaction that people are having. So it's been a, really, a great way for people to kind of flesh out and strengthen that relationship to their family members. LICHTMAN: Tom. . . WILLKOMM: And. . . LICHTMAN: Go ahead, Therese. WILLKOMM: And one of the great things with texting - so let's say you have a hard time on that iPhone finding those letters or typing those letters, now with that built-in microphone right on the keyboard, you can just hit that microphone and that you speak into it and have speech to text. And so it makes it so much faster to do texting without having to hit all those buttons. LICHTMAN: Talking with Tom Kamber and Therese Willkomm. Let's go back to the phones. Bob in Pleasant Hill, California, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. BOB: Thank you. Thank you. So my dad is 80 years old. He is probably the last living accountant who has never used a computer, does all of his work on paper exclusively. Starting in the 1980s, my siblings and I have been buying him computers, buying him software, offering training classes, trying to get him to use the computer and/or the Internet. He absolutely refused it. I don't know whether he's scared of it, whether he has some kind of mental block, whether he's just being stubborn. But I wonder if your experts there have any advice on how to deal with a person like that. LICHTMAN: Tom Kamber? KAMBER: Sure. You know, what you're experiencing there is a phenomenon that geriatric specialists call a problem of resilience. A lot of older adults - as people get older, our ability to bounce back from setbacks or kind of recover from things that go wrong diminishes a little bit. You have few resources physically and financially, and even in terms of time. And so one of the things that may be going on for your dad there, is that he is, you know, he knows that the way he's been doing things for years professionally has been working. He's still able to function with it. And when he looks at the idea of using, you know, QuickBooks or any of these tax preparation devices actually that are online now is something to, you know, he's choosing between different platforms. And so if one platform doesn't work out, he might spend a year or two learning that platform and hundreds of dollars, even thousands of dollars, trying to adopt that - adopt it. And if doesn't go well for him, he doesn't have a lot of years of professional life left to then recover from that and try something different. And So you need to find ways to reduce the risks for your dad when he's working at those tools, maybe find somebody who also is an older adult who has used those kinds of tools and has a platform that they really like. And give them a chance to try it in a sort of trial basis where he doesn't have to invest a lot of time and money into it to have some kind of success with it just to get him in a mood of learning step by step without having to invest so much. We often underestimate how much anxiety older people have about adopting new things. It take a big investment of time and money. LICHTMAN: Did that help, Bob? BOB: Well, you know, the thing is that he was 50 when we started to try to get him to use computers. And since - because of his refusal, he's been unemployed - underemployed for the last 30 years. And I mean, we've never even got to the point of having him sit down at a computer and be willing to turn it on. KAMBER: Does he use any technology devices at all? BOB: He has a simple cellphone that he got within the last couple of years, and he watches TV, cable TV, but that's about it. KAMBER: I think, you know, one of the things that you might try is to pick something where he has a very immediate need. Maybe his phone isn't quite as robust as he'd like it to be or even his cable TV. You know, you can add something like Netflix onto the cable TV and give him a sense that there's - the Internet is connecting to that. So it extends something that he's already using and gives him a kind of small step into technology adoption where you're really working closely with and make sure he has a good, positive experience with that. I think creating momentum and creating at least a little bit of positive feedback makes a difference. And one other suggestion, I have to say I've never been able to teach my own parents to use technology, and many, many, many people have a hard time learning from their family members. And so bringing in an outsider and giving him an hour a week of technology support from anybody who's just patient and will sit with them is - really can make a big difference for somebody. You might try that route as well. LICHTMAN: Thanks, Bob. In the 20 seconds we have left, is there - are there places people can go if they don't live in New York City? Where should people look, Therese Willkomm, for advice on how to help their parents or if they're an older person themselves and want help using new devices? WILLKOMM: There is a number of different websites. As far as learning to use new devices and adaptations, every state has a statewide assistive technology program. And so they can look at, you know, within their own state for who's their assistive technology provider. I think Tom's got probably some ideas on just, you know, where they can go learning as far as technology. Tom? KAMBER: Sure. There are two principal places that people go. And the first place most people look is the library. And the libraries really are the first point of access for so many older people that are trying to learn technologies. And the second area really are the wide range of senior services programs that proliferate throughout states and cities. Every city has a department of senior services. And I should mention that, you know, we - because of the investment from the Department of Commerce in the stimulus package over the last few years, we've built 3,000 free access, public access computer labs all across the country, not OATS but a program called Broadband Technology Opportunities Program. And here in New York, OATS has built 23 of those, but they're everywhere out there now. So if you call your local city or state government and ask where they might be a free computer lab with the senior services trainings now, there's a lot more out there than there was just a few years ago, and you're likely to find a program right in your community. LICHTMAN: Well, thank you both for taking time to talk to us today. KAMBER: Thank you. WILLKOMM: Thank you. LICHTMAN: Tom Kamber, the executive director of OATS. That stands for Older Adults Technology Service. And Therese Willkomm is the director of New Hampshire's State Assistive Technology program with the Institute on Disability at the University of New Hampshire.", "section": "Technology", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2013 NPR.

I'm Robert Siegel. And now, All Tech Considered. (SOUNDBITE OF THEME MUSIC)SIEGEL: There's an article in the May 27th issue of The New Yorker called \"Change the World: Silicon Valley transfers its slogans - and its money - to the realm of politics. \" In it, The New Yorker's George Packer writes about, among other things, technological optimism, the sort of thinking that led Mark Zuckerberg to remark a few years ago that widespread use of Facebook in Lebanon could help young people feel more connected and perhaps less likely to embrace terrorism. George Packer writes this: Technology can be an answer to incompetence and inefficiency, but it has little to say about larger issues of justice and fairness, unless you think that political problems are bugs that can be fixed by engineering rather than fundamental conflicts of interest and value. And he joins us now from Brooklyn. George Packer, welcome once again. GEORGE PACKER: Good to be back with you, Robert. SIEGEL: Are we now seeing a huge amount of money and political influence coming from people who are very rich, very self-interested, very smart and very much convinced that their interests are our interests? PACKER: Yeah. What I found in Silicon Valley is an industry that's sort of been kept a very far remove from Washington and had an attitude of just let us do our thing and make the miracles that people love around the world and leave us alone. And I think the industry has gotten big enough, wealthy enough and entangled in - in our lives enough that some of the leaders out there are beginning to realize they can't completely ignore politics. They have to pay attention to it. They need lobbyists in Washington. Mark Zuckerberg has started an advocacy group for immigration reform. And there's even a line of thinking out there that technology holds a lot of the answers to what ails government. SIEGEL: As for the phrase that's the title of your article, \"Change the World,\" when I hear it, I associate Barack Obama saying as much. It reminds me years ago, Jimmy Carter said that we just needed a government as good as we are, and Bill Clinton used to declare every profound political conflict a case of false choices at some level. We've always had a certain amount of simplistic, optimistic bromides from people in public life. Is this one any different? PACKER: I think it's very much in that lineage. It's sort of populist. It's magical thinking. It's ahistorical in the sense that it really doesn't take recent history seriously. Instead, it thinks that a whole new way of doing things, such as transferring engineering solutions to political problems, using the iPhone to improve, you know, city services and the problems of urban government. That's very much the same kind of magical thinking that I think Barack Obama's 2008 campaign somewhat suffered from and the other politicians that you named. It seems to be a regular temptation in the era where people feel that government doesn't work very well. We just - if we just kind of get out of that box and into another one, or out of all boxes, somehow that will solve the problem. SIEGEL: You write, after hearing the praises sung of apps that can hail us a taxi and pick us a restaurant and order a bike messenger to deliver takeout, quote, \"It suddenly occurred to me that the hottest tech startups are solving all the problems of being 20 years old with cash on hand because that's who thinks them up. \"PACKER: Yeah. That's a little bit of a - an unfair quip since, of course, there's a lot else going on in Silicon Valley, including some, you know, pretty amazing engineering breakthroughs. But I did get the feeling - especially in San Francisco where south of Market Street there's just thousands, it seems, of little startup companies that are the next social network or the next sharing economy breakthrough. Their vision of what life should be like in its frictionless, seamless version - which is a - phrases you hear often out there - is the life of 20-somethings. People, you know, without kids, without jobs that are - involve a fair amount of drudgery. It's like, the real problem is how do you get your food to your apartment as fast as possible? So it was perhaps not entirely justified, but I couldn't resist it. SIEGEL: You know, thinking about the political views of the folks in Silicon Valley, as you write about them, I was thinking about Henry Ford, who was an ingenious industrialist of his day who held many very odious views. But he also believed in paying autoworkers a wage that would permit them to buy the cars they were making. There was a certain egalitarianism involved in what he was doing. That doesn't seem to figure at all in this particular world view. PACKER: Right. These are very un-odious people. These are very good people, nice people, people you like to talk to and be around and who, if they did have workers, would probably pay them pretty well because they'd distribute their stock options quite fairly. But they don't have any workers. That's the problem. It's - the working class of San Francisco and the Bay Area is being pushed out of its old neighborhoods because of the skyrocketing cost of housing, and there's no real working class left because these are jobs for engineers and managers and designers - very smart people. A lot of them come from Ivy League colleges. And San Francisco and Silicon Valley are more and more being shaped after their desires and their idea of the good life. SIEGEL: Is this story also - is it equally about the naivete of people who think that Silicon Valley millionaires are different, or is that only about the peculiar view of those people themselves? PACKER: No. I think you're right. It is about the country's attitude towards Silicon Valley and its leaders, which is to say they're not quite seen as just corporate heads or as industry titans. They're seen as pioneers, revolutionaries, even. Steve Jobs very much encouraged that. And so for example, last week when Tim Cook - who replaced Jobs as the CEO of Apple - appeared before the Senate to try to explain Apple's extremely creative means for avoiding paying corporate taxes in the U. S. , by the end, the senators seem to be racing to shake his hand and tell him how much they loved Apple's products, which tells me Apple isn't like the oil and gas industry, isn't like the pharmaceutical industry. They are considered somehow higher than that. And I think that's a dangerous attitude because, after all, Apple was found to be one of the biggest tax avoiders in the country today. And that's something that should not be waved away simply because senators have wonderful iPhones in their pockets that they stare at all the time. SIEGEL: George Packer's article in the May 27th New Yorker is called \"Change the World. \" He's also the author of the new book \"The Unwinding. \" George Packer, thanks a lot for talking with us. PACKER: My pleasure, Robert. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Robert Siegel. And now, All Tech Considered. (SOUNDBITE OF THEME MUSIC) SIEGEL: There's an article in the May 27th issue of The New Yorker called \"Change the World: Silicon Valley transfers its slogans - and its money - to the realm of politics. \" In it, The New Yorker's George Packer writes about, among other things, technological optimism, the sort of thinking that led Mark Zuckerberg to remark a few years ago that widespread use of Facebook in Lebanon could help young people feel more connected and perhaps less likely to embrace terrorism. George Packer writes this: Technology can be an answer to incompetence and inefficiency, but it has little to say about larger issues of justice and fairness, unless you think that political problems are bugs that can be fixed by engineering rather than fundamental conflicts of interest and value. And he joins us now from Brooklyn. George Packer, welcome once again. GEORGE PACKER: Good to be back with you, Robert. SIEGEL: Are we now seeing a huge amount of money and political influence coming from people who are very rich, very self-interested, very smart and very much convinced that their interests are our interests? PACKER: Yeah. What I found in Silicon Valley is an industry that's sort of been kept a very far remove from Washington and had an attitude of just let us do our thing and make the miracles that people love around the world and leave us alone. And I think the industry has gotten big enough, wealthy enough and entangled in - in our lives enough that some of the leaders out there are beginning to realize they can't completely ignore politics. They have to pay attention to it. They need lobbyists in Washington. Mark Zuckerberg has started an advocacy group for immigration reform. And there's even a line of thinking out there that technology holds a lot of the answers to what ails government. SIEGEL: As for the phrase that's the title of your article, \"Change the World,\" when I hear it, I associate Barack Obama saying as much. It reminds me years ago, Jimmy Carter said that we just needed a government as good as we are, and Bill Clinton used to declare every profound political conflict a case of false choices at some level. We've always had a certain amount of simplistic, optimistic bromides from people in public life. Is this one any different? PACKER: I think it's very much in that lineage. It's sort of populist. It's magical thinking. It's ahistorical in the sense that it really doesn't take recent history seriously. Instead, it thinks that a whole new way of doing things, such as transferring engineering solutions to political problems, using the iPhone to improve, you know, city services and the problems of urban government. That's very much the same kind of magical thinking that I think Barack Obama's 2008 campaign somewhat suffered from and the other politicians that you named. It seems to be a regular temptation in the era where people feel that government doesn't work very well. We just - if we just kind of get out of that box and into another one, or out of all boxes, somehow that will solve the problem. SIEGEL: You write, after hearing the praises sung of apps that can hail us a taxi and pick us a restaurant and order a bike messenger to deliver takeout, quote, \"It suddenly occurred to me that the hottest tech startups are solving all the problems of being 20 years old with cash on hand because that's who thinks them up. \" PACKER: Yeah.

As children, he argues, we are expected and we're allowed to be confused and lost and full of wonder. But as adults in the age of Google, we are expected to project confidence and understanding, and we sometimes avoid situations where we don't know the answers, and, therefore, we get fewer opportunities to use our imaginations. In just a minute, we'll hear how Ta-Nehisi Coates rebooted his imagination by learning French. But we also want to hear you stories. Tell us about a time when you had to get lost or feel stupid or abandon your comfort zone. What happened? Our number is 800-989-8255. Our email address is talk@npr. org. Ta-Nehisi Coates is the senior editor for The Atlantic. His piece \"How Learning a Foreign Language Reignited My Imagination\" appears in the June issue of the magazine. He joins us now via Skype from his home in New York. Welcome to TALK OF THE NATION. TA-NEHISI COATES: Hi. Thanks for having me. DONVAN: It's a pleasure. And you write in your piece, Ta-Nehisi: I started studying French in the summer of 2011, in the throes of a mid-30s crisis. I wanted to be young again. Let's start there. What did studying French have to do with feeling young again? COATES: Well, actually, I should correct the record, here. I most certainly have not learned a foreign language. In fact, many people have maintained that you can't actually fully ever learn, when they were always learning. But mine particularly is still quite bad. (LAUGHTER)DONVAN: Thanks for fessing up. COATES: Yeah. Because I don't want anybody to put me on the spot here, one of your callers call and they start speaking French, you know. DONVAN: This is about the process and the journey more than about the product and (unintelligible). OK. COATES: Yes. Yes. Yes, yes. So in 2011 - you know, and not just in terms of learning a foreign language, but, in general, I think one of the things we get away from as we age is this sense of wonder. When you're a child - at least when I was a child - you know, wonder was essential to survival. We had questions about the world, and imagination is one way in which, you know, we answer those questions. And one of the things I was confronted with when I went to study French immediately was the fact of entire worlds that you just could not comprehend. I mean, speech is so elemental to how we communicate. And I found my wonder, my imagination being exercised in that space, often just to understand what people were saying and try to imagine what folks were saying. (LAUGHTER)DONVAN: I want to pin you down a little bit on what - I want you to define wonder for me, because everything you just described could be confusion, which is not the same thing, but might be related. So what do you mean by wonder? COATES: That's a great point, and I'm not sure wonder and confusion are two different things. You know what it is? I think wonder is the acceptance of confusion and the enjoyment of it, you know, like the feeling that it's OK to be confused, that you're lost and kind of thrilling in that sort of feeling of being lost, of not understanding and reaching at various things. And, you know, when you study a foreign language, that's the first thing. I mean, just the sheer not understanding is terrifying. It's like being reduced to being a two or three-year-old, except, you know, in my case, you're a 35, 36, 37-year-old dude. But your mind functions like a three-year-old. I strongly suspect that's why young people pick it up so much easier. They don't have any of that insecurity at all. DONVAN: Well, what do you think is the evolutionary purpose of our losing the sense of wonder? In other words, if wonder is so wonderful, why, as adults, do we give it up? COATES: Well, I don't know - I mean, it's obviously wonderful, but I don't know how great it is, because, again, the other part of that that it always comes with is confusion and fear. Those are parts of it. I think as children, if we didn't have to have it, we wouldn't have to have it. As adults, we become more in control of our actions. We decide where we're going to go, what we're going to see, who we're going to talk to, what we're going to talk to about. As a child, you know, it's a good thing to learn the language in which people are speaking around you. As an adult, once you've acquired that, why go any further? You don't have to. DONVAN: But it's almost like saying that learning is the death of wonder. In other words, if you learned as a child to speak the language that your parents speak and you start to struggle through it, the more you learn, the less you have to wonder what they're talking about. COATES: Well, you know what, I would say once you - the end of learning is probably the end of wonder, you know? If you make a decision to stop right there, you know, and not pick up anything else, then, yeah. You know, I think a big part of this is the willingness to look stupid. I mean, that's a really, really huge part of it, something again that children, you know, having not yet learned, really, really young children not yet learned, don't have to worry about. But with adults, we want to know what's going on. We want to know right now. DONVAN: I remember seeing an interview with James Gandolfini who starred in \"The Sopranos,\" talking about his early days of studying acting. And he was praising his teacher, and I can't remember her name, but he said, the things she taught me to be willing to do was to make a complete idiot of myself in front of everybody and to not care about it. COATES: As far as I'm concerned, it is so essential to being any sort of real disciplined thinker, to being any kind of intellectual, a willingness to look stupid. I just think it's just absolutely, absolutely essential. And I'm not talking about, like, proud ignorance. You know, I'm not talking about going around and being, you know, happy to not know something but accepting that fact, accepting that and then, you know, moving forward. DONVAN: You're almost talking about courage. I want to bring in Bridget(ph). She's in San Marcos, Texas. Hi, Bridget. You're on TALK OF THE NATION. And I assume you've been listening to what Ta-Nehisi has been talking about, so you want to jump in on this? BRIDGET: Oh, I'm totally in agreement with him. And I think one of the words that I've recently learned to apply to my new endeavor is that it's humbling. I've always been a really talented person with language, and I learned to read so young. I learned - I think before I was three, I was reading pretty well. I'm just one of those weird kids. So I felt cheated I never - I don't remember what it was like to be excited about learning to read. And I learned Spanish and French when I was an FBI linguist, so I'm good with language. But I recently wanted a new challenge just like your guest, and I, long story short, kind of ran across Braille. And I'm a sighted person. I have good vision with my contacts, and I'm learning Braille on my own. And there are lots of books available at libraries, and I am so humbled by the difficulty of it. Like I said, I'm a good language person. I'm a good reader, but this is a whole different part of the brain. And it is so - you feel - I don't want to say stupid, but you feel like, OK, how many times can I do this not. . . DONVAN: I want to pick - Bridget, I want to pick up on the word you just threw in there a couple of times, humbling, and put that back to Ta-Nehisi and see if that's also what you're talking about. COATES: Yeah. No, that's definitely what I'm talking about. I mean, when I went to France and then to Switzerland this spring, one of the things that people warned me about was how rude people would be in France because, you know, you don't speak French well. And, you know, I didn't find people to be especially rude. But I think a lot of that comes from the notion that learning should be predictable, that it should be easy, that it should be polite, that it should happen in this sort of way where everyone salutes you for the fact that you want to learn something. But the whole experience is humbling because you don't know. You really, really don't know. You don't know what's going to happen. You don't know what people are saying about you. You don't know how people are going to react to you. DONVAN: Maybe it's a relief that you don't know. COATES: Maybe so. DONVAN: And maybe you can enjoy that. All right, Bridget. Thanks for your call. I want to go to Tony(ph) who's in Denver, Pennsylvania. Hi, Tony. You're on TALK OF THE NATION. TONY: Hi. How are you doing? DONVAN: We're good. TONY: Pretty much the question is about when do you leave your comfort zone. I do it pretty much every week. I've recently gotten back in the long-haul driving, and every day is an adventure. You know, you have an address, you have a new set of directions. GPS can take you so far and somebody says you turned left, you should've turned right. It can get interesting out here. You know, you make a wrong turn with a truck, you know, you're 65, 70 feet long. She's not going to turn around and (unintelligible) with a car. DONVAN: So I'm interested in the GPS piece of what you just said because, you know, in a sense, GPS is supposed to show you the answer. And it really, really. . . COATES: I hate GPS. I hate GPS. DONVAN: Why? COATES: I like the atlas. I totally can hear what he's saying. I love the atlas. You know, I'm a huge, huge fan of, you know, trying to figure it out yourself, which way to go. And, you know, you might get lost. You might, you know? GPS has made it so predictable. TONY: Exactly. GPS is way too predictable. There's way too many mistakes in them. Normally, a GPS will take you a certain set route, man. You get into the atlas and you look. You can make your own way. DONVAN: Well, also with GPS, you never really need to look out the window. TONY: Exactly. DONVAN: You don't need to know the landmarks. Tony, really, really good point. We haven't thought about that at all. Thanks for joining us on TALK OF THE NATION. TONY: Thank you. DONVAN: Wendy(ph), you're in San Antonio, Texas, and you're on TALK OF THE NATION. WENDY: Hi. Yeah, I, a couple decades ago actually, decided to try to learn how to ski, and having grown up in Miami, that wasn't really an option. And so when I took a vacation one time, I took a never-ever-before skiing class. And when I finished the class, I still had never skied because that just wasn't something apparently that I had a skill set for. And as an educator, it really changed how I looked at my students. . . DONVAN: Really. WENDY: . . . because it's not about necessarily somebody not trying or that sort of thing. I was trying as hard as I could, and the teacher was being as patient as she could. But I think because I'm sort of a control freak, skiing is not a good sport for me. (LAUGHTER)WENDY: So it really affected how I taught. DONVAN: Thanks for your call, Wendy. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION on NPR News. I liked Wendy, Ta-Nehisi, that Wendy said, I'm a control freak. And you're talking about the opposite of control freakdom, aren't you? COATES: Yeah. It was interesting. I kind of forgot what she's saying until she said that, then that kind of nailed it for me because again, I think a huge part of learning things that are outside of your comfort zone, outside of what you'd normally do is really, really letting go. You have to have your self-esteem somewhere else. It has to be built, you know, on something else. It can't really be built on the immediate success of whatever you're trying to learn because that just won't go well. I mean, you have to have something to go home. For me, it was always - I could always come home and say I was a decent father, right? So no matter how bad I did at French or whatever, you know, I could pat my son on the head and that would make me feel better. DONVAN: We have an email from Reed(ph), who writes: I travel by motorcycle on back roads, three to five weeks, four to seven miles - four to 7,000 miles as often as possible. I was buried up to my rear axle and mud with dust coming on five miles from nowhere in the Ozarks three weeks ago. Imagine all sorts of stuff while in safe areas on the road. So in the - I don't know. . . COATES: That sounds great. DONVAN: Yeah. But is it the risk he's talking - that attracts you or is it the I'm-going-to-just-let-whatever happens happen, which again. . . COATES: No. I think it's what you just said: I think is I'm going to let whatever happen happens happens. I mean, you know, for me, you it was just the matter of, like, English sort of disappearing. And I'm sure there a lot of people who are familiar with this. But, you know, regrettably, I have not. I've been to Europe, London, once as a very, very young child. I just had never been in an environment. And I have to say the further I got away from Paris the more this was true, where it just, you know, English just went away. You know, and as a writer, you know, as somebody who has written in English, who makes his, you know, living, writing in English, so obviously, that's extremely important for me. And to see that go away, and to have every one else around me, you know, sort of look at me, like, I didn't have what they had. I was - it didn't matter how quote, unquote, \"smart I was,\" you know, or how I perceived myself as this, you know, whatever big-time writer for The Atlantic. No one cared. No one cared at all. You know, I was a 3-year-old walking around in a 37-year-old's body. DONVAN: Let's go to Jen(ph) in Highland Park, Pennsylvania. Hi, Jen, You're on TALK OF THE NATION. JEN: Hi there. So I called because I did something that's kind of a classic story. Going west, my boyfriend and I, now husband, moved out there, put our savings together, sold everything we had, and were quite successful out there for three years, pounding the pavement, working really hard. And I came back here and opened my own business as a designer seamstress for gowns, dresses, women's wear. Every day, I am out of my comfort zone because every day I'm trying something new navigating through a gown to make fit someone like a glove, creating things that don't exist. And it's really good just to go with the flow and be challenged every day and it's amazing. I can't believe I actually, you know. . . DONVAN: Congratulations to that. JEN: If you can. . . DONVAN: Yeah. Congratulations for that. But I have a question that comes off of what you said. You said a couple of times that you've been successful, which means that in the end, you kind of got to a place where you wanted to be. And what I want take to Ta-Nehisi is, you know, what if these wanderings and wonderings don't lead, you know, lead you into trouble and lead you into corners that you can't get out of. Is it as charming to you then or is that - do you just need to, like, let that be the risk, otherwise it's not going to authentic? JEN: It is a risk. And I take that risk. Some of my clients have been very difficult, and I wondered, you know, how did I not see this coming before? But in the end, I work harder and I pushed through and I make it work. DONVAN: All right. JEN: (Unintelligible) says. You just - you make it work. And, yeah, it's worth the risk. It's, you know, why be boring? Why do the same thing all the time and you could really find out what you're made of. DONVAN: Amen to that. Thanks, Jen, very much for your call. I want to go to Rachel(ph) in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Hi, Rachel. You're on TALK OF THE NATION. RACHEL: Hi. I studied Latin for a decade, and then I decided, well, French is like Latin, so I'll go to France and I'll just learn it while I'm there(LAUGHTER)RACHEL: And I was - like Ta-Nehisi - I had, like, a three-year-old's vocabulary. I learned a lot about food, so I got really good at asking what I wanted. But I had to learn how to function just with this limited vocabulary and because I have severe anxiety. I have an anxiety disorder that I'm treated for, and so I actually, while going in France, I had to make this inner journey where I confronted some of my own anxieties and some of my own issues. And I found it extremely cathartic. DONVAN: Really? RACHEL: I mean that - yeah. DONVAN: So - because I would think you would say it would be triply stressful for you. RACHEL: Yes and no. It wasn't - this wasn't the first time that I had done something like this. And I realized, you know, like, when I moved out of my - when I moved away from my parents, my mom said to me, you know, there's going to be stuff that you're going to work out and I can't do that for you, and I'm - you're going to have to do it while I'm not around. And working out - being able to work out, you know, those things when I'm completely alone, and alone as in there's a language barrier, I can't go talk to anyone about it. . . DONVAN: Right. RACHEL: . . . ended up being really healthy. DONVAN: What do you think, Ta-Nehisi? COATES: I totally agree with all that, and it is cathartic. And it also - I think, like, in - at least for me, when I am home, there is a kind of solutionism that, you know, I fall into. Well, I don't feel good today. I can easily go out and do something to fix that. I'm feeling bad about something right now. I can go out and fix that. When you have a language barrier, a lot of times there's nothing that can be done because you can only express so much to other people, and you may not even know that many people to even express it to. And so it was just kind of accepting the world as it was. And I have to tell you, I was only gone for nine days. So, I mean, I can't even, you know, I'm going to see really soon what it's like. But I can't even imagine, you know, an elongated period like that. I mean, it just sounds incredible. DONVAN: Ta-Nehisi, I want to thank you for joining us. And now we know that solutionism is the opposite of wonder. Ta-Nehisi Coates is a senior editor for The Atlantic. His piece, \"How Learning a Foreign Language Reignited My Imagination,\" appears in the June issue of the magazine. He joined us today from his home in (unintelligible). Thanks for joining us.

DONVAN: This is about the process and the journey more than about the product and (unintelligible). OK. COATES: Yes. Yes. Yes, yes. So in 2011 - you know, and not just in terms of learning a foreign language, but, in general, I think one of the things we get away from as we age is this sense of wonder. When you're a child - at least when I was a child - you know, wonder was essential to survival. We had questions about the world, and imagination is one way in which, you know, we answer those questions. And one of the things I was confronted with when I went to study French immediately was the fact of entire worlds that you just could not comprehend. I mean, speech is so elemental to how we communicate. And I found my wonder, my imagination being exercised in that space, often just to understand what people were saying and try to imagine what folks were saying. (LAUGHTER) DONVAN: I want to pin you down a little bit on what - I want you to define wonder for me, because everything you just described could be confusion, which is not the same thing, but might be related. So what do you mean by wonder? COATES: That's a great point, and I'm not sure wonder and confusion are two different things. You know what it is? I think wonder is the acceptance of confusion and the enjoyment of it, you know, like the feeling that it's OK to be confused, that you're lost and kind of thrilling in that sort of feeling of being lost, of not understanding and reaching at various things. And, you know, when you study a foreign language, that's the first thing. I mean, just the sheer not understanding is terrifying. It's like being reduced to being a two or three-year-old, except, you know, in my case, you're a 35, 36, 37-year-old dude. But your mind functions like a three-year-old. I strongly suspect that's why young people pick it up so much easier. They don't have any of that insecurity at all. DONVAN: Well, what do you think is the evolutionary purpose of our losing the sense of wonder? In other words, if wonder is so wonderful, why, as adults, do we give it up? COATES: Well, I don't know - I mean, it's obviously wonderful, but I don't know how great it is, because, again, the other part of that that it always comes with is confusion and fear. Those are parts of it. I think as children, if we didn't have to have it, we wouldn't have to have it. As adults, we become more in control of our actions. We decide where we're going to go, what we're going to see, who we're going to talk to, what we're going to talk to about. As a child, you know, it's a good thing to learn the language in which people are speaking around you. As an adult, once you've acquired that, why go any further? You don't have to. DONVAN: But it's almost like saying that learning is the death of wonder. In other words, if you learned as a child to speak the language that your parents speak and you start to struggle through it, the more you learn, the less you have to wonder what they're talking about. COATES: Well, you know what, I would say once you - the end of learning is probably the end of wonder, you know? If you make a decision to stop right there, you know, and not pick up anything else, then, yeah. You know, I think a big part of this is the willingness to look stupid. I mean, that's a really, really huge part of it, something again that children, you know, having not yet learned, really, really young children not yet learned, don't have to worry about. But with adults, we want to know what's going on. We want to know right now. DONVAN: I remember seeing an interview with James Gandolfini who starred in \"The Sopranos,\" talking about his early days of studying acting. And he was praising his teacher, and I can't remember her name, but he said, the things she taught me to be willing to do was to make a complete idiot of myself in front of everybody and to not care about it. COATES: As far as I'm concerned, it is so essential to being any sort of real disciplined thinker, to being any kind of intellectual, a willingness to look stupid. I just think it's just absolutely, absolutely essential. And I'm not talking about, like, proud ignorance. You know, I'm not talking about going around and being, you know, happy to not know something but accepting that fact, accepting that and then, you know, moving forward. DONVAN: You're almost talking about courage. I want to bring in Bridget(ph). She's in San Marcos, Texas. Hi, Bridget. You're on TALK OF THE NATION. And I assume you've been listening to what Ta-Nehisi has been talking about, so you want to jump in on this? BRIDGET: Oh, I'm totally in agreement with him. And I think one of the words that I've recently learned to apply to my new endeavor is that it's humbling. I've always been a really talented person with language, and I learned to read so young. I learned - I think before I was three, I was reading pretty well. I'm just one of those weird kids. So I felt cheated I never - I don't remember what it was like to be excited about learning to read. And I learned Spanish and French when I was an FBI linguist, so I'm good with language. But I recently wanted a new challenge just like your guest, and I, long story short, kind of ran across Braille. And I'm a sighted person. I have good vision with my contacts, and I'm learning Braille on my own. And there are lots of books available at libraries, and I am so humbled by the difficulty of it. Like I said, I'm a good language person. I'm a good reader, but this is a whole different part of the brain. And it is so - you feel - I don't want to say stupid, but you feel like, OK, how many times can I do this not. . . DONVAN: I want to pick - Bridget, I want to pick up on the word you just threw in there a couple of times, humbling, and put that back to Ta-Nehisi and see if that's also what you're talking about. COATES: Yeah. No, that's definitely what I'm talking about. I mean, when I went to France and then to Switzerland this spring, one of the things that people warned me about was how rude people would be in France because, you know, you don't speak French well. And, you know, I didn't find people to be especially rude. But I think a lot of that comes from the notion that learning should be predictable, that it should be easy, that it should be polite, that it should happen in this sort of way where everyone salutes you for the fact that you want to learn something. But the whole experience is humbling because you don't know. You really, really don't know. You don't know what's going to happen. You don't know what people are saying about you. You don't know how people are going to react to you. DONVAN: Maybe it's a relief that you don't know. COATES: Maybe so. DONVAN: And maybe you can enjoy that. All right, Bridget. Thanks for your call. I want to go to Tony(ph) who's in Denver, Pennsylvania. Hi, Tony. You're on TALK OF THE NATION. TONY: Hi. How are you doing? DONVAN: We're good. TONY: Pretty much the question is about when do you leave your comfort zone. I do it pretty much every week. I've recently gotten back in the long-haul driving, and every day is an adventure. You know, you have an address, you have a new set of directions. GPS can take you so far and somebody says you turned left, you should've turned right. It can get interesting out here. You know, you make a wrong turn with a truck, you know, you're 65, 70 feet long. She's not going to turn around and (unintelligible) with a car. DONVAN: So I'm interested in the GPS piece of what you just said because, you know, in a sense, GPS is supposed to show you the answer. And it really, really. . . COATES: I hate GPS. I hate GPS. DONVAN: Why? COATES: I like the atlas. I totally can hear what he's saying. I love the atlas. You know, I'm a huge, huge fan of, you know, trying to figure it out yourself, which way to go. And, you know, you might get lost. You might, you know? GPS has made it so predictable. TONY: Exactly. GPS is way too predictable. There's way too many mistakes in them. Normally, a GPS will take you a certain set route, man. You get into the atlas and you look. You can make your own way. DONVAN: Well, also with GPS, you never really need to look out the window. TONY: Exactly. DONVAN: You don't need to know the landmarks. Tony, really, really good point. We haven't thought about that at all. Thanks for joining us on TALK OF THE NATION. TONY: Thank you. DONVAN: Wendy(ph), you're in San Antonio, Texas, and you're on TALK OF THE NATION. WENDY: Hi. Yeah, I, a couple decades ago actually, decided to try to learn how to ski, and having grown up in Miami, that wasn't really an option. And so when I took a vacation one time, I took a never-ever-before skiing class. And when I finished the class, I still had never skied because that just wasn't something apparently that I had a skill set for. And as an educator, it really changed how I looked at my students. . . DONVAN: Really. WENDY: . . . because it's not about necessarily somebody not trying or that sort of thing. I was trying as hard as I could, and the teacher was being as patient as she could. But I think because I'm sort of a control freak, skiing is not a good sport for me. (LAUGHTER) WENDY: So it really affected how I taught. DONVAN: Thanks for your call, Wendy. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION on NPR News. I liked Wendy, Ta-Nehisi, that Wendy said, I'm a control freak. And you're talking about the opposite of control freakdom, aren't you? COATES: Yeah. It was interesting. I kind of forgot what she's saying until she said that, then that kind of nailed it for me because again, I think a huge part of learning things that are outside of your comfort zone, outside of what you'd normally do is really, really letting go. You have to have your self-esteem somewhere else. It has to be built, you know, on something else. It can't really be built on the immediate success of whatever you're trying to learn because that just won't go well. I mean, you have to have something to go home. For me, it was always - I could always come home and say I was a decent father, right? So no matter how bad I did at French or whatever, you know, I could pat my son on the head and that would make me feel better. DONVAN: We have an email from Reed(ph), who writes: I travel by motorcycle on back roads, three to five weeks, four to seven miles - four to 7,000 miles as often as possible. I was buried up to my rear axle and mud with dust coming on five miles from nowhere in the Ozarks three weeks ago. Imagine all sorts of stuff while in safe areas on the road. So in the - I don't know. . . COATES: That sounds great. DONVAN: Yeah. But is it the risk he's talking - that attracts you or is it the I'm-going-to-just-let-whatever happens happen, which again. . . COATES: No. I think it's what you just said: I think is I'm going to let whatever happen happens happens. I mean, you know, for me, you it was just the matter of, like, English sort of disappearing. And I'm sure there a lot of people who are familiar with this. But, you know, regrettably, I have not. I've been to Europe, London, once as a very, very young child. I just had never been in an environment. And I have to say the further I got away from Paris the more this was true, where it just, you know, English just went away. You know, and as a writer, you know, as somebody who has written in English, who makes his, you know, living, writing in English, so obviously, that's extremely important for me. And to see that go away, and to have every one else around me, you know, sort of look at me, like, I didn't have what they had. I was - it didn't matter how quote, unquote, \"smart I was,\" you know, or how I perceived myself as this, you know, whatever big-time writer for The Atlantic. No one cared. No one cared at all. You know, I was a 3-year-old walking around in a 37-year-old's body. DONVAN: Let's go to Jen(ph) in Highland Park, Pennsylvania. Hi, Jen, You're on TALK OF THE NATION. JEN: Hi there. So I called because I did something that's kind of a classic story. Going west, my boyfriend and I, now husband, moved out there, put our savings together, sold everything we had, and were quite successful out there for three years, pounding the pavement, working really hard. And I came back here and opened my own business as a designer seamstress for gowns, dresses, women's wear. Every day, I am out of my comfort zone because every day I'm trying something new navigating through a gown to make fit someone like a glove, creating things that don't exist. And it's really good just to go with the flow and be challenged every day and it's amazing. I can't believe I actually, you know. . . DONVAN: Congratulations to that. JEN: If you can. . . DONVAN: Yeah. Congratulations for that. But I have a question that comes off of what you said. You said a couple of times that you've been successful, which means that in the end, you kind of got to a place where you wanted to be. And what I want take to Ta-Nehisi is, you know, what if these wanderings and wonderings don't lead, you know, lead you into trouble and lead you into corners that you can't get out of. Is it as charming to you then or is that - do you just need to, like, let that be the risk, otherwise it's not going to authentic? JEN: It is a risk. And I take that risk. Some of my clients have been very difficult, and I wondered, you know, how did I not see this coming before? But in the end, I work harder and I pushed through and I make it work. DONVAN: All right. JEN: (Unintelligible) says. You just - you make it work. And, yeah, it's worth the risk. It's, you know, why be boring? Why do the same thing all the time and you could really find out what you're made of. DONVAN: Amen to that. Thanks, Jen, very much for your call. I want to go to Rachel(ph) in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Hi, Rachel. You're on TALK OF THE NATION. RACHEL: Hi. I studied Latin for a decade, and then I decided, well, French is like Latin, so I'll go to France and I'll just learn it while I'm there (LAUGHTER) RACHEL: And I was - like Ta-Nehisi - I had, like, a three-year-old's vocabulary. I learned a lot about food, so I got really good at asking what I wanted. But I had to learn how to function just with this limited vocabulary and because I have severe anxiety. I have an anxiety disorder that I'm treated for, and so I actually, while going in France, I had to make this inner journey where I confronted some of my own anxieties and some of my own issues. And I found it extremely cathartic. DONVAN: Really? RACHEL: I mean that - yeah. DONVAN: So - because I would think you would say it would be triply stressful for you. RACHEL: Yes and no. It wasn't - this wasn't the first time that I had done something like this. And I realized, you know, like, when I moved out of my - when I moved away from my parents, my mom said to me, you know, there's going to be stuff that you're going to work out and I can't do that for you, and I'm - you're going to have to do it while I'm not around. And working out - being able to work out, you know, those things when I'm completely alone, and alone as in there's a language barrier, I can't go talk to anyone about it. . . DONVAN: Right. RACHEL: . . . ended up being really healthy. DONVAN: What do you think, Ta-Nehisi? COATES: I totally agree with all that, and it is cathartic. And it also - I think, like, in - at least for me, when I am home, there is a kind of solutionism that, you know, I fall into. Well, I don't feel good today. I can easily go out and do something to fix that. I'm feeling bad about something right now. I can go out and fix that. When you have a language barrier, a lot of times there's nothing that can be done because you can only express so much to other people, and you may not even know that many people to even express it to. And so it was just kind of accepting the world as it was. And I have to tell you, I was only gone for nine days. So, I mean, I can't even, you know, I'm going to see really soon what it's like. But I can't even imagine, you know, an elongated period like that. I mean, it just sounds incredible. DONVAN: Ta-Nehisi, I want to thank you for joining us. And now we know that solutionism is the opposite of wonder. Ta-Nehisi Coates is a senior editor for The Atlantic. His piece, \"How Learning a Foreign Language Reignited My Imagination,\" appears in the June issue of the magazine. He joined us today from his home in (unintelligible). Thanks for joining us.

Today we're going to spend some time talking about the power of social media. In a few minutes we'll meet one of Bahrain's most popular bloggers. He's actually been in hiding for the past two years to avoid arrest for his critiques of his government. He's now been granted political asylum in London, and he'll share some of his thoughts with us in a few minutes. But first we want to talk about how social media can spread all kinds of messages. Recently we've talked a lot about Twitter, for example, how it played a role in building up a fan base for the ABC hit \"Scandal. \" But Twitter can also be a vehicle for some really raw, offensive messages - racist, homophobic, you name it. Our next guests have tried to see if there's actually a pattern to this. Monica Stephens is an assistant professor of geography at Humboldt State University. That's in Arcadia, California. From June of 2012 to April 2013, she sorted through hate speech on Twitter and quite literally put it on a map. The map is called \"The Geography of Hate,\" and it's been published on the blog floatingsheep. org. And Professor Monica Stephens is with us now. Welcome, and thanks for joining us. Also with us is Danielle Belton. She is editor-at-large for Clutch magazine online and creator of theblacksnob. com. She's a regular contributor to our program and is very active on social media, and she's with us now, as well. Danielle, welcome back, thank you so much for joining us. DANIELLE BELTON: Always great to be here. MARTIN: So Professor Stephens, let's start with you. Let's just say the methodology is very interesting, but I don't want to spend all of our time on it. But just briefly, because you do go into detail about this on the blog, so if people are really interested, they can read all about it. But just briefly, your team pulled together every geo-coded tweet in the U. S. , from June 2012 to April 2013, that contained certain keywords related to hate speech like the N-word or the F-word and people, and so forth like that. So why don't you pick up the thread there. MONICA STEPHENS: Yeah, and then my students actually read through every single geo-coded tweet using one of these words to determine if the sentiment in the tweet was negative aimed towards that particular group or positively aimed towards that group or neutral towards that group. So they were able to determine when these terms were used in jest or when they were joking or when someone was actually using the term to say hey, I'm really offended when you use that term. MARTIN: And by geo-coded, that means what? STEPHENS: Sure, so geo-coding is simply the process of adding an X and a Y coordinate to the tweet itself. So it locates where that tweet is in material space. So we could actually look at it and zoom in, if I had allowed that on the map, and you could actually see even sometimes what part of the house somebody is in and what their - but for this map I aggregated it all to the county level and then normalized that by the total amount of tweets that were in that county over the same time period. MARTIN: And what was the point of doing that? STEPHENS: That was first to protect the privacy of the people who were tweeting, and the other purpose was to account for population density, as, you know, some areas use Twitter more than other areas. There are obviously more tweets sent out from Los Angeles than there are from Omaha, Nebraska, and so just to account for that sort of difference, to say OK, well even if Los Angeles has the largest number of purely hateful tweets, we didn't want it look like it's the hot spot on the map. MARTIN: So we can go through all the qualifiers that the attitudes captured are people who use Twitter and are geo-tagging and using certain terms. But even having said all that, just give us the headline as you saw it. STEPHENS: Well, one of things that was most interesting was the term that it was used to refer to people who are perhaps illegal immigrants, and that ended up being very much clustered in Texas, around San Antonio and the Dallas-Fort Worth area. So when you start to see that sort of clustering happen, that people in that area are more likely to use that term in a negative way, it starts to give us an idea of how conversations are happening within the country. MARTIN: And the N-word was ever popular, correct? I mean, of all the terms that seemed to surface the most often, the N-word seemed - from my reading of the map seemed to continue to be everlasting, right? STEPHENS: Yeah, the students went through about 90,000 uses of the N-word to determine which ones were negative. MARTIN: And geographically, did you notice - was there any trend that was significant? STEPHENS: It tends to be in smaller towns, particularly in the Midwest, sort of the Rust Belt area, more so than it is in the South, but it's also quite present within Georgia and Alabama, as well. MARTIN: So Danielle, as somebody who's connected through blogging, you kind of live on Twitter, right, and its social media, but what do you make of this, surprising, not surprising? BELTON: It's not surprising. I mean, one of the things that attracts people to Twitter is the fact that it can be an anonymous forum. So people can rant and vent and say things that they would never say to your face online. It's an apt tool for what many people call trolling. So it's a way to get people incensed, a way to get a whole lot of attention. So it doesn't surprise me at all that you find in small towns that you'd have someone who's already anonymous, because of the power of Twitter, would feel like they're free, you know, to speak their mind, and their mind might possibly be filled with hate. MARTIN: Professor Stephens, I know that just - and the map is interactive. I mean, you can pick certain terms and see where there were clusters of those terms, noting, as you said, that certain terms for people of Mexican descent, right, that have been used in the past, like the W-word, let's call it that, seem to be located in certain areas. Even with all that, were you surprised that the West Coast did not show a lot of these terms? STEPHENS: Yeah, I was surprised, but what I was more surprised by was that these terms are happening everywhere; that especially the N-word is quite universal around the United States. It wasn't just in small towns in the South, which is what, you know, we would have initially assumed. MARTIN: What else? Where there any places where you didn't find those terms being used? STEPHENS: Well yeah, I mean, I think that - I've gotten a lot of people questioning well, you know, why is it that Illinois or Indiana looks more hateful than Montana? And part of it is that there's just not as many people on Twitter altogether in Montana. MARTIN: If you're just joining us, we're talking about a new study that literally puts certain racist, homophobic and hate speech directed toward people with disabilities on the map. Our guest is Professor Monica Stephens, who led a team that literally put these terms on a map. Danielle, you wanted to say something. BELTON: Oh, I was going to say that it doesn't surprise me that you'd have a lot of racist tweets out of Illinois or Indiana. Being a native Midwesterner, there are certain regions and hot spots within these individual states that have a reputation for people being very vocal about minorities. And in the case of Illinois and Indiana, and even my home state of Missouri, you have a significant African-American population, not enough where we're the majority in any type of capacity, but just enough where people feel the need that they can be very expressive in how they want to complain about it. You know, you can't complain about something unless you actually see it on a daily basis. So it's like - sometimes I think maybe people use Twitter less in Montana, but there's a lot fewer minorities in Montana. MARTIN: Well, but that's an interesting question, though, because there's all kinds of conventional wisdom, which may or may not comport with fact, around how racial attitudes are formed. But one of sort of the truisms is that familiarity would lessen these kinds of attitudes because people would know somebody, right, they would know somebody of a different race, and therefore - or hopefully more than one person - and therefore that there would be less inclination toward these kinds of attitudes. BELTON: You'd think. That's true, but in the Midwest, a lot of these major cities are heavily segregated. So in many cases, familiarity has bred like contempt between people, because people are in their segregated enclaves, and they feel very strongly about people who are different from them. MARTIN: Professor Stephens? STEPHENS: I think it's also that they haven't been together. I think that these - that people are more likely to tweet something using the N-word, for example, if they have had a negative experience with somebody who's black. And you'll notice that where I live, in Arcadia, California, there's very little traffic, and part of it is there's very little Twitter traffic, but also there aren't that many black people, but also that people do live in less segregated ways than they do in some cities, where you have, you know, a black area of a city and a white area of a city, and perhaps an Asian area of a city. MARTIN: Again I said I didn't want to get stuck on the methodology, but Professor Stephens, I did find the methodology fascinating in the sense that there were so many uses of the B-word that you didn't have the research funding to pay people to go through all of them to determine whether they were positive or negative. There were literally millions. And I'm wondering if you have any hypothesis about that, why is the use of the B-word so prevalent? STEPHENS: There were 5. 5 million geo-coded tweets using the B-word over this 10-month period. And so to pay students to read every single one would have been about 641 days of student work in order to do that. So it wasn't feasible to look through it. But why do I think people use it more? I think it's often more used in also a positive, in a jeering way. Somebody pointed out that dog breeders use the word, as well. So I think that it's used in a variety of different contexts. MARTIN: And tell us, if you would, about the responses that you've been getting to your study. STEPHENS: Well, I've received a lot of comments from people who haven't been able to read - they frequently ask questions, part on our blog floatingsheep. org. And so that's where I've been able to refer most people to, is we address issues where people comment and say, oh, it's not normalized by population. It's like yeah, it is. California has one-eighth of the population of the United States, and it hardly shows up on the map. So that's one response I've gotten. I've also received a large response from white men who feel that they're being discriminated at by not being included in the map. And we actually tried to. We also looked at words like honky, cracker and gringo, but actually, those weren't necessarily used in a negative way very often, particularly the word honky, which often is referring to honky-tonk music and honky-tonk bars. And people were using it in a very, very positive context. So it wasn't something that we could include in the map, because it ends up being very - just such a small number of words that are actually negative. MARTIN: Redneck? STEPHENS: Redneck had a huge number, as well, but a lot of them weren't really negative towards rednecks. And they were also generally leveraged by people of the same group, and you could kind of tell that. Like. . . MARTIN: So as being familial, in the same way that some black people use the N-word in a familial way, which you also screened out for - as not being negative. STEPHENS: Right. MARTIN: What do you - I understand that you kind of want to stick to the research, but any particular conclusion you'd want to point us to about this? STEPHENS: At this point, we're still examining a lot of the conclusions, as far as the underlying demographics of this. But I think one of the things that pops out is the small town nature, and perhaps these are places that have experienced larger amounts of job loss over recent years. So that's an avenue I want to explore further. MARTIN: Danielle, what about you? Any conclusions that you would point us to? BELTON: I would say that this is just another example about how far we have to go as a society when it comes to race and ethnicity. Even though she couldn't normalize it for gender, because of the fact the term is used so much, the fact that the B word is a normal term for a lot of people to throw around, even though it has a negative connotation, is indicative of how far we still have to go. MARTIN: Danielle Belton is editor-at-large for Clutch magazine online and creator of the BlackSnob. com. She was with us from St. Louis, Missouri. Monica Stevens is assistant professor of geography at Humboldt State University, although we caught up with her in Lexington, Kentucky, where she's traveling. Thank you both so much for speaking with us. BELTON: Thank you, Michel. STEPHENS: Thank you very much. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  I'm Michel Martin, and this is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. Today we're going to spend some time talking about the power of social media. In a few minutes we'll meet one of Bahrain's most popular bloggers.

Our next guests have tried to see if there's actually a pattern to this. Monica Stephens is an assistant professor of geography at Humboldt State University. That's in Arcadia, California. From June of 2012 to April 2013, she sorted through hate speech on Twitter and quite literally put it on a map. The map is called \"The Geography of Hate,\" and it's been published on the blog floatingsheep. org. And Professor Monica Stephens is with us now. Welcome, and thanks for joining us. Also with us is Danielle Belton. She is editor-at-large for Clutch magazine online and creator of theblacksnob. com. She's a regular contributor to our program and is very active on social media, and she's with us now, as well. Danielle, welcome back, thank you so much for joining us. DANIELLE BELTON: Always great to be here. MARTIN: So Professor Stephens, let's start with you. Let's just say the methodology is very interesting, but I don't want to spend all of our time on it. But just briefly, because you do go into detail about this on the blog, so if people are really interested, they can read all about it. But just briefly, your team pulled together every geo-coded tweet in the U. S. , from June 2012 to April 2013, that contained certain keywords related to hate speech like the N-word or the F-word and people, and so forth like that. So why don't you pick up the thread there. MONICA STEPHENS: Yeah, and then my students actually read through every single geo-coded tweet using one of these words to determine if the sentiment in the tweet was negative aimed towards that particular group or positively aimed towards that group or neutral towards that group. So they were able to determine when these terms were used in jest or when they were joking or when someone was actually using the term to say hey, I'm really offended when you use that term. MARTIN: And by geo-coded, that means what? STEPHENS: Sure, so geo-coding is simply the process of adding an X and a Y coordinate to the tweet itself. So it locates where that tweet is in material space. So we could actually look at it and zoom in, if I had allowed that on the map, and you could actually see even sometimes what part of the house somebody is in and what their - but for this map I aggregated it all to the county level and then normalized that by the total amount of tweets that were in that county over the same time period. MARTIN: And what was the point of doing that? STEPHENS: That was first to protect the privacy of the people who were tweeting, and the other purpose was to account for population density, as, you know, some areas use Twitter more than other areas. There are obviously more tweets sent out from Los Angeles than there are from Omaha, Nebraska, and so just to account for that sort of difference, to say OK, well even if Los Angeles has the largest number of purely hateful tweets, we didn't want it look like it's the hot spot on the map. MARTIN: So we can go through all the qualifiers that the attitudes captured are people who use Twitter and are geo-tagging and using certain terms. But even having said all that, just give us the headline as you saw it. STEPHENS: Well, one of things that was most interesting was the term that it was used to refer to people who are perhaps illegal immigrants, and that ended up being very much clustered in Texas, around San Antonio and the Dallas-Fort Worth area. So when you start to see that sort of clustering happen, that people in that area are more likely to use that term in a negative way, it starts to give us an idea of how conversations are happening within the country. MARTIN: And the N-word was ever popular, correct? I mean, of all the terms that seemed to surface the most often, the N-word seemed - from my reading of the map seemed to continue to be everlasting, right? STEPHENS: Yeah, the students went through about 90,000 uses of the N-word to determine which ones were negative. MARTIN: And geographically, did you notice - was there any trend that was significant? STEPHENS: It tends to be in smaller towns, particularly in the Midwest, sort of the Rust Belt area, more so than it is in the South, but it's also quite present within Georgia and Alabama, as well. MARTIN: So Danielle, as somebody who's connected through blogging, you kind of live on Twitter, right, and its social media, but what do you make of this, surprising, not surprising? BELTON: It's not surprising. I mean, one of the things that attracts people to Twitter is the fact that it can be an anonymous forum. So people can rant and vent and say things that they would never say to your face online. It's an apt tool for what many people call trolling. So it's a way to get people incensed, a way to get a whole lot of attention. So it doesn't surprise me at all that you find in small towns that you'd have someone who's already anonymous, because of the power of Twitter, would feel like they're free, you know, to speak their mind, and their mind might possibly be filled with hate. MARTIN: Professor Stephens, I know that just - and the map is interactive. I mean, you can pick certain terms and see where there were clusters of those terms, noting, as you said, that certain terms for people of Mexican descent, right, that have been used in the past, like the W-word, let's call it that, seem to be located in certain areas. Even with all that, were you surprised that the West Coast did not show a lot of these terms? STEPHENS: Yeah, I was surprised, but what I was more surprised by was that these terms are happening everywhere; that especially the N-word is quite universal around the United States. It wasn't just in small towns in the South, which is what, you know, we would have initially assumed. MARTIN: What else? Where there any places where you didn't find those terms being used? STEPHENS: Well yeah, I mean, I think that - I've gotten a lot of people questioning well, you know, why is it that Illinois or Indiana looks more hateful than Montana? And part of it is that there's just not as many people on Twitter altogether in Montana. MARTIN: If you're just joining us, we're talking about a new study that literally puts certain racist, homophobic and hate speech directed toward people with disabilities on the map. Our guest is Professor Monica Stephens, who led a team that literally put these terms on a map. Danielle, you wanted to say something. BELTON: Oh, I was going to say that it doesn't surprise me that you'd have a lot of racist tweets out of Illinois or Indiana. Being a native Midwesterner, there are certain regions and hot spots within these individual states that have a reputation for people being very vocal about minorities. And in the case of Illinois and Indiana, and even my home state of Missouri, you have a significant African-American population, not enough where we're the majority in any type of capacity, but just enough where people feel the need that they can be very expressive in how they want to complain about it. You know, you can't complain about something unless you actually see it on a daily basis. So it's like - sometimes I think maybe people use Twitter less in Montana, but there's a lot fewer minorities in Montana. MARTIN: Well, but that's an interesting question, though, because there's all kinds of conventional wisdom, which may or may not comport with fact, around how racial attitudes are formed. But one of sort of the truisms is that familiarity would lessen these kinds of attitudes because people would know somebody, right, they would know somebody of a different race, and therefore - or hopefully more than one person - and therefore that there would be less inclination toward these kinds of attitudes. BELTON: You'd think. That's true, but in the Midwest, a lot of these major cities are heavily segregated. So in many cases, familiarity has bred like contempt between people, because people are in their segregated enclaves, and they feel very strongly about people who are different from them. MARTIN: Professor Stephens? STEPHENS: I think it's also that they haven't been together. I think that these - that people are more likely to tweet something using the N-word, for example, if they have had a negative experience with somebody who's black. And you'll notice that where I live, in Arcadia, California, there's very little traffic, and part of it is there's very little Twitter traffic, but also there aren't that many black people, but also that people do live in less segregated ways than they do in some cities, where you have, you know, a black area of a city and a white area of a city, and perhaps an Asian area of a city. MARTIN: Again I said I didn't want to get stuck on the methodology, but Professor Stephens, I did find the methodology fascinating in the sense that there were so many uses of the B-word that you didn't have the research funding to pay people to go through all of them to determine whether they were positive or negative. There were literally millions. And I'm wondering if you have any hypothesis about that, why is the use of the B-word so prevalent? STEPHENS: There were 5. 5 million geo-coded tweets using the B-word over this 10-month period. And so to pay students to read every single one would have been about 641 days of student work in order to do that. So it wasn't feasible to look through it. But why do I think people use it more? I think it's often more used in also a positive, in a jeering way. Somebody pointed out that dog breeders use the word, as well. So I think that it's used in a variety of different contexts. MARTIN: And tell us, if you would, about the responses that you've been getting to your study. STEPHENS: Well, I've received a lot of comments from people who haven't been able to read - they frequently ask questions, part on our blog floatingsheep. org. And so that's where I've been able to refer most people to, is we address issues where people comment and say, oh, it's not normalized by population. It's like yeah, it is. California has one-eighth of the population of the United States, and it hardly shows up on the map. So that's one response I've gotten. I've also received a large response from white men who feel that they're being discriminated at by not being included in the map. And we actually tried to. We also looked at words like honky, cracker and gringo, but actually, those weren't necessarily used in a negative way very often, particularly the word honky, which often is referring to honky-tonk music and honky-tonk bars. And people were using it in a very, very positive context. So it wasn't something that we could include in the map, because it ends up being very - just such a small number of words that are actually negative. MARTIN: Redneck? STEPHENS: Redneck had a huge number, as well, but a lot of them weren't really negative towards rednecks. And they were also generally leveraged by people of the same group, and you could kind of tell that. Like. . . MARTIN: So as being familial, in the same way that some black people use the N-word in a familial way, which you also screened out for - as not being negative. STEPHENS: Right. MARTIN: What do you - I understand that you kind of want to stick to the research, but any particular conclusion you'd want to point us to about this? STEPHENS: At this point, we're still examining a lot of the conclusions, as far as the underlying demographics of this. But I think one of the things that pops out is the small town nature, and perhaps these are places that have experienced larger amounts of job loss over recent years. So that's an avenue I want to explore further. MARTIN: Danielle, what about you? Any conclusions that you would point us to? BELTON: I would say that this is just another example about how far we have to go as a society when it comes to race and ethnicity. Even though she couldn't normalize it for gender, because of the fact the term is used so much, the fact that the B word is a normal term for a lot of people to throw around, even though it has a negative connotation, is indicative of how far we still have to go. MARTIN: Danielle Belton is editor-at-large for Clutch magazine online and creator of the BlackSnob. com. She was with us from St. Louis, Missouri. Monica Stevens is assistant professor of geography at Humboldt State University, although we caught up with her in Lexington, Kentucky, where she's traveling. Thank you both so much for speaking with us. BELTON: Thank you, Michel. STEPHENS: Thank you very much.", "section": "Technology", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2013 NPR.  All rights reserved.

He stood at a podium near a small crowd of newly-hired workers. In the back, stood yet more workers, in matching white work coats with a Lenovo patch. GOVERNOR PAT MCCRORY REPUBLICAN, NORTH CAROLINA: Manufacturing is coming back to the country, manufacturing is coming back to North Carolina.

But Tom Looney, vice president and general manager for Lenovo in North America, explains why they've put this plant here. TOM LOONEY: Today, in this PC business, speed of execution is key. Time kills deals. So again, we've got do business the way our customers want to do business and that's what this facility will give us, the flexibility and speed to beat our competition everyday on the streets. (SOUNDBITE OF HIGHWAY)INGE: The plant is located near a busy eight lane highway - it's a road made for moving products. Lenovo put the assembly plant inside an existing fulfillment center, and it plans to hire a total of 115 workers to assemble various different ThinkPad notebooks and desk-tops, using components from overseas. Lenovo's Tom Looney says he hopes to hire more people. LOONEY: I was here 60 days ago to help launch this facility and spoke to employees and I told them I was going to take them to their knees. And they actually got a little concerned about that. But I said I was going to take them to their knees with orders so that I can hire the next 115 and the next 115. INGE: Curtis Richardson is one of the new hires. The 27-year-old is an engineering student at North Carolina A&T State University. His job is to test the computers to make sure they work right before shipping. CURTIS RICHARDSON: I really feel that it's an opportunity for me to grow, along with the company as well. That's probably what I really love about Lenovo. INGE: Economic development officials are excited. Penny Whiteheart, with the Piedmont Triad Partnership, says she likes advanced manufacturing jobs because they come with salaries that can support families. PENNY WHITEHEART: For instance, here in the Piedmont Triad, the weekly wage for a manufacturer is almost 20 percent higher than the average for all industries.  So that's why we pay particular attention to those kinds of companies when we're looking to recruit new companies to our area. INGE: But Mike Walden, an economics professor at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, says manufacturing alone can't make up for the tens of thousands of jobs lost when key North Carolina industries like textiles and furniture went overseas.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #5: They should know they're stealing and they should not think it's OK. ULABY: And Pachter says there are ways these companies could start cracking down. PACHTER: Register the members of the household with the account so if two people use the same user ID at the same time, then the content owner is going to be notified that there's an illicit use, and they'll probably turn off both. ULABY: Netflix and other companies claim they're not bothered by password-sharers. But recently, Netflix added an option that seemed to indicate concern.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: I have Hulu and Netflix and HBO Go. ULABY: But this guy does not pay for all of them. He and his friends are promiscuous with their passwords. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"GAME OF THRONES\") UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Oh, come on, let us see it. Everybody talks about it. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Me and people in my circle commonly refer to this as hipster cable. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"GAME OF THRONES\") PETER DINKLAGE: (as Tyrion Lannister) We're going to need details. Copious details. ULABY: Here's how Hipster cable works in this case. Our guy, who does not want his name used on the air, traded his Hulu Plus password for his friend's Netflix and HBO GO passwords. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: This HBO Go does not belong to my friend Kitty who gives it to me. That HBO Go belongs to her parents. And they gave her the password and stuff so she could use it and then, by a proxy, share it with me. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"GAME OF THRONES\") DINKLAGE: (as Tyrion Lannister) We owe them tens of millions. ULABY: So this single password is getting shared by our guy, his housemates and probably Kitty's brothers, potentially dozens of people. MICHAEL PACHTER: People should know better. ULABY: That scold comes from tech analyst Michael Pachter of the firm Wedbush Securities. He estimates 20 percent of people streaming video use passwords they did not pay for. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #5: They should know they're stealing and they should not think it's OK. ULABY: And Pachter says there are ways these companies could start cracking down. PACHTER: Register the members of the household with the account so if two people use the same user ID at the same time, then the content owner is going to be notified that there's an illicit use, and they'll probably turn off both. ULABY: Netflix and other companies claim they're not bothered by password-sharers. But recently, Netflix added an option that seemed to indicate concern. It allows four people to legally stream videos at the same time. Convincing the cable companies to allow a similar option for HBO Go would probably take an army.

As NPR's Howard Berkes reports, this data farm, costing more than $1 billion, sits on a National Guard base south of Salt Lake City. HOWARD BERKES, BYLINE: The complex of buildings is finished and at 1. 5 million square feet, it's five times bigger than the Ikea down the road. It's top secret so we can't get any closer than this four-lane highway. This is a location that is quintessential for Utah. Mountains rise behind this dusty, desert foothill. There's even a compound of polygamists nearby. Inside the NSA's Utah Data Center, workers are now planting 100,000 square feet of computers and sometime in September the data harvest begins. HARVEY DAVIS: This is just part of a big network, OK. And the data is analyzed across that network. BERKES: Which means, as NSA installation director Harvey Davis, the place will employ about 100 technicians and no intelligence analysts. DAVIS: When an analyst sits in front of their computer and does their work, they don't particularly care from whence the data came, OK. And as long as the data finds its way into the network, people who do the work, analytic work and data do not have to be, geographically, in the same place. BERKES: So it's the computers that will do the work here in Utah and boy will they be busy consuming 65 megawatts of power, enough for 65,000 homes.  They'll get so hot, they need a million and a half gallons of water a day to stay cool. After all, they'll be able to process enough emails, phone calls, text messages and other data to take up five zettabytes of storage. Five zettabytes would fill more than a trillion DVDs. That's an estimate from William Binney, a former NSA technical director. WILLIAM BINNEY: They must have plenty of space with five zettabytes to store, you know, at least something on the order of 100 years worth of the worldwide communications, phones and emails and stuff like that, and then have plenty of space left over to do any kind of parallel processing to try to break codes. BERKES: The NSA says the Data Center capacity is classified information. The Agency's Harvey Davis would only say this about the data it gathers. DAVIS: The NSA's focus is on foreign intelligence and foreign intelligence that ride over the networks is what we're talking about. BERKES: Last summer, General Keith Alexander, the director of the NSA, was asked this during a speech at the American Enterprise Institute. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Will the Utah Data Center hold the data of American citizens? GENERAL KEITH ALEXANDER: No. While I can't go into all the details of the Utah Data Center, we don't hold data on U. S. citizens. BERKES: But given the revelations of the past week about NSA's data gathering, privacy activists are concerned about the agency's new data farm here in Utah. Chris Soghoian focuses on technology privacy at the American Civil Liberties Union. CHRIS SOGHOIAN: We don't know everything that the NSA is doing or, in fact, most of what the NSA is doing, but there is almost certainly surveillance that they would like to do and have not been able to do because they didn't have the storage or computing resources to perform the searches. And this will give them the ability to do more searches through more innocent people's information. BERKES: Last month, the National Security Agency broke ground for another data farm at agency headquarters at Fort Mead, Maryland. It will be two-thirds the size of the new data center here in Utah.

I'm Audie Cornish. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:  And I'm Melissa Block. On the international black market, prices for elephant ivory and rhinoceros horn have reached record highs, and that's pushed wildlife poaching to a fever pitch. Conservationists and governments that profit from wildlife tourism are turning to a high-tech tool to stop the killing: drones. They're doing field tests, and NPR's Christopher Joyce has this story about some early results. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: (Foreign language spoken)CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: A crowd of wildlife rangers has gathered on a woody hillside in Nepal. A man holds what looks like an overgrown toy airplane in his right hand, arm cocked as if to throw it into the sky. (SOUNDBITE OF DRONE ENGINE)(SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING)JOYCE: Which is exactly what he does, letting the propeller take charge and send it skyward. The craft is an unmanned aerial vehicle, also known as a drone, though not the military kind. Its wingspan is about seven feet, and it carries only a video camera. As its electric motor whirrs, the camera films the forest below. It's a test run sponsored and videotaped by the World Wildlife Fund. MATT LEWIS: It's a cat-and-mouse game when it comes to getting ahead of poachers. JOYCE: Matt Lewis is a wildlife biologist with WWF. He says poachers are getting more sophisticated. LEWIS: When poachers are starting to use night vision technology, when poachers are starting to use tranquilizer drugs to silently dart an animal and cut off its horns at night and get out undetected, it's incumbent upon us to find out a better solution to address that. JOYCE: Lewis says aerial vehicles could tip the odds back in favor of the rangers, so WWF is testing simple, inexpensive ones in Nepal and Namibia, in southwest Africa. Lewis says as the war in Afghanistan winds down, drone manufacturers are looking for new customers. But governments are sensitive about the word drone. LEWIS: Drone has a very negative context around the world, primarily due to the military use. JOYCE: But the situation is desperate. In Vietnam, a single rhino horn is now worth a fortune. It's sold as a medicine, even though it's mostly made of keratin, the same stuff as your fingernails. And South Africa is the bank when it comes to rhino horn. Most of the world's rhinos are there, and things are getting out of hand. Kirsty Brebner is a rhino specialist with the Endangered Wildlife Trust in Johannesburg. KIRSTY BREBNER: Rhino poaching right now is the worst it's ever been. Our rhinos are being absolutely slaughtered. JOYCE: More than 600 rhinos killed illegally last year out of a total population of 20,000 in South Africa. Brebner says UAVs hold promise. Last month, a sophisticated drone got a weeklong trial there, but it's more than just a flying camera. BREBNER: It's not just launching it into the African night and hoping that you're going to find something. It's actually doing it with mathematics and some sound science behind it. JOYCE: Math and science is what a team from the University of Maryland brought to the drones-versus-poachers war in South Africa. They're led by Tom Snitch. Snitch is no wildlife biologist. He's an economist who prefers starched white shirts and business suits to khakis and boots. But Snitch's partners at Maryland use mathematical models to predict behavior. They created a program to help the Pentagon predict where bombers in Iraq and Afghanistan would use IEDs. TOM SNITCH: And the fact of the matter is you're looking at human behavior - in that case, IED bombers, in our case, poachers. JOYCE: Last month, Snitch's team took four drones - made in the U. S. by a company called Falcon - to a South African wildlife reserve. The drones carry infrared and video cameras. They fly themselves. But Africa is big, and drones are dumb. That's where the math comes in. The team uses historical records of wildlife movements and poaching to write a computer program that educates the drones. SNITCH: And you can look at this and say: Where should we position our drones to fly at night to intercept these people before they get to the animals? And more importantly, where can you put the rangers between the rhinos and the poachers? JOYCE: And in the tests, a Falcon drone successfully tracked rhinos and something more. SNITCH: We put the drone up, and sure enough, right underneath us was a mother and a calf. They were about 75 meters from a fence line, and we saw a car pull up to the fence line and stopped. JOYCE: They reported the car to local rangers, though there was no indication they were poachers. Snitch and the wildlife trust's Kirsty Brebner say the trials went well, but they say the ultimate test will be political. If drones catch poachers, will governments prosecute them?

That's a very different world we're in. TEMPLE-RASTON: That may be what happened in this latest case involving a former NSA contractor named Edward Snowden. Here he is speaking to The Guardian newspaper. EDWARD SNOWDEN: When you're in positions of privileged access, like a systems administrator for these sort of intelligence community agencies, you're exposed to a lot more information on a broader scale than the average employee.

And the truth is, they've both gone through the floor. They're both in the gutter and for the same set of technological and cultural reasons. TEMPLE-RASTON: Culturally, we're sharing everything, where we're eating on FourSquare, who we're dating on Facebook. Technologically, all this sharing takes place on networks that aren't exactly secure and private citizens aren't the only ones using them.

They need IT guys and those people are becoming very powerful.

BRENNER: You know, we call this stuff top secret, but if a thousand people have access to it, it may be called top secret, but there's some important sense in which it's not so secret anymore. You know, Ben Franklin had it right when he said three can keep a secret if two of them are dead. TEMPLE-RASTON: U.

And that passion inspired an experimental talk show, where he adds two other things he loves: cars and comedians. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SERIES, \"COMEDIANS IN CARS GETTING COFFEE\")WERTHEIMER: The voices Sarah Silverman, Seth Meyers, Gad Elmaleh, Chris Rock, Don Rickles and David Letterman - they have all taken rides in the car to get a cup of coffee and chat with Jerry Seinfeld. They are the guests that will be featured in the new season of his Web series \"Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee. \"Jerry Seinfeld, welcome back to our program. : Thank you, Linda. It's a pleasure to be here. WERTHEIMER: Now, I gather that the premise of this Web show of yours is that you put together three things Jerry Seinfeld loves: cars, coffee and comedy. : Yes, but it's also the subtraction of a lot of things I hate. . . (LAUGHTER): . . . is another key to this formula. I'm sure you've been on talk shows on TV. WERTHEIMER: Mm-hmm. : I am a veteran. And as much as I loved it and frankly made my career in the '80s, it's gotten to the point now where I felt it needed some - and I love using words like this - and I'm on NPR, I feel completely comfortable saying - a diminution. It needed to be reduced. It needed to be deconstructed. And that's a big thing the show does, is it removes a lot of the things that I think restrict interesting conversation. WERTHEIMER: The program looks like it's very simple. I assume it's not as simple as it looks. : It's simple to shoot. And we do spend a lot of time reducing what is sometimes a two or three-hour experience down to what I feel is the juiciest 14 minutes of that. And I think editing is one of the great luxuries. I think it's one of the things life really needs. You know, if you bump into somebody at a cocktail party and you chat with them for 15 minutes, you can't say, you know, there was only five good minutes out of that. (LAUGHTER)WERTHEIMER: Yeah. : I wish I could get the other 10 back. (LAUGHTER): But on this show, we remove the 10 that didn't have much going on. WERTHEIMER: We saw the first episode of the new season, where Sarah Silverman is riding with you in a vintage Jaguar, which is a really beautiful car. : Yeah, it is. That was a nice one. WERTHEIMER: You compared her to the car. : Yeah, don't you think? Especially the way she was dressed that day, in those long bell-bottoms, those blue bell-bottoms. She looked exactly like the car. WERTHEIMER: Do you try to match the car to the guest? : Yeah. Like Sarah to me is kind of feline, very smooth and seductive in her maneuvers. So - and the Jaguar reminded me of her. WERTHEIMER: You know, when you do stand-up comedy, you react with the audience. And the audience, you know, comes back at you. But it's very different to be in this small metal space, elbow to elbow, knee to knee. I mean you're just - you can't get away from each other there. I would think that would give it a certain intensity. : It does. It does. And you know, she starts telling me about, that she had an issue with depression as a teenager. This is not something that you're chatting about in front of 400 people on \"The Tonight Show. \" 'Cause number one reason is unless you have a joke, you're not even going into it. WERTHEIMER: Right. : So we get to do that. And you know, it really led to something funny because I interrupted her to get Half & Half, instead of milk. . . (LAUGHTER): . . . 'cause I prefer Half & Half. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SERIES, \"COMEDIANS IN CARS GETTING COFFEE\")WERTHEIMER: Do you think we get a view of whatever the definition of - as what they're really like might possibly be? : Absolutely. I mean, look, I know these people and this is it. (LAUGHTER): This is what they're really like. I mean you walk out on a talk show, you know I'm on here for eight minutes, I want to make sure I tell a funny story or do an interesting anecdote. You're not just going to be sitting there tapping a coffee stirrer on the table and - you know. But you can do that on this show. So nobody feels that pressure to perform. And I do feel like I am capturing their true demeanor and energy. WERTHEIMER: Now, I have to say though that the thing that I thought was enormously appealing about this program is how much you appear to love doing it. And after all of those sort of years of kind of deadpan comedy that we're used to from you, there you are, you're just laughing your head off at things that people say to you. : I adore these people, all of them. They have been my life. It's like when I talk to people about being a comedian, well, there's being a comedian - which is you go on stage, you perform, and it's a profession. But then there's this other life, which is you spend all your time around these people. And that has given me this Technicolor existence. This show is very personal, 'cause if I like them, we'll have fun together. And if we have fun together, you'll have fun watching. WERTHEIMER: Jerry Seinfeld, thank you. : Thank you, Linda. It's a pleasure. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)WERTHEIMER: Jerry Seinfeld's Web series is called \"Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee. \" The second season goes online todayIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Linda Wertheimer. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:  And I'm Renee Montagne. LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST:   Jerry Seinfeld visited us a while back to talk about his love of coffee, a love he only developed in recent years. And that passion inspired an experimental talk show, where he adds two other things he loves: cars and comedians. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SERIES, \"COMEDIANS IN CARS GETTING COFFEE\") WERTHEIMER: The voices Sarah Silverman, Seth Meyers, Gad Elmaleh, Chris Rock, Don Rickles and David Letterman - they have all taken rides in the car to get a cup of coffee and chat with Jerry Seinfeld. They are the guests that will be featured in the new season of his Web series \"Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee. \" Jerry Seinfeld, welcome back to our program. : Thank you, Linda. It's a pleasure to be here. WERTHEIMER: Now, I gather that the premise of this Web show of yours is that you put together three things Jerry Seinfeld loves: cars, coffee and comedy. : Yes, but it's also the subtraction of a lot of things I hate. . . (LAUGHTER) : . . . is another key to this formula. I'm sure you've been on talk shows on TV. WERTHEIMER: Mm-hmm. : I am a veteran. And as much as I loved it and frankly made my career in the '80s, it's gotten to the point now where I felt it needed some - and I love using words like this - and I'm on NPR, I feel completely comfortable saying - a diminution. It needed to be reduced. It needed to be deconstructed. And that's a big thing the show does, is it removes a lot of the things that I think restrict interesting conversation. WERTHEIMER: The program looks like it's very simple. I assume it's not as simple as it looks. : It's simple to shoot. And we do spend a lot of time reducing what is sometimes a two or three-hour experience down to what I feel is the juiciest 14 minutes of that. And I think editing is one of the great luxuries. I think it's one of the things life really needs. You know, if you bump into somebody at a cocktail party and you chat with them for 15 minutes, you can't say, you know, there was only five good minutes out of that. (LAUGHTER) WERTHEIMER: Yeah. : I wish I could get the other 10 back. (LAUGHTER) : But on this show, we remove the 10 that didn't have much going on. WERTHEIMER: We saw the first episode of the new season, where Sarah Silverman is riding with you in a vintage Jaguar, which is a really beautiful car. : Yeah, it is. That was a nice one.

And just steps away from this building - right outside - is something that should be familiar to anyone who's ever received a postcard from Seattle; or taken home a pen or a glass, or anything - a tchotchke of any kind. And it's the Space Needle, built in connection with the 1962 World's Fair. It is an iconic part of the Seattle skyline. And joining me now to talk about the history of the Space Needle and its engineering, its design, is Knute Berger. He's author of the book \"Space Needle: The Spirit of Seattle. \" He's an editor-at-large for Seattle Magazine and regular contributor to KUOW, in Seattle. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. KNUTE BERGER: Thank you. Delighted to be here. FLATOW: I'm probably old enough remember when that was built in 1962 so. . . BERGER: Yeah, it was highly publicized. Its image got all over the world. FLATOW: And how - it has a unique design to it. Who designed it and why does it have the shape it has? BERGER: That's a really interesting question. There's - it's actually a complicated story. The chief architect was a man named John Graham Jr. , had a large architectural firm. He was mainly known as the man who invented the first really successful shopping mall, which was here in Seattle, Northgate. He had the task of creating the Space Needle. But he - they got stuck on the design. They had a doodle on a napkin. He had a bunch of architects who began looking at a tower-like structure. They were inspired by a tower, a broadcast tower in Germany, in Stuttgart, which had a restaurant on it. And so they knew they wanted an observation deck. But they were kind of open to what else they would do. They thought about putting a planetarium up there and a helicopter pad. FLATOW: No kidding. BERGER: Yeah. They considered all kinds of things. And - but they were stuck on coming up with a design that was really a wow design. So John Graham hired as a consultant a professor from the University of Washington named Victor Steinbrueck. He's known locally in Seattle as architect-activist who saved the Pike Place Market. But he was a designer, and he worked on the Space Needle design. He got stuck. And one day, he was sitting in his home office and he saw - he had a beautiful abstract sculpture by a California artist named David Lemon, and it was feminine figure in complete abstract, reaching up to the sky with this narrow waist and then this tripod legs. And it was called \"The Feminine One. \" And he went, aha, OK, there is a unique shape for a tower. FLATOW: Wow. If you have a question you want to ask Knute, get up there on our microphones and you can ask it. Where there any engineering innovations that were required to get this to be built? Anything about the revolving restaurant, anything like that? BERGER: Well, it was interesting because at that time, there were no revolving restaurants. FLATOW: Oh, well. BERGER: There had to be an innovation. Yeah, John Graham was actually building a revolving bar in Honolulu, and they thought, well, let's since they had - Graham wanted a flying saucer shape. And, of course, Washington state had kicked off the whole flying saucer craze with the sighting at Mt. Rainier in 1947 that the press had called flying saucer. But it became this kind of iconic idea of what the future would look like. Well, because it was this circular shape, a revolving restaurant made sense. Graham patented a gearing system that allowed you to turn the entire restaurant of 250 people with a one-horsepower motor. FLATOW: Wow. BERGER: And that was built up in Everett, Washington, just north of Seattle. FLATOW: With a size that drives a washing machine. It's very small. BERGER: Yes, exactly. FLATOW: Very small motor. BERGER: Exactly. They have - the motor in there now is a little bigger, but it only takes one horsepower to turn it. FLATOW: Wow. We actually - on our website at sciencefriday. com/spaceneedle, we have some photos of it, the under construction, if you want to go over there and look at that. I understand there was something also innovative about having to design telephone, the telephone system network that was there. BERGER: Yeah. They wanted to be able to have telephones on the tables in the rotating restaurant. FLATOW: Kind of like they do in big city restaurants. BERGER: Exactly. FLATOW: Have a phone at your table. BERGER: Precisely, and except they couldn't plug the phones in. So they needed wireless phones. FLATOW: They couldn't plug them in because it's rotating. BERGER: That's right. FLATOW: I see. BERGER: Yeah. And it goes around about once an hour. So what they did was they went to Pacific Northwest Bell and had the engineers there create a wireless telephone. So the Space Needle actually had wireless phones in 1962. You could sit down. You could make a call. There was a radio pickup in the wall, and they would connect you then to the operator so you could call out. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. I was - I took a visit to the Space Needle yesterday. And I'm - being a geek myself, I was really enthralled with the technology and just this - the pure nuts and bolts that are holding it together. I remember walking out and seeing this giant nut and - screw and nut holding it - it's bolted to the ground. Of course, being a geek, I wanted to know the size of the wrench it took to do that. (LAUGHTER)FLATOW: But that seemed to be very, very simple, and it seems to be holding up very, very well. BERGER: Yeah, they hired an engineer from Southern California, a guy named John Minasian. And Minasian was an expert in towers, and he built rocket gantries for Cape Canaveral for the Saturn rockets. He also built missile testing gantries for the Air Force at Edwards Air Force Base and broadcast towers. And he contributed pretty significantly to the Needle design in terms of - for one thing, being from Southern California, he'd studied with Richter at Caltech. He said you're going to - we're going to put in a foundation that will stand the test of time. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And it has been and, you know, you're in a very tectonic part of the world. There are a lot of earthquakes that happen here. I imagine that was taken into account in the design. BERGER: Yeah. They did wind tunnel test at the University of Washington, and they basically doubled the load so that it was twice the required code at the time. I talked to an engineer who worked on the project says it could - it'll stay standing with a nine point, you know, quake. FLATOW: Wow. Well, and was it designed with the Cold War in mind? We were right in the middle of the coldest past of the Cold War at that time. BERGER: The whole World's Fair was part of the national response to Sputnik. It received federal funding because the scientists in the U. S. wanted a science fair. And the Eisenhower administration thought that was a good idea. FLATOW: There had just been won in Belgium, right, a few years beforehand? BERGER: That's right. 1958. FLATOW: And had a big - if I remember correctly - had like a big atom as its symbol. And so the scientists wanted something that compete with that. BERGER: That's right. And the U. S. scientists had been very disappointed in the '58 Brussels fair because they felt the Russians had outshone us in terms of science. And they said we need to do something. And the Seattle guys came along and said, we want to do a fair. You want a science fair. That's what this will be about. The Space Needle was designed to be a symbol of the kind of uplift that science and technology represented to the world. When they broke ground on the Space Needle, it was literally the same time that the Berlin Wall was being built. And it became this kind of symbol about the difference between us and the Soviets. They were putting up barbwire. We were putting up a vista to the world. FLATOW: Talking with Knute Berger on SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. I'm Ira Flatow here at - in Seattle at the Pacific Science Center right next to the Space Needle. If it were to be built today, would anything be built differently about it, structurally or design-wise or is it almost a perfect needle? BERGER: You know, I asked the engineer who's still alive who worked on it. I asked him that exact question. I said what would you today? And he said, basically, we wouldn't anything different. He said we could take some of the weight out of it. They overbuilt it. He. . . FLATOW: Yeah. It's solid. BERGER: It's very solid. FLATOW: Very solid. BERGER: Although it's one of the first questions people ask when they see is is it going to fall over? FLATOW: Is that right? BERGER: Yeah. People - I think it's because of the wasp waist and then the way it flares out with this platform on top. People have the sense that it's delicate, which is a great design element. FLATOW: Were things added during the years or was it the same thing that we've. . . BERGER: Things have been added during the years. There is what's called the SkyLine level, which is a public event space built at the 100-foot level. They've also built a building kind of around the base that has the gift shop. Otherwise, it's pretty much intact. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And it was built with the science fair in mind as part of a larger ground. Part - it would fit into the larger works of the whole world's fair here. BERGER: That's right. It was actually late coming in the fair. They realized in the process, they needed a symbol for the fair, and they didn't have one. They didn't have a means of financing it. They didn't have a location for it. The Space Needle is where it is because the city managed to find a small piece of property that they could sell to a private developer to build the Space Needle. And it happened to be the perfect spot. FLATOW: You talked about the structure itself having a very feminine shape to it. But anybody who has looked at this thing swears that it looks like a UFO at the top there landing or taking off. BERGER: Yeah. Well. . . FLATOW: Is it done on purpose? BERGER: Yes, it was. In fact, John Graham - when the guys would come to him with designs - one of his - one of the things he constantly was exhorting them is he'd sat about the top \u2014 he'd say more disc-y, more disc-y. It needs to be more disc-y. He really wanted that flying saucer shape and some - if you look at some of the rejected designs, you'll see that some look like bagels and some look like, you know, Buck Rogers things. I mean, it just. . . FLATOW: So why did he want it? Was it just the era that was happening in? I remember the '50s were filled with sightings of flying saucers, things like that. BERGER: It was the - the theme of the fair was the space age, so we were going into space. Who had the best technology in space? It was the aliens who were visiting the Earth. (LAUGHTER)BERGER: It was the UFO. It represented these advanced civilizations that were doing what we aspire to. So it just became a kind of symbol for that. But it also had that connection with Mount Rainier. And one of the great views of the Space Needle is on a day when the clouds are there and you can see it literally just kind of hovering above the crowds and you can't see the base. FLATOW: Yeah, yeah. BERGER: That's like one of those fabulous views. FLATOW: It was a fabulous view yesterday, and I appreciate it and it took me that many years to get up there and see it. I'm glad I did. Thank you very much, Knute, for joining us today. BERGER: Thank you.

FLATOW: Yeah, yeah. BERGER: That's like one of those fabulous views. FLATOW: It was a fabulous view yesterday, and I appreciate it and it took me that many years to get up there and see it.

Top U. S. officials briefed House and Senate members on the secret surveillance operations that were disclosed recently by NSA contractor Edward Snowden. U.

NPR's Tom Gjelten reports on how the information revolution has transformed intelligence work. TOM GJELTEN, BYLINE: There was a time when America's enemies conspired face-to-face, or communicated through couriers or by leaving messages for each other somewhere. But in the digital age, that has changed. FBI Director Robert Mueller made that point back in 2008, as Congress considered whether to amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DIRECTOR ROBERT MUELLER: In this day and age, our ability to gain intelligence on the plans, the plots of those who wish to attack us is dependent upon us obtaining information relating to cellphones, Internet, email, wire transfers - all of these areas. GJELTEN: If all the action was in that electronic space five years ago, it's even more so today, as intelligence and security officials constantly point out. Speaking in February, the NSA's general counsel, Rajesh De, threw out some figures on the explosive growth in communication data. RAJESH DE: More data crosses the Internet every second today than existed on the Internet 20 years ago. Global mobile traffic grew 70 percent last year alone. GJELTEN: Officials say these trends highlight the challenge facing spy agencies. With so much communication now taking place in the digital world, intelligence officers have to be able to follow that communication. James Bamford, the author of several books on the NSA, says spies used to focus on getting human sources inside an organization, agents who could report on what people in the organization were saying and doing. But human sources no longer matter so much, Bamford says. Intelligence officers use new approaches because their adversaries are interacting in new ways. JAMES BAMFORD: During the day, they're on cell phones or they're on email, or they're on social networking sites. By intercepting that information, you develop patterns and look at who these people might be involved with. GJELTEN: To justify the NSA's collection of telephone records and its selective monitoring of online communication overseas, U. S. officials cite these revolutionary changes in the information space. John Negroponte was the director of national intelligence when wiretapping programs were expanded during the Bush administration. He defends the NSA's new emphasis. JOHN NEGROPONTE: I'd say it's a testament to how surveillance methods have kept up with the geometric progression of these communication methods. GJELTEN: Congressional critics of the expanded surveillance operations say they're not convinced these programs have really proved their value in fighting terrorism. They ask whether other types of intelligence gathering might be just as effective. John Negroponte, who served as U. S. ambassador to Iraq, says no one method is sufficient. He recalls how in 2006, the combination of different intelligence sources led the U. S. military to the head of al-Qaida in Iraq, Abu Musab al Zarqawi. NEGROPONTE: I believe his phone number was detected through human intelligence. Somebody gave us his phone number. Then that phone number was monitored through signals intelligence. And then his movements were tracked by geospatial intelligence - drones and so forth. So it's actually the integration of these different methodologies that actually give you the best results. GJELTEN: The expanded use of telephone and Internet surveillance is, in part, an adaptation to the information revolution. The NSA, the CIA and other agencies will defend these programs vigorously on that basis, despite concerns that Americans' privacy has been put at risk. But that's not the whole story.

I'm Jacki Lyden. Coming up, the posthumous release of a book by the man known as the deadliest sniper in U. S. history, who was killed earlier this year at a shooting range. But first, small drones are coming to U. S. airspace. Drone manufacturers, police departments, farmers and many businesses are eager to begin using unmanned aerial vehicles here. And as NPR's Steve Henn reports, government officials from the FAA to state legislators are struggling with the implications. STEVE HENN, BYLINE: The FAA says by the end of this year, it's likely to issue a new proposed rule that would allow small commercial drones - 55 pounds or less - to fly in U. S. airspace. These little drones probably won't be allowed to fly near airports or above 400 feet, but that doesn't mean they won't have some powerful capabilities. Chris Dixon is at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. CHRIS DIXON: Yeah, drones in general - commercial drones are basically a data business for the most part. HENN: Picture fleets of little drones collecting information about anything you can imagine. Dixon's firm just invested millions in a company that makes software to allow small drones to fly autonomously for hours. The system also makes it possible to plug in all different kinds of sensors to these tiny planes - from cameras to heat sensors to devices that sniff the air for chemicals. DIXON: For example, there are large, you know, power lines and gas lines and oil lines and things that go across remote and dangerous areas of the world. HENN: But it's not just oil companies or the cops that want to use drones. Small lightweight unmanned aerial vehicles have caught the eye of journalists, filmmakers and even environmentalists. NICK: Probably one of the things I'm most proud of is that I'm working on this film about river restoration. HENN: Nick, who asked us not to use his last name, isn't waiting for new rules to allow commercial drones. Instead, he's flying and filming illegally. His logic? If he can fly over it in a regular plane, it's fair game. NICK: There are some legitimate concerns with these because you can be a lot lower to the ground than you can with a conventional aircraft. So, you know, would I want somebody creeping around my house or around my windows with one? No. HENN: If the FAA tracked Nick down, they could put him out of business, but he thinks concerns about drone-based snooping are overblown. He says creeping up on someone with the drones he uses would be like trying to sneak up on them with a leaf blower. NICK: It's got lights. It's noisy. There's nothing sneaky about it. HENN: It seems likely that national drone regulations will leave room for filmmakers like Nick. But states might not. A bill waiting for the governor's signature in Texas bans drones outright, but then it carves out 19 separate exceptions, including some for the police, but nothing for the press. MARGOT KAMINSKI: The interesting thing about this bill is that it doesn't explicitly seem to consider the First Amendment at all. HENN: Margot Kaminski is a lecturer at the Yale Law School who often writes about legal policy questions raised by drones. She says the Texas bill creates a patchwork. KAMINSKI: Texas realtors, for example, are permitted to use unmanned aerial vehicles to take photos, and Texas oilmen can use them to check on rigs, but there doesn't seem to be any exception for photojournalism. STATE REPRESENTATIVE GENE WU: This has created what I call a zebra law. HENN: Gene Wu is a legislator in Texas representing Southwest Houston. WU: You go from one spot, it's legal. You move over just a little bit, it becomes illegal. And then you move over a little bit again, it becomes legal. It'll be extremely confusing to law enforcement and to the average citizen. HENN: The bill's sponsors say if property owners give a drone pilot permission to film or fly, it's all good. Still, using drones to monitor wildlife will probably be banned. Scientific research might be allowed or it might not. An unmanned traffic copter, banned. Already, there's a community of amateur photographers and filmmakers in Texas who are using drones legally and have had an impact. KAMINSKI: There was a man who flew his drone taking photographs over a Dallas meatpacking plant and photographed a river of blood coming out of the back of the meatpacking plant. HENN: What do you mean river of blood? KAMINSKI: Like an actual river of pig blood. You can see the meatpacking plant itself and then this blood-red creek that then flows down to a major Texas river. HENN: The drone pilot shared that photo with state and federal authorities. That led to an investigation, fines and eventually a cleanup. But the proposed bill in Texas would make the drone pilot here the criminal. And Texas isn't the only state considering legislation to rein in how drones can be used. More than 30 states have passed or are considering their own prohibitions on drones. HENN: Steve Henn, NPR News, Silicon Valley.

It used to be the social media juggernaut, the place where teens especially made personalized Web pages. Then Facebook took over and more of teens' online social lives moved to phones. Now, the conversations are spread across many social networks. For our monthly look at media for young people, NPR's Sami Yenigun talked with a group of suburban teens to find out how they use all these different platforms. SAMI YENIGUN, BYLINE: Eighteen-year-old Jamal Royster's phone is packed with apps, all the usual suspects. JAMAL ROYSTER: I got some Twitter, some Snapchat, some Vine, Instagram and Facebook. YENIGUN: This cozy living room in suburban Maryland has about a dozen teens sitting on couches and the carpeted floor. They've come to tell me how they talk to friends, to friends of friends, to Facebook friends. ROYSTER: Long lost friends, you usually hit them up on Facebook, like messages. I've gotten messages like that. And I caught up with my friends, like I'm catching up with my friend Paul right now. YENIGUN: But 17-year-old Jelani Williamson says he doesn't use it much anymore. JELANI WILLIAMSON: I used to be on Facebook daily until my aunt friend requested me. (LAUGHTER)YENIGUN: But there are a couple things Facebook is still good for, practical things like messaging, coordinating on school projects when you don't want to hand out your phone number, and inviting friends to parties. Well, parties at someone else's house, Williamson says. WILLIAMSON: Oftentimes, like, parties that are all over social media get, like, busted by the cops really easily. YENIGUN: OK. So how do you invite friends over without inviting the 5-0? Eighteen-year-old Darien Carr used to use the messaging app Kik when he had an iPod touch. Kik is just like texting, but over the Internet. No cellphone service required. But then Carr got an iPhone and Kik sort of dropped off. DARIEN CARR: Not a lot of people had it and it was just more practical to text people than to use Kik. YENIGUN: For quick one-on-one conversations, texting rules. But for personal expression, teens like Royster take to Twitter. ROYSTER: People be in their feelings on Twitter. They vent. YENIGUN: It's a place for opinions, Williamson says. WILLIAMSON: Usually, I tweet, like, what's on my mind, like, oh, like, Beyonce looks amazing in this video. YENIGUN: But Twitter's focus is text. When these kids want a more visual way to share themselves, they do what Grace Plihal does. GRACE PLIHAL: I'm a self-proclaimed Instagram addict. I Instagram everything. Like, it's kind of like my way of showing my life to the world, I guess. So, yeah, I use it a lot. YENIGUN: Plihal's world - her friends, her surroundings - are sent through grainy filters to her 600-something Instagram followers. She says she takes a lot of selfies, pictures of herself hanging out in New York, chilling in the subway, spending time with her siblings, et cetera. Jelani Williamson says it's how you let your friends know you're keeping it real. WILLIAMSON: Instagram is used to, like, verify your life because, like, at school and things like that, you can just say that you do things that you don't. And people do that a lot. But if you Instagram it, it's like, yes, I didn't make this up. YENIGUN: But not everyone feels comfortable posting pictures of themselves online, and for those camera-shy sharers, there's Tumblr, says Caroline Lamb. CAROLINE LAMB: It's showing your life without showing your face. So, like Instagram, you show your life and yourself and your life. But on Tumblr you, like, put quotes and pictures of other people doing funny stuff. YENIGUN: It's well understood in this group of kids that once a picture makes its way onto a site like Tumblr, it'll likely never fully disappear from the Web. So what if you want to share a picture, but you don't want it to hang around? Royster says Snapchat. ROYSTER: The reason for Snapchat, like, whoever thought of that, like, I'm worried about what they were thinking about. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Yeah. (LAUGHTER)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Oh, yeah. ROYSTER: Pictures that just disappear after 10 seconds, like, yeah. YENIGUN: Makes sense that selfies get a little racy when they only live for a little while. Snapchat, like Instagram, is for still photos. And one of the newer platforms, Vine, is for short films. Really short, seven seconds. Seventeen-year-old Jesse Anebonem says Vine videos tend to be well thought out short movies. His favorite this week. . . JESSE ANEBONEM: The \"Waka Flocka Elmo\" Vine. (LAUGHTER)(SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO, \"WAKA FLOCKA ELMO\")YENIGUN: That's a seven-second loop of \"Sesame Street's\" favorite red furball getting down to the sounds of \"Waka Flocka Flame. \" But this video wasn't just on Vine. When you upload, Vine lets you post to Facebook and Twitter at the same time. All of these networks are connected. In fact, Anebonem says he watches Vines without even having the Vine app. ANEBONEM: For some reason, my phone won't let me download Vine. I don't know why. But if I see it on Twitter, I'll, like, favorite it and then show somebody because it's funny. YENIGUN: One person in this room, 15-year-old Carmen Hamlet, has been really quiet this whole time. CARMEN HAMLET: I don't have a phone. (LAUGHTER)YENIGUN: So when Hamlet wants to hang in this vibrant cyber world of jokes, jams and social scrapbooking, she has to borrow a phone or she could always go back to a computer.

They've come to tell me how they talk to friends, to friends of friends, to Facebook friends. ROYSTER: Long lost friends, you usually hit them up on Facebook, like messages. I've gotten messages like that. And I caught up with my friends, like I'm catching up with my friend Paul right now. YENIGUN: But 17-year-old Jelani Williamson says he doesn't use it much anymore. JELANI WILLIAMSON: I used to be on Facebook daily until my aunt friend requested me. (LAUGHTER) YENIGUN: But there are a couple things Facebook is still good for, practical things like messaging, coordinating on school projects when you don't want to hand out your phone number, and inviting friends to parties. Well, parties at someone else's house, Williamson says. WILLIAMSON: Oftentimes, like, parties that are all over social media get, like, busted by the cops really easily. YENIGUN: OK. So how do you invite friends over without inviting the 5-0? Eighteen-year-old Darien Carr used to use the messaging app Kik when he had an iPod touch. Kik is just like texting, but over the Internet. No cellphone service required. But then Carr got an iPhone and Kik sort of dropped off. DARIEN CARR: Not a lot of people had it and it was just more practical to text people than to use Kik. YENIGUN: For quick one-on-one conversations, texting rules. But for personal expression, teens like Royster take to Twitter. ROYSTER: People be in their feelings on Twitter. They vent. YENIGUN: It's a place for opinions, Williamson says. WILLIAMSON: Usually, I tweet, like, what's on my mind, like, oh, like, Beyonce looks amazing in this video. YENIGUN: But Twitter's focus is text. When these kids want a more visual way to share themselves, they do what Grace Plihal does. GRACE PLIHAL: I'm a self-proclaimed Instagram addict. I Instagram everything. Like, it's kind of like my way of showing my life to the world, I guess. So, yeah, I use it a lot. YENIGUN: Plihal's world - her friends, her surroundings - are sent through grainy filters to her 600-something Instagram followers. She says she takes a lot of selfies, pictures of herself hanging out in New York, chilling in the subway, spending time with her siblings, et cetera. Jelani Williamson says it's how you let your friends know you're keeping it real. WILLIAMSON: Instagram is used to, like, verify your life because, like, at school and things like that, you can just say that you do things that you don't. And people do that a lot. But if you Instagram it, it's like, yes, I didn't make this up. YENIGUN: But not everyone feels comfortable posting pictures of themselves online, and for those camera-shy sharers, there's Tumblr, says Caroline Lamb. CAROLINE LAMB: It's showing your life without showing your face. So, like Instagram, you show your life and yourself and your life. But on Tumblr you, like, put quotes and pictures of other people doing funny stuff. YENIGUN: It's well understood in this group of kids that once a picture makes its way onto a site like Tumblr, it'll likely never fully disappear from the Web. So what if you want to share a picture, but you don't want it to hang around? Royster says Snapchat. ROYSTER: The reason for Snapchat, like, whoever thought of that, like, I'm worried about what they were thinking about. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Yeah. (LAUGHTER) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Oh, yeah. ROYSTER: Pictures that just disappear after 10 seconds, like, yeah. YENIGUN: Makes sense that selfies get a little racy when they only live for a little while. Snapchat, like Instagram, is for still photos. And one of the newer platforms, Vine, is for short films. Really short, seven seconds. Seventeen-year-old Jesse Anebonem says Vine videos tend to be well thought out short movies. His favorite this week. . . JESSE ANEBONEM: The \"Waka Flocka Elmo\" Vine. (LAUGHTER) (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO, \"WAKA FLOCKA ELMO\") YENIGUN: That's a seven-second loop of \"Sesame Street's\" favorite red furball getting down to the sounds of \"Waka Flocka Flame. \" But this video wasn't just on Vine. When you upload, Vine lets you post to Facebook and Twitter at the same time. All of these networks are connected. In fact, Anebonem says he watches Vines without even having the Vine app. ANEBONEM: For some reason, my phone won't let me download Vine. I don't know why. But if I see it on Twitter, I'll, like, favorite it and then show somebody because it's funny. YENIGUN: One person in this room, 15-year-old Carmen Hamlet, has been really quiet this whole time. CARMEN HAMLET: I don't have a phone. (LAUGHTER) YENIGUN: So when Hamlet wants to hang in this vibrant cyber world of jokes, jams and social scrapbooking, she has to borrow a phone or she could always go back to a computer.

I'm Melissa Block. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: I'm Robert Siegel, and it's time now for All Tech Considered. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SIEGEL: Here's a thought for those of you listening to us now on your iPod or your smartphone or an Internet radio. Cost, distance and a lack of infrastructure mean that most people on Earth, more than 4. 5 billion people, are not connected to the Internet. And this week, people at Google X, the company's research lab, said that they hope to address that problem with balloons, a network of high-altitude helium balloons offering Internet access. NPR's Steve Henn is joining us now. Hi, Steve. STEVE HENN, BYLINE: Hi. SIEGEL: Google is famous for April Fools' jokes. Is this just one that happens to happen in June? (LAUGHTER)HENN: No. No, they're actually serious about this, although they did call the project Loon, which is short for balloon, but I think also sort of a head nod to the fact that it sounds a bit odd. SIEGEL: How many balloons? How high up? How long would they stay there? HENN: Well, it's very early days. So they just finished a test of this in New Zealand. And the balloons will fly at about 20 kilometers, which is the stratosphere, and that's about twice as high as an airplane flies. And the first test was with a couple dozen balloons. But ultimately, for the system to work, I mean, you'd need quite a few balloons. The balloons only cover an area of about 40 square kilometers right now on the ground. SIEGEL: So we're talking about hundreds or thousands of balloons, each of which could put in about how many months' service? HENN: They hope that each balloon could stay afloat for 100 days or more right now. SIEGEL: So Google is thinking of going into the balloon launching business. (LAUGHTER)HENN: Yes, apparently so. Right? SIEGEL: How big are the balloons? HENN: The balloons are about 15 meters across. That's roughly 50 feet and about 12 meters high. They each have a solar panel floating below them, which powers the radio connectivity that sends a signal to the ground and also to other balloons. So these balloons connect to each other and then back to an ISP on the ground. SIEGEL: Connect, by signal you mean. They're not physically connected to each other. HENN: No. SIEGEL: And they're obviously not tethered up there or planes would constantly be dragging balloons with them. (LAUGHTER)SIEGEL: What will control where they are, their locations, for people who would use them for Internet connectivity? HENN: Well, ultimately, they're controlled by changing their altitude in the sky. So there - NOAA has a map of stratospheric winds. And these winds blow in slightly different directions and at different speeds. So by adjusting the balloon's position in the air column, Google can predict where an individual balloon will go and try to make sure that it stays within range of its network and is covering the area on the ground that they want to serve with an Internet connection. SIEGEL: That standard that they try to keep it within range of its network suggests this may not be the most reliable Internet signal you'll get if you're using this system. HENN: Right. And in the test in New Zealand this week, they described it as somewhat less than constant connectivity. (LAUGHTER)SIEGEL: Less than constant, not a great ad campaign. HENN: Well, it's early. (LAUGHTER)SIEGEL: Is the assumption here that this is cheaper than just launching satellites and having more connectivity down there? HENN: Yeah, that's the idea, that it would actually be cheaper to launch a network of balloons that was dense enough to be in constant contact with each other, rotating around the entire planet, than it would be to launch a satellite. And right now, satellite Internet connectivity is tremendously expensive and slow. SIEGEL: So an idea or it's a go? HENN: It's an idea, but they're taking it seriously. They've made it public. And I think we'll be talking about this in the future. (LAUGHTER)SIEGEL: OK. Thanks, Steve. HENN: My pleasure. SIEGEL: That's NPR technology correspondent Steve Henn.

I'm Steve Inskeep. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  And I'm David Greene. The U. S. auto industry is doing more with less. A lot less. There are fewer car assembly plants in the United States. There are also hundreds of thousands fewer workers than there were before the recession. But productivity is the highest it's ever been. And profits are high too. NPR's Sonari Glinton looks at why that won't translate into more jobs. SONARI GLINTON, BYLINE: You know how when take an embarrassing fall people rush up to you and ask are you all right, even after you're back on your feet. Well, that's how it's been with the car business. KRISTEN DZICZEK: People ask a lot, is the auto industry back? It depends on what scale you want to look at. GLINTON: That's Kristen Dziczek. She's the research director at the Center for Automotive Research. So if we're looking at scales, let's start with productivity. In this case, how many work hours it takes to build a car. DZICZEK: Productivity in our automotive plants in the U. S. is 39 percent higher than it was in the year 2000. Productivity has never been this high. GLINTON: And while sales aren't as high as they once were, vehicle prices are up so profitability is up. General Motors, Ford and Chrysler have all been making money and they've been rewarding their workers with profit sharing checks. And all the companies, foreign and domestic, are investing billions of dollars in North American facilities. You'd think this would translate into a hiring frenzy, right? Well Dziczek says, not so much. DZICZEK: In employment we're still down a lot. The peak before the crash was over a million. And we're at about 670,000, 660,000 employees in motor vehicle and parts manufacturing in the U. S. So employment's still got a long way to go. GLINTON: Here's the thing, the car companies are adding workers, but the addition of those workers is sort of slow and steady. A few thousand here, a few hundred there. The plants in the U. S. and North America are running at full steam. Every single plant that makes cars on this continent is at or near capacity in terms of number of shifts or hours worked. And car plants that used to, say, have one assembly line, now have two - with the same amount of space and workers. Michael Robinet is an analyst with IHS Automotive. MICHAEL ROBINET: There's no doubt that the industry is stressed right now. It's stressed at the vehicle assembly facility. It's stressed where they make engines and transmissions. And it's definitely stressed within the supply community. GLINTON: Plants have added second and third shifts. And they're less likely to shut down or even go on their formally traditional summer breaks. Robinet says the car companies, both foreign and domestic, have learned the lessons of the economic crash well - almost too well. ROBINET: The days of 2008 and 2009 still linger in our industry, and therefore everybody is being very, very careful about adding capacity, whether in the form of brick and mortar or in the form of new employees, and only adding them when it's absolutely necessary or they see a road in the future where it's going to be fully utilized. GLINTON: Robinet says the car companies are not ready to expand the number of plants in the U. S. unless they're absolutely sure they'll be needed for a long, long time. Meanwhile, companies like Volkswagen are building plants in Mexico. New plants in places such as Michigan or even Mississippi just don't seem to be on the horizon. Robinet says, though, the car business has sort of hit its sweet spot. ROBINET: The industry is back. It's in a happy place. The world is now looking for more vehicles built in North America, and certainly exports are going to be on the rise. That's a great ending comment, by the way. That one's a keeper.

One effect of the revelations about NSA surveillance has been to bring the unfamiliar word metadata into the spotlight. Our linguist Geoff Nunberg explains what metadata is, how it's related to the big data revolution, and whether it makes any difference - or, as he puts it, does meta matter? GEOFF NUNBERG, BYLINE: This is just metadata; there's no content involved - that was how Sen. Dianne Feinstein defended the NSA's blanket surveillance of Americans' phone records and Internet activity. Before those revelations, not many people had heard of metadata, the term librarians and programmers use for the data that describes a particular document or record it's linked to. It's the data you find on a card in a library catalog, or the creation date and size of a file in a folder window. It's the penciled note on the back of a snapshot: Kathleen and Ashley, Lake Charles, 1963. Or it could be the times, numbers and GPS locations attached to the calls in a phone log. Metadata was bound to break out sooner or later, riding the wave of data in all its forms and combinations. Big data and data mining are the reigning tech buzzwords these days, and university faculties are scrambling to meet the surge in demand for courses in the hot, new field of data science. It's as if data is usurping information as a byword. Up to now, data has played a supporting role in the information age. There's a popular definition of data as the raw material that becomes information when it's processed and made meaningful. That puts information at the center of the modern tech world, but it isn't how anybody actually uses the two words. I have this image of somebody working on a spreadsheet as a manager leans over and says, is it information yet? But the shift in focus from information to data reflects a genuine difference between the two. Information brings to mind the knowledge that's gathered in libraries, encyclopedias and journals - stuff that has an independent existence in the world. Data is always connected to particular things and events. It comes from experiments and sensors and official records; or from the scuff marks we leave behind as we click on websites, make calls, go through the E-Z Pass toll booths, visit an ATM. It's all out there, accumulating in ginormabytes, overflowing the server farms. When you're focused on information in that stand-alone sense, metadata plays a subordinate role. In the old days, it was just a tool for getting to the stuff you were really interested in. Think how much metadata you had to wade through, to find a passage about drunkenness in Tocqueville's \"Democracy in America\" - looking up the book in the library card catalog, writing down its call number, finding it on the shelves, searching for drunkenness in the index, then finally turning it to the page. Now that that kind of information is online, the metadata can seem almost irrelevant. No need for catalogs or indexes - you just enter a query and when the book comes up, you barrel in sideways. That's probably why Google was so careless about metadata when they digitized major library collections for Google Books. Literally, millions of books are misdated or misclassified. It's not odd to run into a web browser manual dated 1939 that lists Sigmund Freud as its author; or a copy of \"Madame Bovary\" attributed to Henry James, and filed under antiques and collectibles. The faulty metadata prompted some grumbles from academics, and Google's been working on fixing it. But it doesn't bother most of the people who use Google Books. They get at its information in other ways. But metadata gets a lot more respect in other corners of the Google campus, not to mention from its competitors up and down U. S. 101. Their focus is not information in the abstract, but on collecting specific data about their users. And for that, they need to get the metadata right - who's visited this page; how long did they stay; where did they go next; who did they email, call or text - all so that advertisers can ensure that the seersucker jacket I clicked on yesterday will stalk me to the end of my days. That's the same kind of metadata the NSA has been trawling. Its defenders maintain that we have to be willing to trade some privacy for some security and right now, we're all arguing about where to put the boundaries. But some advocates of the surveillance have also tried to soft-pedal its intrusiveness. You hear people pronouncing metadata as a soothing incantation, as if your right to privacy ends as soon as you lick and seal the envelope. Sifting through the metadata, the president said, involves just modest encroachments on privacy. James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, compared the programs to combing through a library with millions of volumes and sorting them by their Dewey decimal numbers, without actually opening and reading the books. But if you're going to compare this to rummaging around in an old-fashioned library, it's more like opening the back covers of all the books, to see whose names are on the borrowers' cards. Whether or not you think the government should be sweeping this stuff up, calling it metadata doesn't make the process any less intrusive. Tell me where you've been and who you've been talking to; and I'll tell you about your politics, your health, your sexual orientation, your finances. So maybe we should just let the word sink back into the nerdy cubicles it came from. When it comes to privacy, the meta doesn't matter. In the post-information age, it's just data all the way down.

The faulty metadata prompted some grumbles from academics, and Google's been working on fixing it. But it doesn't bother most of the people who use Google Books. They get at its information in other ways. But metadata gets a lot more respect in other corners of the Google campus, not to mention from its competitors up and down U. S. 101. Their focus is not information in the abstract, but on collecting specific data about their users. And for that, they need to get the metadata right - who's visited this page; how long did they stay; where did they go next; who did they email, call or text - all so that advertisers can ensure that the seersucker jacket I clicked on yesterday will stalk me to the end of my days. That's the same kind of metadata the NSA has been trawling. Its defenders maintain that we have to be willing to trade some privacy for some security and right now, we're all arguing about where to put the boundaries. But some advocates of the surveillance have also tried to soft-pedal its intrusiveness. You hear people pronouncing metadata as a soothing incantation, as if your right to privacy ends as soon as you lick and seal the envelope. Sifting through the metadata, the president said, involves just modest encroachments on privacy. James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, compared the programs to combing through a library with millions of volumes and sorting them by their Dewey decimal numbers, without actually opening and reading the books. But if you're going to compare this to rummaging around in an old-fashioned library, it's more like opening the back covers of all the books, to see whose names are on the borrowers' cards. Whether or not you think the government should be sweeping this stuff up, calling it metadata doesn't make the process any less intrusive. Tell me where you've been and who you've been talking to; and I'll tell you about your politics, your health, your sexual orientation, your finances. So maybe we should just let the word sink back into the nerdy cubicles it came from. When it comes to privacy, the meta doesn't matter. In the post-information age, it's just data all the way down.

President Obama acknowledged China's feat in his State of the Union address a few months later and said we were facing a Sputnik moment. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: And now it's our turn. We know what it takes to compete for the jobs and industries of our time. We need to out-innovate, out-educate and out-build the rest of the world. (APPLAUSE)FLATOW: Now more than two years later, what are we doing? How have we gone? Well, not so much. This week, the latest survey of supercomputers finds China again is on top with its Milky Way 2. That's a machine that's not just slightly better than America's best machine but about twice as fast as our runner-up. How did we get here? We lost our competitive lead in innovation some time ago. Are we set to lose the race in supercomputing? And you think, well, it's just a computer. What does this say about the state of science and innovation in the U. S. in general? Countries like China and Japan are betting big time on science and technology with investments to match. Can we meet the challenge? That's what we're going to be talking about with our guests. Horst Simon is editor for the Top500, also deputy lab director at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab in Berkeley.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow; this is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)FLATOW: This is SCIENCE FRIDAY; I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking about China's new supercomputer, the fastest in the world, what it means for American computing power, innovation. Do we have anything that works to rival it? And why do we care? Why do we care that we don't have the fastest computer in the world? We're not the leader in innovation in the world anymore. Well, we'll talk about those issues. My guests are Horst Simon, editor for the Top500. He's also deputy lab director at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab in Berkeley, California. Rick Stevens, associate lab director for computing, environment and life science research at Argonne National Lab, that's just outside of Chicago. He's also professor of computer science at the University of Chicago. Welcome, gentlemen, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. HORST SIMON: Good morning. RICK STEVENS: Good morning Ira. FLATOW: What is - good morning. Tell me what is so important about having the fastest computer. SIMON: I think it's a symbolic value. It has, of course, some real practical applications, but it is indeed a race, and a lot of countries are in the race because it shows on a certain object scale intellectual prowess and where a country is at. But beyond that I think beyond this symbolic value there is some real technological know-how that is required to get there. And so therefore the Chinese accomplishment of being number one again, the second time, is really significant. And I think right now the second time that (unintelligible), Milky Way 2, is on the number one spot is even more significant than the first time around because the Chinese have demonstrated not only that they are in this race for the long term, but they have in the new system added a number of technologies that are domestically homegrown technologies that show us that they have made significant progress to be in that race. FLATOW: They are using Intel processors, correct? SIMON: That is correct. They're using Intel processors and also the Intel accelerators, the (unintelligible) technology. But what is important to notice is that the software system is all homegrown. They have their own Linux-type operating system, Kylin Linux, they have developed program languages, implemented them on the system. Tools, they've built their own interconnect technology. They've built their own front-end processors. So it's just like except the computational engine, this is a genuine Chinese system. And the reason everybody's concerned about this is that the next step will be to replace the Intel processors with something that maybe in two or three years is also domestically in China produced. So that's why this is a big step forward. FLATOW: Rick, you work at Argonne National Labs, where the supercomputer Mira lives. That's number five on the most recent list. STEVENS: It's number five right now. It debuted at number three and then moved down the list. What's interesting. . . FLATOW: Were you surprised - let me just ask you, were you surprised that the Chinese took the lead on this? STEVENS: No I wasn't surprised because we had been watching them quite carefully over the last five or six years. And they were not at all secretive about their intent to build this class of machine. FLATOW: And you have to invest money to do this, do you not? STEVENS: Yeah, they're investing quite a lot. This machine is - we don't know the number exactly, but we estimate it's about twice as expensive as the machines that we've deployed so far. FLATOW: What kind of money do you talk about here in building a machine like this? STEVENS: It's probably on the order of about 300 million. FLATOW: And the biggest U. S. machines are how many hundreds of million? STEVENS: Less than 200. FLATOW: So they set out to invest in becoming number one, then, in this, and putting money into it? STEVENS: That's right. The technology that this Chinese machine is based on is current technology, and in between the first generation Milky Way machine and the second generation, of course the United States and Japan also took the lead for a short time. The U. S. recently deployed two machines in the two five and based on the same technology. So what this really represents, in addition to what Horst said, their interest in producing domestic capability, they're also willing to spend more than we are on a single machine. FLATOW: Don't you expect, though, that there are secret supercomputers being used by our government that are much faster than we know about? You know, just take the surveillance of all the phone and data traffic by the NSA. Don't you think that takes a massive amount of computing power that somewhere there are computers that no one's talking about? SIMON: Yes, I really think there is more computer power out there than is on the Top500 list. The Top500 list really reflects what's publicly known, what the sites, the vendors acknowledge. And we can take our previous guest here on the show, like Google, for example. Google certainly has huge compute power that's not represented on the list. What's different, though, is that the applications of all the computers on the Top500 list are for large-scale scientific modeling and simulation and also in an industrial sense, modeling and simulation. And these types of supercomputers have very different characteristics that set them often apart from what is used in, say, Internet computing or data processing. So it's a different race. FLATOW: So here you're talking about specialized computers that could be really big. SIMON: Yes, so a key ingredient for these computers is what I've glanced over very briefly, this interconnect. And this technology makes it possible for - in the (unintelligible) case, more than 300 million cores to actually cooperate and work on computing tasks. That's a very difficult project process, and that requires not just great technology but also requires applications and software that can use that parallelism. FLATOW: Rick, you testified on Capitol Hill a few weeks ago, to the House Science Committee, about what it would take to get the next generation of supercomputing exascale. Were they receptive? Did they say, well, we'll give you the money for that? STEVENS: They didn't say they would give us the money, but they were quite receptive to the challenge. But in the U. S. , this is a long-term activity to invest in the basic R&D to work cooperatively with many agencies, with many computer vendors, to keep pushing the technology forward. You can't just get there by buying machines. We're going to have to dramatically improve power consumption, dramatically improve the performance of memory systems and so forth to do this. And so what I was talking about on the - to the House Science Committee was a strategy for doing that. FLATOW: But it also takes money and a commitment. SIMON: It will take - definitely take a commitment, eight to 10 years, and a large investment of money. If I. . . FLATOW: Go ahead, Horst. SIMON: So Rick and I have worked on exascale since 2006, and what seven years later is somewhat frustrating is the slow pace in which this has progressed. Everybody seems to be very supportive and understands the strategic importance of high-performance computing and of getting to the exascale in terms of its impact on science, in terms of national security and in terms of economic competitiveness. Yet we seem to have currently just in general a very slow going when it comes to large-scale science projects in the U. S. FLATOW: Yeah, we've seen a lot of that going on in other places. Let's talk about this word exascale. Give us the progression of how - what you mean by exascale. STEVENS: Well, exascale is 10 to the 18th operations per second or 10 to the 18th bytes. The systems we have today are measured in petaOPS or petabytes. They're about 10 to 20, or the Chinese machine is about 30 petaFLOPS. Over the last 40 years or so, we've been able to increase the speed of the top supercomputers about a factor of 1,000 every 10 years. So we used to have machines that were measured in gigaFLOPS, a billion operations per second, and then teraFLOPS and then petaFLOPS, and now we're targeting exaFLOPS. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to the phones. Bill(ph) in Arcadia, California. Hi Bill. BILL: Actually, that's Arcata, at the other end of the state. FLATOW: Oh, I'm sorry. BILL: I was interested to hear a discussion of the national security implications. It seemed quite a few moments into the show before I heard it mentioned. But we're in an interesting age now where cyber warfare is actually being manifested in, and, you know, it represents a threat throughout our national infrastructure. And we're in a time when a massive battleship could easily be crippled by a properly written and inserted type of code. So this may most importantly be a national security issue. FLATOW: Horst, would you agree? SIMON: Yes, although most of the supercomputers that we're talking about are used for national security applications in a different setting. For example, they are used for modeling and simulation of a nuclear stockpile, understanding new materials or fatigue in old materials, this type of application. But I agree with the caller that supercomputers in general have this national security application. And the important thing is to keep in mind that the supercomputers that are on the Top500 list that Rick and I are talking about in a sense the vanguard of computers. This is where new technology is tested out, where new technology is proven in a demanding environment with innovative and aggressive uses, such as the scientists are. And so once the technology survives this it can migrate out and be useful to many other applications. So, losing that leading edge is, I think, the concern I would have in terms of national security applications. FLATOW: You mean just developing the technology, using it as sort of an experimental database to make a supercomputer? STEVENS: Well, you can think of it this way, Ira, these top supercomputers are like time machines. They give us access to a capability that won't be broadly available for five to 10 years. So whoever has the time machine is able to do experiments, able to see into the future deeper and more clearly than those that don't have such machines. FLATOW: I never heard it quite put that way. It's very nicely put. But people are concerned about cyber warfare and supercomputers possibly being involved in those. Is that a reason itself to develop supercomputers? STEVENS: Well, in cybersecurity, often, the use of the computer is very specific, and while you can program general purpose machines, such as the ones we're talking about, to be both offensive engines in some sense or defensive engines, that's probably not the most efficient way to engage in cyber warfare. You would more likely use specialized devices. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. We'll see if we can get a phone call or two in here. Let's go to Bill in Wayne, Pennsylvania. Hi, Bill. BILL: Hi. How are you doing? Can you hear me OK? FLATOW: Yeah. BILL: So my question is really: Should we be focused on putting more and more chips and memory and an O. S. together to build a bigger and faster computer or looking at things like nanoscale or quantum computers which might give us more bang for the buck further into the future? And you can always put more and better and faster chips together. But isn't it really - it's the efficiency in how you look to the future? I mean, if you go back 50 years ago and you look at what they're doing with, you know, the ENIAC and systems like that compared to where we are now, I mean there's not that much of a difference. We're still, you know, the hardware isn't that much of a difference. We should probably put our money into more advanced techniques at the fabrication level to get, you know, a 1,000 or a more quantum increase in processing power than just be throwing more chips at a box. FLATOW: All right. Let me get an answer. Thanks for the call. Horst? SIMON: Yeah. Well, I think we should do both. The caller is right that we do need to invest into the technologies that are sometimes called Beyond CMOS. Indeed, we are today still running with a computer architecture that is the heritage from past Second World War to (unintelligible) architecture. So scaling this can be probably pushed through for a couple more generations of computer systems but ultimately, yes, we do need to invest into new technology, such as quantum computing or any alternate technologies. But we can not stop supporting the current high-end computing because any of these new technologies are at least a decade away from reaching a production and usable level. So we need to continue with the scaling up to the exascale that Rick and I have discussed. FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. In the few minutes left, you talked about what this says to the world about American innovation and the state of innovation. Can you talk a little bit more about the importance of that? STEVENS: Well, certainly, a very visible sign of a nation's intent to participate in leading-edge science and technology development, even though right now China is number one on the list, the United States has vastly more machines on the list. So you can argue that we're not falling behind in our sort of global commitment, but it's a very accurate barometer of our intent to invest to stay at that leading edge. Many, many disciplines require high-performance computing to make progress, whether it's from designing new materials to designing better drugs, understanding fundamental science or designing better security for our soldiers need high-performance computing. And so it's a ubiquitous technology. FLATOW: And do you think that our people, our government, whoever would be responsible for helping fund or make sure that technology - who's ahead, do they understand this problem? STEVENS: I think they do understand. I was just in Washington earlier this week, again, in the House side, and there was very general support. I think the challenge is simply a matter of budget priority. Trading off investments in high-performance computing or advanced computing technology with other lower-priority items, and that priority discussion really needs to take place. FLATOW: Well, why not run it through the Pentagon? They seem to get a lot of money that even they're not asking for. I mean if you want to get a high-tech project say you need it for, you know, for the military. STEVENS: Well, historically, DARPA has invested in this area. I think in the last five or six years or so DARPA has changed to be more focused on the war fighter directly and less on the broader infrastructure. So I think a national program is needed that combines the assets of DOE and Department of Defense and the National Science Foundation and other agencies to do this because everybody is in it together. FLATOW: You do hold out hope that that's what's going to happen. STEVENS: I think it's going to have to happen that way. We need to get a consensus in Washington to do this because it's so critical. FLATOW: Horst, any last comments about where you see this happening. SIMON: Well, I'm less optimistic unfortunately than Rick because I put my money in a bet against exascale happening before 2020. And the reason why I say this is because I've observed the slow pace of progress that we have made in the last three or four years since 2010. So I'm afraid that we are on a path to losing out, and this is not just in high-performance computing getting towards exascale, but across a wide range of science. Just as Rick said, generally, the support is there, the understanding is there, the goodwill is there. But we live in a very budget-constrained world in the U. S. right now, whereas some of our friends in terms of science, but competitors when it comes to technology, are investing much more heavily. FLATOW: Like China. SIMON: Like China. FLATOW: OK. You've got the last word, Horst. I want to thank you very much both of you. Horst Simon is editor for the Top500. He's also deputy lab director at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab in Berkeley.

Thank you, gentlemen, for taking time to be with us. STEVENS: Thank you. FLATOW: You're welcome. SIMON: Thank you. FLATOW: We're going to take a short break, and we'll talk about - we're going to talk about food, food in the supermarket and maybe why it should have a date timestamp for you. It's a really interesting topic. We'll be right back after the break. Stay with us. I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.

So we used to have machines that were measured in gigaFLOPS, a billion operations per second, and then teraFLOPS and then petaFLOPS, and now we're targeting exaFLOPS. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to the phones. Bill(ph) in Arcadia, California. Hi Bill. BILL: Actually, that's Arcata, at the other end of the state. FLATOW: Oh, I'm sorry.

So whoever has the time machine is able to do experiments, able to see into the future deeper and more clearly than those that don't have such machines. FLATOW: I never heard it quite put that way. It's very nicely put. But people are concerned about cyber warfare and supercomputers possibly being involved in those. Is that a reason itself to develop supercomputers? STEVENS: Well, in cybersecurity, often, the use of the computer is very specific, and while you can program general purpose machines, such as the ones we're talking about, to be both offensive engines in some sense or defensive engines, that's probably not the most efficient way to engage in cyber warfare. You would more likely use specialized devices. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. We'll see if we can get a phone call or two in here. Let's go to Bill in Wayne, Pennsylvania. Hi, Bill. BILL: Hi. How are you doing? Can you hear me OK? FLATOW: Yeah. BILL: So my question is really: Should we be focused on putting more and more chips and memory and an O. S. together to build a bigger and faster computer or looking at things like nanoscale or quantum computers which might give us more bang for the buck further into the future? And you can always put more and better and faster chips together. But isn't it really - it's the efficiency in how you look to the future? I mean, if you go back 50 years ago and you look at what they're doing with, you know, the ENIAC and systems like that compared to where we are now, I mean there's not that much of a difference. We're still, you know, the hardware isn't that much of a difference. We should probably put our money into more advanced techniques at the fabrication level to get, you know, a 1,000 or a more quantum increase in processing power than just be throwing more chips at a box. FLATOW: All right. Let me get an answer. Thanks for the call. Horst? SIMON: Yeah. Well, I think we should do both. The caller is right that we do need to invest into the technologies that are sometimes called Beyond CMOS. Indeed, we are today still running with a computer architecture that is the heritage from past Second World War to (unintelligible) architecture. So scaling this can be probably pushed through for a couple more generations of computer systems but ultimately, yes, we do need to invest into new technology, such as quantum computing or any alternate technologies. But we can not stop supporting the current high-end computing because any of these new technologies are at least a decade away from reaching a production and usable level. So we need to continue with the scaling up to the exascale that Rick and I have discussed. FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. In the few minutes left, you talked about what this says to the world about American innovation and the state of innovation. Can you talk a little bit more about the importance of that? STEVENS: Well, certainly, a very visible sign of a nation's intent to participate in leading-edge science and technology development, even though right now China is number one on the list, the United States has vastly more machines on the list. So you can argue that we're not falling behind in our sort of global commitment, but it's a very accurate barometer of our intent to invest to stay at that leading edge. Many, many disciplines require high-performance computing to make progress, whether it's from designing new materials to designing better drugs, understanding fundamental science or designing better security for our soldiers need high-performance computing. And so it's a ubiquitous technology. FLATOW: And do you think that our people, our government, whoever would be responsible for helping fund or make sure that technology - who's ahead, do they understand this problem? STEVENS: I think they do understand. I was just in Washington earlier this week, again, in the House side, and there was very general support. I think the challenge is simply a matter of budget priority. Trading off investments in high-performance computing or advanced computing technology with other lower-priority items, and that priority discussion really needs to take place. FLATOW: Well, why not run it through the Pentagon? They seem to get a lot of money that even they're not asking for. I mean if you want to get a high-tech project say you need it for, you know, for the military. STEVENS: Well, historically, DARPA has invested in this area. I think in the last five or six years or so DARPA has changed to be more focused on the war fighter directly and less on the broader infrastructure. So I think a national program is needed that combines the assets of DOE and Department of Defense and the National Science Foundation and other agencies to do this because everybody is in it together. FLATOW: You do hold out hope that that's what's going to happen. STEVENS: I think it's going to have to happen that way. We need to get a consensus in Washington to do this because it's so critical. FLATOW: Horst, any last comments about where you see this happening. SIMON: Well, I'm less optimistic unfortunately than Rick because I put my money in a bet against exascale happening before 2020. And the reason why I say this is because I've observed the slow pace of progress that we have made in the last three or four years since 2010. So I'm afraid that we are on a path to losing out, and this is not just in high-performance computing getting towards exascale, but across a wide range of science. Just as Rick said, generally, the support is there, the understanding is there, the goodwill is there. But we live in a very budget-constrained world in the U. S. right now, whereas some of our friends in terms of science, but competitors when it comes to technology, are investing much more heavily. FLATOW: Like China. SIMON: Like China. FLATOW: OK. You've got the last word, Horst. I want to thank you very much both of you. Horst Simon is editor for the Top500. He's also deputy lab director at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab in Berkeley. Rick Stevens, associate lab director for Computing, Environment and Life Science Research at Argonne National Lab in - that's outside of Chicago, also professor of Computer Science at the University of Chicago. Thank you, gentlemen, for taking time to be with us. STEVENS: Thank you. FLATOW: You're welcome. SIMON: Thank you. FLATOW: We're going to take a short break, and we'll talk about - we're going to talk about food, food in the supermarket and maybe why it should have a date timestamp for you. It's a really interesting topic. We'll be right back after the break. Stay with us. I'm Ira Flatow.

If you have a smartphone, you might take the Internet for granted, right? It's always there. But around the world, some four and a half billion people still are not connected. Google, being in the Internet business, has a plan to expand its reach, bring Internet to all these people, but it's not by spooling out fiber-optic cable or building cell towers. It's using a technology that, well, sort of sounds like it belongs in another century: free-floating balloons. They call it Project Loon. They've already launched a pilot system in New Zealand and plan to expand that to the entire 40th parallel south, a ring around the globe. Can it work? How loony is this idea? How do you ensure coverage with a network of thousands of balloons floating through the stratosphere? How do you control these things? Mike Cassidy is the leader of Project Loon, based at Google X, that's Google's secret lab in Mountain View, California. He joins us by phone. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Cassidy. MIKE CASSIDY: Thanks so much. FLATOW: Balloons, whose idea was it to have balloons? CASSIDY: Well, I mean, Larry Page has talked about using balloons for Internet for a while. It's an older technology, as you pointed out. Chinese used them quite a while ago to signal from high up. So it's been around for - the idea's been around for a while, actually. FLATOW: Tell me about the pilot program that's running now in New Zealand? How many balloons have you launched? How does it work? CASSIDY: We launched about 30 balloons down in New Zealand, and they're about 20 kilometers up, twice as high as commercial airplanes fly, and they can bring 3G signal from that height all the way down to the ground. FLATOW: 3G signal from how many feet, 30,000? CASSIDY: Twenty kilometers up, more like 70,000, 70,000 feet, yeah. FLATOW: Seventy thousand, and you can get 3G signals down there. Wow. CASSIDY: Yep. FLATOW: And it's working? CASSIDY: Yeah, it works great. FLATOW: Are you expanding the program at all in a larger test? CASSIDY: So, the one thing about balloons is they tend to move sort of west to east. So once we put balloons up there, they will float in a ring around the world, and they're - some of the balloons are right now on their way to Chile and Argentina. The goal of the project, once we roll it out further, is to have a continuous ring around the world at 40 degrees south latitude, and anyone under those - the path of the balloons would be able to use the trial service. FLATOW: So it's like if I go up in a hot air balloon, I sort of - I go where the air current go. Is that the same thing here? CASSIDY: And that's one of the cool things about the project. We can steer the balloons by increasing or decreasing the altitude of the balloon and finding a wind that's going the direction we want. So if we see we want to go a little bit further north, we perhaps drop down a half a kilometer, find a wind going that direction and then stop at that altitude, and that's the way we steer the balloons. FLATOW: And how long can they stay up? CASSIDY: We're hoping the balloons will stay up for 100 days. This design has lasted 58 days previously. So we need to make a few improvements to get to that 100-day duration. FLATOW: Now we talked to Terry Hock, who is a senior engineer at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, and he has a lot of experience launching these sort of balloons. And he said, and let me quote him: \"It's very feasible to launch them and have them navigate the globe. In terms of trying to control them, steering the balloon by changing altitude is incredibly difficult to do. I wouldn't have a whole lot of faith in that part of it. \" Would you say that there are significant challenges in that? CASSIDY: There's definitely challenges. It requires a pretty sophisticated computational algorithm to say, OK, balloon number one is now moving 10 miles an hour east over a certain spot; balloon number two, in order to take its place, it's moving slightly southeast. Balloon number three, which is going to take that one's place, is at 14 miles an hour moving a slightly different direction. But that's one of the things that Google has experience with, building a sort of large simulation, large computational ability and be able to program these thousands of balloons to go to right place at the right time. FLATOW: And where is that right place? CASSIDY: Well, for the pilot test, for example, if we want to have a continuous ring, we don't actually have them uniformly distributed around the globe. For example we don't need the same density over the middle of the Pacific Ocean as we do over Christ Church itself. But by steering them and planning, you can have them appear in the right density in the sky over the places that need coverage. FLATOW: And where - would those - those are under-covered places around the world. Where are the prime places for that? CASSIDY: There's lots of places. In the Southern Hemisphere alone, two-thirds of the countries, the cost of Internet access is higher than the average monthly income for people in those countries. Even in China and India, there's over a billion people that don't have good Internet coverage. So I think there's lots of places around the world where there's sort of remote and rural areas that don't have coverage, or it's unaffordable. FLATOW: So would you have to keep relaunching new balloons as these go down just to keep that ring going? CASSIDY: Yes, every 100 days you'd have to put up another balloon to take the place of the one that came down. FLATOW: Now at those altitudes, aren't we talking about extremely cold temperatures, like minus-70 below Fahrenheit up there? CASSIDY: It's a tough environment. In the daytime it's typically minus-40 Celsius, and at night it's minus-60 Celsius. It's also very low atmospheric density, only about 2 or 3 percent of the density of the air up there that it is down here. So it's closer to a space environment. It's also a high-ultraviolet environment. The sun beats down really hard on our balloons. So it is a tough environment to live in. FLATOW: Why is this better than just putting a satellite up and doing it that way? CASSIDY: So we don't think our solution or anyone's solution is the only solution. We think there are different approaches. One of the interesting things about our approach is we can continuously update our service every 100 days. With communications satellites, and I actually, I'm an aerospace engineer, I used to build communications satellites, it often takes quite a while, a number of years, to build the satellites. It can be quite expensive, hundreds of millions of dollars. And it's also on the order of a hundred million dollars to put the satellite up. And then the satellites sometimes will have a life of 10 years or so, and that's great except that also means the technology was - it's not easy to get the latest technology up into the satellite. FLATOW: So you can - by launching a new balloon every 100 days, you can upgrade the hardware, too, by doing that. CASSIDY: That's right. You get the latest state-of-the-art technology every 100 days. FLATOW: And what is - give us an idea of the costs involved here. What does a balloon and its package cost to get up there? CASSIDY: So this is very early in the stage of the sort of pilot test. We're building these things by hand now. But the exciting thing is the envelope for the balloon is made out of polyethylene, plastic, so it's not a very exotic plastic, and the electronical components are mostly off the shelf, I mean, an off-the-shelf-type battery, an electronics GPS module. So we're hopeful that by using low-cost parts, off-the-shelf-type technology, we can make the system low cost and therefore very affordable for people when we roll out the service. FLATOW: And when would that be rolled out? CASSIDY: Well again, it's sort of early days. We've just launched last Saturday this sort of small pilot test. So it's really hard to predict how long it will take to expand, yet alone to other areas in New Zealand and other areas around the 40th degree latitude let alone sort of moving to other areas. But we hope soon. FLATOW: And 40 degree latitude, would that be like where New Zealand is in the southern Pacific and head out there? CASSIDY: That's right, that's right, and that was one of the reasons we thought it would be a good place to do our pilot test because it was an easy number of countries to do the test in, four countries: New Zealand, Australia, Chile and Argentina would be sort of flown over by the balloons. So it made it a more manageable size. FLATOW: And I guess you write off the balloon when it comes down, right? No one's going to retrieve it. It might come down in the ocean. CASSIDY: No, we plan to retrieve - we hope to retrieve all the balloons. We have a very high retention and recovery rate right now. We can control where the balloons come down. So as they become near the end of their life, we open up a little valve at the top and bring the balloon down to a recovery area. We had a boat off the coast of New Zealand for some of the test balloons. When we were done with the test, we brought them down in the ocean and recovered them. But yes, we plan to recover almost all the balloons if we can. FLATOW: And how many total number of balloons do you envision in the ring at any one time? CASSIDY: For a ring around the 40th degree south latitude, we think it'll take about 300 balloons, spacing them out, depending on whether the coverage density is required. And obviously to expand beyond that ring of 40 degrees south latitude will take, you know, thousands of balloons to go more than that. FLATOW: Sounds exciting. We wish you luck, Mike. CASSIDY: Thanks so much for having us on today. FLATOW: You're welcome. Mike Cassidy, leader of Project Loon. That's based at Google X. He was joining us by phone to talk about that.

Among other things, the bill will allow companies to import a lot more skilled workers. The tech industry has lobbied hard for this, despite concerns that it will mean extra competition for American workers. To that fear, Illinois Senator Dick Durbin insists the bill has American workers covered. SENATOR DICK DURBIN: Employers will be given a chance to hire a temporary foreign worker when truly needed. But first, they'll be required to recruit Americans. No exceptions, no excuses. MONTAGNE: Still, as NPR's Martin Kaste reports, making companies recruit Americans isn't the same as making them hire them. MARTIN KASTE, BYLINE: If you talk to disgruntled tech workers much, sooner or later they're going to send you this video. (SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO)LAWRENCE LEBOWITZ: And our goal is, clearly, not to find a qualified and interested U. S. worker. KASTE: That's an immigration lawyer from Pittsburgh in what looks like a seminar for clients, a few years ago. In this video, he's telling clients what to do when they want to sponsor one of their foreign workers for a permanent visa - a green card. The problem is the government: it makes them prove that they looked for American workers first. So they have to advertise the job, but he tells them they don't have to advertise it too conspicuously. (SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO)LEBOWITZ: Certainly, we are not going to try to find the place where the applicants are going to be the most numerous. We're going to find a place where again, we're complying with the law and hoping - and likely - not to find qualified and interested worker applicants. KASTE: Immigration law firms do this all the time - they show employers how to recruit Americans without actually having to hire them. This lawyer didn't want to talk to NPR, maybe because the anti-visa activists have been sending this video around for years. It's Exhibit A in their argument that the recruiting rules are a sham. And in techy parts of the country, this kind of faux recruiting is common knowledge. ORION HUGHES: A lot of us are aware of that ruse. KASTE: A software tester named Orion Hughes is sitting in a coffee shop in Redmond, Washington. He says people in his industry quickly learn not to waste their time on certain job listings - especially the listings with overly specific requirements - say, X number of years in, quote, the job offered. That often means that they just want to make permanent a temporary foreign worker who's already in the job. And if you're stubborn enough to apply anyway, he says, that interview is going to be awkward. HUGHES: If you want to put yourself in that manager's shoes, it's an uncomfortable situation for them. There will be kind of a sour facial expression, and they'll go from one question to the next. They are finding some reason to exclude you. KASTE: Employers usually go through these motions only when they're sponsoring a foreigner for a permanent visa. But now the Senate immigration bill would extend somewhat similar requirements to temp workers - the foreigners on the so-called H-1B visas that have become so common and so controversial in the lower-end tech jobs. The bill would have the employers post those jobs online first, and there'd be more recruiting rules for companies that use H-1Bs a lot. It sounds good - but it's a move that seems to ignore all the ill will that's been generated over the years by the insincere recruiting. BRUCE MORRISON: No one is ever hired. KASTE: Bruce Morrison is a former congressman who helped to design the current work visa system; now he's an immigration lawyer and a lobbyist. He says the recruiting rule in the green card system came with a fundamental flaw. MORRISON: Which is, it doesn't start until you've already picked the person you want. The decision whether to hire an American already happened - and you didn't. KASTE: He's one of many experts who've given up on these recruiting rules. He says the better fix would be for the government just to charge employers a heftier fee. MORRISON: Create the economic circumstance where it costs you a lot more to hire a foreigner, and you'll only do it if you can't find an American who's suitable. KASTE: The Senate bill takes some small steps in this direction, but Morrison thinks it's not nearly enough. The bill actually removes this recruiting rule for some of the permanent visas - and he's happy about that. He's been lobbying for a while to get more green cards into the hands of skilled workers. But now it looks like the recruit-Americans-first idea is being shifted to the temporary visas - the H-1Bs. And that means the tech industry will still be plagued by insincere job listings and bogus interviews, and the undercurrent of resentment that those create. Martin Kaste, NPR News, Seattle. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:  Immigration reform looks like it will be passed in the Senate, likely by the end of the week. Among other things, the bill will allow companies to import a lot more skilled workers. The tech industry has lobbied hard for this, despite concerns that it will mean extra competition for American workers. To that fear, Illinois Senator Dick Durbin insists the bill has American workers covered. SENATOR DICK DURBIN: Employers will be given a chance to hire a temporary foreign worker when truly needed. But first, they'll be required to recruit Americans. No exceptions, no excuses. MONTAGNE: Still, as NPR's Martin Kaste reports, making companies recruit Americans isn't the same as making them hire them. MARTIN KASTE, BYLINE: If you talk to disgruntled tech workers much, sooner or later they're going to send you this video. (SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO) LAWRENCE LEBOWITZ: And our goal is, clearly, not to find a qualified and interested U. S. worker. KASTE: That's an immigration lawyer from Pittsburgh in what looks like a seminar for clients, a few years ago. In this video, he's telling clients what to do when they want to sponsor one of their foreign workers for a permanent visa - a green card. The problem is the government: it makes them prove that they looked for American workers first. So they have to advertise the job, but he tells them they don't have to advertise it too conspicuously. (SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO) LEBOWITZ: Certainly, we are not going to try to find the place where the applicants are going to be the most numerous. We're going to find a place where again, we're complying with the law and hoping - and likely - not to find qualified and interested worker applicants. KASTE: Immigration law firms do this all the time - they show employers how to recruit Americans without actually having to hire them. This lawyer didn't want to talk to NPR, maybe because the anti-visa activists have been sending this video around for years. It's Exhibit A in their argument that the recruiting rules are a sham. And in techy parts of the country, this kind of faux recruiting is common knowledge. ORION HUGHES: A lot of us are aware of that ruse. KASTE: A software tester named Orion Hughes is sitting in a coffee shop in Redmond, Washington. He says people in his industry quickly learn not to waste their time on certain job listings - especially the listings with overly specific requirements - say, X number of years in, quote, the job offered. That often means that they just want to make permanent a temporary foreign worker who's already in the job. And if you're stubborn enough to apply anyway, he says, that interview is going to be awkward. HUGHES: If you want to put yourself in that manager's shoes, it's an uncomfortable situation for them. There will be kind of a sour facial expression, and they'll go from one question to the next. They are finding some reason to exclude you. KASTE: Employers usually go through these motions only when they're sponsoring a foreigner for a permanent visa. But now the Senate immigration bill would extend somewhat similar requirements to temp workers - the foreigners on the so-called H-1B visas that have become so common and so controversial in the lower-end tech jobs. The bill would have the employers post those jobs online first, and there'd be more recruiting rules for companies that use H-1Bs a lot. It sounds good - but it's a move that seems to ignore all the ill will that's been generated over the years by the insincere recruiting. BRUCE MORRISON: No one is ever hired. KASTE: Bruce Morrison is a former congressman who helped to design the current work visa system; now he's an immigration lawyer and a lobbyist. He says the recruiting rule in the green card system came with a fundamental flaw. MORRISON: Which is, it doesn't start until you've already picked the person you want. The decision whether to hire an American already happened - and you didn't. KASTE: He's one of many experts who've given up on these recruiting rules. He says the better fix would be for the government just to charge employers a heftier fee. MORRISON: Create the economic circumstance where it costs you a lot more to hire a foreigner, and you'll only do it if you can't find an American who's suitable. KASTE: The Senate bill takes some small steps in this direction, but Morrison thinks it's not nearly enough. The bill actually removes this recruiting rule for some of the permanent visas - and he's happy about that. He's been lobbying for a while to get more green cards into the hands of skilled workers.

You've probably seen that the site is unbelievably popular among college students. You can find them posting updates on the bus, chatting in the library, tagging photos while they walk. But even though nearly every student has Facebook, there's a new study that says different groups use the site in many different ways. And according to the study, at least, that can have surprising implications for student success in college and even beyond. Those are the recent findings of a study by Rey Junco. He's an associate professor at Purdue University. He's also a faculty associate at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University. We often talk to him about trends in social media, and he's with us now. Rey Junco, thanks so much for joining us once again. REY JUNCO: It's always great to be here, Michel. Thank you. MARTIN: What exactly were you trying to find out with this study? What were you curious about? JUNCO: The research on digital inequality suggests that people from different backgrounds use the Internet in different ways, and so I wanted to see if that applied to Facebook. So I looked at the gender, race and ethnicity, and I also looked at socioeconomic status. And each of those groups spent, you know, equal amounts of time on Facebook, but women were more likely to post and tag photos, view photos, comment on content and post status updates. African-Americans were less likely to check up on friends. And those from lower socioeconomic statuses were less likely to engage in a wide variety of activities, including sending private messages, viewing videos, posting videos, tagging videos, chatting, tagging photos and creating or RSVPing to events? MARTIN: OK, so let's say African-American males are more likely to play games on Facebook, and white women, white girl students, are more likely to write private messages. Why would that have implications for their academic success? JUNCO: What women are doing, they are communicating and connecting more than men. That can be seen not only as a direct predictor of something like, like student academic success, but it's also a social information-seeking behavior, and that is incredibly important for student success. Students need to feel like they have both an academic and a social connection to the institution in order to be successful. We know that those are major predictors of whether a student will stay in college or not. MARTIN: But how do we know that they're checking up on each other for academic reasons or just finding out where they're going to hang out on the weekend? Why would that have anything to do with academic success? I think a lot of parents might hear this and think, you know, I'm glad my son is not spending so much time socializing online. He should be studying. JUNCO: Right, and to that person I would say that the social aspects of college are just as important as the academic aspects of college, because students need to know how to interact in society, as well as interact with their textbooks and do well on quizzes. MARTIN: According to what data? Who says? I mean, 'cause we all know kids who spend a lot of times in, a lot of time in the library seem to do pretty well. JUNCO: There's clearly research to show that students need to create a connection on campus within their first three to six weeks. And if they don't do that, they're at a very high risk of dropping out. And so there is a good deal of literature on retention that focuses on these two concepts, the concepts of academic and social integration and how important those both are to student success. MARTIN: Can you draw conclusions, though, that suggest that the way these students are engaging with social media has something to do with their success, or is it other factors? Is this a causation or is this a correlation? Is it just something that this kind of behavior just happens to be associated with kids who might have a tougher road a hoe in college anyway because, perhaps, their parents didn't go to college, or they don't come from - maybe they're the only person in their family who's ever gone to college? JUNCO: The study is certainly correlational. But you touch on a very important point, and that is, for any kind of behavior or outcome, there are so many things that go into that behavior. So there's so many predictors of that behavior. What I'm talking about is, perhaps, a very small slice of the pie, but the results were significant enough to, you know, certainly talk about and publish. MARTIN: The other thing that's interesting to me is that you noted that these kids are all in college. The same kinds of social segregation that so many people have seen on college campuses, you know, like the white kids sitting with the white kids, the swimmers sitting with the swimmers - I think people have this impression that a lot of that stuff goes away in the social media world. Are you finding that really the world of social media just kind of replicates the physical world in the way people interact? JUNCO: Yes, and I think that's exactly what this study says. If you're looking at it at the 35,000-foot level, what I'm basically saying, and what I found here, is that the power dynamics that we see in education, generally, are replicated online. So these digital inequalities that we see very early on in education, with students from lower socioeconomic statuses and areas being encouraged to use computers differently than their higher socioeconomic status peers, is clearly replicated here on Facebook, as well. MARTIN: Are there other implications that you feel comfortable drawing for students, for parents, for educators who are listening to this and might be thinking about how to engage with students on Facebook, or students who are hearing this thinking about how they use Facebook when they head off to college in the fall? Can you offer some guides for bridging this? JUNCO: One important key idea is to stop thinking that all students are great with technology and use it in the same ways. If you make those assumptions, then you behave in ways towards your students that might actually reinforce those inequalities. So for instance, if I think that all my students know how to do a certain thing on Facebook or do a certain thing with an e-mail attachment, and a student says, well, I can't do that, you might scoff at them or be irritated. And that's really not where we should be going with that. I think if we're doing anything with technology in a classroom that we have to make sure that all of our students are on the same page. And so part of including technology in a classroom is making sure to educate students about how you're going to use that technology in the classroom and perhaps even the mores and cultures of the specific technology tool like Facebook, for instance. MARTIN: So for example, if you're organizing a study group, or if the students are organizing a study group. . . JUNCO: Right. MARTIN: . . . don't assume that if you post that information on Facebook, all students are going to get it. JUNCO: That's a really great example, because students from lower socioeconomic statuses are less likely to RSVP to an event. So if that's the case, then they're less likely to attend that kind of study group, putting them at, you know, a double disadvantage there. MARTIN: Rey Junco is a name you often hear on this program. He's an associate professor at Purdue University. He's also a faculty associate at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University, and he was with us from member station WLRN in Miami.

A few pioneering scientists are taking the idea of reducing carbon dioxide in a different direction. They're thinking about ways to remove what's already in the atmosphere, and possibly turn a profit in the process. NPR's Richard Harris caught up with one of the scientists who's exploring this new approach. RICHARD HARRIS, BYLINE: Lots of researchers are trying to tackle climate change by inventing better batteries, better solar cells, better windmills and more efficient vehicles. Peter Eisenberger has been looking at the problem from another perspective. He's not trying to invent anything. He's trying to take advantage of the vast wealth of knowledge that we already have at our fingertips. PETER EISENBERGER: If you looked at knowledge as a commodity, we have generated this enormous amount of knowledge, and we hadn't even begun to think of the many ways we could apply it. So I felt that if we reversed the normal process of innovation - that is, somebody goes in the lab and says, eureka. I got this new material. Look what it can do. I got this new process. But rather said: This is what the world needs. You can go and find already existing knowledge that would enable you to do it. HARRIS: He decided what the world needs is a way to suck carbon dioxide right out of the air. We're putting 30 billion tons of it into the air every year, and it's driving climate change. So he and another professor who works with him at Columbia University founded a company to do just that. EISENBERGER: And it turned out that the best device already exists. It's called a monolith. That is the same type of instrument that's in your catalytic converter in your car that cleans up your exhaust. HARRIS: He put together a bunch of these monoliths. They grab carbon dioxide from the air, and release it again when you heat them up. Their company, called Global Thermostat, was bankrolled with seed money from liquor and music magnate Edgar Bronfman. The company has built two pilot plants in Menlo Park, California. But, of course, there are big issues to solve: What do you do with the carbon dioxide once you've captured it, and how do you make money? EISENBERGER: And so we then we looked for ways to monetize CO2, and found out lots of people wanted to use CO2 as an important feedstock for making a valuable product. HARRIS: For example, people pipe it into greenhouses, or oil companies pump it underground to help them squeeze out more oil. Soda companies use it to put bubbles in their drinks. But these are mostly small-scale applications, so they'd never require all that much CO2. Maybe someday he could get paid to clean up the atmosphere by sucking out the CO2 and burying it underground, but there's no real support for that now. But using carbon dioxide to make fuel could someday be big. So Eisenberger's first project involves using CO2 to feed algae, which, in turn, churn out biofuel. EISENBERGER: Our first demonstration plant is being erected right now down in Daphne, Alabama with an algae company called Algae Systems, which sits on Mobile Bay. They'll be floating their algae in plastic bags on the top of the water. We'll be piping in CO2 that we pull out of the air, and the sun will do the rest. HARRIS: Now, this one project will have zero effect on how much carbon dioxide is in the earth's atmosphere. But Eisenberger does have much grander ambitions. EISENBERGER: I believe we have something that's economically viable, so our company will be successful. But I'm really in this because I want to contribute to the long term solution that the world needs. HARRIS: Eisenberger says if he can open the door to capturing carbon dioxide from the air and make the process cheap enough, someday we could actually slow down, or possibly even reverse the buildup of carbon dioxide in the air. Robert Socolow at Princeton University started hearing a buzz about this technology a few years back. ROBERT SOCOLOW: It's catchy. It's attractive - conceptually - that one could basically pour CO2 into the atmosphere for the next several decades, and then take it out later and then everything would be fine. HARRIS: But Socolow also found that worrisome. So he got his colleagues at the American Physical Society together a couple of years ago to produce a critique of this strategy. SOCOLOW: It's seductive, and therefore we'd better understand its true promise before we get carried away. HARRIS: It sounds like you were concerned that this would be an excuse for inaction. SOCOLOW: Yes. HARRIS: The physics panel concluded that the technology would be hopelessly expensive, costing $600 for every ton of carbon dioxide it drew out of the air. And the scale would also be huge. Consider what it would take to capture the carbon dioxide wafted into the air from a single coal-fired power plant. SOCOLOW: The calculation that we have in our American Physical Society report is that it will be 20 miles long and 30 feet high. So it's like the Great Wall of China. HARRIS: The committee concluded that it would make a lot more sense to cut down on emissions first - like make our cars, homes and factories more efficient. They also say it makes much more sense to capture carbon dioxide directly from smokestacks, where it's concentrated, instead of from the air. Socolow says maybe someday we'll have our emissions under control, and then we might need to remove some of the carbon dioxide that's already in the air with a capture technology. But that's a long way away, in his view. SOCOLOW: I locate it in the 22nd century. HARRIS: In other words, this might be a good project for Eisenberger's great-great-great grandchildren. No surprise, researchers working on carbon dioxide capture technologies today say that report made it much harder for them to raise money. And Eisenberger says the conclusions are just plain wrong, particularly the panel's cost estimate of $600 a ton. EISENBERGER: We have had third-party reports - independent people - evaluating our technology, and it's under $50 a ton. HARRIS: But Eisenberger says he hasn't actually demonstrated that yet, and he agrees nobody should take his word for it. EISENBERGER: I'm just going to go do it. And doing it or not, that's the answer. HARRIS: Eisenberger acknowledges that pursuing a big idea takes some hard-headedness and thick skin. EISENBERGER: If they don't tell you you're crazy, you're not doing something worthwhile. HARRIS: Do you really believe that? EISENBERGER: Oh, without a doubt, and the history will show you that. Because what you do when you innovate, you disturb the existing order. Fortunately, that's the beauty of science, right? The people that take the time to come into the lab, right, and see it working and can do their own evaluation of the costs and all the performance, they know it's not crazy. HARRIS: And if he and other researchers pursuing this technology can really make it inexpensive to draw carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, Eisenberger says it could be a game-changer. We could start producing fuels with the carbon dioxide that's already in the air, instead of unearthing more fossil fuels. This won't happen quickly, though. EISENBERGER: The energy infrastructure of the world is $55 trillion. You know, it's not like a new Google app. The world has made these transitions before, and they just don't happen in a day, but they happen. HARRIS: There's certainly no guarantee that capturing carbon dioxide from the air will ever become big enough to make a difference to our climate. But it certainly won't if people like Eisenberger don't at least give it a try. Richard Harris, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MONTAGNE: Tomorrow, we'll hear about another scientist who has found a way to make a low-carbon diesel fuel from yeast. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:   When President Obama laid out his ambitious plan to address climate change this week, he focused especially on reducing the amount of carbon dioxide we put into the air. A few pioneering scientists are taking the idea of reducing carbon dioxide in a different direction. They're thinking about ways to remove what's already in the atmosphere, and possibly turn a profit in the process. NPR's Richard Harris caught up with one of the scientists who's exploring this new approach. RICHARD HARRIS, BYLINE: Lots of researchers are trying to tackle climate change by inventing better batteries, better solar cells, better windmills and more efficient vehicles. Peter Eisenberger has been looking at the problem from another perspective. He's not trying to invent anything. He's trying to take advantage of the vast wealth of knowledge that we already have at our fingertips. PETER EISENBERGER: If you looked at knowledge as a commodity, we have generated this enormous amount of knowledge, and we hadn't even begun to think of the many ways we could apply it. So I felt that if we reversed the normal process of innovation - that is, somebody goes in the lab and says, eureka. I got this new material. Look what it can do. I got this new process. But rather said: This is what the world needs. You can go and find already existing knowledge that would enable you to do it. HARRIS: He decided what the world needs is a way to suck carbon dioxide right out of the air. We're putting 30 billion tons of it into the air every year, and it's driving climate change. So he and another professor who works with him at Columbia University founded a company to do just that. EISENBERGER: And it turned out that the best device already exists. It's called a monolith. That is the same type of instrument that's in your catalytic converter in your car that cleans up your exhaust. HARRIS: He put together a bunch of these monoliths. They grab carbon dioxide from the air, and release it again when you heat them up. Their company, called Global Thermostat, was bankrolled with seed money from liquor and music magnate Edgar Bronfman. The company has built two pilot plants in Menlo Park, California. But, of course, there are big issues to solve: What do you do with the carbon dioxide once you've captured it, and how do you make money? EISENBERGER: And so we then we looked for ways to monetize CO2, and found out lots of people wanted to use CO2 as an important feedstock for making a valuable product. HARRIS: For example, people pipe it into greenhouses, or oil companies pump it underground to help them squeeze out more oil. Soda companies use it to put bubbles in their drinks. But these are mostly small-scale applications, so they'd never require all that much CO2. Maybe someday he could get paid to clean up the atmosphere by sucking out the CO2 and burying it underground, but there's no real support for that now. But using carbon dioxide to make fuel could someday be big. So Eisenberger's first project involves using CO2 to feed algae, which, in turn, churn out biofuel. EISENBERGER: Our first demonstration plant is being erected right now down in Daphne, Alabama with an algae company called Algae Systems, which sits on Mobile Bay. They'll be floating their algae in plastic bags on the top of the water. We'll be piping in CO2 that we pull out of the air, and the sun will do the rest. HARRIS: Now, this one project will have zero effect on how much carbon dioxide is in the earth's atmosphere. But Eisenberger does have much grander ambitions. EISENBERGER: I believe we have something that's economically viable, so our company will be successful. But I'm really in this because I want to contribute to the long term solution that the world needs. HARRIS: Eisenberger says if he can open the door to capturing carbon dioxide from the air and make the process cheap enough, someday we could actually slow down, or possibly even reverse the buildup of carbon dioxide in the air. Robert Socolow at Princeton University started hearing a buzz about this technology a few years back. ROBERT SOCOLOW: It's catchy. It's attractive - conceptually - that one could basically pour CO2 into the atmosphere for the next several decades, and then take it out later and then everything would be fine. HARRIS: But Socolow also found that worrisome. So he got his colleagues at the American Physical Society together a couple of years ago to produce a critique of this strategy. SOCOLOW: It's seductive, and therefore we'd better understand its true promise before we get carried away. HARRIS: It sounds like you were concerned that this would be an excuse for inaction. SOCOLOW: Yes. HARRIS: The physics panel concluded that the technology would be hopelessly expensive, costing $600 for every ton of carbon dioxide it drew out of the air. And the scale would also be huge. Consider what it would take to capture the carbon dioxide wafted into the air from a single coal-fired power plant. SOCOLOW: The calculation that we have in our American Physical Society report is that it will be 20 miles long and 30 feet high. So it's like the Great Wall of China. HARRIS: The committee concluded that it would make a lot more sense to cut down on emissions first - like make our cars, homes and factories more efficient. They also say it makes much more sense to capture carbon dioxide directly from smokestacks, where it's concentrated, instead of from the air. Socolow says maybe someday we'll have our emissions under control, and then we might need to remove some of the carbon dioxide that's already in the air with a capture technology. But that's a long way away, in his view. SOCOLOW: I locate it in the 22nd century. HARRIS: In other words, this might be a good project for Eisenberger's great-great-great grandchildren. No surprise, researchers working on carbon dioxide capture technologies today say that report made it much harder for them to raise money. And Eisenberger says the conclusions are just plain wrong, particularly the panel's cost estimate of $600 a ton. EISENBERGER: We have had third-party reports - independent people - evaluating our technology, and it's under $50 a ton. HARRIS: But Eisenberger says he hasn't actually demonstrated that yet, and he agrees nobody should take his word for it. EISENBERGER: I'm just going to go do it. And doing it or not, that's the answer. HARRIS: Eisenberger acknowledges that pursuing a big idea takes some hard-headedness and thick skin. EISENBERGER: If they don't tell you you're crazy, you're not doing something worthwhile. HARRIS: Do you really believe that? EISENBERGER: Oh, without a doubt, and the history will show you that.

One was Professor Marvin Minsky had written a little program that displayed three spots on the screen, and they influenced each other and generated a sort of kaleidoscope display. It was interesting for an hour or two, but after a while you realize that eventually everything decayed into a random pattern. So I started talking up the idea that a better demonstration was needed. And the space race was very much in the news at the time. And so I started talking up the idea of a spaceship trainer that would teach people how to fly a spaceship. And what I got going was a display which showed two spaceships on the screen, and it had some random stars in the background. To add a little motivation to learning how to fly a spaceship, we added torpedoes, and we consciously designed it to be a game. We called it \"Space War! \" And when everything got working, I decided that was pretty good, so I added an exclamation point.

SIEGEL: And first, for folks who might not be familiar, how does Google Reader work? What does it do? HU: Well, Google Reader uses RSS. That's a technology that lets users subscribe to feeds of their favorite news sites and blogs.

SIEGEL: And why has Google decided to lay the Reader to rest? HU: Well, Google has been offering this service as a free service for many years, and it decided it just wasn't worth the overhead. Even though its users are loyal, that usage has been dropping over the last few years as more and more of us have turned to Facebook and our Twitter feeds for our news. And so RSS readers in general were getting less useful because, as we're seeing more and more content, that makes us feel overloaded.

The Quinnipiac University poll showed that opinion about an NSA contractor who leaked those secret documents. That opinion crosses all parties, gender and income lines, with accusations and denials by Google, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft that Prism had open access to private photos, emails and records. With all those denials, people are still worried, and they're looking for ways to keep where they go, what they send and whom they talk to, keep all that stuff private. Your data on the Internet, you know, really has never been private. If you sign up for Gmail or Facebook, you agree that they can grab your information, too. But disclosure about Prism has gotten many people really upset, and they want to know what they can do about it. There are a few services that may make your online surfing a little more private, and we'll be talking about them today. Our number is 1-800-989-8255 if you'd like to join in our conversation. You can tweet us @scifri, S-C-I-F-R-I. Let me introduce my first guest. Jon Xavier is a digital producer for the Silicon Valley Business Journal, and he has tested out a few of these services. He joins us from Stanford University. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. JON XAVIER: Hi. Thanks for having me. FLATOW: You know, I was actually experimenting with some of these myself yesterday and today, about stuff that you can do, and there are something like secure private browsers. There's Tor. There's search engines that say they're the most private thing in the world. Is that true? XAVIER: Yeah. Well, you know, after the sort of the news broke about the NSA snooping, I wanted to look into it and see, you know, what the real options were for people that wanted to protect their privacy. And it's true. There are a lot of secure options that are available on the Internet right now. Many of them are free, which is great. But one of the things I did run into is that when you are looking to secure your privacy, there's sort of a continuum of privacy versus convenience. So while there are a lot of services. . . FLATOW: Right. XAVIER: . . . they're not always convenient as the services you might be used to. So it does take a little bit of work to secure your privacy online. FLATOW: One of the Web surfing devices I used when I went to a website, it said we can not load the flash video. That would be a problem. XAVIER: Right. Yeah. FLATOW: So that's the kind of inconvenience you're talking about. XAVIER: Well, what's interesting is a lot of people don't realize how much every website is gathering data on them, and a lot of that data is being used to sort of customize the user experience to you. So, for example, when you go on Google and you type in a search query, Google is, like, scarily accurate about what you're looking for. Usually, you find it in the first couple, you know, search results. You know, sometimes, it tells you what you're looking for before you even finish the query. The reason it can do that is it's gathered a lot of data about you and what you're looking for, where you're at, what you've searched for recently, and it uses that to tailor that service to you. So if you use like a more secure search page, like Startpage, it's not going to give you as good a result. FLATOW: All right. Jon Xavier - Jon, hang on - is with us. We'll be right back with Jon Xavier, talking about how some of the tools you can use if you want to surf more privately. We'll be back right after this break. Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY, from NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)FLATOW: This is SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking about online security, tools and tips with Jon Xavier, digital producer at the Silicon Valley Business Journal. Jon, I mentioned Tor, the Web browsing - what do you think of Tor? XAVIER: Yeah. So, Tor is great. It's one of the most private ways you can browse the Internet. What it basically does is it's like - if you've ever seen a hacking movie from the early '90s, say \"Hackers,\" they always say, oh, I'm going to bounce myself through a bunch of servers, so you can't trace me. That's basically what Tor does. It - rather than having you connect directly to the server that's serving up the website, it sticks a random amount of servers all over the world between you and that, and then it encrypts it so that that website cannot actually see where the traffic that it's receiving is coming from when it comes from Tor. So Tor is great if you want to disable any sort of Web tracking. FLATOW: How about options for protecting searches? That's for Web browsing. How about something instead of Google Search? XAVIER: Yeah, yeah. Well, one I mentioned earlier, obviously, is Startpage, which is a - one of a few sort of private search engines that have sprung up. They were kind of a thing a little while ago, because people were looking for ways to position themselves against Google. Obviously, it's the, you know, market leader. You need something to set yourself apart, and one of the things that people can hit on was privacy. So there are a number of ones. There's one called Start Page. FLATOW: Right. XAVIER: There's one called DuckDuckGo. What they do is, basically, they give you a search, and they don't track any information about you. They don't save your searches. They don't install any cookies. And the idea being that that way, if the government comes calling and says, give us information about this searcher, they don't have any information to give you. FLATOW: And they also - some of them claim, you know, we're not made in America. We don't reside in America, and our country protects us from getting the data. XAVIER: Yeah. Well, I mean, that's what they say. And certainly the - so Startpage is based in Europe, and Europe has much stronger privacy protections than the United States. That's why companies like Google are always getting sued by, like, the French government for, you know, having too much data-gathering on people that use their services. But at the end of the day, I mean, the sort of things that the NSA is doing are the kinds of things that, you know, intelligence agencies all over the world do. So there's that claim, and I'm sure that there's sort of the reality, and they may not be the same. FLATOW: How about securing your email? What kind of email client might you want? XAVIER: Well, it's interesting. Email is obviously - it's the big thing, because what the NSA was looking at was mostly email records. And there are a number of options to secure your email if you want. The most secure thing is obviously to set up your own email server, and then use a desktop client like Thunderbird, which has a pretty good plug-in called Enigmail that will encrypt all your emails before they leave your computer, so that there - it would be really hard to intercept those and read them. But that requires a bit of tech knowledge, obviously, to set something like that up. So there're other options, like a service called Hushmail, which is basically an encrypted webmail server. So it's like a Gmail, but it's encrypted. It doesn't store the data beyond a certain amount of time. So it's more secure, although, that one comes with the caveat that they have worked with governments in the past to track criminals who are using the service to, you know, do crimes. FLATOW: What about text messaging? Can you encrypt a text message? XAVIER: Yes, you can, actually. And one of the great things about modern phone calls is everything is digital. So anything that you can send through a phone, you can encrypt. There's some great options for Android. There's an app called RedPhone, which is free, and it has a sister app called TextSecure, which is also free. And what they do is they encrypt your phone call and your text message before it leaves your phone. The problem with it is that, in order for it to be encrypted, you have to be calling or texting someone who also has that app. And that's one of the problems you run into with a lot of these services, is that you - in order to really communicate securely, you have to sign the other person up. Edward Snowden even ran into that problem when he was trying to give these documents to Glenn Greenwald. He said I need you to encrypt your emails before I do this. And Glenn Greenwald came back and said, well, I don't know how. So, you know, there's - even for really savvy people, that's barrier. FLATOW: Here's a tweet from Paul Sproge, who says: What about Bitmessage and Bitcoin? XAVIER: Well, Bitcoin is not a communication paradigm. It's basically decentralized currency based around cryptography. You know, you can use Bitcoin. One of the problems with Bitcoin is a lot of the - at the end of the day, you can't buy everything you want to buy with Bitcoin. And so most people, at a certain point, needed to convert Bitcoin back into dollars, and they're going to have to use the major sort of currency exchanges for that - for Bitcoin currency exchanges. And the government has been cracking down on those hard. So it's become a lot harder to do Bitcoin purchases than it was in the past. FLATOW: Let's go to the phones. 1-800-989-8255. Mark in Arlington, Mass. Hi, Mark. MARK: Hi. How are you doing? FLATOW: Hey, there. MARK: Hi. I've been a software engineer for many decades, and I've been thinking for a while that I really ought to download Tor and try it out. But then I started thinking, well, you know, I'll probably be downloading the binaries, and how do I know that the binaries do what's claimed? Well, the alternative is to download the source code and compile it myself, and that assumes that I have the time to spend to read through the entire source code and really understand what it's doing, which most people don't, and most people don't even have the ability to do that. And then if you want to take this one step further and get completely paranoid about it, you should take a look at an article I think was published in the ACM - Journal of the ACM sometime in the late '70s, early '80s. It's from a talk given by Ken Thompson, one of the inventors of UNIX, and it's entitled \"Reflections on Trusting Trust. \" And it's an absolutely fascinating presentation on how they managed to come up with a way to sneak into a compiler, the ability for that compiler to insert surreptitious code into any code that it was compiling and have that - have the code that was sneaking this code in not actually even appear in the source code from the compiler itself. FLATOW: So somebody is - so you're saying that you have to trust who you trust. You have to trust somebody, that they haven't put something, you know, inside the code that you're downloading. What do you say about that, Jon? XAVIER: Yeah. Actually, I mean, that is a major concern when you're look at these cryptography-based or secure communications solutions. The real problem is that as a lay person, you know, even as a fairly sophisticated person, a developer, you'd often don't have the time or the expertise to really evaluate something, because cryptography is a science in itself. It's a very technical subject, and there's a lot of ways to get it wrong. So a good example of that actually is a program called Cryptocat, which was a secure chat program. Basically, you could log in to a chat room. Everything was encrypted, so you could say that no one was snooping in on it. The problem with that is it was out for a couple of years. It was very popular, because it was really easy to use. Security researchers looked at that a few months ago and they said: You know what? Actually, this is completely wrong. They made some really rookie mistakes when they were implementing the cryptography, so that, in fact, it's no more secure than a regular chat program would be. So, you know, as a user of Cryptocat, you have no way of knowing that. And even the developers probably thought it was secure, but they had made a mistake, and there was no one to evaluate that. FLATOW: But isn't the Internet a little more self-correcting now, where everybody's looking at this stuff and putting out the word on, you know, channels we never had before chat rooms, comments, places like that? XAVIER: Certainly, yeah. I mean - and that's really the way - I mean, there's no Consumer Protection Bureau for computer code. FLATOW: Yeah. XAVIER: So that's the way the word gets out. But Cryptocat has been in use for more than two years, and this only came out a couple of years - you know, a couple of months ago. So it's like all the people that were using it for two years thought it was secure, and it was only recently that people dug into it and found out that it was not. FLATOW: Let me bring on someone else. You know how much the information in your email account is worth, but do you know what it's worth to cyber criminals? I want to bring on a guest who's trying to figure that out. Chris Kanich is an associate professor of computer science, University of Illinois at Chicago. And the research behind - he has a security tool called Cloudsweeper. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. CHRIS KANICH: Hi, Ira. Thanks for having me. FLATOW: Tell us what Cloudsweeper does. KANICH: Cloudsweeper is a project that allows you to get a better idea of what the data in your account is worth to criminals, and try to get a better idea of how to control that data and how it gets stored, how it can be accessed in order to make your life more secure. And so we have two different tools that are available right now. One gives you an account theft audit that will take a look at and say, OK, well, I see you have a Twitter account, maybe an Amazon account, things like that. Then we also know through looking at underground forums where bad guys are trading these accounts, buying and selling them, about how much those are worth to them. And so we can actually just tally up and give you a really rough, hypothetical guess about how much a cyber criminal could actually make by taking over your account and then selling everything that's inside of it. FLATOW: Well, I'd like you to know that I used Cloudsweeper, and my account was worth a total of $8. KANICH: Well, there you go. FLATOW: But the other part that you're talking about, the idea that you can go through someone's Google mail and find out what's - passwords and things are stored in there, and what people can steal from you? KANICH: Yeah. That's the other side of what we're doing here. And so beyond the account theft audit, we're also taking a look at what data is actually stored in there. And the biggest part there is that as the Internet is maturing and as we can kind of settle down and, ooh, there's a new service here, a new service there, I know I've had my Gmail account for coming up on eight or nine years now. So what are the chances that somebody emailed me something that I don't necessarily want others to see? And because Gmail just lets me store this stuff for free, you know, years and years and years of data. If a bad guy got in and said, well, I don't just want to use Chris' account to send some spam. I want to use Chris' account to dig through and find something that I could actually use to make a whole bunch of money, maybe commit identity theft on him, things along those lines, that's what we're really trying to look at and help people control by saying: Let's find what data in here is a liability for you instead of. . . FLATOW: Right. KANICH: . . . something that's useful for you, and try to put a damper on that, maybe make it harder to access, or maybe make it so that you can only access that in certain ways after encrypting it, things along those lines. FLATOW: And it tells you what to get rid of. Does it tell you what dangerous things are in there? KANICH: Yeah. So this is the beginning of a larger project. And the first thing that we thought of is, well, there are a lot of services that aren't so good at security, and they have been known to send you your password back in the clear. So say I sign up for a free service, and I'm like, OK, this is my super-secret password. I don't want to use it for anything else. And then they say, oh, thanks for signing up for this service, Chris. If you forget, your password is blah. And while a lot of services have gotten a lot better about this, there's a decent chance - and as we've seen by looking at this that there is a whole lot of stuff in there that people don't necessarily want to keep around. So trying to sweep up what's in there is probably a good idea if we're going to be keeping these accounts for years or decades. FLATOW: And if people want to get a hold of Cloudsweeper, they can just find it on the Internet. KANICH: That's correct. You should be able to Google search for Cloudsweeper right now, and it'll be in the top few results. FLATOW: Jon Xavier, what's your comment on that? XAVIER: I mean, I think that's a great tool, because it's - one of the first things I think you need to do when you're thinking about security and privacy is you really need to understand what's at stake. And a lot of people, I think, don't realize how central their email is and how having their email compromised could compromise pretty much every other service that they use online. So doing a real security audit and finding out, you know, what their exposure is, I think that's a great - that's a great first step for anyone to take. FLATOW: This is SCIENCE FRIDAY, from NPR. I'm Ira Flatow, talking with Jon Xavier, and also with Chris Kanich. How about Twitter? So many people use Twitter. Is Twitter a - can you make that secure? Is it possible? XAVIER: Well, not really. Because one of the issues is with the services that a lot of people use - Twitter, Facebook, things like that - they are not going to want to do this sort of cryptography that you would need to do to really protect yourself from something like the NSA. The saying kind of in Silicon Valley is that if you're using a service and you don't pay for it, you are the product. And what that means, basically, is that companies, basically, that give free services are a lot of times making money by capturing data about their users, and then using that to make money either by selling ads or selling it to other people. You know, that's sort of Google's model. That's Facebook's model. Twitter does that, to a certain extent, as well. So there's not really a motivation there for these companies to want to secure themselves the way you would need to, to protect yourself from the NSA. But there are alternatives. You can use other types of peer-to-peer social networks - Diaspora, something like that. There's one called Mask, which is actually encrypted. And then WikiLeaks, the leaking site, actually has its own social network called FOWL, Friends of WikiLeaks, which you can use, where all the things are encrypted before they reach the server. FLATOW: How about. . . XAVIER: Of course, then you. . . FLATOW: I'm sorry. Go ahead. XAVIER: Of course, the problem there is you have to sign up everybody you know in order to social network with them. FLATOW: Well, some other service you have to sign up is Skype. How secure is Skype? XAVIER: The answer is not very. The problem there is - so Microsoft was one of the companies that was sort of fingered in this leak, and just recently, actually, just yesterday, there were some memos that were released about how much they were actually providing to the NSA. And one of the things that Skype is actually - Skype calls are encrypted, but apparently the NSA had data access to it before it was actually encrypted. So, you know, a service like Skype, it's like - just like anything else. It's not going to be as secure. I mean, there are alternatives. There's something called Silent Circle, which is actually an iPhone app that provides, among other things, secure, encrypted video chat. FLATOW: Hmm. Any other ones in about - we have about a minute left. Any other services or apps you might suggest? XAVIER: One I really like - if you guys use Dropbox. FLATOW: Yes. XAVIER: Dropbox is great, but that was one of the ones that - one of the memos that was leaked, said it was coming online. So if you want to do file storage and synching, there's another service called Tresorit, which basically encrypts your file before it gets stored on the server in the cloud. So what that means is, basically, if the NSA wanted to get access to that, all they would be accessing would be an encrypted file which they would have to then decrypt, which is a big problem for them. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. XAVIER: So that's a good alternative to Dropbox. It works basically the same, almost identically. FLATOW: What about Boxcryptor? I know there was - there's one that - or would any one that encrypts in advance of you dropping it into the drop box work? XAVIER: Yeah. Well, the main thing is you want it to be client-side encryption. So you want it actually encrypt before it gets to the server. If it encrypts on the server, you run into the same issues that you would with Skype. FLATOW: All right. Thank you gentlemen very much. Very interesting stuff for us. Chris Kanich, associate professor of computer science at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Jon Xavier, digital producer, Silicon Valley Business Journal. Thank you both for taking time to be with us today. KANICH: Thank you. FLATOW: We're going to take a. . . XAVIER: Thanks a lot. FLATOW: You're welcome. We're going to take a short break, and when we come back, we're going to talk about UK SETI. SETI is being set up in, you know, search for extraterrestrial intelligence in the UK, also. So stay with us. We'll be right back after this break. I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY, from NPR. IRA FLATOW, HOST:  A recent survey of American voters showed that more than half - that's 55 percent - say that Edward Snowden is a whistleblower rather than a traitor. The Quinnipiac University poll showed that opinion about an NSA contractor who leaked those secret documents. That opinion crosses all parties, gender and income lines, with accusations and denials by Google, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft that Prism had open access to private photos, emails and records. With all those denials, people are still worried, and they're looking for ways to keep where they go, what they send and whom they talk to, keep all that stuff private. Your data on the Internet, you know, really has never been private. If you sign up for Gmail or Facebook, you agree that they can grab your information, too. But disclosure about Prism has gotten many people really upset, and they want to know what they can do about it. There are a few services that may make your online surfing a little more private, and we'll be talking about them today. Our number is 1-800-989-8255 if you'd like to join in our conversation. You can tweet us @scifri, S-C-I-F-R-I. Let me introduce my first guest. Jon Xavier is a digital producer for the Silicon Valley Business Journal, and he has tested out a few of these services. He joins us from Stanford University. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. JON XAVIER: Hi. Thanks for having me. FLATOW: You know, I was actually experimenting with some of these myself yesterday and today, about stuff that you can do, and there are something like secure private browsers. There's Tor. There's search engines that say they're the most private thing in the world. Is that true? XAVIER: Yeah. Well, you know, after the sort of the news broke about the NSA snooping, I wanted to look into it and see, you know, what the real options were for people that wanted to protect their privacy. And it's true. There are a lot of secure options that are available on the Internet right now. Many of them are free, which is great. But one of the things I did run into is that when you are looking to secure your privacy, there's sort of a continuum of privacy versus convenience. So while there are a lot of services. . . FLATOW: Right. XAVIER: . . . they're not always convenient as the services you might be used to. So it does take a little bit of work to secure your privacy online. FLATOW: One of the Web surfing devices I used when I went to a website, it said we can not load the flash video. That would be a problem. XAVIER: Right. Yeah. FLATOW: So that's the kind of inconvenience you're talking about. XAVIER: Well, what's interesting is a lot of people don't realize how much every website is gathering data on them, and a lot of that data is being used to sort of customize the user experience to you. So, for example, when you go on Google and you type in a search query, Google is, like, scarily accurate about what you're looking for. Usually, you find it in the first couple, you know, search results. You know, sometimes, it tells you what you're looking for before you even finish the query. The reason it can do that is it's gathered a lot of data about you and what you're looking for, where you're at, what you've searched for recently, and it uses that to tailor that service to you. So if you use like a more secure search page, like Startpage, it's not going to give you as good a result. FLATOW: All right. Jon Xavier - Jon, hang on - is with us. We'll be right back with Jon Xavier, talking about how some of the tools you can use if you want to surf more privately. We'll be back right after this break. Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY, from NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FLATOW: This is SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking about online security, tools and tips with Jon Xavier, digital producer at the Silicon Valley Business Journal. Jon, I mentioned Tor, the Web browsing - what do you think of Tor? XAVIER: Yeah. So, Tor is great. It's one of the most private ways you can browse the Internet. What it basically does is it's like - if you've ever seen a hacking movie from the early '90s, say \"Hackers,\" they always say, oh, I'm going to bounce myself through a bunch of servers, so you can't trace me. That's basically what Tor does. It - rather than having you connect directly to the server that's serving up the website, it sticks a random amount of servers all over the world between you and that, and then it encrypts it so that that website cannot actually see where the traffic that it's receiving is coming from when it comes from Tor. So Tor is great if you want to disable any sort of Web tracking. FLATOW: How about options for protecting searches? That's for Web browsing. How about something instead of Google Search? XAVIER: Yeah, yeah. Well, one I mentioned earlier, obviously, is Startpage, which is a - one of a few sort of private search engines that have sprung up. They were kind of a thing a little while ago, because people were looking for ways to position themselves against Google. Obviously, it's the, you know, market leader. You need something to set yourself apart, and one of the things that people can hit on was privacy. So there are a number of ones. There's one called Start Page. FLATOW: Right. XAVIER: There's one called DuckDuckGo. What they do is, basically, they give you a search, and they don't track any information about you. They don't save your searches. They don't install any cookies. And the idea being that that way, if the government comes calling and says, give us information about this searcher, they don't have any information to give you. FLATOW: And they also - some of them claim, you know, we're not made in America. We don't reside in America, and our country protects us from getting the data. XAVIER: Yeah. Well, I mean, that's what they say. And certainly the - so Startpage is based in Europe, and Europe has much stronger privacy protections than the United States. That's why companies like Google are always getting sued by, like, the French government for, you know, having too much data-gathering on people that use their services. But at the end of the day, I mean, the sort of things that the NSA is doing are the kinds of things that, you know, intelligence agencies all over the world do. So there's that claim, and I'm sure that there's sort of the reality, and they may not be the same. FLATOW: How about securing your email? What kind of email client might you want? XAVIER: Well, it's interesting. Email is obviously - it's the big thing, because what the NSA was looking at was mostly email records. And there are a number of options to secure your email if you want. The most secure thing is obviously to set up your own email server, and then use a desktop client like Thunderbird, which has a pretty good plug-in called Enigmail that will encrypt all your emails before they leave your computer, so that there - it would be really hard to intercept those and read them. But that requires a bit of tech knowledge, obviously, to set something like that up. So there're other options, like a service called Hushmail, which is basically an encrypted webmail server. So it's like a Gmail, but it's encrypted. It doesn't store the data beyond a certain amount of time. So it's more secure, although, that one comes with the caveat that they have worked with governments in the past to track criminals who are using the service to, you know, do crimes. FLATOW: What about text messaging? Can you encrypt a text message? XAVIER: Yes, you can, actually. And one of the great things about modern phone calls is everything is digital. So anything that you can send through a phone, you can encrypt. There's some great options for Android. There's an app called RedPhone, which is free, and it has a sister app called TextSecure, which is also free. And what they do is they encrypt your phone call and your text message before it leaves your phone. The problem with it is that, in order for it to be encrypted, you have to be calling or texting someone who also has that app. And that's one of the problems you run into with a lot of these services, is that you - in order to really communicate securely, you have to sign the other person up. Edward Snowden even ran into that problem when he was trying to give these documents to Glenn Greenwald. He said I need you to encrypt your emails before I do this. And Glenn Greenwald came back and said, well, I don't know how. So, you know, there's - even for really savvy people, that's barrier. FLATOW: Here's a tweet from Paul Sproge, who says: What about Bitmessage and Bitcoin? XAVIER: Well, Bitcoin is not a communication paradigm. It's basically decentralized currency based around cryptography. You know, you can use Bitcoin. One of the problems with Bitcoin is a lot of the - at the end of the day, you can't buy everything you want to buy with Bitcoin. And so most people, at a certain point, needed to convert Bitcoin back into dollars, and they're going to have to use the major sort of currency exchanges for that - for Bitcoin currency exchanges. And the government has been cracking down on those hard. So it's become a lot harder to do Bitcoin purchases than it was in the past. FLATOW: Let's go to the phones. 1-800-989-8255. Mark in Arlington, Mass. Hi, Mark. MARK: Hi. How are you doing? FLATOW: Hey, there. MARK: Hi. I've been a software engineer for many decades, and I've been thinking for a while that I really ought to download Tor and try it out. But then I started thinking, well, you know, I'll probably be downloading the binaries, and how do I know that the binaries do what's claimed? Well, the alternative is to download the source code and compile it myself, and that assumes that I have the time to spend to read through the entire source code and really understand what it's doing, which most people don't, and most people don't even have the ability to do that. And then if you want to take this one step further and get completely paranoid about it, you should take a look at an article I think was published in the ACM - Journal of the ACM sometime in the late '70s, early '80s. It's from a talk given by Ken Thompson, one of the inventors of UNIX, and it's entitled \"Reflections on Trusting Trust. \" And it's an absolutely fascinating presentation on how they managed to come up with a way to sneak into a compiler, the ability for that compiler to insert surreptitious code into any code that it was compiling and have that - have the code that was sneaking this code in not actually even appear in the source code from the compiler itself. FLATOW: So somebody is - so you're saying that you have to trust who you trust. You have to trust somebody, that they haven't put something, you know, inside the code that you're downloading. What do you say about that, Jon? XAVIER: Yeah. Actually, I mean, that is a major concern when you're look at these cryptography-based or secure communications solutions. The real problem is that as a lay person, you know, even as a fairly sophisticated person, a developer, you'd often don't have the time or the expertise to really evaluate something, because cryptography is a science in itself. It's a very technical subject, and there's a lot of ways to get it wrong. So a good example of that actually is a program called Cryptocat, which was a secure chat program. Basically, you could log in to a chat room. Everything was encrypted, so you could say that no one was snooping in on it. The problem with that is it was out for a couple of years. It was very popular, because it was really easy to use. Security researchers looked at that a few months ago and they said: You know what? Actually, this is completely wrong. They made some really rookie mistakes when they were implementing the cryptography, so that, in fact, it's no more secure than a regular chat program would be. So, you know, as a user of Cryptocat, you have no way of knowing that. And even the developers probably thought it was secure, but they had made a mistake, and there was no one to evaluate that. FLATOW: But isn't the Internet a little more self-correcting now, where everybody's looking at this stuff and putting out the word on, you know, channels we never had before chat rooms, comments, places like that? XAVIER: Certainly, yeah. I mean - and that's really the way - I mean, there's no Consumer Protection Bureau for computer code. FLATOW: Yeah. XAVIER: So that's the way the word gets out. But Cryptocat has been in use for more than two years, and this only came out a couple of years - you know, a couple of months ago. So it's like all the people that were using it for two years thought it was secure, and it was only recently that people dug into it and found out that it was not. FLATOW: Let me bring on someone else. You know how much the information in your email account is worth, but do you know what it's worth to cyber criminals? I want to bring on a guest who's trying to figure that out. Chris Kanich is an associate professor of computer science, University of Illinois at Chicago. And the research behind - he has a security tool called Cloudsweeper. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. CHRIS KANICH: Hi, Ira. Thanks for having me. FLATOW: Tell us what Cloudsweeper does. KANICH: Cloudsweeper is a project that allows you to get a better idea of what the data in your account is worth to criminals, and try to get a better idea of how to control that data and how it gets stored, how it can be accessed in order to make your life more secure. And so we have two different tools that are available right now. One gives you an account theft audit that will take a look at and say, OK, well, I see you have a Twitter account, maybe an Amazon account, things like that. Then we also know through looking at underground forums where bad guys are trading these accounts, buying and selling them, about how much those are worth to them. And so we can actually just tally up and give you a really rough, hypothetical guess about how much a cyber criminal could actually make by taking over your account and then selling everything that's inside of it. FLATOW: Well, I'd like you to know that I used Cloudsweeper, and my account was worth a total of $8. KANICH: Well, there you go. FLATOW: But the other part that you're talking about, the idea that you can go through someone's Google mail and find out what's - passwords and things are stored in there, and what people can steal from you? KANICH: Yeah. That's the other side of what we're doing here. And so beyond the account theft audit, we're also taking a look at what data is actually stored in there. And the biggest part there is that as the Internet is maturing and as we can kind of settle down and, ooh, there's a new service here, a new service there, I know I've had my Gmail account for coming up on eight or nine years now. So what are the chances that somebody emailed me something that I don't necessarily want others to see? And because Gmail just lets me store this stuff for free, you know, years and years and years of data. If a bad guy got in and said, well, I don't just want to use Chris' account to send some spam. I want to use Chris' account to dig through and find something that I could actually use to make a whole bunch of money, maybe commit identity theft on him, things along those lines, that's what we're really trying to look at and help people control by saying: Let's find what data in here is a liability for you instead of. . . FLATOW: Right. KANICH: . . . something that's useful for you, and try to put a damper on that, maybe make it harder to access, or maybe make it so that you can only access that in certain ways after encrypting it, things along those lines. FLATOW: And it tells you what to get rid of. Does it tell you what dangerous things are in there? KANICH: Yeah. So this is the beginning of a larger project. And the first thing that we thought of is, well, there are a lot of services that aren't so good at security, and they have been known to send you your password back in the clear. So say I sign up for a free service, and I'm like, OK, this is my super-secret password. I don't want to use it for anything else. And then they say, oh, thanks for signing up for this service, Chris. If you forget, your password is blah. And while a lot of services have gotten a lot better about this, there's a decent chance - and as we've seen by looking at this that there is a whole lot of stuff in there that people don't necessarily want to keep around. So trying to sweep up what's in there is probably a good idea if we're going to be keeping these accounts for years or decades. FLATOW: And if people want to get a hold of Cloudsweeper, they can just find it on the Internet. KANICH: That's correct. You should be able to Google search for Cloudsweeper right now, and it'll be in the top few results. FLATOW: Jon Xavier, what's your comment on that? XAVIER: I mean, I think that's a great tool, because it's - one of the first things I think you need to do when you're thinking about security and privacy is you really need to understand what's at stake. And a lot of people, I think, don't realize how central their email is and how having their email compromised could compromise pretty much every other service that they use online. So doing a real security audit and finding out, you know, what their exposure is, I think that's a great - that's a great first step for anyone to take. FLATOW: This is SCIENCE FRIDAY, from NPR. I'm Ira Flatow, talking with Jon Xavier, and also with Chris Kanich. How about Twitter? So many people use Twitter. Is Twitter a - can you make that secure? Is it possible? XAVIER: Well, not really. Because one of the issues is with the services that a lot of people use - Twitter, Facebook, things like that - they are not going to want to do this sort of cryptography that you would need to do to really protect yourself from something like the NSA. The saying kind of in Silicon Valley is that if you're using a service and you don't pay for it, you are the product. And what that means, basically, is that companies, basically, that give free services are a lot of times making money by capturing data about their users, and then using that to make money either by selling ads or selling it to other people. You know, that's sort of Google's model. That's Facebook's model. Twitter does that, to a certain extent, as well. So there's not really a motivation there for these companies to want to secure themselves the way you would need to, to protect yourself from the NSA. But there are alternatives. You can use other types of peer-to-peer social networks - Diaspora, something like that. There's one called Mask, which is actually encrypted. And then WikiLeaks, the leaking site, actually has its own social network called FOWL, Friends of WikiLeaks, which you can use, where all the things are encrypted before they reach the server. FLATOW: How about. . . XAVIER: Of course, then you. . . FLATOW: I'm sorry. Go ahead. XAVIER: Of course, the problem there is you have to sign up everybody you know in order to social network with them. FLATOW: Well, some other service you have to sign up is Skype. How secure is Skype? XAVIER: The answer is not very. The problem there is - so Microsoft was one of the companies that was sort of fingered in this leak, and just recently, actually, just yesterday, there were some memos that were released about how much they were actually providing to the NSA. And one of the things that Skype is actually - Skype calls are encrypted, but apparently the NSA had data access to it before it was actually encrypted. So, you know, a service like Skype, it's like - just like anything else. It's not going to be as secure. I mean, there are alternatives. There's something called Silent Circle, which is actually an iPhone app that provides, among other things, secure, encrypted video chat. FLATOW: Hmm. Any other ones in about - we have about a minute left. Any other services or apps you might suggest? XAVIER: One I really like - if you guys use Dropbox. FLATOW: Yes.

FLATOW: Mm-hmm. XAVIER: So that's a good alternative to Dropbox. It works basically the same, almost identically. FLATOW: What about Boxcryptor?

Well, the main thing is you want it to be client-side encryption. So you want it actually encrypt before it gets to the server. If it encrypts on the server, you run into the same issues that you would with Skype. FLATOW: All right. Thank you gentlemen very much. Very interesting stuff for us.

Many people have ditched them for cable or wireless, so when old lines go down in storms, phone companies are questioning whether it's worth the cost of replacing them. That's the case right now in several communities hit last year by Superstorm Sandy, as NPR's Dan Bobkoff reports. DAN BOBKOFF, BYLINE: Fire Island is a long, narrow strip of land off the coast of Long Island. It's where Manhattanites summer to get away from it all. And last fall, it also happened to be right smack in the path of Sandy. MARIO POSILLICO: We had damage to our beach. You know, every part of our infrastructure was damaged. BOBKOFF: Mario Posillico is one of Fire Island's 300-or-so year-round residents. He's the village administrator of Saltaire. It's the kind of place that had just a single store until Sandy knocked it out of commission. (SOUNDBITE OF FOOTSTEPS)BOBKOFF: It was there Posillico met me on his bike traveling the newly rebuilt boardwalks. They may had, you know, all been lifted, twisted. It was very much like a roller coaster - all these boardwalks. The storm also destroyed much of the island's phones. Salt water and copper phone lines don't mix. But the island's only traditional phone company has no plans to replace them. Instead, Verizon is offering customers a little white box with an antenna it calls Voice Link. Pat Briody has had a house on Fire Island for 40 years. PAT BRIODY: It has all the problems of a cell phone system but none of the advantages. BOBKOFF: Essentially, Voice Link connects home phones to the Verizon Wireless network on the island. It has a traditional-sounding dial tone and 911 service. But that's about it. You can't get Internet. Some businesses can't process credit card transactions. Many alarm systems and health monitors won't work with Voice Link. But Fire Island and a few other communities hit hard by Sandy have no other choice. Steve Kunreuther of the Saltaire Yacht Club is not happy. STEVE KUNREUTHER: I don't think there's anybody who will tell you Voice Link is better than the copper wiring. (SOUNDBITE OF A RINGING PHONE)TOM MAGUIRE: MaguireBOBKOFF: Hi, Dan Bobkoff. Can you hear me OK? MAGUIRE: I can hear you clear as a bell. BOBKOFF: This is Tom Maguire. He's a senior vice president at Verizon. I reached him at his New Jersey home, where he happened to be using Voice Link himself. So, are you using the same box right now that they're using on Fire Island? MAGUIRE: Yes. The one I'm talking to you on? Yes, same exact thing. BOBKOFF: I'll leave it up to you to decide whether that sounds as good as a landline. MAGUIRE: I really take exception with the fact that some people think that Voice Link is an inferior product. BOBKOFF: Besides, Maguire says, most calls on the island already come from cell phones. MAGUIRE: The traditional landline business has been declining out on Fire Island, much as it has in the rest of the country. BOBKOFF: And this is why what happens to a few Verizon customers on the East Coast matters to the rest of us. For nearly a century, the government has promoted universal access: the idea that anyone should be able to get a reliable home phone connection at a reasonable cost. But phone customers have been ditching traditional phone service. Some now get their home phone from the cable company. Others have gone completely wireless. Verizon has seen a 67 percent drop in the number of customers using copper landlines since 2000. Harold Feld, with the consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge, says regulators have to decide whether universal access still matters. HAROLD FELD: Or do we not care anymore? Now, is this something where the phone service of the future is going to be great where you can get it and great where you can afford it, but it's not going to be a public utility anymore. It's not going to be protected anymore, so you better hope you live some place where it works right. BOBKOFF: Traditional phone companies like Verizon are still required to offer universal phone service in most places where they operate. Feld says their competitors, like cable companies, are not. FELD: Verizon and AT&T have been saying, well, look, you know, it's not fair. We're no longer monopolies anymore. We can't subsidize the poor areas with the rich areas, so we want a change. BOBKOFF: So, in a sense, Voice Link is a kind of compromise. It's the phone company saying, we'll give you a phone line but one that's cheaper for us to operate. Verizon says from now on, when a copper line has problems, if fiber optic lines aren't available, it's going to promote Voice Link as a customer's best option. Each customer that switches saves the company about $600 a year. It's up to regulators to decide whether that's a fair trade and they're watching Fire Island as a test case. Both state regulators and the Federal Communications Commission are taking public comments on the matter. And they're getting an earful. As I was leaving Fire Island, Connie Lawler saw my microphone. And when I told her I was doing a story on Voice Link, she was distraught over the loss of her copper wires. CONNIE LAWLER: If you can help us, you will be our guardian angel.

MAGUIRE: I really take exception with the fact that some people think that Voice Link is an inferior product. BOBKOFF: Besides, Maguire says, most calls on the island already come from cell phones. MAGUIRE: The traditional landline business has been declining out on Fire Island, much as it has in the rest of the country. BOBKOFF: And this is why what happens to a few Verizon customers on the East Coast matters to the rest of us. For nearly a century, the government has promoted universal access: the idea that anyone should be able to get a reliable home phone connection at a reasonable cost. But phone customers have been ditching traditional phone service. Some now get their home phone from the cable company. Others have gone completely wireless. Verizon has seen a 67 percent drop in the number of customers using copper landlines since 2000. Harold Feld, with the consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge, says regulators have to decide whether universal access still matters. HAROLD FELD: Or do we not care anymore? Now, is this something where the phone service of the future is going to be great where you can get it and great where you can afford it, but it's not going to be a public utility anymore. It's not going to be protected anymore, so you better hope you live some place where it works right. BOBKOFF: Traditional phone companies like Verizon are still required to offer universal phone service in most places where they operate. Feld says their competitors, like cable companies, are not. FELD: Verizon and AT&T have been saying, well, look, you know, it's not fair. We're no longer monopolies anymore. We can't subsidize the poor areas with the rich areas, so we want a change. BOBKOFF: So, in a sense, Voice Link is a kind of compromise. It's the phone company saying, we'll give you a phone line but one that's cheaper for us to operate. Verizon says from now on, when a copper line has problems, if fiber optic lines aren't available, it's going to promote Voice Link as a customer's best option. Each customer that switches saves the company about $600 a year. It's up to regulators to decide whether that's a fair trade and they're watching Fire Island as a test case. Both state regulators and the Federal Communications Commission are taking public comments on the matter. And they're getting an earful. As I was leaving Fire Island, Connie Lawler saw my microphone. And when I told her I was doing a story on Voice Link, she was distraught over the loss of her copper wires. CONNIE LAWLER: If you can help us, you will be our guardian angel.

We are about halfway through the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. That's where observant Muslims abstain from food, drink and intimacy during daylight hours and take special care to pray and reflect on their spirituality. If you are currently observing Ramadan, you might sometimes forget that it's time to pray or eat until you hear this coming out of your pocket. (SOUNDBITE OF APP, MUSLIM PRO)MARTIN: That's from the app Muslim Pro. The app is just one of many tools helping tech-savvy Muslims get through the month. There's also the hashtag #breakingfast that's trending on Twitter. Muslims around the world are using it to share about the meals that they're eating before sunrise or after sunset. We wanted to talk more about this, about how technology's helping people observe Ramadan in the 21st-century. So we've called our regular barbershop contributor Arsalan Iftikhar. He's founder of TheMuslimGuy. com. Welcome back, Arsalan. Thanks so much for joining us. ARSALAN IFTIKHAR: Thanks, Michel. It's good to be with you. MARTIN: And Ramadan Mubarak. IFTIKHAR: Thank you very much. MARTIN: So tell us about some of these apps. What do they do? IFTIKHAR: Well, you know what, Michel, first, I think it's really important for this story, you know, that I was able to crowd source through my nearly 40,000 Facebook and Twitter followers at TheMuslimGuy to see what apps and social media tools people are using around the world during this Muslim holy month of Ramadan. And this is really the first time, Michel, that I can remember that I've seen major technology companies really, truly embracing Ramadan for the nearly 7 million American-Muslims and 1 billion Muslims worldwide. First and foremost, I have to give a shout out to Google. Google, for Ramadan, has created a new global landing page where people can watch TV programs from around the world, get inspiration on ways to cook their favorite dish and much more, including a live video feed from the Grand Mosque in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. MARTIN: I think, actually, - I think we actually have some audio of that. This is just what you said. It's a live feed from the Grand Mosque in Mecca, which is - here it is. We'll just play it. Here it is. (SOUNDBITE OF TARAWEEH PRAYER)MARTIN: What are we hearing here? And why would this be important to someone? IFTIKHAR: Well, Michel, what you're hearing there is the nightly prayer during Ramadan, which are called the Taraweeh prayers. And the reason that it's really important is that this is something that observant Muslims all around the world do on a nightly basis. But what's really important is that, this again, is at the Grand Mosque in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, which is home to the Kaaba, which Muslims around the world pray to. And I think it's really important actually for people who are non-Muslims, as well because, since traditionally the Kaaba in Mecca is only allowed for Muslims to visit in person, it allows people from different faiths and different backgrounds an insight to what goes on in the holy city when millions of Muslims from around the world congregate there every year. MARTIN: I understand that social media activities are actually higher during the month of Ramadan. Is that so and why do you think that is? IFTIKHAR: Absolutely, Michel, because, let's be honest, you know, when you can't eat or drink anything all day, there's no better way to count down the minutes until you can break your fast than by surfing the net. According to The Online Project, which is the Middle East's largest social media agency, their research showed that there was a 30 to 42 percent increase in Facebook usage during the month of Ramadan in Muslim-majority countries, and a 14 to 33 percent increase in Twitter usage during Ramadan in Muslim-majority nations, as well. And what's really interesting to note is they found also that Muslim users of social media tend to be more, quote-unquote, positive rather than negative once they had opened their Ramadan fast because, let's be honest again, everyone is a little grumpy if we haven't eaten or drank anything all day. MARTIN: So what are people tweeting about? Are they tweeting about how miserable they are? Or what are they doing? IFTIKHAR: No, they're really, you know, they're tweeting and posting about everything. You know, what's really important is that since we Muslims break our Ramadan fast at different times around the world because of our respective time zones, you know, social media is really the way that we can keep in touch with our friends and family. So for example, many people are using the social media website Pinterest to post yummy Ramadan recipes for things like vegetable biryani, Moroccan lamb stew, or chicken tikka masala. Muslim families also connect with each other by sharing recipes from websites like DesiCookbook. com, which offers, you know, South Asian food recipes and which also sees spikes in Web traffic during Ramadan, as well. And so, you know, whether you're looking for your local mosque, whether you're looking for prayer times, whether you're looking for what time your fast opens, you know, social media and the Internet are really, really great ways to connect with people in your local area and around the world. MARTIN: Are people complaining? Are they complaining about how miserable they are? Or do they get - do they get - do they get any, like, support for talking about how miserable they are or are they more expected to keep that to themselves and, you know, focus on the positive or focus on the kind of loftier thoughts? IFTIKHAR: Well, we try to, of course. But, you know, again, when you're abstaining from food and drink throughout the day for 30 days, you know, many times, you know, the focus of your attention is going to go on food again. And so, you know, there's a big, big emphasis on, you know, finding, you know, recipes and thinking about what you're going to eat with your family and friends that night. You know, I remember, you know, growing up in Chicago here and not being able to find any Halal restaurants. Halal is the Muslim version of keeping kosher. And, you know, now we have grocery stores, like Whole Foods Markets, which now carry Saffron Road Halal entrees, you know, in their aisles. And so, you know, we're just learning about new things that companies are taking into account when it comes to Muslim consumers here in the United States and abroad, and it really is a very festive occasion for Muslims all around the world. MARTIN: Are there any people who say that you should shun this technology during Ramadan as part of your fast? I mean, there are other - other religions. . . IFTIKHAR: . . . Yeah, my mom. . . MARTIN: . . . Do emphasize - oh, she does? IFTIKHAR: Yeah. MARTIN: People say, well, you know, technology is one of the things that you should try to abstain from unless it's absolutely necessary, because there are people who feel it takes on an addictive quality. For example, during Lent, which is observed by Christians in the 40 days before Easter, there are those who don't go on technology fasts, unless they absolutely have to use it for their work. But in their personal lives, some people actually do social media fasts. So you're saying your mom thinks maybe you should abstain technology as something else? IFTIKHAR: Well, I was saying that tongue-in-cheek. But, you know, you're absolutely right. You know, obviously the central, core concept of Ramadan is one of spiritual cleansing and atonement. And so, like you said, you know, you're not only abstaining from food and drink and other things, but it's also meant to serve as a spiritual time. So, for example, I haven't watched television, you know, in the last two weeks or so, and that's just something that, you know, I've traditionally not done during Ramadan. Obviously, as you can see from all of my research here, I've not been able to stay away from social media. But, you know, these are things that, you know, many Muslims, at the personal level and at the family level, deal with on a daily basis. And, you know, just depending on your level of observance, you know, it can really be a good way to actually, you know, strengthen your spiritual foundation, as well. MARTIN: Well, what were some of your favorite tweets at #breakingfast? Do you want to tell us? IFTIKHAR: Well, you know, again, it's all about the food. You know, when you can't eat for 17 hours a day, you basically try to - it really is, for lack of a better term, food porn. And you have, you know, great dishes from around the world and you have people's recipes on, you know, how to make their favorite hummus or, you know, what they've done to, you know, their, you know, biryani or things like that. And, you know, a lot of times it is just about finding ways to better your own Ramadan experience. So if you find a great recipe, if you find a great restaurant, if you find a great Mosque, you know, that might be having nightly prayers, you know, you connect with each other using the breakingfast hashtag. And it's really, really heartening to see a lot of companies, including Google, Nokia, Microsoft - really taking, you know, American-Muslim and global-Muslim consumers seriously, and making Ramadan just a little bit easier for all of us. MARTIN: Arsalan Iftikhar is senior editor of The Islamic Monthly. He's founder of TheMuslimGuy. com, and of course a regular contributor to our barbershop roundtable. Arsalan, thank you.

Birds do it. Bats do it. Now, even educated people do it. We're talking about echolocation: the process whereby animals emit sounds to locate objects. A team of researchers has created an algorithm that lets us see with sound. Ivan Dokmanic of the Ecole Polytechnique Federale in Switzerland says the project kicked off with a question. IVAN DOKMANIC: Is it possible to just produce a sound and be like Batman or just hear the shape of the room, right, just like \"Dark Knight\" style? (SOUNDBITE OF MOVIE, \"THE DARK KNIGHT\")LYDEN: Only Dokmanic's technology uses microphones in a different way. First, you set up a few of them around the room. DOKMANIC: Hook these microphones up to an amplifier and to computer, produce some sound, and then just calculate the shape of the room based on the echoes that you receive from the walls in the room. Times when these echoes arrive enable us, using some mathematical tools, to determine where the walls actually are. LYDEN: So how could we actually apply this technology in the real world? Well, for one thing, let's say you're building a concert hall and you know exactly what kind of sound you want. DOKMANIC: In architectural acoustics, you could really say, okay, this is how I want my room to sound. And then just plug this into our algorithm, and then this algorithm will produce the room that produces these echoes. LYDEN: Or the technology could be used as an aid for the blind providing optic feedback. DOKMANIC: Saying, okay, you know, the general form of the room is like this, or there are obstacles here and there, and you know, be careful. LYDEN: It could also come in handy when solving a crime if there happens to be a recording of it. DOKMANIC: You can imagine that you could actually reconstruct the room where the sound was recorded. LYDEN: But these applications aren't available for the public just yet. As to when we might see them, Ivan Dokmanic is optimistic but realistic. DOKMANIC: I hope not too long. But, I guess, the realistic horizon is maybe two years to get something that's really usable by everyone. LYDEN: Dokmanic says he and his team are raising funds to expand the technology. They hope to turn it into an app, coming soon to a smartphone screen near you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) JACKI LYDEN, HOST:  Now, from sound beneath the waves to sound above ground. Birds do it.

We called NPR's Steve Henn, who's in Las Vegas, checking out what's going on. Steve, good morning. STEVE HENN, BYLINE: Good morning. GREENE: OK. So we have these conventions of hackers taking place. What are they, and what's the difference between the two? HENN: Black Hat has kind of a corporate feel to it. People who go to this conference try to network and get business. It's the security technology industry conference. DEF CON's older and bigger and a little bit wilder. Feels more like a techie, hippie, libertarian festival. And DEF CON started 21 years ago. And in the beginning, I'm told it was a pretty ragtag group, largely of kids. You know, they created this conference as a safe place for hackers of all stripes to get together and show off what they were working on and meet each other. Remember, a lot of these people spent hours communicating on sort of the proto-Internet. But they hadn't actually met. Over the years, you know, computer security became an industry. So, fast forward to the late-'90s. The computer industry had woken up to the fact that security issues were big problems. And that's when Black Hat was born, when they realized that the industry itself needed a convention also. So, today, there are two conferences. They both have ethical hackers showing off what they can do, but they still have really different feels to them. GREENE: And, Steve, you say ethical hackers. And that's an interesting question, because hacking is sometimes something that can run you afoul of the law. I mean, have any of these people who attend this conference done things that can be considered illegal? HENN: Well, sure. You know, lots and lots of people attend DEF CON. But the idea of ethical hacking is that you find a vulnerability in a product that lots of people use, and you disclose it responsibly. Usually, that means, you know, reaching out to the company, letting them know that something about their product might make people vulnerable to an attack, or having their identity stolen and giving them a chance to fix it. One of the problems, though - especially in industries that aren't used to dealing with hackers - is they don't necessarily know how to handle someone who they've never heard of coming up and saying, hey, you know, we broke this, and people can get hurt. GREENE: I've been in your computer system. HENN: Right. And so this relationship is often fraught. GREENE: I'm imagining rows of people sitting at computers, trying out ways to break into government or corporate websites. Is that what these events look like? HENN: Well, you know, Black Hat really doesn't look that way, but at DEF CON - which, as I said, is a little bit wilder - there is something called the wall of sheep, where hackers will sit along a wall, and they will try to hack into the devices of attendees. And if they break into your device and figure out who you are, your name goes up on a board to sort of shame you for having, you know, lax personal cyber-security hygiene. GREENE: Wow. That's one way to drive home you need to beef up your security. And, Steve, really interesting keynote address coming at Black Hat, General Keith Alexander, the director of the National Security Agency. And he's, of course, been taking a lot of heat for those revelations by former contractor Edward Snowden. It's pretty remarkable that he's come there, isn't it? HENN: Yeah, that's right. A lot of people didn't expect him to show up. And not only is he delivering a speech this morning, he spent yesterday meeting privately with a group of high-level security industry leaders. There's a real lack of trust right now between this industry and the intelligence community. A lot of people in it are concerned that international clients are going to be afraid to store data in the United States if they feel that the NSA can just walk in and grab it. So, he's going to face a tough audience today. GREENE: Thanks so much for coming on. HENN: Oh, my pleasure. GREENE: That's NPR's Steve Henn, and he's covering two hacking conferences in Las Vegas. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  Thousands of computer hackers are in Las Vegas right now for two major hacker conventions this week. One is called DEF CON, and the other's called Black Hat.

Good morning. I'm David Greene. And I'm Renee Montagne. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: In this case, what happens in Vegas does not stay in Vegas. A standing room only crowd packed a ballroom at Caesar's Palace yesterday to hear General Keith Alexander. The director of the National Security Agency delivered a keynote address to a hacker conference. And given the recent NSA leak, he ended up in front of a very tough crowd. NPR's Steve Henn was there. STEVE HENN, BYLINE: General Keith Alexander came to this conference - Black Hat - to go on a charm offensive. GENERAL KEITH ALEXANDER: This is the technical foundation for our world's communications - you folks right here. HENN: But he didn't just resort to flattery. On Tuesday, the day before his speech, he met privately with technology leaders from some of the country's biggest tech companies. Then he went out to dinner with a group of hackers. And yesterday Jeff Moss, the hacker who founded this conference 16 years ago, gave him credit for just showing up. JEFF MOSS: It would have been easy for him to sort of duck out and not come speak to us, you know, go to a meeting. HENN: But Black Hat and its sister conference DEF CON have been fertile ground for NSA recruiting for years. The brightest minds in computer security from around the world flock here each summer. And the men and women who run computer security at the world's biggest tech firms are here too. In short, the NSA has to deal with these people. And yesterday General Alexander said he came here to clear up some misperceptions about how the NSA's surveillance program operates. ALEXANDER: I will answer every question to the fullest extent possible. And I promise you the truth. What we know, what we're doing, and what I cannot tell you because we don't want to jeopardize our future defense. HENN: Ultimately, however, the only questions that Alexander answered were pre-selected by the conference organizers or shouted out from hecklers. Just hours before he spoke, the Obama administration declassified more details about two NSA data collection programs, and then the Guardian newspaper published more classified documents describing how the NSA searches through huge quantities of digital information it collects from approximately 150 network sites around the world. The NSA said that program was lawful and aimed at collecting foreign intelligence. But again and again yesterday, Alexander tried to make the point that all of these programs were essential to disrupting terror plots and they all function within the law. ALEXANDER: I think it's important to understand the strict oversight that goes in on these programs. Because the assumption is that people are out there just wheeling and dealing - and nothing could be further from the truth. HENN: Alexander said the NSA closely tracks and then audits each analyst who accesses its enormous repositories of data. It does this to ensure that these databases aren't abused. He argued that federal judges who oversea the NSA's collection programs are not simply rubber stamps. But ultimately the question he struggled to answer was shouted from the audience. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Why should we believe you are not lying to us right now? HENN: Basically, why should we believe you? UNIDENTIFIED MAN: You lied to Congress. ALEXANDER: I haven't lied to Congress. HENN: And that's true. Alexander didn't lie to Congress. But many here believe that his boss -  the director of National Intelligence, James Clapper - did, when he told Congress earlier this year that the NSA was not collecting personal information about millions of Americans. Yesterday that left General Alexander stuck, asking a skeptical crowd to trust in a system of checks and balances they couldn't see for themselves. After all, the details of most Foreign Intelligence Surveillance court proceedings are still classified; so are the contents of all these internal NSA audits. So all Alexander could do was ask the crowd to believe him, to take him at his word that his team - his analysts - were being maligned. ALEXANDER: And their reputation is tarnished because all the facts aren't on the table. HENN: But that's unlikely to change because so much about the NSA is still secret.

You can even hit the brakes. It will even hit the brakes automatically to stop short of hitting that kid running after the beach ball in the street. And there are - and, of course, these are all controlled by computers. And where there are computers, there are hackers. Can someone hack into your car and take over those computers, perhaps for evil purposes? Yes, they can. My next guests hacked into a Ford Escape and a Toyota Prius to figure out their weaknesses and their - joining me now from the Def Con hacking conference in Las Vegas where they just stepped off the stage from presenting their results. Charlie Miller is a security engineer at Twitter, and Chris Valasek is director of security at IOActive. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. CHARLIE MILLER: Thanks for having us. FLATOW: Hey there. CHRIS VALASEK: Thanks, Ira. FLATOW: I was just watching the video of you guys hacking into a Prius in a parking lot. MILLER: Yeah. It's been a fun trip so far. FLATOW: How do you do that? How did you do that? MILLER: So if I really wanted to attack your previous guest's Prius, what I would want to do is two steps. The first step was I would have to remotely attack one of their, like you mentioned, the Bluetooth that allows your phone to talk to your car. So I would do - we need a remote attack first. And once I had compromised any piece of - any electronic on your car, then I would be able to send messages to the other computers in your car to make them do things. Our research focused on that second thing because the remote has actually already been done a couple of years ago by some other researchers. So for our research, we said let's suppose you already have a remote attack, what do can you do the car? And like you said, you can do a lot of crazy stuff like control the seatbelts, control the speedometer, honk the horn, yank the steering wheel, engage the brakes. You know, the possibilities are endless. VALASEK: And it's not going away anytime soon. More and more computers are being added to cars that do more and more things. The functionality really is going to be complete control by the computer network sometime in the near future. FLATOW: So you're going to be - like in these fighter jets, you don't fly the jet. You fly the computer, and the computer drives the car in this case. VALASEK: Yeah. I hope so. I mean one of the things that we didn't want out of this is to have car manufacturers stop putting these cool new gadgets in cars because we like that. We just want them to do it in a secure way. FLATOW: And so you're out there sort of to show them where the weaknesses are. VALASEK: Yeah, we'd like to point out that if someone were to remotely compromise your car, as Charlie talked about before, there's a lot of safety critical functionality that's computer controlled and can be forged when you're already on that network. So you don't want to people to, you know, be able to control these things, but no one's really talking much about it or releasing much information, and we figure we'd start doing that. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number, if you want to talk about hacking into your car. So you think you want to get the conversation going so we can be ready for when the day we need it? VALASEK: Exactly, so that was a big part of our research was to make sure we released everything in an open manner, and we're releasing a paper and all our code, and the hope is that other researchers will get involved, and we can all work together to make cars a lot safer than they are now. MILLER: But we want a lot of researchers to be able to repeat this work, and then we can all work together. FLATOW: So far we've talked about the Toyota. What about the Ford Escape? What did you find you could do with the Ford Escape? VALASEK: So similar things, but the Ford Escape we had did not have quite as sophisticated electronics as the Prius. So it limited the attacks that we could do. So on the Ford we could do things like speedometer, of course, odometer, GPS. We could make the lights all turn off. We could engage the brakes if you were stopped. And the scariest thing we could do is we could actually make the brakes not work if you were going slowly, so like five miles an hour or something. So you can imagine pulling into a parking spot or going to a crosswalk and, you know, the attack happens, now the brakes aren't working, and you're still driving, and there's nothing you could do. FLATOW: And how could, if someone really wanted to hack in, how could they get into the car without you noticing it or knowing about it? VALASEK: Yes, there's so much in the car, too, that is - communicates wirelessly. Cars have tire pressure monitoring systems that monitor the pressure of each individual tire. So that's a method you could get in. As you talked before about making a phone call from your steering wheel, you know, that's Bluetooth. The telematics unit, you know, your entertainment, infotainment systems, are now having Wi-Fi-enabled access points in the car. So there's more and more attack vectors the more technology that gets put into these things. MILLER: And also, another one is like the telemax unit, like OnStar, that you would have in your car. FLATOW: You could get in through OnStar? MILLER: I don't know if anyone's done that, but it's a theoretical way you could do that. VALASEK: Yeah. FLATOW: Wow, what about through you CD, the old-fashioned CD slot? Any way you could get in there? MILLER: Yeah, academics actually performed that attack in their research. So that's a very real possibility. VALASEK: In 2011 they had a CD that if you put it into the car stereo, it's - any other stereo it sounded like real music, but you put it into the car stereo of the car that they were looking at, and it actually exploited the radio, and then it was able to do the same kinds of things we were able to do inside the cars. FLATOW: This is really spooky. Hang around guys, we're going to take break, and we're going to come back and talk more with Charlie Miller, a security engineer at Twitter; and Chris Valasek, who is director of security at IOActive. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. You can tweet us with questions about security for your car @scifri, you can tweet us there, also on our website at sciencefriday. com. And we'll be back after this break, so stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY. We're talking this hour about hacking. My guests are security experts Charlie Miller, he's a security engineer at Twitter; Chris Valasek, he is director of security at IOActive. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. Did you gentlemen discover, were you surprised by how easily it was to do all these things? VALASEK: I wouldn't call it easy. It actually - we've been doing this research for 10 months now. So it's not like we stepped in the cares for a weekend and had complete control of them. It takes a lot of research and a lot of time to do the type of attacks that we did. MILLER: It wasn't easy, but I guess we were surprised at the amount of different things that we could actually accomplish. FLATOW: Yeah, getting in through the tire pressure valve mechanism. Wow. VALASEK: Yeah, that's not something we did, but again it's something that communicates with this computer network and has some kind of external existence on the car. So really anything that communicates with the outside could potentially be used as an attack vector. FLATOW: Now in Europe, Volkswagen hacker - took hackers to court who were going to release codes to cars like you did. What has been the response from Ford and Toyota to your dealings with their automobile? MILLER: So luckily Ford and Toyota did not take us to court, so that's good. But their response has basically been that they are focusing on the remote attack part of the equation, and they don't necessarily care about the second part of the equation, which is, you know, controlling the car from - you know, any one computer controlling all the rest of the computers. So obviously we're concerned with the entire safety of the car and security, so from - we think there should be a layered approach where, you know, not only is hard to attack the car, but once you attack the car, it's also hard to, say, crash the car. But, you know, right now they're really focusing, they said, on the remote aspect. VALASEK: (Unintelligible) manufacturers have started doing this as well. They want you know, they assume that eventually they'll be attacked, so you want to make it hard for the attacker to do something after he's already in. FLATOW: But on the video I was watching of you, you were actually able to steer the car also. VALASEK: Yeah, absolutely. We had control over steering, braking, acceleration, lack of braking in the Ford's case. So we could really do just about anything that the car would do with our computer code. MILLER: Right, and it's quite scary. I was driving along, and Chris, you know, going maybe 40 miles an hour, and Chris would just yank - with the computer, he would tell the computer to turn left, and it would just yank the steering wheel right out of my hand and turn us left, you know, off the road. FLATOW: Wow, wow, let's go to the phones, 1-800-989-8255. Sam(ph) in Cincinnati, hi Sam, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. SAM: Hello, I had a quick question. Like a lot of people, when I heard the story I thought of \"Minority Report,\" where there were remote control cars, and the police were involved in stopping Tom Cruise's car. And I was wondering if you gentlemen had been approached by law enforcement regarding this issue. I'm sure they'd be giddy about the idea of being able to stop people's cars remotely. FLATOW: Interesting question. VALASEK: Yeah, so we actually have the functionality that we refer to as the car immobilizer. We can clamp the brakes of the Prius and it stops the car. Also even if you press the acceleration pedal, you still can't move. So we have that ability, but we haven't been approached by any law enforcement people. MILLER: I believe OnStar has that ability, as well, and actually work with law enforcement sometimes. FLATOW: Oh, they're stopping the car. Well there you go, Sam, it's already happening. SAM: Great, thank you. FLATOW: You're welcome, 1-800-98-8255 is our number. Let's go - keep going to the phones. Ben in Tarrytown, Hi Ben, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. BEN: Hey, how's it going? FLATOW: Hey there. BEN: Hey, I was just wondering if anyone ever stops your car, when the brakes are working, I mean, and you got into an accident, is there any evidence left behind that can be used to prove you innocent? VALASEK: Yeah, that's a question, the question of sort of forensics after the fact. And all of our attacks, there might be, if you did the remote aspect, there might some forensics there. But all of our attacks leave no trace at all. We're just sending messages that once they're received, they're acted on, and they're not stored anywhere. So yeah, you would - there wouldn't be any evidence that anything had happened with what we did. FLATOW: So there's no little black box that keeps track or recording of the signals being sent to the various brakes, wheels, things like that? VALASEK: No, when there's an error with one of the computers, those may be stored somewhere, but what we're doing is just kind of simulating what naturally happens in the car. So there's really no evidence that it ever occurred. FLATOW: So how do you take your research further from here? What do you want to do next? MILLER: Well, one of the things that we'd like to do is, as we said, get more researchers involved and get more eyes on this problem so that, you know, we can be safe in our cars. And the biggest obstacle to us and almost any researcher is you need a car to do this, and, you know, cars don't come cheap. So one of the things we're working on is trying to get some way to get all the computers out of a car and package them up in a way that maybe for a couple thousand dollars a researcher could, you know, buy this and do all the same research that we would have in our real car except, you know, they wouldn't have to actually buy a car. VALASEK: Yeah, you can buy - you can go on eBay and buy old, used computers from the cars from a salvage yard and be able to hook them all up and do the kind of same research we're doing right now, but you don't have to spend, $40,000 on cars. FLATOW: Could you not have a car simulator that you could put on your Mac or your PC instead of going to buy the guts of the car? MILLER: You could, but the problem is all the sort of interesting things happen in the very low-level proprietary things that are very manufacturer specific, and so you really need the actual computers, called ECUs, from the cars to know how to handle all these weird error conditions that we're taking advantage of. FLATOW: Is there any way for anybody to prevent this from happening, at least the wireless part, at the moment, or are you just, you know, you can't put the tin foil beanie over your car? VALASEK: No, no, there's no tin foil hat for the cars as of yet. So right now if you were to remotely compromise a car, you kind of have full remote access to it. That being said. . . MILLER: Yeah, yeah, so I mean that's one of the scary parts if there's not much you can do as a driver. So we really need to get the manufacturers to make changes to make the cars safer because as a user, you're just trusting that the cars are going to work in a safe fashion. FLATOW: Here's a tweet from David Henry(ph) who says: Does the fact that most cars run on proprietary software make them harder or easier to hack? VALASEK: I wouldn't say harder or easier. It's just a matter of time. You know, Charlie had a Ford, and I had the Toyota, and we both figured out all the messages that we really needed to make control. So it's not a matter of being difficult, it's just a matter of spending the hours, I think. MILLER: Right, and each, the Ford or the Toyota, the actually messages were completely different. FLATOW: Do you think it's just a matter of time until someone actually gets hacked, I mean, and we'll see an accident or some result of it? MILLER: I hope not. I mean, that's why we're doing this research now instead of waiting for someone to get hurt. Like we want to get things fixed now before there's a problem. I hope that this is never a problem for anybody. FLATOW: Well, I want to thank you guys for taking time to be with us, and good luck to you, and good luck at the meeting. What kind of response have you been getting? VALASEK: The people here seemed to think it was great. So we're happy about that. FLATOW: Yeah, OK, good to you, thanks again. MILLER: Thanks for having us. VALASEK: Thank you. FLATOW: You're welcome Charlie Miller, security engineer at Twitter; and Chris Valasek, director of security intelligence at IOActive. IRA FLATOW, HOST:  As I say, have you ever noticed how cars are becoming more computerized or smarter, like you can make a call through your steering wheel and have your car parallel park for you? You can even hit the brakes. It will even hit the brakes automatically to stop short of hitting that kid running after the beach ball in the street. And there are - and, of course, these are all controlled by computers. And where there are computers, there are hackers. Can someone hack into your car and take over those computers, perhaps for evil purposes? Yes, they can. My next guests hacked into a Ford Escape and a Toyota Prius to figure out their weaknesses and their - joining me now from the Def Con hacking conference in Las Vegas where they just stepped off the stage from presenting their results. Charlie Miller is a security engineer at Twitter, and Chris Valasek is director of security at IOActive. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. CHARLIE MILLER: Thanks for having us. FLATOW: Hey there. CHRIS VALASEK: Thanks, Ira. FLATOW: I was just watching the video of you guys hacking into a Prius in a parking lot. MILLER: Yeah. It's been a fun trip so far. FLATOW: How do you do that? How did you do that? MILLER: So if I really wanted to attack your previous guest's Prius, what I would want to do is two steps. The first step was I would have to remotely attack one of their, like you mentioned, the Bluetooth that allows your phone to talk to your car. So I would do - we need a remote attack first. And once I had compromised any piece of - any electronic on your car, then I would be able to send messages to the other computers in your car to make them do things. Our research focused on that second thing because the remote has actually already been done a couple of years ago by some other researchers. So for our research, we said let's suppose you already have a remote attack, what do can you do the car? And like you said, you can do a lot of crazy stuff like control the seatbelts, control the speedometer, honk the horn, yank the steering wheel, engage the brakes. You know, the possibilities are endless. VALASEK: And it's not going away anytime soon. More and more computers are being added to cars that do more and more things. The functionality really is going to be complete control by the computer network sometime in the near future. FLATOW: So you're going to be - like in these fighter jets, you don't fly the jet. You fly the computer, and the computer drives the car in this case. VALASEK: Yeah. I hope so. I mean one of the things that we didn't want out of this is to have car manufacturers stop putting these cool new gadgets in cars because we like that. We just want them to do it in a secure way. FLATOW: And so you're out there sort of to show them where the weaknesses are. VALASEK: Yeah, we'd like to point out that if someone were to remotely compromise your car, as Charlie talked about before, there's a lot of safety critical functionality that's computer controlled and can be forged when you're already on that network. So you don't want to people to, you know, be able to control these things, but no one's really talking much about it or releasing much information, and we figure we'd start doing that. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number, if you want to talk about hacking into your car. So you think you want to get the conversation going so we can be ready for when the day we need it? VALASEK: Exactly, so that was a big part of our research was to make sure we released everything in an open manner, and we're releasing a paper and all our code, and the hope is that other researchers will get involved, and we can all work together to make cars a lot safer than they are now. MILLER: But we want a lot of researchers to be able to repeat this work, and then we can all work together. FLATOW: So far we've talked about the Toyota. What about the Ford Escape? What did you find you could do with the Ford Escape? VALASEK: So similar things, but the Ford Escape we had did not have quite as sophisticated electronics as the Prius. So it limited the attacks that we could do. So on the Ford we could do things like speedometer, of course, odometer, GPS. We could make the lights all turn off. We could engage the brakes if you were stopped. And the scariest thing we could do is we could actually make the brakes not work if you were going slowly, so like five miles an hour or something. So you can imagine pulling into a parking spot or going to a crosswalk and, you know, the attack happens, now the brakes aren't working, and you're still driving, and there's nothing you could do. FLATOW: And how could, if someone really wanted to hack in, how could they get into the car without you noticing it or knowing about it? VALASEK: Yes, there's so much in the car, too, that is - communicates wirelessly. Cars have tire pressure monitoring systems that monitor the pressure of each individual tire. So that's a method you could get in. As you talked before about making a phone call from your steering wheel, you know, that's Bluetooth. The telematics unit, you know, your entertainment, infotainment systems, are now having Wi-Fi-enabled access points in the car. So there's more and more attack vectors the more technology that gets put into these things. MILLER: And also, another one is like the telemax unit, like OnStar, that you would have in your car. FLATOW: You could get in through OnStar? MILLER: I don't know if anyone's done that, but it's a theoretical way you could do that. VALASEK: Yeah. FLATOW: Wow, what about through you CD, the old-fashioned CD slot? Any way you could get in there? MILLER: Yeah, academics actually performed that attack in their research. So that's a very real possibility. VALASEK: In 2011 they had a CD that if you put it into the car stereo, it's - any other stereo it sounded like real music, but you put it into the car stereo of the car that they were looking at, and it actually exploited the radio, and then it was able to do the same kinds of things we were able to do inside the cars. FLATOW: This is really spooky. Hang around guys, we're going to take break, and we're going to come back and talk more with Charlie Miller, a security engineer at Twitter; and Chris Valasek, who is director of security at IOActive. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. You can tweet us with questions about security for your car @scifri, you can tweet us there, also on our website at sciencefriday. com. And we'll be back after this break, so stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY. We're talking this hour about hacking. My guests are security experts Charlie Miller, he's a security engineer at Twitter; Chris Valasek, he is director of security at IOActive. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. Did you gentlemen discover, were you surprised by how easily it was to do all these things? VALASEK: I wouldn't call it easy. It actually - we've been doing this research for 10 months now. So it's not like we stepped in the cares for a weekend and had complete control of them. It takes a lot of research and a lot of time to do the type of attacks that we did. MILLER: It wasn't easy, but I guess we were surprised at the amount of different things that we could actually accomplish. FLATOW: Yeah, getting in through the tire pressure valve mechanism. Wow. VALASEK: Yeah, that's not something we did, but again it's something that communicates with this computer network and has some kind of external existence on the car. So really anything that communicates with the outside could potentially be used as an attack vector. FLATOW: Now in Europe, Volkswagen hacker - took hackers to court who were going to release codes to cars like you did. What has been the response from Ford and Toyota to your dealings with their automobile? MILLER: So luckily Ford and Toyota did not take us to court, so that's good. But their response has basically been that they are focusing on the remote attack part of the equation, and they don't necessarily care about the second part of the equation, which is, you know, controlling the car from - you know, any one computer controlling all the rest of the computers. So obviously we're concerned with the entire safety of the car and security, so from - we think there should be a layered approach where, you know, not only is hard to attack the car, but once you attack the car, it's also hard to, say, crash the car. But, you know, right now they're really focusing, they said, on the remote aspect. VALASEK: (Unintelligible) manufacturers have started doing this as well. They want you know, they assume that eventually they'll be attacked, so you want to make it hard for the attacker to do something after he's already in. FLATOW: But on the video I was watching of you, you were actually able to steer the car also. VALASEK: Yeah, absolutely. We had control over steering, braking, acceleration, lack of braking in the Ford's case. So we could really do just about anything that the car would do with our computer code. MILLER: Right, and it's quite scary. I was driving along, and Chris, you know, going maybe 40 miles an hour, and Chris would just yank - with the computer, he would tell the computer to turn left, and it would just yank the steering wheel right out of my hand and turn us left, you know, off the road. FLATOW: Wow, wow, let's go to the phones, 1-800-989-8255. Sam(ph) in Cincinnati, hi Sam, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. SAM: Hello, I had a quick question. Like a lot of people, when I heard the story I thought of \"Minority Report,\" where there were remote control cars, and the police were involved in stopping Tom Cruise's car. And I was wondering if you gentlemen had been approached by law enforcement regarding this issue. I'm sure they'd be giddy about the idea of being able to stop people's cars remotely. FLATOW: Interesting question. VALASEK: Yeah, so we actually have the functionality that we refer to as the car immobilizer. We can clamp the brakes of the Prius and it stops the car. Also even if you press the acceleration pedal, you still can't move. So we have that ability, but we haven't been approached by any law enforcement people. MILLER: I believe OnStar has that ability, as well, and actually work with law enforcement sometimes. FLATOW: Oh, they're stopping the car. Well there you go, Sam, it's already happening. SAM: Great, thank you. FLATOW: You're welcome, 1-800-98-8255 is our number. Let's go - keep going to the phones. Ben in Tarrytown, Hi Ben, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. BEN: Hey, how's it going? FLATOW: Hey there. BEN: Hey, I was just wondering if anyone ever stops your car, when the brakes are working, I mean, and you got into an accident, is there any evidence left behind that can be used to prove you innocent? VALASEK: Yeah, that's a question, the question of sort of forensics after the fact. And all of our attacks, there might be, if you did the remote aspect, there might some forensics there. But all of our attacks leave no trace at all. We're just sending messages that once they're received, they're acted on, and they're not stored anywhere. So yeah, you would - there wouldn't be any evidence that anything had happened with what we did. FLATOW: So there's no little black box that keeps track or recording of the signals being sent to the various brakes, wheels, things like that? VALASEK: No, when there's an error with one of the computers, those may be stored somewhere, but what we're doing is just kind of simulating what naturally happens in the car. So there's really no evidence that it ever occurred. FLATOW: So how do you take your research further from here? What do you want to do next? MILLER: Well, one of the things that we'd like to do is, as we said, get more researchers involved and get more eyes on this problem so that, you know, we can be safe in our cars. And the biggest obstacle to us and almost any researcher is you need a car to do this, and, you know, cars don't come cheap. So one of the things we're working on is trying to get some way to get all the computers out of a car and package them up in a way that maybe for a couple thousand dollars a researcher could, you know, buy this and do all the same research that we would have in our real car except, you know, they wouldn't have to actually buy a car. VALASEK: Yeah, you can buy - you can go on eBay and buy old, used computers from the cars from a salvage yard and be able to hook them all up and do the kind of same research we're doing right now, but you don't have to spend, $40,000 on cars. FLATOW: Could you not have a car simulator that you could put on your Mac or your PC instead of going to buy the guts of the car? MILLER: You could, but the problem is all the sort of interesting things happen in the very low-level proprietary things that are very manufacturer specific, and so you really need the actual computers, called ECUs, from the cars to know how to handle all these weird error conditions that we're taking advantage of. FLATOW: Is there any way for anybody to prevent this from happening, at least the wireless part, at the moment, or are you just, you know, you can't put the tin foil beanie over your car? VALASEK: No, no, there's no tin foil hat for the cars as of yet. So right now if you were to remotely compromise a car, you kind of have full remote access to it. That being said. . . MILLER: Yeah, yeah, so I mean that's one of the scary parts if there's not much you can do as a driver. So we really need to get the manufacturers to make changes to make the cars safer because as a user, you're just trusting that the cars are going to work in a safe fashion. FLATOW: Here's a tweet from David Henry(ph) who says: Does the fact that most cars run on proprietary software make them harder or easier to hack? VALASEK: I wouldn't say harder or easier. It's just a matter of time. You know, Charlie had a Ford, and I had the Toyota, and we both figured out all the messages that we really needed to make control. So it's not a matter of being difficult, it's just a matter of spending the hours, I think. MILLER: Right, and each, the Ford or the Toyota, the actually messages were completely different. FLATOW: Do you think it's just a matter of time until someone actually gets hacked, I mean, and we'll see an accident or some result of it? MILLER: I hope not. I mean, that's why we're doing this research now instead of waiting for someone to get hurt. Like we want to get things fixed now before there's a problem. I hope that this is never a problem for anybody. FLATOW: Well, I want to thank you guys for taking time to be with us, and good luck to you, and good luck at the meeting. What kind of response have you been getting? VALASEK: The people here seemed to think it was great. So we're happy about that. FLATOW: Yeah, OK, good to you, thanks again.

I'm Ira Flatow. Google has joined the growing list of companies that want to help you watch TV shows and online videos at your own convenience by streaming the shows from your computer or your smartphone to your TV set. Google Chromecast is the latest device to help you do that, and they gave a very reasonable price of - about 35 bucks. How does it stack up to Roku, Apple TV and others? Here to tell us if Chromecast is a game changer is Larry Magid, syndicated columnist, blogger for the San Jose Mercury News, Forbes. com, CNet and Huffington Post and co-director of ConnectedSafe. org. Good to talk to you again, Larry. LARRY MAGID: Good to talk you, Ira. FLATOW: So is it everything it's supposed to do? Tell us what it does. MAGID: Well, I think it has great potential. What it does is you plug it into the HDMI port - that's the little port that's just about every high-definition TV has on it - and then you might have to plug it into a power source as well. And then when you tune in that HDMI channel on your TV, you then take your iPhone or your Android phone or your tablet or even a laptop, and you use that as your remote control to watch video. Now, right now, it's very limited in terms of what you can watch. They have Netflix, and they have Google's own YouTube, and they also have Google Play so you could rent or buy a movie or music on Google Play. But it does not have a vast array of channels that you could get on the other devices - Roku or the Apple TV, for example. But it does this very elegantly. Now, it doesn't come with a remote control, which is one of the reasons perhaps they were able to sell it for so little. But your smartphone or your tablet or whatever is a remote control. And what's particularly interesting about it, if you are not streaming the video from your device, you're actually going directly from your Wi-Fi connector, wherever that is in your house, to the Chromecast. Your device is simply your remote control. So once, for example, you start watching the video, you could then use your iPhone or your tablet or whatever to go do something else because it's streaming directly to the Chromecast. FLATOW: So far, it's not what they used to call the killer app, you know? MAGID: It has the potential, and here is why. Google, as we all know, is huge and has amazing outreach and can develop partnerships. If they can get millions of these things into people's homes at $35. . . FLATOW: Yeah. MAGID: . . . then you better believe the HBOs and the Hulus and the Amazons and everybody else are going to be lining up to sign up. And already, we're hearing reports - I just read today that Hulu wants to get on board. HBO said it's exploring getting on board. So once the content is there, once you have potentially hundreds of channels, then if I were the - if I were a cable company or a satellite company, I'd be very worried about Google taking over my market. FLATOW: So what do you do if you're Apple TV? Do you try to match the price of that, or how do you compete with that? MAGID: Right. I read that actually Apple TV just lowered the price to bid on the refurbished models. They're $99 out the door retail. I think you're going to have to compete with price, and I think you're going to also - and I'm sure Apple will do this - compete with service and quality. I mean Apple does do things that you can't do and may never be able to do on Chromecast, for example, being able to access your iTunes library. That's something that's somewhat unique to Apple for obvious reasons. And so Chromecast does have the potential of doing that with your Google Library, but I do think this is going to be a big horserace right now with Roku and Apple. And I think Amazon is going to get into the act, and we're going to probably see other players as well. FLATOW: Because Roku is not that much more expensive, isn't it? MAGID: You know, you can get a Roku for $50 or the one I have happens to be 99. It's got a few bells and whistles, but it has more than 100 channels. FLATOW: Right. MAGID: And it's also very easy to set up. It's hard to get much easier than a Roku. The only big difference between the Roku and the Chromecast from a setup standpoint is the Chromecast looks like a USB key. It plugs into the port directly, whereas with the Roku, you put in a cable and plug in, but not exactly brain surgery. FLATOW: And just well I got you. Let me ask a couple of other geeky, techie things. MAGID: Sure. FLATOW: How - Google just released the Nexus 7 tablet. MAGID: Yeah. FLATOW: How do you like that? MAGID: I do like it. I mean the resolution is quite good. I like the fact that it's thinner than the iPad Mini, and I have an iPad Mini. I was holding them hand right next to each other. And if you go to LarrysWorld. com, my main website, you can find a link to my Forbes review. I think it's a very competitive product, but, of course, Apple has got something in the drawing board. But again, this is going to be a huge horserace. But Google is definitely starting to catch up in the tablet wars. They have ways to go, but the Nexus 7 is a very good offering, especially if you like smaller tablets. FLATOW: And you also just got back from the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas. See anything interesting there? MAGID: Well, I saw a lot of hacking attempts or hacking demonstrations with phones, something called Mactans, where you have a rouge charger - you know at the airport you can go charge your phone. . . FLATOW: Right. MAGID: . . . you better take a close look at those chargers because if it's a Mactan charger, it can eject malware into your iPhone or iPad. Apple says they're going to fix this with the next release of the iOS. But another thing I saw breaking into home security systems and home door locks. A lot of people have these electronic pads now to unlock their doors so they can do it from an iPhone or from a P. C. and change the combination. FLATOW: Right. MAGID: Well, some of guys have shown how you can hack into those. So you may think you're secure with this electronic lock but not if the bad guys get a hold of what the good guys showed at the conference. As you know, Black Hat is all about demonstrating what could happen, hopefully, so things are fixed before criminals actually exploit them. FLATOW: Well, that's a good segue for us, Larry, because we're going to talk about the Def Con hacking conference in just a couple of minutes where people have been hacking into Prius, on these. . . MAGID: Absolutely. And I drive a Prius. I actually worry. (LAUGHTER)FLATOW: All right, Larry. Thanks for taking time to be with us today. MAGID: Thanks, Ira. FLATOW: Good to have you. Larry Magid, who has lots of hats, he's syndicated columnist, blogger for the San Jose Mercury News, Forbes. com, CNet, Huffington Post and co-director of ConnectSafety. org, a very interesting site for you and your kids.

Even though it hasn't yet been released to the public, there's already been a lot of controversy about Google Glass, which is like an eyeglass frame that has a very small, voice-activated mobile device with a camera. Some say it will open a new world of experience. Others see it as a major threat to privacy and civility. According to our linguist, Geoff Nunberg, your reaction is apt to depend on who's wearing the device: you or someone else. GEOFF NUNBERG, BYLINE: You and I can't buy Google Glass yet. It's only available to the select developers and opinion-makers who have been permitted to spring $1,500 for the privilege of having the first one on the block. But I've seen it around in my San Francisco neighborhood, among the young techies who commute down to the Google and Facebook in WiFi-equipped shuttle buses, or who pedal downtown to Zynga and Twitter on their fixies. You've probably seen pictures of one of these. It's an eyeglass frame with a camera and display tucked into the temple, and a tiny track pad and speaker in the earpiece.

Fred Armisen demoed Glass in a \"Weekend Update,\" segment on \"Saturday Night Live\" a couple of months ago in May, and he didn't have to exaggerate much - jerking and swiveling his neck to get it to boot and reboot, repeating voice commands over and over again, all the while marveling to Seth Meyers how simple and unobtrusive it was.

Over the centuries, each big technological advance has reduced the effort and imagination it takes to slip from one place to the other. There is no frigate like a tablet to take us lands away. And now there's Glass, which brings the here and now and the there and then to just a twitch of the eye apart. That's as close as they can get without somebody actually going in and rewiring your optic nerves. But the one thing we've learned in modern times is that when the here and now goes toe to toe with the there and then, it's invariably the here and now that gets hammered.

Even though it hasn't yet been released to the public, there's already been a lot of controversy about Google Glass, which is like an eyeglass frame that has a very small, voice-activated mobile device with a camera. Some say it will open a new world of experience. Others see it as a major threat to privacy and civility. According to our linguist, Geoff Nunberg, your reaction is apt to depend on who's wearing the device: you or someone else. GEOFF NUNBERG, BYLINE: You and I can't buy Google Glass yet. It's only available to the select developers and opinion-makers who have been permitted to spring $1,500 for the privilege of having the first one on the block.

I'm Melissa Block. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  And I'm Audie Cornish. Two companies that have advertised email services that would cloak users communications are shutting down. The government apparently thinks that one of these companies may have information relevant to an investigation. Lavabit was used by NSA leaker Edward Snowden. In a letter to users, Lavabit's founder said a legal battle with the U. S. government forced the closure. He said he was barred from describing the nature of the case. Hours later, a second encrypted email service, Silent Circle, closed down as well. Joining us now to help puzzle through what may have happened, NPR's Steven Henn. And Steve, first, just explain to us what an encrypted email service is. STEVE HENN, BYLINE: Sure. It's exactly what it sounds like. Lavabit was founded in hopes of offering an email service that didn't create a huge cache of personal communications that the government or maybe others could tap into and read. So all the messages held on its servers are encrypted. The thing is, because of how email is designed, many computer scientists say ultimately it's pretty much impossible to make email completely secure. Basically that has to do with the fact that people use different systems to connect. So if I send you an email from Lavabit but you have a Gmail account, that message has to be deciphered before you can read it. And at that point, my message isn't going to be protected. The government or someone else could be grabbed it. It's also possible that the government could use the courts to require a company like Lavabit to turn over its encryption keys and then use those keys to look at all my old archived messages. In fact, it was that fear that inspired this second company, Silent Circle, to shutter its own security email system yesterday. CORNISH: But, Steve, what's known about Edward Snowden's use of Lavabit. HENN: Not a lot. You know, we know he used a lot of that account to set up a press conference in Moscow in the airport last month, but we can't even know for certain if the legal case that led Lavabit's owners to close their business was related to Snowden's account. The court records are sealed and there's a gag order on thi case. CORNISH: And what has Lavabit said about why it shut down? HENN: Well, again, not much because of that gag order. But the owner, Ladar Levison, published an open letter yesterday saying that while he couldn't legally share with his users the events that led to his decision to close, he was going to appeal his case to the fourth circuit. The strong implication is that he decided to shut down his business that he's been running for 10 years, because he was forced to choose between complying with a government order he didn't believe in or closing. CORNISH: And did the closure of this second service, Silent Circle, have anything to do with Lavabit shutting down? HENN: Well, yes and no. Silent Circle offers a number of secure communication services, including encrypted instant messaging and voice over IP calls. And their clients include big oil companies, even parts of the U. S. intelligence community. Both the U. S. and British special forces use their services. Basically, executives there told me they could no longer promise that their email on their services were as secure as their other products. And they didn't want to risk their client information being captured, so they closed the service and destroyed all the archived emails. And this actuallt brings up another point. Folks at Silent Circles and actually the owner of Lavabit, both warned that this kind of government surveillance ultimately could undermine U. S. technology firms abroad. And the fear was echoed today in a report by the Information Technology Innovation Foundation. It estimated the NSA spying scandal could cost cloud computing companies more than 21 and $35 billion in lost international business just over the next few years.

I'm Ira Flatow. Have you ever wondered how a flea that is less than half an inch long can jump nearly 12 inches into the air? Or how a dragonfly can beat its wings 30 times a second? Now, before you swat them away next time, I want you to take a close look - and I mean a really close look - at their joints. The secret to these tiny athletes is a protein called resilin, and it's found in the hinges of many insects. And that highly elastic protein allows for a quick release of energy and a quick getaway. It's like snapping a rubber band. Can we harness that energy and efficiency of that resilient resilin? My next guest is researching just that. Kristi Kiick is a professor of material science and engineering and biomedical engineering at the University of Delaware in Newark, and she joins us from WHYY Wilmington. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. KRISTI KIICK: Thanks, Ira. I'm glad to be here. FLATOW: You're welcome. Where exactly do you find this natural resilin? KIICK: In nature, it's found in, as you mentioned, the various joints of insects. In our lab, we find it from E. coli, which is the way we produce it in the lab. FLATOW: So you're making a synthetic version of it? KIICK: Yes. FLATOW: Is that the right way? Or are you just reproducing the same stuff, but letting the E. coli make it? KIICK: So there's a couple of different ways that you can look at making resilin in the lab. We've been using molecular biology recombinant DNA methodologies to take the amino acid repeats in resilin that are thought to give resilin in nature all those excellent properties that you mentioned, and to repeat them multiple times. And then we can engineer in extra biological activity or degradation activity that we'd like into the materials for the particular applications that we're looking at. FLATOW: Now, is there anything as good in humans, as similar to resilin in humans? KIICK: The energy store in mammals is a protein called elastin. And if one looks at the properties of native elastin and resilin in insects, the natural resilin, their properties in terms of mechanical properties can be pretty similar. Their properties chemically are a fair bit different. When researchers have tried to look at engineering versions of the elastins versus the resilins, that's where - at least at this time - it looks like the resilin-based materials, synthetic, have improved resilience over that of some of the synthetic elastins. FLATOW: So that's a good way, a much better way of saying resilin beats out the elastin, no contest. KIICK: At least in the data that we have to date for the resilin-like peptides, that's true. FLATOW: So natural resilin is less rigid. It can stretch long distances. It's much, much better. KIICK: It's very stretchy, and the thing that makes it interesting for the particular applications that we're looking at - and I think that has captured the interest of scientists across the world - is not only its resilience, which is its ability to release energy after energy has been put into the material, but it's also the fact that it does respond over those high frequencies that you mentioned in the intro. So for particular applications where it'd be very useful to have things with a high-frequency energy feedback that would be useful for certain biomedical applications. FLATOW: In other words, something that can bend back and forth without breaking a lot of times, like, you know, if you have an insect flapping its wings, it's got to do that thousands and thousands of times before, you know, without snapping the hinges off. KIICK: Yeah, that's right. Millions and millions of times. FLATOW: Millions. And that's what's resilin can do, and where - I'm thinking of, like, where would that be useful in medicine? I guess your knee joints, something like that, or other places? KIICK: So, yeah, so maybe people who had resilin in their knees could suddenly become much better athletes. We've been looking not necessarily at applications like that, but applications such as cardiovascular engineering. Heart valves could be a potential application. And in our particular lab, we've been looking at materials that can be used to help heal vocal folds. FLATOW: Tell me a little bit more about that. KIICK: Yeah, so this is a collaboration between my labs and another lab at the University of Delaware and a lab at the University of Wisconsin. We've been looking at these high-frequency properties of resilin, and are wondering if that might not be useful to help heal damaged vocal folds. Vocal folds - you know, when I was a kid growing up, we often called them vocal chords, and I think many people do that. So I had this image in my head of like a little harp that would be - provide the sound of different pitches when one spoke. What is actually true is that the vocal folds are these two small - they're only millimeters in size - pieces of tissue that close together on one another and control the production of sound. So when those vocal folds get damaged, it causes a lot of problems in speech, which has a lot of implications for health, in human health. FLATOW: Have you had any success in using resilin for treatments of the vocal folds? KIICK: So, we're not quite that far in our research yet. So we've been interested in designing the biological activity of resilin, so to keep the structurally great properties that the natural protein has. And then to endow on that protein the properties that would allow it to bind to cells, that would allow cells to degrade it and remodel it. So we've gotten to the point where we've been making these materials, and we're looking now at injecting them in vivo in models to see how well they perform. FLATOW: You know, scientists are creating new - or repairing new structures. They make an underlying structure, and then they try to grow stem cells on top to make organs and things. Could resilin be used in any of those kinds of applications? KIICK: It's possible. So, some of the applications where elastomeric properties are useful - in particular, cardiovascular applications, or things around heart applications would be a particularly good target for resilin. We think that the resilin has perhaps a better fit with the high-frequency applications, but there's no reason that it couldn't also be used in these lower-frequency applications, as well. FLATOW: There was some mention in the literature talking about modified resilin with gold nanoparticles. Wow. How does that work? KIICK: So resilin has different properties in solution that allow it to bind to surfaces in different ways, depending on the conditions that the solution is under. So it can adopt different confirmations that can give it different properties. One of the things that's true of resilin - and it's observed in the cross-link structures - is that it's fluorescent. So when one can immobilize resilin on gold nanoparticles, it can allow control of light production, and to couple that with the gold nanoparticle, to act as a sensor for particular analytes in solution. FLATOW: You say it gives off light? Does it do that when it bends? Could you look at an insect and see it when it's flapping its wings there, giving off some light? KIICK: If you shine a light on an insect that excites the resilin in the right way, you could see the fluorescence. But to date, to my knowledge - that would be really cool if you could do that - but it doesn't light up when you bend it. I might have to think about how we could do that in the lab. FLATOW: All right. We've given you an assignment for the weekend. (LAUGHTER)KIICK: Don't tell my husband. FLATOW: Tell your husband. Well, no one's listening, so you don't have to worry about that. What about industrial purposes? You know, you have rubber, you have plastic. Somebody's going to say, well, you can make a tire out of it. It rolls, or something that's, you know, can be used in industrial purposes that vibrates a lot. Could you use resilin for that? KIICK: Right. So the mechanical properties of the resilins that have been made to date probably aren't strong enough to make a tire. And if you were to make a tire out of it right now, it would be a very expensive tire. So in thinking about the commercial applications for resilin, I think probably the best area to look initially is in some of the biomedical applications. But you could consider, if it were a small component of any of the larger type commercial products - say in a shoe or in a tire or in cosmetics - that it might have applications there, as well. But I think it's pretty early in the game to know if that's going to be true yet or not. FLATOW: What about vibration damping, you know what I'm saying? You put rubber in things to keep it from damping the vibration. Now it's going to vibrate a lot and stay strong.  Could you use it for something like that? KIICK: Yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely. FLATOW: You know, in computer parts, or a new cellphone part or something. You drop it on the floor, it's got resilin in it. And you could advertise: made with resilin on the. . . KIICK: It bounces right back up into your hand. (LAUGHTER)FLATOW: Exactly. Let's talk a little bit about biomedical engineering. As a biomedical engineer, do you often look to nature for inspiration? I mean, it's all over there, isn't it? KIICK: Yes, we do look to nature. We look to nature in a variety of different ways. In our particular labs, we're interested in understanding how materials that support cells and support their behavior can be engineered based on natural principles. So we look to resilin because of its mechanical properties. We also have research in various other types of peptide and polymer-based materials where we're interested in assembling and organizing the materials in ways that mimic how the proteins and polysaccharides that surround cells are already arranged. So there's a lot of inspiration there. In various other areas of bioengineering, people have looked at viruses for inspiration for carrying drugs, carrying DNA into cells. If you look at the interference-based coloring of butterfly wings, there's big inspiration there for photonic materials. So there's a lot of different ways that bioengineers look to nature to try to design new structures or new biomedical materials. So bioengineering itself is a really wide field, and where we play is mainly in the area of biomedical. FLATOW: Do you ever get together with insect folks, maybe, or somebody like Gail Wilson, somebody like that, and just schmooze about what might be good, fertile ground to look into? KIICK: You know, we haven't done that yet, so we've been really focusing on our interactions with cardiovascular biologists and vocal fold clinicians. But reaching out to the insect folks would be a great idea. FLATOW: You know, there's a great - there's an old book, \"Micro. \" You're familiar with Michael Crichton's last book, or he wrote part of it? KIICK: I'm familiar with it, although I haven't read it. FLATOW: Ah, but you should, because you'll get a lot of inspiration from that book. We're going to do that book as part of our book club coming up soon, I think, because it's such an interesting book. KIICK: Yeah. Excellent. FLATOW: Yeah. All about what's going on on the floor of the forest and all kinds of things, with the insects, and we'll get into that later. Thank you very much for taking time to be with us today. KIICK: Thanks, Ira. It was a pleasure. FLATOW: You're welcome. Kristi  Kiick is a professor of material science and engineering and biomedical engineering at the University of Delaware in Newark.

FLATOW: So you're making a synthetic version of it? KIICK: Yes. FLATOW: Is that the right way? Or are you just reproducing the same stuff, but letting the E. coli make it? KIICK: So there's a couple of different ways that you can look at making resilin in the lab. We've been using molecular biology recombinant DNA methodologies to take the amino acid repeats in resilin that are thought to give resilin in nature all those excellent properties that you mentioned, and to repeat them multiple times. And then we can engineer in extra biological activity or degradation activity that we'd like into the materials for the particular applications that we're looking at. FLATOW: Now, is there anything as good in humans, as similar to resilin in humans? KIICK: The energy store in mammals is a protein called elastin. And if one looks at the properties of native elastin and resilin in insects, the natural resilin, their properties in terms of mechanical properties can be pretty similar. Their properties chemically are a fair bit different. When researchers have tried to look at engineering versions of the elastins versus the resilins, that's where - at least at this time - it looks like the resilin-based materials, synthetic, have improved resilience over that of some of the synthetic elastins. FLATOW: So that's a good way, a much better way of saying resilin beats out the elastin, no contest. KIICK: At least in the data that we have to date for the resilin-like peptides, that's true. FLATOW: So natural resilin is less rigid. It can stretch long distances. It's much, much better. KIICK: It's very stretchy, and the thing that makes it interesting for the particular applications that we're looking at - and I think that has captured the interest of scientists across the world - is not only its resilience, which is its ability to release energy after energy has been put into the material, but it's also the fact that it does respond over those high frequencies that you mentioned in the intro. So for particular applications where it'd be very useful to have things with a high-frequency energy feedback that would be useful for certain biomedical applications. FLATOW: In other words, something that can bend back and forth without breaking a lot of times, like, you know, if you have an insect flapping its wings, it's got to do that thousands and thousands of times before, you know, without snapping the hinges off. KIICK: Yeah, that's right. Millions and millions of times. FLATOW: Millions. And that's what's resilin can do, and where - I'm thinking of, like, where would that be useful in medicine? I guess your knee joints, something like that, or other places? KIICK: So, yeah, so maybe people who had resilin in their knees could suddenly become much better athletes. We've been looking not necessarily at applications like that, but applications such as cardiovascular engineering. Heart valves could be a potential application. And in our particular lab, we've been looking at materials that can be used to help heal vocal folds. FLATOW: Tell me a little bit more about that. KIICK: Yeah, so this is a collaboration between my labs and another lab at the University of Delaware and a lab at the University of Wisconsin. We've been looking at these high-frequency properties of resilin, and are wondering if that might not be useful to help heal damaged vocal folds. Vocal folds - you know, when I was a kid growing up, we often called them vocal chords, and I think many people do that. So I had this image in my head of like a little harp that would be - provide the sound of different pitches when one spoke. What is actually true is that the vocal folds are these two small - they're only millimeters in size - pieces of tissue that close together on one another and control the production of sound. So when those vocal folds get damaged, it causes a lot of problems in speech, which has a lot of implications for health, in human health. FLATOW: Have you had any success in using resilin for treatments of the vocal folds? KIICK: So, we're not quite that far in our research yet. So we've been interested in designing the biological activity of resilin, so to keep the structurally great properties that the natural protein has. And then to endow on that protein the properties that would allow it to bind to cells, that would allow cells to degrade it and remodel it. So we've gotten to the point where we've been making these materials, and we're looking now at injecting them in vivo in models to see how well they perform. FLATOW: You know, scientists are creating new - or repairing new structures. They make an underlying structure, and then they try to grow stem cells on top to make organs and things. Could resilin be used in any of those kinds of applications? KIICK: It's possible. So, some of the applications where elastomeric properties are useful - in particular, cardiovascular applications, or things around heart applications would be a particularly good target for resilin. We think that the resilin has perhaps a better fit with the high-frequency applications, but there's no reason that it couldn't also be used in these lower-frequency applications, as well. FLATOW: There was some mention in the literature talking about modified resilin with gold nanoparticles. Wow. How does that work? KIICK: So resilin has different properties in solution that allow it to bind to surfaces in different ways, depending on the conditions that the solution is under. So it can adopt different confirmations that can give it different properties. One of the things that's true of resilin - and it's observed in the cross-link structures - is that it's fluorescent. So when one can immobilize resilin on gold nanoparticles, it can allow control of light production, and to couple that with the gold nanoparticle, to act as a sensor for particular analytes in solution. FLATOW: You say it gives off light? Does it do that when it bends? Could you look at an insect and see it when it's flapping its wings there, giving off some light? KIICK: If you shine a light on an insect that excites the resilin in the right way, you could see the fluorescence. But to date, to my knowledge - that would be really cool if you could do that - but it doesn't light up when you bend it. I might have to think about how we could do that in the lab. FLATOW: All right. We've given you an assignment for the weekend. (LAUGHTER) KIICK: Don't tell my husband. FLATOW: Tell your husband. Well, no one's listening, so you don't have to worry about that. What about industrial purposes? You know, you have rubber, you have plastic. Somebody's going to say, well, you can make a tire out of it. It rolls, or something that's, you know, can be used in industrial purposes that vibrates a lot. Could you use resilin for that? KIICK: Right. So the mechanical properties of the resilins that have been made to date probably aren't strong enough to make a tire. And if you were to make a tire out of it right now, it would be a very expensive tire. So in thinking about the commercial applications for resilin, I think probably the best area to look initially is in some of the biomedical applications. But you could consider, if it were a small component of any of the larger type commercial products - say in a shoe or in a tire or in cosmetics - that it might have applications there, as well. But I think it's pretty early in the game to know if that's going to be true yet or not. FLATOW: What about vibration damping, you know what I'm saying? You put rubber in things to keep it from damping the vibration. Now it's going to vibrate a lot and stay strong.  Could you use it for something like that? KIICK: Yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely. FLATOW: You know, in computer parts, or a new cellphone part or something. You drop it on the floor, it's got resilin in it. And you could advertise: made with resilin on the. . . KIICK: It bounces right back up into your hand. (LAUGHTER) FLATOW: Exactly. Let's talk a little bit about biomedical engineering. As a biomedical engineer, do you often look to nature for inspiration? I mean, it's all over there, isn't it? KIICK: Yes, we do look to nature. We look to nature in a variety of different ways. In our particular labs, we're interested in understanding how materials that support cells and support their behavior can be engineered based on natural principles. So we look to resilin because of its mechanical properties. We also have research in various other types of peptide and polymer-based materials where we're interested in assembling and organizing the materials in ways that mimic how the proteins and polysaccharides that surround cells are already arranged. So there's a lot of inspiration there. In various other areas of bioengineering, people have looked at viruses for inspiration for carrying drugs, carrying DNA into cells. If you look at the interference-based coloring of butterfly wings, there's big inspiration there for photonic materials. So there's a lot of different ways that bioengineers look to nature to try to design new structures or new biomedical materials. So bioengineering itself is a really wide field, and where we play is mainly in the area of biomedical. FLATOW: Do you ever get together with insect folks, maybe, or somebody like Gail Wilson, somebody like that, and just schmooze about what might be good, fertile ground to look into? KIICK: You know, we haven't done that yet, so we've been really focusing on our interactions with cardiovascular biologists and vocal fold clinicians. But reaching out to the insect folks would be a great idea. FLATOW: You know, there's a great - there's an old book, \"Micro. \" You're familiar with Michael Crichton's last book, or he wrote part of it? KIICK: I'm familiar with it, although I haven't read it. FLATOW: Ah, but you should, because you'll get a lot of inspiration from that book. We're going to do that book as part of our book club coming up soon, I think, because it's such an interesting book. KIICK: Yeah. Excellent. FLATOW: Yeah. All about what's going on on the floor of the forest and all kinds of things, with the insects, and we'll get into that later. Thank you very much for taking time to be with us today. KIICK: Thanks, Ira. It was a pleasure. FLATOW: You're welcome.

I'm Jacki Lyden. For over half a century, The Washington Post has been one of America's preeminent broadsheets, covering the power and politics of the nation's capital. It's won Pulitzers and attracted readers and, of course, woven itself into American history and culture with the Watergate scandal. (SOUNDBITE OF MOVIE, \"ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN\")JOHN MCMARTIN: (As foreign editor) Look, there are over 2,000 reporters in this town. Are there five on Watergate? Where did The Washington Post suddenly get the monopoly on wisdom? LYDEN: The legendary editor Ben Bradlee and the reporting of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein was popularized in the 1976 movie \"All The President's Men. \" The paper brought down a president, Richard Nixon. But times change. News has migrated from the page to computer screens to mobile phones. And The Washington Post isn't immune. This week, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos bought the paper for $250 million, and eight decades of Graham family ownership came to an end. [POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: Eugene Meyer acquired the newspaper in 1933; he was succeeded as publisher by his son-in-law Phil Graham, who after his death was followed by his wife and then his son. ] More changes ahead for everyone in the news business, from broadsheets to broadband and beyond. That's our cover story today: News we can use in the digital age. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: I don't really think it's a question of replacing newspapers. I think it's a convergence. LYDEN: That's Arianna Huffington, founder of the Huffington Post. We'll hear more from her later. Journalism looks different than it did 20 years ago, and it's not as if The Washington Post didn't see it coming. In 1992, Robert Kaiser was the managing editor of the paper. He was dispatched to a conference hosted by Apple in Japan, on the intersection of technology and the news. On the way home, he wrote a letter to The Post leadership. ROBERT KAISER: I wrote this memo by hand on a yellow pad, in the airplane - on the fanciest plane ride I've ever had in my life. The Washington Post was richer then; they could put the managing editor in first. LYDEN: Kaiser proposed two, concrete strategies going forward for a new digital Washington Post. KAISER: We should create the first electronic newspaper. The second proposal was to put all Post classified ads online. LYDEN: And The Post did just that. It created an online version of itself, but it just wasn't savvy enough. KAISER: We could've been Monster. We could've been Craigslist. We could have done all that stuff if we had been adventurous. But let me say, we get nervous when people tell me how prescient this was, and if only we'd listened to what Kaiser wrote, and stuff like that. That might literally be true, in some way. But the fact is because we were so big, so fat and so happy, and because everything seemed to be going our way, we were just in no frame of mind to take the big, adventurous steps that would've been required to really try to become pioneers in this realm. LYDEN: Instead, Craigslist took a huge bite out of ad revenues and thus, profits. And so, too, did new, digitally nimble news sources like the Huffington Post. In 2005, Arianna Huffington upended the traditional news model with something called aggregation. The Huffington Post collected stories and links from all corners of the Web, and put it on its own front page. HUFFINGTON: There was a real opportunity to bring together four different elements: blogging, which at the time, you may remember, was kind of dismissed as the - something that people who had no jobs were doing in their pajamas, in their parents' basements; elevate blogging, then combine it with curation, which really basically means aggregation but with a certain attitude, and with the emphasis being on bringing together the best of the Web on any subject; commenting - a lot of engagement; engagement was always at the heart of everything at the Huffington Post, you know, so that it wasn't just as talking to our readers but listening to them. And our comments were, from the beginning, pre-moderated so we could have a civil environment. And then gradually, as we started being more profitable and bringing in more investment, original reporting. So this was - sort of the four elements that we started with, and that we kept growing as HuffPost became bigger and we were able to have more resources. LYDEN: The approach was pilloried by old media, dismissed as a lightweight mash-up. HUFFINGTON: I think there were definitely many more naysayers than people who thought it would work. I remember one of our first reviews. I've kind of learned it by heart. On our first day, in the LA Weekly - said, the Huffington Post is an unsurvivable failure. It is the movie equivalent of \"Gigli,\" \"Heaven's Gate\" and \"Ishtar,\" all rolled into one. LYDEN: Another major objection to aggregating - papers thought their work - content they'd paid writers and editors to produce - was being hawked for free. HUFFINGTON: Aggregating, if done right - and we have constant trainings for our editors - if done within the fair use guidelines, is of tremendous benefit to the creators of the content because it brings them many more eyeballs, a lot more traffic, which they can monetize. We get, literally, hundreds of requests every day from newspapers and magazines to link to their stories. So linking is really part of the Internet economy. But I think we've moved beyond those early days, in terms of our understanding of platforms. LYDEN: Now, everyone, including The Washington Post, aggregates. But after just eight short years, that model may already be an outdated one. Along came BuzzFeed with a whole new model. JON STEINBERG: We're all about sharing all different kinds of content, whether that's lighthearted, social, emotional content; breaking scoops and news reporting; or branding content. Those are really the three categories of things that we do. And we view ourselves as a media company that's really social from the ground up. LYDEN: Jon Steinberg is the president of BuzzFeed. You might have seen BuzzFeed's top 10 lists, and that's exactly the point. STEINBERG: Everything we write has to be shareable. It has to be something that someone would want to pass along to another person. And we think that's a really high bar. As opposed to writing for a search engine or writing for a robot of some kind, the content has to be compelling and novel and interesting enough that a person is willing to pass it along to another person. LYDEN: BuzzFeed was developed by six people in a room in Chinatown, in Manhattan. Its founder, Jonah Peretti, was actually working for the Huffington Post at the time. Back to Jon Steinberg. STEINBERG: Jonah had this vision that having been a founder of the Huffington Post, the next big thing would be social. And much like Huffington Post arose during an era of search engines and Google being the dominant place people went to for news, that Facebook and like social platforms would evolve. I don't think we'd be where we are today were it not for Facebook and Twitter, StumbleUpon - and I think soon, emerging platforms like Snapchat and WhatsApp and things like that because that, for us, is the cable system of our era. You know, for us, these social platforms are the new cable system. And what we're seeing play out now is much like what we saw play out with television programming during the '80s. LYDEN: Now, BuzzFeed has a staff of 300 people. One hundred of them are reporters. STEINBERG: We've approached it from the bottom up. We started out as a toy, as something that was lightweight. And then as we saw more and more of an audience coming to us, we decided to move upstream because we saw so much of an opportunity for young people. Young people really have no media that is their own. You know, arts and leisure sections and real estate sections talking about expensive things doesn't really appeal to a younger generation whereas memes and Web culture is their culture. It's their rock music as opposed to the disco music from a prior generation. STEINBERG: And so with that audience, and having started out with the light entertainment stuff, we felt that we could be the place that they come to for their hard-hitting news and reporting. And, you know, our front-page traffic has grown substantially, pointing to the fact that now, people come to us during a moment of world affairs. LYDEN: Have you done demographic research on BuzzFeed? STEINBERG: Sixty percent of our audience is 18 to 34. That's perhaps the most pronounced demographic differentiation. When you look at television-viewing audiences now, the average network television viewer is late 40s or 50s. STEINBERG: You know, New York Times had an article on Monday about Fox News' median viewer being 65 years old. So our audience is inordinately young, compared to newspaper or television. LYDEN: But they don't have to pay a subscription fee, do they? They don't have to buy it the way that they would The New York Times or The Washington Post  - or for that matter, contribute to a local public radio station, if their conscience is to be absolved. STEINBERG: We just find that the economics of the Web allow us to thrive with a new kind of advertising model, and not be reliant on pay walls or subscriptions. We want the biggest possible audience. LYDEN: So I'd like to ask, when you tell stories, are you determining things editorially, or based on algorithms and searches? How do you identify? STEINBERG: Our organization under Ben Smith, our editor-in-chief, works like a traditional news organization in that reporters go after stories that they're interested in and are assigned by their editors. What's different is, we have a training program that's all around writing for the social Web. And we have a publishing system, a content management system - which is very different - that allows people to dynamically pull in and put together content. They publish what they want to write. And everything - or most things - hit some area of the site, whether that's the front page or a section. And then pieces only stay live, and only continue to be promoted, if they're being shared. And if they're not being shared, they either roll off the front page or roll off the section header. And they're just - they're there, but they don't get promoted. They - we don't give additional fuel to things that are not being shared. LYDEN: From paper and ink to printing presses, broadsheets to broadband, search engines to social media, change is the new normal. Steinberg thinks that The Washington Post is positioned, once again, to innovate. STEINBERG: I think that it gives them really a shot now to reinvent themselves in a lot of the things that I think about in terms of train tracks and distribution. Jeff Bezos and Amazon have some of the best. I mean, the Kindle platform is just one of the most powerful reading platforms in the world right now. And the fact that The Washington Post will theoretically have access to that, in some way - you know, blows my mind. LYDEN: As for the rest of us, stay tuned.

Libraries are, too. Sure, you could study and research there, but in the 1800s, British libraries also had gaming rooms as a way to lure patrons away from pubs. For our series on Public Libraries in America, NPR's Sami Yenigun reports that today, libraries are using video games to bring in young people. SAMI YENIGUN, BYLINE: There's a battle going down - at the public library. (SOUNDBITE OF SHOUTING)YENIGUN: It's a one-point game in the fourth quarter, only seconds left on the game clock. Huddled around a big screen in this small room at the Sollers Point Branch of the Baltimore County Public Library system, 10 or so teenagers are cheering on their joystick-wielding buddies. The ball is snapped, the kick is up. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SHOUTING)UNIDENTIFIED BOY: Ah, he got it. Yes. Yes. YENIGUN: No good. The kick is wide right, the crowd goes wild, trash talk is flying. Every Wednesday, battles like this one boil over. The weekly Xbox program for teens starts at 3:30 and ends at five. LIZ SLACK: Or if they're being really good and they want to stay longer and the next shift can take over, they can stay until about 5:30. YENIGUN: That's Liz Slack, librarian at the Sollers Point Branch. Today, the kids get to stay until 5:30. Video game programs like this one are in public libraries around the country. According to a study published in Library Journal last year, about 15 percent of libraries around the U. S. currently lend games for library cardholders to take home. But other research shows that gaming in the library is far more common, and teenagers game the most. Sandy Farmer is the manager of Central Youth Services for the Houston Public Library where there are four Wii U's, four Xboxes, several Nintendo DSIs, some iPads, seven PlayStations and a few big screen TVs. SANDY FARMER: It's a primary part of our service that we offer. And it results in a 15 to 20 percent increase in the circulation of books. YENIGUN: More video games in the library means more checking out of books. FARMER: The kids and the teens spend more time here. Families come. Their parents have things to do on the computers because a lot of our families don't have computer access at home, and Internet access at home. So, the kids have something to do. And while they're here they find out - uh - there's Superman. I can read Superman. YENIGUN: For some kids, reading about Superman in a video game can be more fruitful than reading about him in a book. Constance Steinkuehler is an associate professor at the University of Wisconsin who just finished a study called Game-based Learning. It looks at children and teenagers who don't like school but love games. CONSTANCE STEINKUEHLER: In some cases, you had struggling readers read text that was up to eight grades above their diagnosed reading level and reading it with perfect comprehension, all right? Because they were willing and able to bootstrap and fix their comprehension problems as they went through it. YENIGUN: Steinkuehler says the reason for this is simple. STEINKUEHLER: When you care, you actually persist in the face of challenges. YENIGUN: And while many have long looked at video games as a medium with little to no educational value, Steinkuehler says that even as far back as 10 or 15 years ago libraries saw games differently. STEINKUEHLER: Because they're so attuned to individuals' information-seeking patterns across diverse resources and how complex that can be, and because they're working with populations that are there out of interest or need, they're kind of naturally sort of understood the medium in a very interesting way. YENIGUN: At the New York Public Library system, the Arcade Program takes a deeper look into the medium. Kevin Winkler is director of Library Sites and Services. He describes something that's sounds a lot like a book club. KEVIN WINKLER: Gamers can come in, they can play games and they can also talk about them and engage in a kind of analytical discussion about them. Talk about the strategic methods for winning or concluding the games, and really sharing ideas and thoughts about how the games work, their structure and so forth. YENIGUN: But not every gaming program is educational, Winkler points to the Wii Fitness for Adults as an example. And not every game asks gamers to read big blocks of text, which is OK with Keri Adams, librarian at the Johnson Public Library in Hackensack, New Jersey. She welcomes all kinds of games, as long as they aren't rated M for Mature audiences. KERI ADAMS: They're fun, and I think there's a value to kids coming to the library and having fun, and having kind of a place where they can come and hang out with each other. There aren't a lot of safe places for teenagers can go, so I think it's important to give them that, even if it isn't, you know, the most educational experience. YENIGUN: Sandy Farmer, of the Houston Public Library, agrees. FARMER: I have a room full of teenage boys that are happy and the library is the coolest place they know. And video games are a part of that. YENIGUN: With a whole new generation of video game consoles on the horizon, librarians around the country are getting ready for a gaming upgrade.

Well, a team at Indiana University says you can predict election results just as well by mining Twitter for the names of candidates as you can by polling. They examined a sample of just over a half a billion tweets from August through October 2010. And joining us to talk about what they found, from New York, where the research was presented today to the American Sociological Association, is Fabio Rojas, associate professor of sociology at Indiana University. Welcome. FABIO ROJAS: Thank you very much. It's a pleasure to be here. SIEGEL: And you're saying that the candidates with the most buzz in the Twitter-verse also win at the ballot box? ROJAS: Roughly speaking, yes, more tweets does give you more votes. SIEGEL: Well, how well would all of those tweets have predicted congressional races in November 2010? ROJAS: So, for example, if you were to ask the question - does a candidate who gets 50 percent of the tweets about their congressional race get 50 percent more of the vote, then that predicts 404 out of 406 competitive races where you have a Republican running against a Democrat. SIEGEL: And does it predict the margin of victory pretty well? ROJAS: In many cases, it does. It tends to do very well when the race is very competitive. For example, there was one in Utah where, you know, somebody was getting about 47 percent of the vote and the Twitter share was about 45 percent of the vote. So a lot of the cases are within the margin of error of a traditional poll. The cases where the margin of error is big are cases where the race itself is not very competitive, where somebody's running against a very weak competitor. SIEGEL: That would probably describe about at least 300 of the 435 races for the House of Representatives. ROJAS: And there, once again, it does accurately predict the winner, but the margin of error tends to be a little bit larger. And what we suspect is happening is that when the race becomes so lopsided, people stop talking about the race and then the mentions of candidates on Twitter becomes very random and not so strongly correlated or tied with how people are going to vote. SIEGEL: Now, Professor Rojas, explain this. You were only searching for names, so the phrase I love Nancy Pelosi and the phrase don't let Nancy Pelosi destroy America would have counted equally as mentions of Nancy Pelosi. ROJAS: That is correct. That is one of the remarkable findings of this research, which is that the political sentiment or emotion of the tweet does not matter. It's just simply the raw share of tweets. So in other words, the more that people are paying attention to you, whether they like you or hate you, is the important forecaster of the final vote share. SIEGEL: Well, you think social media will supplant political polling in our time? ROJAS: I think political polls are going to remain useful. They've very valuable in specific cases. So, for example, if I'm interviewing a voter and I'd like to know more about them, a poll is a very good place to do that because we can ask the question directly, while we don't have as much information about people from social media unless they reveal it themselves through what they write. But this is going to transform the polling industry because what this shows is that anybody with a laptop computer can come up with the forecast of an election that may be on par or better as a traditional poll.

Always flying off to school or the mall in their own pod. Well, this week, Elon Musk, another kind of space man, is trying to bring that pod travel down to earth. He unveiled designs for a high-speed transit system called hyper-loop. He says it would whisk you from San Francisco to Los Angeles in 30 minutes. That means traveling at 700 miles per hour. So how does hyper-loop work and will it work. Our next guest is here to tell us just that. Tim de Chant is a senior digital editor at NOVA and he joins us from WGBH. Welcome to the show. TIM DE CHANT: Thanks for having me. LICHTMAN: Okay. So give us the real - this has been all the buzz this week. Give us the real deal. Could this work physically? CHANT: Physically it does seem to be possible. There might be some changes that need to be made, but by and large, people think that theoretically that this actually could work. LICHTMAN: Break it down. How would it work? CHANT: Well, he envisions two tubes running down Interstate 5 in California and those tubes would be sucked clear of most of their air. They would be lowered to one-one thousandth of an atmosphere of pressure and that would reduce wind resistance in the tunnel for the capsules that would travel through. And these capsules would be made of, in theory, probably some lightweight material and along the bottom, they'd have some skis that would kind of work like the air hockey part that he mentioned. So there would be a turbine compressor in the very front of these capsules that would feed the remaining oxygen in the tubes down through little holes in these skis, and that would create about half a millimeter to 1. 3 millimeters of lift and that would keep the capsules gliding down these tubes. And as you said, over 700 miles an hour. LICHTMAN: And so the pressure differential is actually the thing that's propelling them? CHANT: No. That's what some people were speculating early on. But, in fact, what's driving them is a linear motor. So linear electric motors work similar to standard electric motors except kind of they're cut open and laid flat. So what they would be doing is he'd assemble, I think, two and a half miles of linear motors to get the cars up to speed. And then, because of the low wind resistance in these tunnels, he's only need a booster linear motor about every 70 miles or so. LICHTMAN: I gotcha. So the pressure, getting rid of the air gets rid of drag. CHANT: Exactly. LICHTMAN: But you still have to push some air out of the way, right? What about heat from that process? CHANT: That's true, yeah. So one of the concerns is that these air cushions that they're running on are such high pressure in that there'd be so much friction there that you'd be generating a lot of heat. Now, Musk's solution is to use and advanced aerospace alloy called Inconel that they use in their SpaceX rockets. And he thinks this will deal with some of that heat. But it remains to be seen if the heat transfer from these skis to the rest of the structure could be dealt with in such a way that would keep the cabin comfortable for passengers. LICHTMAN: Yeah. I mean, speaking of that, I mean, 700 miles per hour seems pretty fast. Is he talking about having barf bags in the pods, too? CHANT: No word on that yet, but I'm sure you'd need them. The force would be up to half a G, depending on the turn and the acceleration. So that's quite a bit. LICHTMAN: I mean, I can't even envision what that's like. Are people's cheeks going to be flapping back? CHANT: I don't think it would be quite that much. I saw somewhere that half a G is about going 0 to 60 between 6 and 7 seconds so that's a reasonably fast car, but it's certainly not among the fastest cars today. LICHTMAN: And this is an old idea, actually. Is that right? CHANT: It is. Yeah. The hyper-loop, from what I see of it, is kind of a hybrid of three different approaches to high speed transit. The first obvious one is high-speed rail, which he's kind of pitting hyper-loop against. The other one is what's called a vactrain. So again, this idea of an evacuated tube where you have low air pressure and that would facilitate cars zipping through. And then, kind of a hybrid of two other ones. One's called a MagLev or the magnetic levitation trains and those are propelled by the linear motors that he's proposing in using in hyper-loop. And then also this air cushion idea where he's supporting the capsules on skis. That was actually first proposed by a French engineer back in the 1960s and the U. S. Department of Transportation experimented with these trains that were levitated on cushions of air and run down monorail type guide rails in the West, again, back in the 1960s and '70s. LICHTMAN: But this would go, I mean, almost double the speed, right, of any of these? CHANT: It would, yes. So right now, the current speed record for any kind of train is the Japanese MagLev and they've run that up to 311 miles an hour. LICHTMAN: And this around 700. CHANT: Yeah. He's actually saying that it could go up to 760 miles an hour, which one of the sources I spoke with was a little concerned about, because depending on the temperature of the air inside the tube, even though it's at very low pressure, the speed of sound is constant at different pressures. So depending on the temperature in that tube, 760 miles an hour may, in fact, exceed that and then you might be pushing kind of sonic waves in front or create a miniature sonic boom within the tunnel, which could probably wreak all sort of havoc. LICHTMAN: Wow. What was this about passengers carrying water in the pods? CHANT: So, yeah, I'm not sure if passengers would be carrying water, but I know the capsules would be, and he has an elaborate setup where he'd be using water to cool the skis and some of the other parts and then he would be storing the steam on the train or on the capsule and then they'd have swap that out when they got to the next station. So there's certainly some complicated logistics involved in keeping this running. LICHTMAN: Yeah, that's a lot of water, right, that would be. . . CHANT: It is, yeah. LICHTMAN: . . . wash - for swapping. CHANT: I don't remember off the top of my head how much there is, but it certainly would be a large amount that you would have to carry along, which, of course, would affect the efficiency of the system. LICHTMAN: Elon Musk, I think, described this as a sort of cost effective solution. What are people saying about that? CHANT: Pretty much universally people are saying that his estimates are very optimistic. He's saying about $6 billion he could get this thing built. But one of the biggest things that people have pointed out is that he only allocated $1 billion to acquiring land or leasing land for additional right of way for the tracks. So even though I-5 is a very straight freeway, there are going to be points where it's going to turn or it enters a city and the turns are too sharp even at the lower 300 mile an hour speeds he's proposing running there. So you'd need to have much more gradual turns. And to do that, you're going to have to buy land from somebody. And given how expensive it was for the California high speed rail, to purchase bits of land for their first section, I can't imagine he's going to be able to get away with it for a billion dollars. LICHTMAN: Well, let's go to the phones. Daniel in Ellensburg, Washington, welcome to Science Friday. DANIEL: Yes, thank you. I see one major drawback to the situation is things can go wrong because, you know, nothing's perfect. So you have a tube that's basically has the vacuum in it and something goes wrong, breaks down or even an earthquake, you're going to have to drain the whole system and, you know, get the people out. You can stations, you know, so far apart, you're still going to have, you know, something's going to happen between. LICHTMAN: Good point. What about that, Tim? How would you deal with maintenance? CHANT: That's correct. It's one of the things that he kind of glossed over a little bit. You know, I think he said that, oh, don't worry, the trains really can't get stuck and if there is a loss of pressure within the cabin, that they'll have oxygen masks and they'd figure out some way to rescue them. But it's not really clear how a capsule that's stuck, say, would get rescued. Or if there was a rupture - one of the bigger concerns from someone I spoke with was that if there is in fact a rupture on the line, you're going to be moving from one one-thousandth of an atmosphere of pressure to one atmosphere of pressure. And that's a really, really big difference. And so something going 700 miles an hour traveling into that would essentially be like hitting a brick wall. LICHTMAN: Oh, wow. I also read that the design only leaves a tiny, tiny amount of space between the skis and the tube wall, is that right? CHANT: Yes. LICHTMAN: Is that a problem? CHANT: Again, one of my sources, Dean Peterson, who's worked on super-conducting magnets and Maglev trains at Los Alamos National Laboratory, when I spoke with him about this, that was one of the things he raised, is that the half a millimeter to 1. 3 millimeters of lift that these air cushions would provide is a really tight tolerance. So you'd have to make sure that you're welds are incredibly precise and that your tubes are manufactured to a very exacting standard. If we want to. . . LICHTMAN: Is there - go ahead. CHANT: I was going to say, if we want to compare this to, say, what Maglev trains run at, generally they run between one centimeter and 10 centimeters of clearance from their track, which still sounds tight but it's obviously orders of magnitude more margin for error there. LICHTMAN: Has this conversation prompted anyone to step in, and do you get the sense that this is going to happen or could happen? CHANT: I get the sense that this very well could happen. A lot of people are very excited about this. And whether anyone actually steps up and does it, that's another matter. This is going to be very expensive to build, even on kind of a large scale prototype sort of situation. And so I think Elon Musk may find himself fulfilling his second partial promise in saying that, you know, maybe in five years he'll step in and build the full scale working prototype to show that it can be done. LICHTMAN: You know what's amazed me about this news, is just how interested the public seems to be in it. It's really captured people's imaginations. I mean, it sounds really cool but I think people also have gotten onboard. Have you noticed that? CHANT: Yes. I think it sparked a really interesting conversation. You know, a lot of times when you bring up high speed rail in this country, it kind of evokes a divisive mood in people. Some people are very much for it, others very much against it. And this, this is something that's kind of futuristicy(ph). And of course, Musk being a salesman knew that attaching a low price tag to it would help it get some traction in the media, I'm sure. And I think that - I think that people are really intrigued by the idea. Again, it's kind of that Jetsons sort of feel that you had in the introduction. And I think that's right. It's the concept of sitting down in a tube and then getting essentially shot down that tube and being hundreds of miles away in a half an hour. It's got very much the feel of the future about it. LICHTMAN: Yeah, it does. And he said it would be only for $20, right? CHANT: He did, although if you look closely at his - at the proposal that he put forth, the $20 I believe only recoups the initial capital costs, so the $6 billion that he put out there. So of course if it goes over cost,  you know, that projection's out the window. And the six billion is amortized over 20 years, so he's allowing himself two decades to get paid back for the $6 billion outlay. But what it doesn't include are things like maintenance or operational costs. LICHTMAN: Well, that's where we have to leave it. Thank you so much for joining us today. CHANT: Thanks for having me. LICHTMAN: Tim De Chant is senior digital editor at NOVA. FLORA LICHTMAN, HOST:  You remember the Jetson family from Orbit City, right? Always flying off to school or the mall in their own pod. Well, this week, Elon Musk, another kind of space man, is trying to bring that pod travel down to earth. He unveiled designs for a high-speed transit system called hyper-loop. He says it would whisk you from San Francisco to Los Angeles in 30 minutes. That means traveling at 700 miles per hour. So how does hyper-loop work and will it work. Our next guest is here to tell us just that. Tim de Chant is a senior digital editor at NOVA and he joins us from WGBH. Welcome to the show. TIM DE CHANT: Thanks for having me. LICHTMAN: Okay. So give us the real - this has been all the buzz this week. Give us the real deal. Could this work physically? CHANT: Physically it does seem to be possible. There might be some changes that need to be made, but by and large, people think that theoretically that this actually could work. LICHTMAN: Break it down. How would it work? CHANT: Well, he envisions two tubes running down Interstate 5 in California and those tubes would be sucked clear of most of their air. They would be lowered to one-one thousandth of an atmosphere of pressure and that would reduce wind resistance in the tunnel for the capsules that would travel through. And these capsules would be made of, in theory, probably some lightweight material and along the bottom, they'd have some skis that would kind of work like the air hockey part that he mentioned. So there would be a turbine compressor in the very front of these capsules that would feed the remaining oxygen in the tubes down through little holes in these skis, and that would create about half a millimeter to 1. 3 millimeters of lift and that would keep the capsules gliding down these tubes. And as you said, over 700 miles an hour. LICHTMAN: And so the pressure differential is actually the thing that's propelling them? CHANT: No. That's what some people were speculating early on.

He's associate professor at Purdue University and a faculty associate at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University. Rey, welcome. REY JUNCO: Thanks Celeste, great to be here. HEADLEE: First, explain what Twitteracy actually is. JUNCO: OK, well, how about I do that in 140 characters or less. HEADLEE: OK, if you can. JUNCO: OK, first, you know, let me go tweet it - no. Twitteracies are new social and academic skills being developed through the use of social media like Twitter. HEADLEE: Is that 140 characters or less, Rey? I can't count that in my head. JUNCO: I checked it. HEADLEE: OK. JUNCO: Yeah. Sorry I had that canned. It sounded like I probably did that right then but, yes, I cheated. HEADLEE: OK. JUNCO: Yeah, but - so I think about it in two ways. First, social media are just transforming traditional literacies. So take for instance, information literacy skills - the ability to like locate, evaluate, and effectively use information. That's been transformed through social media use. HEADLEE: Right. JUNCO: We now rely on the Internet for so much of our information needs and social media allow users to share information quickly, which can lead to a quick spread of incorrect information. So you just have to develop skills to evaluate these newer media, and unfortunately they get very little of that in school. The other part of that is that youth are developing new literacies by using social media through the process of informal learning. And so learning that isn't happening in the schools and formal educational settings. So, for instance, youth engage in constructing identity both online and off-line, but they play a lot with their identity online. For instance, their behaviors on social media like Facebook can help them understand the norms and mores of their peer group, not just on the site but off-line as well. HEADLEE: For better or worse, Rey. That can sometimes be a dangerous thing if, as you say, people are spreading misinformation or specifically, when it comes to literacy, have you seen some of the ways people spell on Facebook and Twitter? I mean, it's egregious. JUNCO: Well, you know, that's really interesting that you mention that, because there's research to show that quote-unquote text speak, is actually related to stronger reading and writing skills. HEADLEE: Wait, how is that possible? HEADLEE: That's the process, yeah. >>HEADLEE When you spell because as C-U-Z, that helps literacy? JUNCO: Yeah. HEADLEE: Maybe I'm an old fogey but that's going to be hard to sell on me. JUNCO: I know. You know, honestly, Celeste, I mean, I thought what you did until I saw some of the research and it's coming from a couple of independent researchers, so it's not, you know, coming out of the same lab or coming out of the same university, but there are strong links. I think there's an issue about how we process language. And the cognitive processing involved in language and so whether you're, you know, you can be - you know, we're primed to be fluent in any language from birth, right. . . HEADLEE: . . . Right. JUNCO: . . . And so you can be fluent in anything from English to sign language to Arabic to Spanish. Same kind of thing. I think that even just engaging in - and perhaps it's even like learning a second language, I hadn't thought about that before, but perhaps it is. HEADLEE: Well, then let me ask you about length. I mean, we were joking earlier about using 140 characters or less, there are many people who argue that something like Facebook or Twitter actually decreases young people's attention span for reading. That, you know, when they're getting all their information in these little bips, blips, and clips that they're not ready to read that multipage investigative report or even a long novel like Moby Dick. JUNCO: Right, well, to that I say two things. One, I've conducted research to show that that isn't the case. That students actually - they get a lot from putting their words in 140 characters. I think it forces them to be concise and to be very thoughtful about what they write. But another part of that is that, for better or worse, this is our society now. We have been thinking in news bites for a very long time and 140 characters for a very long time. I mean, you know, being in the biz, right, you know that you have to grab people's attention very early on with short statements. And so I think part of that is learning how to read the vast amounts of information that's basically thrown at them everyday through traditional and newer media. HEADLEE: So how does a teacher - maybe not in college but how does, say, a high school teacher use Twitter or Facebook to increase literacy? JUNCO: Yeah, well, I think first and foremost, educators and parents need to chill out a bit. There's this idea that social media use in K-12 will lead to kids being off track. . . HEADLEE: . . . Right. JUNCO: . . . Or distracted, or that educators will be stalking their students or worse. That's not what we're talking about here, and there's clearly evidence to show that you can use, for instance Twitter, in very educationally relevant ways. I'm talking about using social media in ways that are educationally relevant and lead to wonderful educational outcomes. So I think that educators can be exploring Twitter themselves and realizing the kinds of things that they learn from being on Twitter, from interacting on Twitter, learning about what it's like to use Twitter, and bringing that into the classroom with students and explicitly talking about this informal learning that's going on and asking them things like what they think of Twitter, how do they react to tweets, why do they post, why are they even on there. So basically, bringing the informal to the formal setting. And we know that thinking about, and engaging in, educational processes transfers. So if I'm good at learning about how, you know, the kinds of things I should post on Twitter and, you know, what kind of friend I can be because of learning how to interact on Twitter, then I can also really easily learn how to be a better student. So the processes really match up. HEADLEE: We've been speaking with Rey Junco, associate professor at Purdue University and a faculty associate at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University, about using Twitter to increase literacy. Not totally sold yet, Rey, but you're opening up my mind. JUNCO: Have me back, Celeste. I'll keep working on you. HEADLEE: Thanks, Rey. JUNCO: All right, take care. CELESTE HEADLEE, HOST:  People are tweeting about Al Jazeera America, it launches tomorrow I should mention, and if you are a Twitter person I would suggest you Google the word Twitteracy.

I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. Computers, smartphones and Internet use are part of our lives now, and we've become accustomed to stories of hacking, identity theft and cyber attacks. In his new book, our guest, technology writer Nate Anderson, takes us back to the early days of the Internet, when the freedom and anonymity the Web offered were new and we weren't sure what rules, if any, would apply to its use. Many thought the Internet was beyond government regulation and that its very chaos was a source of creativity and strength. Anderson's book shows how the opportunities the Web offered to snoops, scam artists, spammers and pornographers inevitably drew the attention of law enforcement, which had to try and master Internet technology to find and catch their targets. Nate Anderson is a senior editor at Ars Technica. His work has also been published in The Economist and Foreign Policy. His new book is called \"The Internet Police: How Crime Went Online and the Cops Followed. \" Well, Nate Anderson, welcome to FRESH AIR. Early in this book, you describe an attempt to establish an Internet haven. Back in the earlier days of the Internet, when a company wanted to be able to offer Internet services to anybody for any purpose pretty much, free of any government restriction - there's a fellow named Ryan Lackey. He picks a remarkable place to actually site the business. Do you want to tell us about this? NATE ANDERSON: So back in the 1990s and the early years of the 2000s, one of the great dreams of people associated with the Internet was this idea that this new invention, these new technologies that were now global, had basically done away with the old national political boundaries. And you see this most remarkably with the case of Sealand, which was this rusting fort in the North Sea a few miles off the coast of the United Kingdom in which some Americans went over there, brought some computers, got an Internet link established from out there, you know, in the water on this platform, and decided to offer hosting services to anyone in the world. So if your country said pornography was illegal, if your country said gambling was illegal, if your country said certain kinds of political speech was illegal, no problem. Come to us, we'll host it. And the idea was that no one could do anything about this, right? Anybody can access anything on the Internet. Once it's on there, you know, there is no possibility of control. And so this was an attempt to evade national law, and a lot of people believed at the time that these kinds of attempts could succeed. And it turns out they were wrong. DAVIES: Now, I want you to describe this. I mean people don't picture a fort being out in the middle of the ocean. Describe this place. It was called Fort Roughs, right, built, what, for World War II? ANDERSON: Roughs Tower, yes, it was built in World War II as a gunnery platform that was trying to take out Luftwaffe bombers coming in during the battle of Britain. And it was essentially a giant platform that stood out of the water on huge legs. Up on top the guns would go. There was a small sort of office, house place. But the men lived in the legs themselves, which were hollowed out, and as you can imagine were windowless and sometimes below the water line. So it could be a very creepy, claustrophobic place to be, and that's where these guys decided to try to set up this data haven that could basically write its own laws, even as it dumped this traffic on the global Internet. DAVIES: Right, so these guys would be, if this worked, would be living inside this 25-foot-wide concrete cylinder into the ocean with no windows, as you say. What were conditions in there like, you know, decades after it had been abandoned as a military use? ANDERSON: So it was heavily rusted. The tower had been - had a crazy history. It had been sort of taken over several times by pirate radio operators in the U. K. And the current family, who still controls it, had taken it several decades ago and managed to hang on to it. The reason that this place was chosen was because at the time it was taken, it was outside U. K. territorial waters, and so the claim has always been that it is essentially its own country and not under U. K. jurisdiction, even though it's just a few miles offshore, and you can easily get your supplies and things from the U. K. DAVIES: Alright, so this guy Ryan Lackey establishes this company. Was it HavenCo? Was that what it's called? ANDERSON: HavenCo, that's right. DAVIES: And there was this piece, I think in Wired magazine, in which the vision was laid out of what it was going to look like. Kind of describe a little bit what the plan was. ANDERSON: Well, the vision was fairly grandiose. It was going to be - you know, the legs of this tower were going to be filled with computer servers. They were going to be filled with an unbreathable gas, making it very difficult for saboteurs or anyone else to enter the tower. Your data would be totally safe. It was suppose to have high-speed Internet links, you know, back to the U. K. and to other points on the European continent. It was - you know, these guys had guns, they had a security force in case, you know, anybody came knocking on the door. It was really designed as kind of a fortress bunker out there in the sea that would simply be resistant to any attempt to take down, you know, your content. DAVIES: So Ryan Lackey, the guy with this vision to establish this Internet service physically free of any government regulation, he gets this platform, which was run by this fellow Roy Bates, who had been a pirate radio operator, had taken it by force. And there's this vision for, you know, nitrogen-filled chambers that hold all these servers and provide services to all kinds of people. What was the experience? What actually happened? ANDERSON: Well, the vision that they had was one of total freedom. And they found themselves - they thought they had a place that was not bound by law. They quickly learned, within a couple of years of attempting this experiment, that they actually wanted law because they got into a dispute with the Bates family, who controlled this tower. And in the end there was nothing they can do about it. I mean the flipside of going to a place without courts, without police, without the jurisdiction of a regular nation-state, is that there's no one to enforce this contract that you thought you had. And so the whole thing ended in acrimony, with Lackey and - leaving the tower, the Bates family taking control of what was there, and it also came out, you know, Lackey admitted that much of what had been said, especially in this Wired magazine article, was - I guess optimistic would be the nicest way to put it - it was done for PR purposes. It was done with a hope to this is where they could get someday. It was never a flourishing operation. It was always fairly small-scale. They tended to host a few online gambling sites, especially those that wanted to reach the lucrative U. S. market, where online gambling was illegal, and for a while they also hosted the government of Tibet's website, which had angered the Chinese. DAVIES: A lot of what your book tells us is that the reality is there is all kinds of illegal and harmful activity on the Internet, and thus law enforcement recognized that and took to fighting it on the Internet. You tell the story of some interesting investigations into child pornography rings, and one of them begins with videos in Australia. Tell us how that story started. ANDERSON: So one of the lessons that law enforcement learned was, you know, they weren't just going to throw up their hands and say, hey, that's right, you know, law is basically - doesn't apply anymore. And so it took them a while, but they did begin to learn how to do things on the Internet. One of the things they learned was the power of international cooperation over this new international medium. So this case that I profiled was, at the time of its takedown in 2009, was the largest such takedown the U. S. had ever conducted. It began back in Australia, where some police, during a raid, found a video depicting child pornography. They were able through the accents of the people involved, who were speaking in the video, to understand that it was Flemish or Belgian in some way, and they passed it to the Belgian police. From there it spawned something called Operation Koala, which became a massive, European-wide, you know, manhunt for people. They actually identified the person who was being abused. It was a father who was abusing his two children by taking them to a studio in the Ukraine, which had been set up for these kinds of activities. So they got the guy involved. They managed to get his email list of people who are interested in these kinds of videos he was producing. They kept all the European addresses and staged a massive raid over 20 countries, and they passed all the U. S. addresses to their counterparts here, where a wide variety of agencies got together to track these guys down, generating hundreds and hundreds of leads, and eventually a massive bust of people that showed them whole new chat rooms, whole new places where these kind of people hung out. DAVIES: In the book you describe this child pornography investigation and how it ended up resulting in the arrest of a lot of people. You describe one interesting character in Baltimore, a guy who'd run for mayor once before, and the arrest there. One of the things that you describe that authorities used in this investigation of Internet child pornography was that when arrests were made, they wouldn't just box up the computers and take them away, but while the suspect was there, would sometimes have the technicians going through the computers right then and there. The phrase was on-scene computer triage. Explain what that is. What was the point? ANDERSON: Right. Well, so the old technique was to go in and treat this as a normal crime scene, right. Don't contaminate the evidence. Be very careful. You know, unplug everything, shut it down, bag it up, tag it. Take it back to the lab. Go through it slowly, carefully, methodically to build your court case. And that works, but you lose a lot by doing it. For instance, when police might enter a house looking for somebody, that person might be on their computer and logged in to certain chat rooms or websites or communities right then, and if you shut down the computer, you might need passwords to boot it up again or to enter these communities again. So what they began doing - and this investigation was one of the first times this was widely deployed - was starting to look, right there - they would still box it all up and take it back to the forensic lab later. But you could learn things right away by spending an hour with the running computer right there, and especially if you could convince the person that you had just busted to give you passwords or to tell you things. And they would do this all the time. They would sometimes convince people that, hey, you know, we're going to break this one way or the other. You might as well just tell us. Maybe things will actually go easier for you when it comes to sentencing, et cetera. There were all sorts of techniques for getting information out of people. And it was remarkably successful. They would find new communities they didn't know existed. And if they had waited a month, those kind of communities would often get suspicious at a member's absence and shut them out. So it opened all sorts of new doors to new communities of child pornography, to immediately finding out these guys' friends and their connections with the outside world, and preserving evidence that might have been erased if they had shut down the computers. DAVIES: One of the interesting things about the description of this child pornography investigation is that, you know, one of the things that makes the Internet safe for this kind of criminal activity is its anonymity. I mean, people - you log on, you get this horrible stuff, but nobody knows who you are. But once the investigators get - nail somebody, then if they can get that person to give them their password, suddenly, the police enter the networks, taking advantage of the anonymity, and the other child pornographers think they're dealing with somebody they trust. In fact, they're dealing with a cop. It's a fascinating kind of reversal of anonymity working in favor of the criminals. ANDERSON: Yeah. It can be very difficult to know who you're dealing with online in any sort of real firm sense. And so - especially in these communities that don't want others to know that. They tend to operate just simply on these usernames. You know nothing about someone beyond this name you see on the screen. And so what police did in this case - and have continued to do in many other cases since - is when they bust somebody, they could get most of these guys to plead guilty. In this particular bust, despite how large it was, only one guy went to trial. Everyone else plead guilty. And as part of those deals, often what the government requested was that they turned over their passwords in these communities and their usernames, and then federal agents assumed those identities. And to the outsiders, you know, there's almost no way to tell that you're now dealing with a fed. So that encouraged a lot of paranoia and suspicion within these communities, especially when somebody would be gone for a few days, or maybe their tone or choice of words change after a while. Well, you think to yourself: Is that just normal, or am I suddenly - have we been infiltrated? Am I dealing with a cop? DAVIES: Right. So when this investigation ran its course, how big of a child pornography operation did it expose? ANDERSON: It varied over time. I believe when they finally shut down - this place was called the Cache, and when they finally shut down the Cache, I believe there were 500 people or so involved. But there had been a couple thousand a year or two earlier. They had - they had been spooked, in fact, by some action that the feds had taken, and many people had left. But I guess enough people didn't get the message and continued. And so there were mass arrests. Most people plead guilty, as I said. This one guy went to trial, and that meant that all of this information about how the government had, you know, infiltrated and exposed these guys came out then at trial and provided, you know, most of my data for reconstructing this really fascinating narrative about what had happened and how. DAVIES: We're speaking with Nate Anderson. He is a deputy editor of Ars Technica. His new book is called \"The Internet Police: How Crime Went Online, and the Cops Followed. \" We'll talk some more after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, our guest is Nate Anderson. He's a deputy editor for Ars Technica. He's written a new book about crime on the Internet and how police have gotten more active pursuing it. It's called \"The Internet Police. \"You have some interesting cases that you describe where folks were targeted, essentially spied upon, using their home computers. Do you want to give us an example on what, you know, what the impact was on these folks? ANDERSON: Yeah. So maybe I could talk about two different cases, because one of the key points that my book is making is that you really can't differentiate between good and bad techniques on the Internet. What you get are techniques, and they can be used by anyone, for any purpose. So one of the stories that I cover in the book involves a substitute teacher in Ohio who had purchased a stolen laptop from a student at her school. She claims she didn't know it was stolen. The police knock on her door a few days later, and they have in their hand pictures of her topless chats with her boyfriend at the time that they have printed out on sheets of paper. She is amazed. It turns out that the computers - which had been owned by the school district - had tracking software on them, and were accessed by an investigator who was looking for this one and happened to grab screenshots of what this woman was doing on her computer at the time, and he passed them to the local police, who showed up at her door, knocking on it, holding these things. And the whole experience really - at least in her telling in the court documents - really devastated her. It made her almost borderline paranoid about surveillance, about clicks on her phone, about - I mean, if people could do that, they could do almost anything, it seemed like. DAVIES: And, in this case, it was the police. The tracking software was there to help the school district recover stolen computers. This actually happened in a school district around Philadelphia recently. But why did the police then use that, rather than simply going and getting the stolen computer? Why would they then barge in and confront her with these embarrassing, though legal, pictures, and then they arrested her? ANDERSON: Well, that's a good question. And she sued the police department over this case, and it was settled privately. She was arrested for receiving stolen goods, but the prosecutor declined to move forward with the case. So my sense is that the police there knew they had overreached and tried to make this situation go away. You know, but what you see also is that hackers do the same thing. I mean, this technique has been around for years in hacking circles. And so I cover another story in the book of this guy out in California who turns out to be a disabled immigrant. He's in a wheelchair. He knows computers. He's been to some local community college classes and programming things. He becomes something of a hacker. He starts hacking into computers of young women all around California, and more broadly. By the end of - you know, by the time police arrest him, he has gotten his software installed on the machines of several hundred young women. He was able to watch the webcams on their computer. He was able to turn on the microphones in their computer, listen to what was happening in the rooms where these computers were. He was able to see what they were doing on their screens, on their computer, what websites they were visiting. And he could see every file on their computer, and he delighted in finding nude pictures that many of them kept on their machines. And he would then toy with his victims. He would show up on instant messaging networks knowing all sorts of things about them, having these pictures, and being able to tell them about conversations they thought they had had privately inside a room, that suddenly this random guy on the Internet knows about. It was absolutely unnerving to these young women, you know, this terrifying experience. But it's now the same kind of thing that the police do, that private organizations do. We know the FBI has this capability. A major scandal erupted a year or two ago in Germany, when it became clear that the German government was using this sort of technology. So, you know, you have this technique, and once it's out there, it can really be used for just about anything. And there's almost no way to say, you know, this is going to be used for good, and not for bad. It is kind of a free-for-all. DAVIES: Nate Anderson's book is \"The Internet Police: How Crime Went Online, and the Cops Followed. \"  He'll be back in the second half of the show. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. We're speaking with technology writer Nate Anderson, whose new book traces the growth of crime on the Internet and the increasingly sophisticated techniques law enforcement employs to fight it. Anderson is a senior editor at Ars Technica. His new book is called \"The Internet Police: How Crime Went Online, and the Cops Followed. \"Before the break, Anderson described some cases where hackers tapped into the home computers of women, using their webcams to spy on them and rifling their computer files for personal information and intimate photos. You describe how emotionally shattering it was for women to suddenly be confronted with these things they thought were private. But tell us a little bit about how that worked. I mean, is there technology that someone can easily get that will allow them to get inside and control somebody else's computer? ANDERSON: Absolutely. I mean, you do not have to be a quote-unquote \"hacker\" to do this anymore. In some research I did after writing the book, I spent some time in an entire Web community that exists around this practice, which they call ratting - R-A-T, remote administration tool. These are basically pieces of software that, once you can get them on someone else's computer, provides you total access to their machine, but surreptitiously. They don't know it's there. They don't know it's running. And. . . DAVIES: And you get them to install the software by what - enticing them to open an email or something? ANDERSON: You can do that. You can approach them on instant messaging, pretending to be a friend of theirs. You can put fake, you know, songs out there to pop music on peer-to-peer file sharing networks that then people download thinking they're getting a song, turns out to be one of these files. One of the things these guys do is spend a lot of time sharing their techniques for how they spread this stuff widely, how you pick up quote-unquote \"slaves,\" which is what they refer to the people who install their software. DAVIES: This is just so creepy. I mean, if you have, you know, one of these major antiviral, you know, protection systems for your computer, are you protected against things like this? ANDERSON: All of the major antivirus, anti-malware systems now do look for these sorts of toolkits - these remote administration tools. But, you know, they're tweaked all the time for the purpose of avoiding these things. So it's hard to say for certain that any given implementation of one of these is going to be caught by, you know, any given tool that you might have, especially if your antivirus software is out of date or a bit older. DAVIES: You know, in the cases the book, where you describe these women being targeted by someone who had taken control of their computer, and then looked through their photos and watched them through the webcam, you know, the police - we know about this because the police investigated and found some of the people that were engaged in this activity. Are they doing a lot of that, and should we feel good about that? It's sort of puzzling, because you don't want the police spying on you, and yet, on the other hand, you want the police protecting us, you know, from people peering into our lives. ANDERSON: Yeah. The FBI has essentially coined a term related to this activity that they call sextortion, because most of these cases turn out to involve these guys will watch usually women, but I have seen a couple of cases involving men or even boys. And once you either get access to their computers, you can get them to give you nude the photos and things, and then you can start blackmailing them and get them to do more and more things for you. And, yeah, it's kind of depressingly common, and it's now - you see busts related to this activity with some frequency. I wouldn't say it's an epidemic, but, you know, if you visit some of these communities and you see people just sharing images of these people that they're spying on from all over the world, no idea they're being watched, you know, it's deeply creepy. And, you know, I just think it's worth knowing that this is a possibility on your machine. I mean, many people are not aware that something like that is even possible. But it's hard to quantify just how much something like that happens. DAVIES: And before we leave this subject, is there any way you can protect yourselves? I mean, should you turn off your computer? Should you - I don't know, anything you can do? ANDERSON: Yeah. There's a couple of things. Running a good anti-malware, antivirus program will help catch many of these. You know, don't download dodgy files on peer-to-peer networks. Don't accept, you know, files from people you don't know over instant messaging. And get a computer that has a light, you know, hardwired to your webcam. Many computers do now. And if they webcam is ever activated, a small light next to it will go on. That usually cannot be bypassed. So those kinds of techniques can at least let you know, you know, when it's happening. DAVIES: You know, a lot of your book deals with serious and troubling stuff like, you know, kiddy porn and extortion and identity theft. You also write about spam, which kind of most of us think of as, you know, a nuisance. Why is spam serious enough for the FBI to get involved in? ANDERSON: Well, it's more than just a nuisance, because most of the spam you get, you may not want it, but the products that it's selling are often or even usually are fraudulent, as well. So in addition to being unwanted, you're often dealing with a fraudulent situation. So you will find that the kingpins behind spam can often be making substantial incomes from this activity. I mean, you might find it hard to believe that anyone would click on one of these emails and give their credit card information to the website that comes up, but it happens all the time. Because spam is so prevalent, you need such a small success rate - I mean, in the . 1 percent or less - and you can still make real money. DAVIES: You do write about a fascinating case involving one, you know, mega-spammer, a guy who the FBI nailed when he went to a conference in Las Vegas. Tell us about him and how big his operation was. ANDERSON: So this case is fascinating, because it shows another one of the key ways that cops have learned to operate online. You know, a lot of spam and some of these other online ills originates now from Eastern Europe and Russia. And Russia famously does not extradite its citizens. It doesn't matter why. And they often show less interest in prosecuting some of these cases, as well. So one of the lessons that the U. S. has learned is if we find somebody who appears to be kingpin, they appear to be in Russia, what are we going to do? We are going to wait. Eventually, they're going to come to a friendly country. They're going to fly through a friendly country or they're going to come to the U. S. for some reason, and when they do, we're going to grab them. So, in this case, this is guy, Oleg Nikolaenko. He's 23, 24, a young Russian guy, had started becoming a major spammer. He had a botnet, which essentially means he controlled hundreds of thousands of people's private computers around the world by installing small software on them that could then send out spam from their machines, making it hard to block, because it came from, you know, 200,000 different places, not one. DAVIES: Whose owners had no idea they were part of a spam network. ANDERSON: No idea their computer is in the background sending out these messages for this guy in Russia. So he runs this botnet, spammers pay him to deliver their message. He's a distributor. He doesn't write the spam. He doesn't send out the herbal supplements. You know, he just distributes messages, makes a ton of money. He also loves cars. So the FBI out of Milwaukee is investigating this guy, and they wait until he comes to the U. S. to visit an auto show in Las Vegas. And as soon as he crosses, you know, U. S. Passport Control - I believe he touched down on JFK on his way there - they know about it. They find out where he's staying. They call the FBI team in Las Vegas, and they arrest the guy in his hotel room. So he thinks he's coming to the U. S. for, like, this three-day, you know, car show, from Russia. He ends up, like, two days later sitting in a jail cell in Milwaukee, where he stays for more than a year. DAVIES: And how big was his operation, and how much money was he making? ANDERSON: So, at his height, this guy was estimated to be controlling more than 500,000 machines, which he would use to send his spam. This was, you know, at its height, probably the largest botnet in the world for while. It may have accounted for up to 30 percent or so of all the spam in the world. And we know from the records of this investigation that eventually came out that he made $464,000 in 2007, and that was just in six months. And that was apparently just from one client, and he had multiple clients. So this guy, who is like 23, 24, is making serious, serious money. DAVIES: Nate Anderson's book is called \"The Internet Police. \" We'll talk more after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, we're speaking with writer Nate Anderson. His new book is called \"The Internet Police: How Crime Went Online, and the Cops Followed. \"You also write about how easy it was for you to buy heroin or ecstasy over the Internet at a site that was called Silk Road. And what's interesting about this was that you said that they were able to do this with impunity because of a multilevel encryption system - if I have this right - that was essentially developed by the U. S. government? Is that right? ANDERSON: That's right. The basic technology that protects this site and other sites like it is called Tor. It used to stand for The Onion Router. Now it's just a word on its own. But it essentially involves a system which, you know, your traffic is passed through layers of different computers, passed from one to the next to the next to the next to the next, until finally, the last computer in the chain dumps it back onto the public Internet. And by that time, it is supposed to be essentially untraceable, mixed in with all this other traffic passing through the Tor network, and there should be, you know, no way to trace it back to you. Now, this is really useful if, for instance, you know, you are a diplomat or, you know, a military officer or something stationed in a foreign country, and you need secure communications back to the U. S. , or if you're an the FBI or a DEA agent here in the U. S. and you need to, you know, pretend to be a drug dealer or something online, you need to disguise where your computer is, where you're coming from. So this tool had all sorts of uses. But it is now developed privately, and while it's still used by the military and by others, it is also used by plenty of people to host child photography, is one popular one. But then the new thing is these drug markets. Silk Road is the best-known. It's still around. It's been operating for a couple of years with apparently almost total impunity. And it enables - it's like Amazon, but for drugs. You can find hundreds of sellers from all over the world who will mail you just about anything. And you can leave feedback on them, how their product was, how their service was. It's quite a remarkable thing. And the guy who runs it has some of these - you know, he's a libertarian, with strong ideas about freedom, who goes by the name Dread Pirate Roberts. And we know the government is after him, but, I mean, in a testament to how well the software works, they haven't caught him yet. DAVIES: OK. But if this was developed by the government, how does it get into the hands of all these other folks? ANDERSON: So the U. S. government - the Navy, actually, did the preliminary research on what is known as Onion Routing, the basic technique that is used here. But the actual software is developed now by a foundation, the Tor Project. And they receive money from all sorts of governments, government agencies, even some Christian groups. Because the thing about these tools, as I've said before, is you can never to limit them to certain uses you think are good or that you think are bad. And so this tool in particular provides, you know, an incredible encryption for people who need to bypass surveillance. Well, that can mean criminals, but it can also mean political dissidents. It can mean religious, you know, dissidents in countries where, you know, freedom of religion is not accepted. It can mean all sorts of uses that one branch of the government - say, the State Department - might say are good, but another branch might - like the FBI - might see things being used in it that are bad. But they don't - but nobody wants it shut down. DAVIES: Yeah. You make the point that, you know, the State Department, I think Hillary Clinton and some others have said that you need this kind of technology for secure, anonymous communication. I mean, people in Mexico who want to be able to communicate without being discovered by, you know, drug cartels, political dissidents. And so, in some respects, it's government policy to permit this kind of communication, to encourage and enable it. ANDERSON: Right. And I think it shows you that, you know, speaking of the government is often not a helpful thing to do when it's that, you know, as broad as the U. S. government. There are so many competing interests. So, yes, state has been a huge backer of these programs. They've traveled, especially in Eastern Europe, they've stirred up quite a bit of controversy by going over there and teaching activists and dissidents how to use tools like Tor to avoid state surveillance. But those exact same tools can avoid state surveillance here in the U. S. , whether it's by the FBI looking for drug dealers or child pornographers, whether it's the NSA looking for terrorists, you know, there's just no way to limit the sort of technology in the way the government would prefer to do. And so what you have in this very strange situation where some aspects of the government are encouraging the same sorts of tools that other aspects of the government aren't very happy about. DAVIES: Is - you know, I guess this is what we have an Executive Branch for, to kind of look at these conflicting policy goals and methods and make some wise decisions about, you know, what we want to do. Is there any attempt to sort of, I don't know, mediate and get an overall policy that makes sense? ANDERSON: Well, I think U. S. policy on this is very widely - back in the 1990s we famously tried to control encryption and anybody exporting strong crypto, as it was called, was under all sorts of restrictions. They couldn't send it to all sorts of different countries. And eventually, we realized that wasn't going to work. I mean, these guys who dreamed about the Internet being global and breaking down geographic barriers, you know, may have had a limited vision but they weren't totally wrong either. And so what the U. S. found was we were essentially just putting ourselves at a disadvantage because other companies on Earth weren't abiding by these rules. They were selling products with strong crypto. So what customers around the world said was, hey, why are we going to buy from the U. S. ? And I think it's the same sort of backlash you're already seeing around some of this - the NSA revelations. Countries are - and companies around the world and even individuals are saying, you know, hey, I don't know that we trust these U. S. Internet companies anymore. And in the '90s the NSA actually backed down from this position and we kind of gave up on trying to control encryption. And I think things have maybe swung back the other way since then. DAVIES: You know, you mentioned the National Security Administration revelations recently, and I guess a lot of that broke after you'd probably finished the book. What's your take on all of these revelations about, you know, the surveillance of both, you know, telephone or other electronic communication? Do we need reforms? Does this tell us - what does it tell us? ANDERSON: Well, I think it tells us a couple of things. One, is it tells us exactly what electronic surveillance in the Internet age looks like when the gloves come off. I mean, the NSA operates under certain restrictions, clearly. It is not totally indiscriminate surveillance. But, you know, the rules are far, far different and much, much looser than anything that is legally allowed to happen domestically. So my book basically looks at how local police, how the FBI and how international policing, you know, handle these things. But they operate under a very different framework. And what you see with these NSA revelations is just how incredible are the data trails we leave. How, with relative ease, they can be scooped up, put back together, dumped into massive databases. And I think the lesson is that the Internet, which was supposed to be this tool of incredible freedom, of anonymous communication, providing a publishing platform to everyone, has sort of at the same time provided one of the most amazing electronic surveillance platforms the world has ever known. DAVIES: There's a lot of discussion now about new regulations on the NSA, about changes in the FISA court, about independent review of what these government agencies do. I mean, what's your take? Is that needed? Do you have a view on it? ANDERSON: I think one of the things that the NSA revelations are going to finally do is open people's eyes to just how dramatic this sort of surveillance looks like in practice. It's one thing to talk about electronic surveillance and it's another thing to really understand just how wide-ranging the Net can be when you have computers scooping up data from fiber optics taps, when you get every phone call made by everyone in the U. S. You know, we're going - the NSA is going to look a lot more like some of these hackers in the book who are operating without many rules. And I think that has already made people uncomfortable. So my sense is we're going to see some rule changes intended to promote greater comfort in this. Even President Obama has indicated those are in progress. You know, whether that is going to satisfy the critics of what's been going on, I think will really depend on the strength of the public reaction, you know, to mobilize a bipartisan agreement in Congress. DAVIES: Well, Nate Anderson, it's been really interesting. Thanks so much for spending some time with us. ANDERSON: Thanks for having me. DAVIES: Nate Anderson's new book is \"The Internet Police: How Crime Went Online and the Cops Followed. \" Coming up, jazz critic Kevin Whitehead reviews some recordings of the English saxophone trio S. O. S. This is FRESH AIR. DAVE DAVIES, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. Computers, smartphones and Internet use are part of our lives now, and we've become accustomed to stories of hacking, identity theft and cyber attacks. In his new book, our guest, technology writer Nate Anderson, takes us back to the early days of the Internet, when the freedom and anonymity the Web offered were new and we weren't sure what rules, if any, would apply to its use. Many thought the Internet was beyond government regulation and that its very chaos was a source of creativity and strength. Anderson's book shows how the opportunities the Web offered to snoops, scam artists, spammers and pornographers inevitably drew the attention of law enforcement, which had to try and master Internet technology to find and catch their targets. Nate Anderson is a senior editor at Ars Technica. His work has also been published in The Economist and Foreign Policy. His new book is called \"The Internet Police: How Crime Went Online and the Cops Followed. \" Well, Nate Anderson, welcome to FRESH AIR. Early in this book, you describe an attempt to establish an Internet haven. Back in the earlier days of the Internet, when a company wanted to be able to offer Internet services to anybody for any purpose pretty much, free of any government restriction - there's a fellow named Ryan Lackey. He picks a remarkable place to actually site the business. Do you want to tell us about this? NATE ANDERSON: So back in the 1990s and the early years of the 2000s, one of the great dreams of people associated with the Internet was this idea that this new invention, these new technologies that were now global, had basically done away with the old national political boundaries. And you see this most remarkably with the case of Sealand, which was this rusting fort in the North Sea a few miles off the coast of the United Kingdom in which some Americans went over there, brought some computers, got an Internet link established from out there, you know, in the water on this platform, and decided to offer hosting services to anyone in the world. So if your country said pornography was illegal, if your country said gambling was illegal, if your country said certain kinds of political speech was illegal, no problem. Come to us, we'll host it. And the idea was that no one could do anything about this, right? Anybody can access anything on the Internet. Once it's on there, you know, there is no possibility of control. And so this was an attempt to evade national law, and a lot of people believed at the time that these kinds of attempts could succeed. And it turns out they were wrong. DAVIES: Now, I want you to describe this. I mean people don't picture a fort being out in the middle of the ocean. Describe this place. It was called Fort Roughs, right, built, what, for World War II? ANDERSON: Roughs Tower, yes, it was built in World War II as a gunnery platform that was trying to take out Luftwaffe bombers coming in during the battle of Britain. And it was essentially a giant platform that stood out of the water on huge legs. Up on top the guns would go. There was a small sort of office, house place. But the men lived in the legs themselves, which were hollowed out, and as you can imagine were windowless and sometimes below the water line. So it could be a very creepy, claustrophobic place to be, and that's where these guys decided to try to set up this data haven that could basically write its own laws, even as it dumped this traffic on the global Internet. DAVIES: Right, so these guys would be, if this worked, would be living inside this 25-foot-wide concrete cylinder into the ocean with no windows, as you say. What were conditions in there like, you know, decades after it had been abandoned as a military use? ANDERSON: So it was heavily rusted. The tower had been - had a crazy history. It had been sort of taken over several times by pirate radio operators in the U. K. And the current family, who still controls it, had taken it several decades ago and managed to hang on to it. The reason that this place was chosen was because at the time it was taken, it was outside U. K. territorial waters, and so the claim has always been that it is essentially its own country and not under U. K. jurisdiction, even though it's just a few miles offshore, and you can easily get your supplies and things from the U. K. DAVIES: Alright, so this guy Ryan Lackey establishes this company. Was it HavenCo? Was that what it's called? ANDERSON: HavenCo, that's right. DAVIES: And there was this piece, I think in Wired magazine, in which the vision was laid out of what it was going to look like. Kind of describe a little bit what the plan was. ANDERSON: Well, the vision was fairly grandiose. It was going to be - you know, the legs of this tower were going to be filled with computer servers. They were going to be filled with an unbreathable gas, making it very difficult for saboteurs or anyone else to enter the tower. Your data would be totally safe. It was suppose to have high-speed Internet links, you know, back to the U. K. and to other points on the European continent. It was - you know, these guys had guns, they had a security force in case, you know, anybody came knocking on the door. It was really designed as kind of a fortress bunker out there in the sea that would simply be resistant to any attempt to take down, you know, your content. DAVIES: So Ryan Lackey, the guy with this vision to establish this Internet service physically free of any government regulation, he gets this platform, which was run by this fellow Roy Bates, who had been a pirate radio operator, had taken it by force. And there's this vision for, you know, nitrogen-filled chambers that hold all these servers and provide services to all kinds of people. What was the experience? What actually happened? ANDERSON: Well, the vision that they had was one of total freedom. And they found themselves - they thought they had a place that was not bound by law. They quickly learned, within a couple of years of attempting this experiment, that they actually wanted law because they got into a dispute with the Bates family, who controlled this tower. And in the end there was nothing they can do about it. I mean the flipside of going to a place without courts, without police, without the jurisdiction of a regular nation-state, is that there's no one to enforce this contract that you thought you had. And so the whole thing ended in acrimony, with Lackey and - leaving the tower, the Bates family taking control of what was there, and it also came out, you know, Lackey admitted that much of what had been said, especially in this Wired magazine article, was - I guess optimistic would be the nicest way to put it - it was done for PR purposes. It was done with a hope to this is where they could get someday. It was never a flourishing operation. It was always fairly small-scale. They tended to host a few online gambling sites, especially those that wanted to reach the lucrative U. S. market, where online gambling was illegal, and for a while they also hosted the government of Tibet's website, which had angered the Chinese. DAVIES: A lot of what your book tells us is that the reality is there is all kinds of illegal and harmful activity on the Internet, and thus law enforcement recognized that and took to fighting it on the Internet. You tell the story of some interesting investigations into child pornography rings, and one of them begins with videos in Australia. Tell us how that story started. ANDERSON: So one of the lessons that law enforcement learned was, you know, they weren't just going to throw up their hands and say, hey, that's right, you know, law is basically - doesn't apply anymore. And so it took them a while, but they did begin to learn how to do things on the Internet. One of the things they learned was the power of international cooperation over this new international medium. So this case that I profiled was, at the time of its takedown in 2009, was the largest such takedown the U. S. had ever conducted. It began back in Australia, where some police, during a raid, found a video depicting child pornography. They were able through the accents of the people involved, who were speaking in the video, to understand that it was Flemish or Belgian in some way, and they passed it to the Belgian police. From there it spawned something called Operation Koala, which became a massive, European-wide, you know, manhunt for people. They actually identified the person who was being abused. It was a father who was abusing his two children by taking them to a studio in the Ukraine, which had been set up for these kinds of activities. So they got the guy involved. They managed to get his email list of people who are interested in these kinds of videos he was producing. They kept all the European addresses and staged a massive raid over 20 countries, and they passed all the U. S. addresses to their counterparts here, where a wide variety of agencies got together to track these guys down, generating hundreds and hundreds of leads, and eventually a massive bust of people that showed them whole new chat rooms, whole new places where these kind of people hung out. DAVIES: In the book you describe this child pornography investigation and how it ended up resulting in the arrest of a lot of people. You describe one interesting character in Baltimore, a guy who'd run for mayor once before, and the arrest there. One of the things that you describe that authorities used in this investigation of Internet child pornography was that when arrests were made, they wouldn't just box up the computers and take them away, but while the suspect was there, would sometimes have the technicians going through the computers right then and there. The phrase was on-scene computer triage. Explain what that is. What was the point? ANDERSON: Right. Well, so the old technique was to go in and treat this as a normal crime scene, right. Don't contaminate the evidence. Be very careful. You know, unplug everything, shut it down, bag it up, tag it. Take it back to the lab. Go through it slowly, carefully, methodically to build your court case. And that works, but you lose a lot by doing it. For instance, when police might enter a house looking for somebody, that person might be on their computer and logged in to certain chat rooms or websites or communities right then, and if you shut down the computer, you might need passwords to boot it up again or to enter these communities again. So what they began doing - and this investigation was one of the first times this was widely deployed - was starting to look, right there - they would still box it all up and take it back to the forensic lab later. But you could learn things right away by spending an hour with the running computer right there, and especially if you could convince the person that you had just busted to give you passwords or to tell you things. And they would do this all the time. They would sometimes convince people that, hey, you know, we're going to break this one way or the other. You might as well just tell us. Maybe things will actually go easier for you when it comes to sentencing, et cetera. There were all sorts of techniques for getting information out of people. And it was remarkably successful. They would find new communities they didn't know existed. And if they had waited a month, those kind of communities would often get suspicious at a member's absence and shut them out. So it opened all sorts of new doors to new communities of child pornography, to immediately finding out these guys' friends and their connections with the outside world, and preserving evidence that might have been erased if they had shut down the computers. DAVIES: One of the interesting things about the description of this child pornography investigation is that, you know, one of the things that makes the Internet safe for this kind of criminal activity is its anonymity. I mean, people - you log on, you get this horrible stuff, but nobody knows who you are. But once the investigators get - nail somebody, then if they can get that person to give them their password, suddenly, the police enter the networks, taking advantage of the anonymity, and the other child pornographers think they're dealing with somebody they trust. In fact, they're dealing with a cop. It's a fascinating kind of reversal of anonymity working in favor of the criminals. ANDERSON: Yeah. It can be very difficult to know who you're dealing with online in any sort of real firm sense. And so - especially in these communities that don't want others to know that. They tend to operate just simply on these usernames. You know nothing about someone beyond this name you see on the screen. And so what police did in this case - and have continued to do in many other cases since - is when they bust somebody, they could get most of these guys to plead guilty. In this particular bust, despite how large it was, only one guy went to trial. Everyone else plead guilty. And as part of those deals, often what the government requested was that they turned over their passwords in these communities and their usernames, and then federal agents assumed those identities. And to the outsiders, you know, there's almost no way to tell that you're now dealing with a fed. So that encouraged a lot of paranoia and suspicion within these communities, especially when somebody would be gone for a few days, or maybe their tone or choice of words change after a while. Well, you think to yourself: Is that just normal, or am I suddenly - have we been infiltrated? Am I dealing with a cop? DAVIES: Right. So when this investigation ran its course, how big of a child pornography operation did it expose? ANDERSON: It varied over time. I believe when they finally shut down - this place was called the Cache, and when they finally shut down the Cache, I believe there were 500 people or so involved. But there had been a couple thousand a year or two earlier. They had - they had been spooked, in fact, by some action that the feds had taken, and many people had left. But I guess enough people didn't get the message and continued. And so there were mass arrests. Most people plead guilty, as I said. This one guy went to trial, and that meant that all of this information about how the government had, you know, infiltrated and exposed these guys came out then at trial and provided, you know, most of my data for reconstructing this really fascinating narrative about what had happened and how. DAVIES: We're speaking with Nate Anderson. He is a deputy editor of Ars Technica. His new book is called \"The Internet Police: How Crime Went Online, and the Cops Followed. \" We'll talk some more after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, our guest is Nate Anderson. He's a deputy editor for Ars Technica. He's written a new book about crime on the Internet and how police have gotten more active pursuing it. It's called \"The Internet Police. \" You have some interesting cases that you describe where folks were targeted, essentially spied upon, using their home computers. Do you want to give us an example on what, you know, what the impact was on these folks? ANDERSON: Yeah. So maybe I could talk about two different cases, because one of the key points that my book is making is that you really can't differentiate between good and bad techniques on the Internet. What you get are techniques, and they can be used by anyone, for any purpose. So one of the stories that I cover in the book involves a substitute teacher in Ohio who had purchased a stolen laptop from a student at her school. She claims she didn't know it was stolen. The police knock on her door a few days later, and they have in their hand pictures of her topless chats with her boyfriend at the time that they have printed out on sheets of paper. She is amazed. It turns out that the computers - which had been owned by the school district - had tracking software on them, and were accessed by an investigator who was looking for this one and happened to grab screenshots of what this woman was doing on her computer at the time, and he passed them to the local police, who showed up at her door, knocking on it, holding these things. And the whole experience really - at least in her telling in the court documents - really devastated her. It made her almost borderline paranoid about surveillance, about clicks on her phone, about - I mean, if people could do that, they could do almost anything, it seemed like. DAVIES: And, in this case, it was the police. The tracking software was there to help the school district recover stolen computers. This actually happened in a school district around Philadelphia recently. But why did the police then use that, rather than simply going and getting the stolen computer? Why would they then barge in and confront her with these embarrassing, though legal, pictures, and then they arrested her? ANDERSON: Well, that's a good question. And she sued the police department over this case, and it was settled privately. She was arrested for receiving stolen goods, but the prosecutor declined to move forward with the case. So my sense is that the police there knew they had overreached and tried to make this situation go away. You know, but what you see also is that hackers do the same thing. I mean, this technique has been around for years in hacking circles. And so I cover another story in the book of this guy out in California who turns out to be a disabled immigrant. He's in a wheelchair. He knows computers. He's been to some local community college classes and programming things. He becomes something of a hacker. He starts hacking into computers of young women all around California, and more broadly. By the end of - you know, by the time police arrest him, he has gotten his software installed on the machines of several hundred young women. He was able to watch the webcams on their computer. He was able to turn on the microphones in their computer, listen to what was happening in the rooms where these computers were. He was able to see what they were doing on their screens, on their computer, what websites they were visiting. And he could see every file on their computer, and he delighted in finding nude pictures that many of them kept on their machines. And he would then toy with his victims. He would show up on instant messaging networks knowing all sorts of things about them, having these pictures, and being able to tell them about conversations they thought they had had privately inside a room, that suddenly this random guy on the Internet knows about. It was absolutely unnerving to these young women, you know, this terrifying experience. But it's now the same kind of thing that the police do, that private organizations do. We know the FBI has this capability. A major scandal erupted a year or two ago in Germany, when it became clear that the German government was using this sort of technology. So, you know, you have this technique, and once it's out there, it can really be used for just about anything. And there's almost no way to say, you know, this is going to be used for good, and not for bad. It is kind of a free-for-all. DAVIES: Nate Anderson's book is \"The Internet Police: How Crime Went Online, and the Cops Followed. \"  He'll be back in the second half of the show. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. We're speaking with technology writer Nate Anderson, whose new book traces the growth of crime on the Internet and the increasingly sophisticated techniques law enforcement employs to fight it. Anderson is a senior editor at Ars Technica. His new book is called \"The Internet Police: How Crime Went Online, and the Cops Followed. \" Before the break, Anderson described some cases where hackers tapped into the home computers of women, using their webcams to spy on them and rifling their computer files for personal information and intimate photos. You describe how emotionally shattering it was for women to suddenly be confronted with these things they thought were private. But tell us a little bit about how that worked. I mean, is there technology that someone can easily get that will allow them to get inside and control somebody else's computer? ANDERSON: Absolutely. I mean, you do not have to be a quote-unquote \"hacker\" to do this anymore. In some research I did after writing the book, I spent some time in an entire Web community that exists around this practice, which they call ratting - R-A-T, remote administration tool. These are basically pieces of software that, once you can get them on someone else's computer, provides you total access to their machine, but surreptitiously. They don't know it's there. They don't know it's running. And. . . DAVIES: And you get them to install the software by what - enticing them to open an email or something? ANDERSON: You can do that. You can approach them on instant messaging, pretending to be a friend of theirs. You can put fake, you know, songs out there to pop music on peer-to-peer file sharing networks that then people download thinking they're getting a song, turns out to be one of these files. One of the things these guys do is spend a lot of time sharing their techniques for how they spread this stuff widely, how you pick up quote-unquote \"slaves,\" which is what they refer to the people who install their software. DAVIES: This is just so creepy. I mean, if you have, you know, one of these major antiviral, you know, protection systems for your computer, are you protected against things like this? ANDERSON: All of the major antivirus, anti-malware systems now do look for these sorts of toolkits - these remote administration tools. But, you know, they're tweaked all the time for the purpose of avoiding these things. So it's hard to say for certain that any given implementation of one of these is going to be caught by, you know, any given tool that you might have, especially if your antivirus software is out of date or a bit older. DAVIES: You know, in the cases the book, where you describe these women being targeted by someone who had taken control of their computer, and then looked through their photos and watched them through the webcam, you know, the police - we know about this because the police investigated and found some of the people that were engaged in this activity. Are they doing a lot of that, and should we feel good about that? It's sort of puzzling, because you don't want the police spying on you, and yet, on the other hand, you want the police protecting us, you know, from people peering into our lives. ANDERSON: Yeah. The FBI has essentially coined a term related to this activity that they call sextortion, because most of these cases turn out to involve these guys will watch usually women, but I have seen a couple of cases involving men or even boys. And once you either get access to their computers, you can get them to give you nude the photos and things, and then you can start blackmailing them and get them to do more and more things for you. And, yeah, it's kind of depressingly common, and it's now - you see busts related to this activity with some frequency. I wouldn't say it's an epidemic, but, you know, if you visit some of these communities and you see people just sharing images of these people that they're spying on from all over the world, no idea they're being watched, you know, it's deeply creepy. And, you know, I just think it's worth knowing that this is a possibility on your machine. I mean, many people are not aware that something like that is even possible. But it's hard to quantify just how much something like that happens. DAVIES: And before we leave this subject, is there any way you can protect yourselves? I mean, should you turn off your computer? Should you - I don't know, anything you can do? ANDERSON: Yeah. There's a couple of things. Running a good anti-malware, antivirus program will help catch many of these. You know, don't download dodgy files on peer-to-peer networks. Don't accept, you know, files from people you don't know over instant messaging. And get a computer that has a light, you know, hardwired to your webcam. Many computers do now. And if they webcam is ever activated, a small light next to it will go on. That usually cannot be bypassed. So those kinds of techniques can at least let you know, you know, when it's happening. DAVIES: You know, a lot of your book deals with serious and troubling stuff like, you know, kiddy porn and extortion and identity theft. You also write about spam, which kind of most of us think of as, you know, a nuisance. Why is spam serious enough for the FBI to get involved in? ANDERSON: Well, it's more than just a nuisance, because most of the spam you get, you may not want it, but the products that it's selling are often or even usually are fraudulent, as well. So in addition to being unwanted, you're often dealing with a fraudulent situation. So you will find that the kingpins behind spam can often be making substantial incomes from this activity. I mean, you might find it hard to believe that anyone would click on one of these emails and give their credit card information to the website that comes up, but it happens all the time. Because spam is so prevalent, you need such a small success rate - I mean, in the . 1 percent or less - and you can still make real money. DAVIES: You do write about a fascinating case involving one, you know, mega-spammer, a guy who the FBI nailed when he went to a conference in Las Vegas. Tell us about him and how big his operation was. ANDERSON: So this case is fascinating, because it shows another one of the key ways that cops have learned to operate online. You know, a lot of spam and some of these other online ills originates now from Eastern Europe and Russia. And Russia famously does not extradite its citizens. It doesn't matter why. And they often show less interest in prosecuting some of these cases, as well. So one of the lessons that the U. S. has learned is if we find somebody who appears to be kingpin, they appear to be in Russia, what are we going to do? We are going to wait. Eventually, they're going to come to a friendly country. They're going to fly through a friendly country or they're going to come to the U. S. for some reason, and when they do, we're going to grab them. So, in this case, this is guy, Oleg Nikolaenko. He's 23, 24, a young Russian guy, had started becoming a major spammer. He had a botnet, which essentially means he controlled hundreds of thousands of people's private computers around the world by installing small software on them that could then send out spam from their machines, making it hard to block, because it came from, you know, 200,000 different places, not one. DAVIES: Whose owners had no idea they were part of a spam network. ANDERSON: No idea their computer is in the background sending out these messages for this guy in Russia. So he runs this botnet, spammers pay him to deliver their message. He's a distributor. He doesn't write the spam. He doesn't send out the herbal supplements. You know, he just distributes messages, makes a ton of money. He also loves cars. So the FBI out of Milwaukee is investigating this guy, and they wait until he comes to the U. S. to visit an auto show in Las Vegas. And as soon as he crosses, you know, U. S. Passport Control - I believe he touched down on JFK on his way there - they know about it. They find out where he's staying. They call the FBI team in Las Vegas, and they arrest the guy in his hotel room. So he thinks he's coming to the U. S. for, like, this three-day, you know, car show, from Russia. He ends up, like, two days later sitting in a jail cell in Milwaukee, where he stays for more than a year. DAVIES: And how big was his operation, and how much money was he making? ANDERSON: So, at his height, this guy was estimated to be controlling more than 500,000 machines, which he would use to send his spam. This was, you know, at its height, probably the largest botnet in the world for while. It may have accounted for up to 30 percent or so of all the spam in the world. And we know from the records of this investigation that eventually came out that he made $464,000 in 2007, and that was just in six months. And that was apparently just from one client, and he had multiple clients. So this guy, who is like 23, 24, is making serious, serious money. DAVIES: Nate Anderson's book is called \"The Internet Police. \" We'll talk more after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, we're speaking with writer Nate Anderson. His new book is called \"The Internet Police: How Crime Went Online, and the Cops Followed. \" You also write about how easy it was for you to buy heroin or ecstasy over the Internet at a site that was called Silk Road. And what's interesting about this was that you said that they were able to do this with impunity because of a multilevel encryption system - if I have this right - that was essentially developed by the U. S. government? Is that right? ANDERSON: That's right. The basic technology that protects this site and other sites like it is called Tor. It used to stand for The Onion Router. Now it's just a word on its own. But it essentially involves a system which, you know, your traffic is passed through layers of different computers, passed from one to the next to the next to the next to the next, until finally, the last computer in the chain dumps it back onto the public Internet. And by that time, it is supposed to be essentially untraceable, mixed in with all this other traffic passing through the Tor network, and there should be, you know, no way to trace it back to you. Now, this is really useful if, for instance, you know, you are a diplomat or, you know, a military officer or something stationed in a foreign country, and you need secure communications back to the U. S. , or if you're an the FBI or a DEA agent here in the U. S. and you need to, you know, pretend to be a drug dealer or something online, you need to disguise where your computer is, where you're coming from. So this tool had all sorts of uses. But it is now developed privately, and while it's still used by the military and by others, it is also used by plenty of people to host child photography, is one popular one. But then the new thing is these drug markets. Silk Road is the best-known. It's still around. It's been operating for a couple of years with apparently almost total impunity. And it enables - it's like Amazon, but for drugs. You can find hundreds of sellers from all over the world who will mail you just about anything. And you can leave feedback on them, how their product was, how their service was. It's quite a remarkable thing. And the guy who runs it has some of these - you know, he's a libertarian, with strong ideas about freedom, who goes by the name Dread Pirate Roberts. And we know the government is after him, but, I mean, in a testament to how well the software works, they haven't caught him yet. DAVIES: OK. But if this was developed by the government, how does it get into the hands of all these other folks? ANDERSON: So the U. S. government - the Navy, actually, did the preliminary research on what is known as Onion Routing, the basic technique that is used here. But the actual software is developed now by a foundation, the Tor Project. And they receive money from all sorts of governments, government agencies, even some Christian groups. Because the thing about these tools, as I've said before, is you can never to limit them to certain uses you think are good or that you think are bad. And so this tool in particular provides, you know, an incredible encryption for people who need to bypass surveillance. Well, that can mean criminals, but it can also mean political dissidents. It can mean religious, you know, dissidents in countries where, you know, freedom of religion is not accepted. It can mean all sorts of uses that one branch of the government - say, the State Department - might say are good, but another branch might - like the FBI - might see things being used in it that are bad. But they don't - but nobody wants it shut down. DAVIES: Yeah. You make the point that, you know, the State Department, I think Hillary Clinton and some others have said that you need this kind of technology for secure, anonymous communication. I mean, people in Mexico who want to be able to communicate without being discovered by, you know, drug cartels, political dissidents. And so, in some respects, it's government policy to permit this kind of communication, to encourage and enable it. ANDERSON: Right. And I think it shows you that, you know, speaking of the government is often not a helpful thing to do when it's that, you know, as broad as the U. S. government. There are so many competing interests. So, yes, state has been a huge backer of these programs. They've traveled, especially in Eastern Europe, they've stirred up quite a bit of controversy by going over there and teaching activists and dissidents how to use tools like Tor to avoid state surveillance. But those exact same tools can avoid state surveillance here in the U. S. , whether it's by the FBI looking for drug dealers or child pornographers, whether it's the NSA looking for terrorists, you know, there's just no way to limit the sort of technology in the way the government would prefer to do. And so what you have in this very strange situation where some aspects of the government are encouraging the same sorts of tools that other aspects of the government aren't very happy about. DAVIES: Is - you know, I guess this is what we have an Executive Branch for, to kind of look at these conflicting policy goals and methods and make some wise decisions about, you know, what we want to do. Is there any attempt to sort of, I don't know, mediate and get an overall policy that makes sense? ANDERSON: Well, I think U. S. policy on this is very widely - back in the 1990s we famously tried to control encryption and anybody exporting strong crypto, as it was called, was under all sorts of restrictions. They couldn't send it to all sorts of different countries. And eventually, we realized that wasn't going to work. I mean, these guys who dreamed about the Internet being global and breaking down geographic barriers, you know, may have had a limited vision but they weren't totally wrong either. And so what the U. S. found was we were essentially just putting ourselves at a disadvantage because other companies on Earth weren't abiding by these rules. They were selling products with strong crypto. So what customers around the world said was, hey, why are we going to buy from the U. S. ? And I think it's the same sort of backlash you're already seeing around some of this - the NSA revelations. Countries are - and companies around the world and even individuals are saying, you know, hey, I don't know that we trust these U. S. Internet companies anymore. And in the '90s the NSA actually backed down from this position and we kind of gave up on trying to control encryption. And I think things have maybe swung back the other way since then. DAVIES: You know, you mentioned the National Security Administration revelations recently, and I guess a lot of that broke after you'd probably finished the book. What's your take on all of these revelations about, you know, the surveillance of both, you know, telephone or other electronic communication? Do we need reforms? Does this tell us - what does it tell us? ANDERSON: Well, I think it tells us a couple of things. One, is it tells us exactly what electronic surveillance in the Internet age looks like when the gloves come off. I mean, the NSA operates under certain restrictions, clearly. It is not totally indiscriminate surveillance. But, you know, the rules are far, far different and much, much looser than anything that is legally allowed to happen domestically. So my book basically looks at how local police, how the FBI and how international policing, you know, handle these things. But they operate under a very different framework. And what you see with these NSA revelations is just how incredible are the data trails we leave. How, with relative ease, they can be scooped up, put back together, dumped into massive databases. And I think the lesson is that the Internet, which was supposed to be this tool of incredible freedom, of anonymous communication, providing a publishing platform to everyone, has sort of at the same time provided one of the most amazing electronic surveillance platforms the world has ever known. DAVIES: There's a lot of discussion now about new regulations on the NSA, about changes in the FISA court, about independent review of what these government agencies do. I mean, what's your take? Is that needed? Do you have a view on it? ANDERSON: I think one of the things that the NSA revelations are going to finally do is open people's eyes to just how dramatic this sort of surveillance looks like in practice. It's one thing to talk about electronic surveillance and it's another thing to really understand just how wide-ranging the Net can be when you have computers scooping up data from fiber optics taps, when you get every phone call made by everyone in the U. S. You know, we're going - the NSA is going to look a lot more like some of these hackers in the book who are operating without many rules. And I think that has already made people uncomfortable. So my sense is we're going to see some rule changes intended to promote greater comfort in this. Even President Obama has indicated those are in progress. You know, whether that is going to satisfy the critics of what's been going on, I think will really depend on the strength of the public reaction, you know, to mobilize a bipartisan agreement in Congress. DAVIES: Well, Nate Anderson, it's been really interesting. Thanks so much for spending some time with us. ANDERSON: Thanks for having me.

Today, two and a half billion people already have access and almost half of them are on Facebook. That leaves nearly five billion people who are not on the Internet at all. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder and CEO unveiled a partnership today called Internet. org, and it has an audacious goal to bring many of those five billion online in the next decade through their mobile phones. For more, NPR's Steve Henn joins us now. And, Steve, who besides Facebook is involved here and how exactly would it work? STEVE HENN, BYLINE: Well, in addition to Facebook, some mobile phone makers like Nokia and Samsung, have signed up, as well as Ericsson which makes mobile networking equipment, and big mobile phone chip makers including QUALCOMM are on board, as well. Basically, the goal here is to radically reduce the cost of getting online for people in the developing world. Right now, there are roughly five billion active mobile phones on the planet, but the vast majority are not connected to the Internet. And that's because data plans are far too expensive for most of the world's population to afford. So, even if the cost of a Smartphone drops dramatically in the next few years, that's not going to matter if data makes that phone basically useless. So these companies are committing to working together to push the cost of basic Internet access on the phone to less than a dollar a month. CORNISH: Give us more detail here. Are the companies committing to make big investments in research or essentially are they saying they're going to help subsidize connections in the developing world? HENN: Well, there are not really any formal spending commitments here. And the proposal doesn't involve subsidizing Internet connections at all. The idea is that these companies will work collaboratively to create a mobile data network that's so efficient that it's commercially viable and profitable in some of the poorest parts of the world. Now, to make that happen, mobile networks have to become much more efficient at moving data around the globe. The phones that connect to these networks have to use less data, as well. And the app designers, like Facebook, have to design programs and services that sip data instead of swill it. The problem is big enough that no single player in this industry can solve it acting alone. So all these firms are saying that they're going to work together to find technical solutions that leverage each other's expertise. CORNISH: Why is this the necessary way to do it? I mean, Facebook wants more people to join Facebook, obviously. And Samsung and Nokia probably want more customers, right, in the developing world? But why not just let business and capitalism run its course? HENN: Well, you know, that's a great question. And maybe without any sort of organized push in this direction, you know, people would come online all over the world in the next decade anyway. But right now, a lot of the research and development and innovation in this space is aimed at consumers in the developed world. I mean, if you think about the hottest new mobile app this year, like Vine, it shares video. The apps are aimed at folks with almost unlimited data plans. And telecom companies in the U. S. and Europe make more money if we use more data on our phones, not less. So the business models that drive the industry right now aren't pushing in the direction of using less data. This effort really is to try to create and promote business models that would also work in the developing world. CORNISH: What would that look like? HENN: Well, one idea that Facebook has experimented with, in places like the Philippines and Mexico, is to cut deals with telecom providers and phone makers where a certain amount of basic Internet access is free with your phone. So, let's say, Facebook would be free. The idea is that would make buying that phone more attractive. And, as a consumer, you'd get in the habit of going online. You know, that ends up boosting phone sales in the short-term. In the long run, it gets more consumers hooked on the Internet. So Facebook wants to expand that. CORNISH: And, of course, if I'm cynical, I'm saying Facebook wants to be a gateway drug for the Internet? HENN: Yeah, right. But these guys argue that in an information economy, the Internet is a necessity. CORNISH: That's NPR's Steve Henn. Steve, thank you so much. HENN: My pleasure.

USSLER: Well, actually, we do bring worms back to learn more about them, but once we have information about them we can use that to paint imagery and look at their distribution on the ocean floor without having to collect samples. FLATOW: Tell us what this instrument looks like. USSLER: Well, the deep sea environmental sample processor, we call it the DPSP, is a one meter diameter titanium sphere that's mounted on a frame and the frame is what carries it down to the sea floor. Inside the one meter, 15 inch sphere is an instrument that will collect sea water, filter it, and process that for DNA analysis. FLATOW: And you do the DNA analysis right there. USSLER: That's right. That's what's really unique (technical difficulty) we've adapted standard microbiology techniques and they typically require people to conduct them and various types of large pieces of equipment. We have reengineered this and put it on the sea floor so it operates autonomously. And we have a program or which we call a mission, and we start that mission and we just go away and let it do its thing. FLATOW: So it's currently sitting in the Monterey Bay? USSLER: That's correct. Right now we have a six month long deployment and it's in Monterey Bay, offshore, connected to our submarine cable network. We call it the MARS cable. And that supplies power and data and communications with the device on the sea floor, and then allows us to interrogate it and receive data back. And also, we can even update the computer code while it's sitting there right from our desks. FLATOW: Is this a way to find new species or what? USSLER: OK. At this point right now this is a proof of concept and we're demonstrating that this technology actually works. What we'd like to do in the future is shrink this to one-tenth its size and make it mobile. And in the surface we have a different group of instruments we just call ESP. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. USSLER: And we're already adapting those for shallow water, that is, less than 300 meter deep water, for doing surveys of the upper ocean. We don't have the analytical capability right now to detect new life forms. We can bring samples back, much to the - not according to the mantra that we were given - but that allows us to determine what it is that we should be looking for. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. USSLER: In the future it'll be very nice to develop a strategy to detect the life and new types of DNA sequences without having any a priori knowledge. FLATOW: Yeah. So this - in the future when you shrink it down and get it past the proof of concept, I'm sort of visioning - envisioning something like a Mars rover but on the ocean floor. USSLER: That's true. That is a possibility. And we actually operate rover-type technology just like you've seen on Mars. And our rover moves very slowly on the sea floor and that's partly because of its size and the types of technology we're using right now. But there's no real restriction on terms of shrinking this type of device and turning it into a mobile facility that could perform exploration in a systematic and efficient way. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And what would you like to find? What would be the A material you'd like to find down there? USSLER: Well, it would be exciting to find new life forms but, in fact, what would be more interesting is to actually try and figure out why they're there. What are they doing? And that's really a significant intellectual but also very pragmatic question because microbes in the ocean control about 85 percent of the ocean chemistry. And the oceans are changing and we'd like to understand what role the microbes will play in the changing ocean conditions. FLATOW: That's fascinating. Let's talk about that a bit more. Microbes control 85 percent of the ocean chemistry. USSLER: That's correct. That's our estimate at this point. FLATOW: In what way? Give me an idea what you mean by that. USSLER: Well, the study that we just finished a few years ago was looking at methane oxidation. And so the sea floor, as many of you know, has methane vents on it. We call them coal vents and methane is bubbling out of the sea floor. In other places it's just fusing out. It's a slow rate of release from the sediment where it's produced. And this is something that's a fuel. It's just like we cook our meals on stoves that use natural gas. That's predominately methane. And these microbes use this as an energy source in the water column. And they act as a biofilter. So very little of that methane makes it all the way up to the surface. And so that is one way in which they control the chemistry of the oceans, is by consuming the methane. Otherwise, we would have a methane-enriched ocean and it would change the chemistry of the oceans to the extent that different life forms would live in it. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Could you find a spot with this technology that you could sort of lurk and wait for something that you would like to see that's not happening at the moment? USSLER: Yes. We've actually done an experiment like that in 2011 at an ocean ridge system called the Juan de Fuca. It's offshore of Oregon. And there are cracks in the sea floor. It's a salt sea floor and there are vents where hot water comes out. But these are very ephemeral and so you can take - sit and wait at one location and want to take a sample but it may not be hot or flowing significantly. But these things are ephemeral and so it may start up again. So we have experimented with ways of sitting and waiting and triggering sampling when the conditions are appropriate. Such as, in this case, high temperatures. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And how long can it stay down there? USSLER: Well, right now we're running the system on batteries which allow it to stay on the sea floor for four to five days autonomously. When we connect to the submarine cable it's unlimited in terms of how long it can stay down on the sea floor, but the problem is simply we don't have submarine cables everywhere. And so that is a limitation. However, the U. S. is building a submarine cable infrastructure off of Oregon and Washington. And they have selected sites that are actually quite interesting for these types of experiments. FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR talking with Bill Ussler of the Monterey Bay Research Institute. Wait. Are you saying that there's like a giant extension cord? USSLER: Yes. (LAUGHTER)USSLER: Yes, exactly. It is under construction right now. And it has shoreside stations where the power gets sent out the cables and it forms a network, interconnected network. And there are nodes where science equipment is going to be installed. And those instrument packages have already been identified and are being manufactured. FLATOW: So there's really a big effort, at least in the Pacific Northwest there. USSLER: That's right. Hundreds of millions of dollars are being invested in this sea floor infrastructure on the part of the National Science Foundation. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And it's a multi-disciplinary effort. A lot of different people involved? USSLER: Yes. It's a multi-disciplinary effort, a multi-institutional effort, and it is just beginning to really start up to become operational. Still going through some testing and validation of the system. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. USSLER: But once that's operational, then they will - node time will be allocated on a grant proposal basis. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. You know, the people are going to say times are tough. There are going to be people that say great, sounds like an interesting experiment. Why spend the money on this? What practical effect is this going to have in my life? USSLER: Oh, in terms of building an infrastructure? FLATOW: Yeah. In terms of what you're doing with studying the microbiology down there. USSLER: OK. In terms of the infrastructure, it gives us the opportunity to do experiments that we couldn't do before because of power and data limitation. And one of the really important things we're facing, you know, as a world is understanding how rapidly the oceans are changing. And by having six points of observation we can develop long-term time series and we can look at trends in ocean temperature and ocean chemistry that will give us some guidance to understand how the oceans are responding to either natural or anthropogenic changes. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Now you're getting this network. You're going down to look at the microbiology. All we talk about these days is money in science. If I gave you a blank check, what would you do with it? USSLER: What would I do? FLATOW: Yeah. USSLER: Well, I would do two things. The capability of our DPSP right now does not include gene expression. And what this is, is that it is a measure of how the actual genes are being expressed and utilized to make proteins and enzymes in a cell. And this is very important to understand basic microbial what we call biogeochemistry. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. USSLER: And the second part is then to take the ESP and this ability to look at gene expression and then couple it to a system where we can actually culture the bacteria that live in the ocean water and grow them. And learn about their metabolism - you know, what do they eat? And, you know, what kind of dependencies they have on other organisms. And how might they respond to changes in the ocean. The submarine cable network really gives us a significant advantage because we can connect this type of system to a power source that's not going to limit the overall sort of integrated vision that we have for developing the ability to analyze genes and gene expression on the sea floor and conducting what we call culturing experiments or incubation experiments. FLATOW: So what's your time scale for moving your lab out from the testing stage? USSLER: Well, it's ongoing right now. We have efforts to begin to shrink the ESP and develop a new generation of instrumentation. We are not at the point of developing gene expression phase, that ability to do that, but we're getting close with that. And I just began some proof of concept experiments for culturing the cells on the sea floor. FLATOW: Wow. USSLER: So, yeah. FLATOW: Yeah. USSLER: So we're, you know, this blank check question is simply, you know, that would push things along even further. In fact, enable us to do things sooner. But that's the direction we're going in. FLATOW: Well, good luck to you. Thank you for taking time to be with us today. USSLER: OK. Thank you. FLATOW: Bill Ussler, marine microbiologist at the Monterey Bay Research Institute. That's about all the time we have for this hour. IRA FLATOW, HOST:  Imagine packing a whole bunch of the tools from a molecular biology lab, from a mass spectrometer to a DNA analyzer, packing them into an under sear robot, one that can both sample and analyze on its own at the bottom of the sea. Joining me now to talk about that is Bill Ussler. He's a marine microbiologist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute. In 1987, David Packard, famous David Packard who funded much of the lab's efforts, challenged it to find ways to bring back data. Not the samples. We don't want sample. I challenge you to bring data back from marine expeditions and this is part of that effort. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. WILLIAM USSLER: Thank you, Ira.

Maybe we should say when are you ever not connected?

The island, which is located on a lake right on the border with Rwanda, has just gotten wired. We're now joined by Jacques Sebisaho, who is a doctor and a native of the island. And he splits his time there between there and New York City. Doctor, thank you very much for being with us. DR. JACQUES SEBISAHO: Thank you, Scott. SIMON: So, how did this idea of bringing the Internet to Idjwi Island come about? SEBISAHO: Twice we lost doctors. So, the first one who came, who didn't last more than a few weeks, said he liked the idea. Initially, he believed in it but he couldn't get in touch with his family. And the second one, who is in the middle of finishing his master's degree in public health, said he couldn't get in touch with his professors. So, I went back to the community and asked them how we could help keep the doctors on the island. They've heard of Internet but they've never seen. They just suggest that we should get Internet. SIMON: Is it very expensive? SEBISAHO: Yeah, it's very expensive. We have to pay $1,500 a month for that. SIMON: Wow. You raise money for that in New York? SEBISAHO: Yes, we do. A friend of mine who's also the president of our board, donated the money to buy the expensive equipment and pay the first month. SIMON: But tell us how it's helping you, what effect it's having. SEBISAHO: Whenever I'm in New York, communication with the staff is almost impossible. One physician has to climb the mountain to just speak with me about the case. But now, I'm able to Skype with the physicians. Whenever they have a case, they will just send me an email and I will go on Skype and we consult together. SIMON: Not everything on the Web is going to be directly helpful, is it? SEBISAHO: That was our fear. Our first fear was that this island that has been isolated in many ways from the conflict and consumer society, now we were wondering now that they have Internet, they will start watching all these stuff that can get people to start consuming.

S. Senate. ALISON LUNDERGAN GRIMES: . . . Kentucky by running for the U. S. Senate. (APPLAUSE)SIMON: Her candidacy had been rumored for months. The obvious Web domain name, Grimesforsenate. com, had already been purchased. But not by the Grimes' campaign. By a man who's a kind of political hobbyist. MICHAEL DEUTSCH: I check to see if that name was available, Grime for Senate, and also Alison for senate and they both were available, and it takes a minute or two and a $10 credit card bill and the domains are mine. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SIMON: That's Michael Deutsch. He doesn't work in politics, but he's the kind of guy who watches CSPAN every day, not just when Angelina Jolie or George Clooney testify on Capitol Hill. For more than a decade, Mr. Deutsch has been buying domain names to political campaigns before they can and he offers those campaigns a deal. He doesn't want money, though he's taken it a couple of times. He wants to spend a day on the trail with the candidate. DEUTSCH: The things that are deadly dull to people in Washington are fascinating to outsiders. SIMON: Alison Grimes' team hasn't replied yet, but his plan has worked in the past. Take his day with Joe Lieberman in 2004 when the campaign bus pulled up to a fish market. DEUTSCH: And the proprietor wanted to give to him two large fish as a gift, and the campaign has to evaluate whether he was permitted to accept them under the campaign finance rules. That took some time. And this also happened in the summer, so it was quite warm and the question is what do you do with two large fish? And he wound up having one of the campaign workers take those fish home to be prepared for dinner. SIMON: Michael Deutsch feasts on such anecdotes. He's a registered Republican but he's struck bargains with candidates of both parties, and sometimes when candidates don't respond, he keeps the domain and just posts his own views. Even today, when you go to McCain2008. com, you'll find an unflattering magazine profile of Senator John McCain left there by Mr. Deutsch. He says some campaigns have called him. . . DEUTSCH: Some not very nice names, some names that I wouldn't tell my mother. SIMON: He knows politics can be rough, but he got hooked early. DEUTSCH: I'm pretty old, so that I remember in 1956 Senator Stevenson giving his acceptance speech at the Democratic Convention on TV. I mean, that's how far back this goes. I was involved with Students for Kennedy back in the '60s. I remember shaking John Kennedy's hand at one rally. SIMON: And how lucky was Senator Kennedy that, back then, he didn't need a website.

The obvious Web domain name, Grimesforsenate. com, had already been purchased. But not by the Grimes' campaign. By a man who's a kind of political hobbyist. MICHAEL DEUTSCH: I check to see if that name was available, Grime for Senate, and also Alison for senate and they both were available, and it takes a minute or two and a $10 credit card bill and the domains are mine. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SIMON: That's Michael Deutsch. He doesn't work in politics, but he's the kind of guy who watches CSPAN every day, not just when Angelina Jolie or George Clooney testify on Capitol Hill. For more than a decade, Mr. Deutsch has been buying domain names to political campaigns before they can and he offers those campaigns a deal. He doesn't want money, though he's taken it a couple of times. He wants to spend a day on the trail with the candidate. DEUTSCH: The things that are deadly dull to people in Washington are fascinating to outsiders. SIMON: Alison Grimes' team hasn't replied yet, but his plan has worked in the past. Take his day with Joe Lieberman in 2004 when the campaign bus pulled up to a fish market. DEUTSCH: And the proprietor wanted to give to him two large fish as a gift, and the campaign has to evaluate whether he was permitted to accept them under the campaign finance rules. That took some time. And this also happened in the summer, so it was quite warm and the question is what do you do with two large fish? And he wound up having one of the campaign workers take those fish home to be prepared for dinner. SIMON: Michael Deutsch feasts on such anecdotes. He's a registered Republican but he's struck bargains with candidates of both parties, and sometimes when candidates don't respond, he keeps the domain and just posts his own views. Even today, when you go to McCain2008. com, you'll find an unflattering magazine profile of Senator John McCain left there by Mr. Deutsch. He says some campaigns have called him. . . DEUTSCH: Some not very nice names, some names that I wouldn't tell my mother. SIMON: He knows politics can be rough, but he got hooked early. DEUTSCH: I'm pretty old, so that I remember in 1956 Senator Stevenson giving his acceptance speech at the Democratic Convention on TV. I mean, that's how far back this goes. I was involved with Students for Kennedy back in the '60s. I remember shaking John Kennedy's hand at one rally. SIMON: And how lucky was Senator Kennedy that, back then, he didn't need a website.

And let's just say you might not need to call Mom quite so often. We'll let him explain. Omar Green is the CEO and cofounder of wallet. AI and he's with us now to tell us more. Welcome, thanks so much for joining us. OMAR GREEN: Thanks for having me. MARTIN: First explain the name, wallet. AI. GREEN: It's really wallet artificial intelligence, it kind of implies exactly what we do - building machines that help you make smarter decisions about your finances. MARTIN: Now, you went to MIT and majored in what, engineering? Right? GREEN: Yeah, I was a mechanical and electrical engineer. MARTIN: And then you started working for Intuit, which makes financial and tax preparations software like QuickBooks, Mint or TurboTax - a lot of people would've heard of those and we just talked about those just a couple of minutes ago. What do you think you can do that these products don't do? GREEN: Ooh. Well, so I think it's good to think about how those tools generally get used, to understand the differences that we have. In general, when people are using a tool like Mint or Quicken, or even some of the others that are out there, they are focused in a pretty serious way. They're concentrated on trying to figure out what's going on with their taxes. There's a whole decision-making process that goes on there. But the vast majority of our time is spent away from that kind of decision-making. We are running around most of the day, making thousands of little decisions each day and there aren't any tools that are focused on that kind of decision-making, and that is what it is that we do at wallet. AI. We focus on those kinds of decisions as opposed to the ones that are there today. MARTIN: So you use technology called Quantified Self. Talk a little bit about that. And how do you plan to use it so that people can make better financial decisions? GREEN: Sure, so we work as a part of a series of tools - I think is probably the best way to frame that up. Where Quantified Self plays a role is in helping us coach you to making those better decisions. So as it happens, if you look at the work of a bunch of cognitive scientists or behavioral economists or people who study how we think and what we do and what happens when we do the things we do, you find that we don't always make the best decisions. We don't always make the best choices, and that in some ways we're wired not to make those choices so great. Our brains are not really designed to make those decisions so well. And so what we do is, by grabbing the information around you when you're making those decisions, looking at the context in which those decisions are made, we can help coach you in the same way that the Quantified Self folks grab data around them if they're a runner and they want to improve their running performance or what have you, and then use that information to coach that person to be a better runner. We do the exact same thing with your finances. MARTIN: So you and I go to the mall and I see some cute shoes. GREEN: Oh, please, let's do that. MARTIN: The software is going to do what? Say, those look really good on you, Michel? Or what? What's it going to do? (Laughing)GREEN: Well, it might do a lot of things. So what wallet. AI would do is, even before we got to the mall, it would be conversing with you on a fairly regular basis about what the state of your finances were. Telling you, in effect, whether or not you were in a position where you could easily afford to buy those shoes or whether you might have to make some sacrifices to afford those shoes, or whether or not you just shouldn't care and should just go out and really enjoy yourself and buy those shoes. And then when you're in that moment. . . MARTIN: . . . So it's like the guy in the elevator, when the woman gets on with a bag, says have you been shopping again? GREEN: (Laughing) It's actually more. . . MARTIN: It delegates itself to be your husband, right? GREEN: Well, we try to stay away from the nagging thing because nagging turns everybody off. What we would wind up doing in that case is nudging you, and it may very well be that hey, buy those shoes but you might want to avoid the latte next week. MARTIN: How would this work to address your money management skills? GREEN: OK, so the first thing that we would have to do is to take more data than just your financial data. We collect, not just the stuff that's coming out of your bank, which a great many other tools like Mint and Quicken do - but we also look at the data that's part of your social networks. And we look at something that some of the real Ph. D. -types call human telemetrics. That we are effectively monitoring the things around you - who you're with, how much time you're spending with them, what applications you might have used on your phone, that sort of thing. And we put all of that stuff into a mountain of financial and nonfinancial models so that we can get ahead of you a little bit. We can make some predictions about what you're likely to do. And it's from those predictions that we're able to sit down with you at a time when you are thinking or in that moment when you're about to buy those shoes and remind you of those things, reinforce for you those kinds of behaviors that end up giving you better financial outcomes. MARTIN: So if your pattern is that you tend to, say, go out on Thursday night every two weeks when you get paid, what might happen? GREEN: So we literally might find that on those Tuesdays nights where you are with your friends Richard and John, that you are prone to spend too much money and not be able to afford your rent at the end of the month. And so what we might say to you is on Monday night or Tuesday morning or throughout the course of Tuesday, you know, John is probably not going to be someone you want to hang out with tonight because you have rent coming up. MARTIN: That is so cold. That is so cold. GREEN: It's definitely where the. . . MARTIN: . . . And so your friends better not find out on Facebook that you're on this and they're telling you, like, not to hang out. GREEN: Hey, man, let's go and hang out, but - or hang out in a different place. MARTIN: So it's kind of like that little, you know, when they have, like, the angel and the devil on your shoulder. GREEN: Exactly. MARTIN: It's a little angel on your shoulder saying, remember, you wanted to save for a down payment or, you know, remember, versus the one saying. . . GREEN: Well, we can also be a little devil, right, that says to you, hey, look, you've been so good for so long, it's time to, you know, really go out and, you know, let your hair down. MARTIN: Omar, you still haven't kind of worked the shoes into the equation now. Now we've been on this trip to the mall for quite some time and somehow I still haven't gotten my shoes, so what's - like, what's going on here? So would the. . . GREEN: Well, so. . . MARTIN: Would the software say, don't get the shoes, or might it say, bypass Neiman's and go to Payless? GREEN: Well, I think it's more likely that the software, given the way this conversation is going, is going to say to you, we know that these shoes are important to you, buy these shoes and we will work with you to figure out how we can afford these shoes. Which might very well be shuffling some things around, financially, for you, or may very well be, we're going to borrow against your future so you can get these shoes now and this is the plan that we're going to use to make sure that all gets paid back. MARTIN: That sounds a little punitive, Omar, but I'll just - but, OK, well, you and I are having fun right now but one of the things. . . GREEN: Very much so. MARTIN: What occurs to me is that it seems to - it seems to require a lot of personal information. It seems to require that you give up a lot of personal information to this device or to this program, including about your friends. And I'm wondering, are people really going to do that? GREEN: Well, I can tell you that in fact we're already sort of doing it. There's a certain amount of trust that we give over to tools all the time. There's an example I like to use of using Google Maps or a Garmin piece of software to tell you where to go when you're driving. There is, in my mind, very, very few things - or are very few things - that are as dangerous as driving at 65 miles an hour down a road you've never been down before and looking to make a turn, and yet we trust a piece of software with our lives to effectively tell us which lane to be in, how fast to go and whether or not to turn right or left at the next light. That's no different in a lot of ways to what we're starting to see happen with personal finance software and, in fact, some of this Quantified Self stuff too, where we're trusting machines to do a little bit more analysis than we can do or have a slightly better point of view than we have right now and be able to guide us around a bit. MARTIN: What gave you the idea for this? GREEN: Oh, goodness, that's a great. . . MARTIN: . . . Do you have, like, a really great mom who's always calling you up and telling you, Omar, remember, put some money in your savings account? (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)GREEN: Well, yeah, I certainly did when I was in school. My parents were really, really good about that sort of thing. But really, it was the combination of seeing all the great customer research that I had access to when I was at Intuit, but also at the same time getting exposed to the work of folks like Daniel Kahneman, who's a cognitive scientist, wrote a great book called \"Thinking, Fast and Slow,\" that sort of changed my thinking about how to build things. But also the work of a number of behavioral economists and I just - I'm one of those guys that reads a lot of stuff, and so some day I just put those two things together in a kind of strange way and realized that no one had built technology that was supposed to help me with my money decisions when I was actually making them. I can maybe, with my engineering background and with a little help from some folks, be able to build a tool that works when I'm actually standing in line at the grocery store with, you know, 3-year-old kids screaming up and down the aisles and be able to make the right kind of decisions that I need to make, because this thing has done a lot of that sit-down-at-the-desk thinking for me and can prompt me to do the right things. MARTIN: Just don't forget my birthday present, OK? GREEN: Never. MARTIN: OK. Omar Green is the CEO and cofounder of wallet. AI. He joined us from San Francisco, California. Omar Green, thank you.

Every weekend, a group of men and women goes out on the San Francisco Bay and does just that, pushing their bodies and nerves to the limit. Emily Green has the story of the Bay Area Association of Disabled Sailors. EMILY GREEN, BYLINE: I'm at Pier 40 on the San Francisco Bay, and the dock is awash in activity. Chris Rubke situates his daughter, Cristina, in her boat. CHRIS RUBKE: Now I'm getting ready to tie down her - the board that holds her chin control under her chin. OK, that feel snug? CRISTINA RUBKE: Yeah. RUBKE: OK. GREEN: Cristina Rubke was born with arthrogryposis, which makes her unable to use her arms or legs. Even so, she's become a corporate lawyer and gets around town on her own. But sailing, using just her chin? That seemed crazy even to her. RUBKE: I was just coming by here and met some of the folks. I mean, the funny thing was that they were telling me that they could rig a boat with a chin control and that I could sail with my chin, and I really, really didn't believe them. So - but then a few months later, it happened. GREEN: The way it works is that in the boat, a small mechanical box with one joystick and two levers sits on a board beneath her chin. If she pushes the joystick to the left or right, that controls the direction of the boat. If she pushes it front to back, that moves the sails in or out. All of the boats are made especially so that they're almost impossible to flip. But as volunteer organizations go, parts frequently break down, and all the volunteers, like Cristina's dad, Chris, are often fix-it-as-you-go mechanics. RUBKE: I'm making this up as I go along. As always. (LAUGHTER)GREEN: Just how complicated are these boats to rig? RUBKE: Just complicated enough. I think that's the right answer. (LAUGHTER)RUBKE: They're not that bad. There's just a lot of little tricks. GREEN: For the disabled sailors, the group provides a sense of freedom. For some of the participants, it's enough to be out on the water. For others, like Kathi Pugh, the drive is more competitive. Pugh was a serious athlete before she broke her neck in a skiing accident when she was 20. KATHI PUGH: So to have something that I can really compete again is really exciting. GREEN: Last year, she placed third in the U. S. Disabled Sailing Championships. (SOUNDBITE OF CRANE)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Woo-hoo. GREEN: Using a crane, Kathi is hoisted up out of her wheelchair and lowered into the boat. One by one, she and the other sailors push off to race each other around buoys placed in the bay. (SOUNDBITE OF MOTORBOAT)CHARLES CUNNINGHAM: You all good? GREEN: Charles Cunningham is at the helm of a motorboat to keep an eye on the sailors. CUNNINGHAM: You all good? You good? You got to do to a 360 now. GREEN: The boats round a buoy, and Cristina and Kathi are neck and neck. Just barely, Cristina edges out Kathi. CUNNINGHAM: What happened is Christine took the wind out of Kat's sail. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Yeah, that's for sure. GREEN: Then, a little while later, there's a distress signal from Kathi. The electronic switches she relies on to manage the boat have stopped working. We pull up next to her on the water. She's amazingly calm. PUGH: We've been having some problems with our circuit board, and now I have like no tiller, no jibs, sporadic main. CUNNINGHAM: Tell the fleet that we are going to tow her in. GREEN: At the end of the day, it's Cristina who has won four out of five of the races. In this sailing club, it doesn't matter if you can use your arms or legs or, as in Cristina's case, just her chin. Anyone can win. For NPR News, I'm Emily Green, in San Francisco.

GREEN: Charles Cunningham is at the helm of a motorboat to keep an eye on the sailors. CUNNINGHAM: You all good? You good? You got to do to a 360 now. GREEN: The boats round a buoy, and Cristina and Kathi are neck and neck. Just barely, Cristina edges out Kathi. CUNNINGHAM: What happened is Christine took the wind out of Kat's sail. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Yeah, that's for sure. GREEN: Then, a little while later, there's a distress signal from Kathi. The electronic switches she relies on to manage the boat have stopped working. We pull up next to her on the water. She's amazingly calm. PUGH: We've been having some problems with our circuit board, and now I have like no tiller, no jibs, sporadic main. CUNNINGHAM: Tell the fleet that we are going to tow her in. GREEN: At the end of the day, it's Cristina who has won four out of five of the races. In this sailing club, it doesn't matter if you can use your arms or legs or, as in Cristina's case, just her chin. Anyone can win. For NPR News, I'm Emily Green, in San Francisco.

Now, the roaming writer wants to know what else is on the minds of his fellow St. Louis residents. And to do so, Henry Goldkamp has placed almost 40 typewriters across the city, posing the somewhat blunt question: What The Hell Is St Louis Thinking? St. Louis Public Radio's Erin Williams helps him find out. ERIN WILLIAMS, BYLINE: Typically, 21st century writers fall into two technical categories: Mac or PC. But poet Henry Goldkamp would much rather use a typewriter. (SOUNDBITE OF TYPEWRITER)WILLIAMS: He's the sole owner of a mobile poetry business. For the past three years, he's spent his weekends going around St. Louis, banging out short poems for anyone who stops by his table. HENRY GOLDKAMP: People can seem very distant and closed off here. A lot of people - you think - keep to themselves, but at least through this medium, I mean, people tell me things that I can't even believe. They've got their hearts on their sleeve, and that's a great thing. It's an emotional town. WILLIAMS: Goldkamp is a tall, bearded 25-year-old, whose day job is working construction. He says he's found that some moments deserve more than a five minute interaction. So he came up with the idea from a public project. Goldkamp has installed nearly 40 typewriters and paper at stores, bars, parks - even in people's homes all around St. Louis. Passers-by are encouraged to stop and type out just how they feel about the city and its effects on their lives. GOLDKAMP: This is about as honest as a definition of the city as you can get. I mean, what better defines a city than the inhabitants themselves? WILLIAMS: Over in the calm and kitschy Central West End neighborhood, Eric Murphy is a little baffled by the concept of typing out his feelings. ERIC MURPHY: I don't know. I think it's a parody on technology. I'm in my early thirties - I have no idea how to use a typewriter. WILLIAMS: The process was better understood over at record store Vintage Vinyl, where 17-year-old Nick Goldschmidt decided to type a simple, poignant sentence in memory of local music icon Bob Reuter, who was also his mentor. NICK GOLDSCHMIDT: It's not as personal as writing it down with a pencil and paper, but it kind of makes you work for it because you have to punch in the freaking keys because they're so, like, you know, it's hard. Definitely more personal than, you know, a computer. WILLIAMS: And Julie Linder, who stood at a typewriter in front of the restaurant Crown Candy Kitchen in the Old North Neighborhood, really enjoyed feeling interconnected feelings through the process. JULIE LINDER: It feels more human - it was interesting talking to the person next to me and trying to figure out how to work the typewriter; and the fact that we're sharing this moment and in some way we feel like we're kind of making a difference. WILLIAMS: Liesel Fenner is the public art manager at Americans for the Arts in Washington D. C. She says that the typewriter's inability to delete gives the final product deeper meaning than the random iterations that today's technology calls for. LIESEL FENNER: Successful public art engages the viewer, and whether that's hands on participation or the viewer coming away with a tangible change in how they experienced that space, that place, is a really lasting impact for years to come.

And now there are apps that can measure your blood pressure, your glucose level. It can take and EKG or an ultrasound. It can even monitor your sleep. You need an add-on gadget to plug into your phone to do these things, but in many cases, it's a lot cheaper than getting the actual lab test done. So what medical apps are out there? Dr. Eric Topol is the author of \"The Creative Destruction of Medicine,\" also director of the Scripps Translational Science Institute in La Jolla, California. Welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Eric. DR. ERIC TOPOL: Thanks very much, Ira. Great to be with you. FLATOW: Give us an idea of what kind of apps that are out there for folks? TOPOL: Well, it's quite a menu. You touch on a few, like being able to do your cardiogram through your phone, your blood pressure, your glucose. But it goes well beyond that. You can measure to find out if you have sleep apnea. You can get your eyes refracted. You can monitor your posture and how much you're sitting continuously. And then things are going forward with respect to depression, mood, stress, asthma, detection before an attack. So it's just an incredible burgeoning area. FLATOW: All right. Well, now without endorsing any of them, I want to actually get into the names of some of these apps because people are going to go on to the App Store and have a look at them. So give me your top few picks for your favorite app? TOPOL: Well, it's a tough one, Ira. Because I'm a cardiologist, obviously I like the cardiogram, and I get a lot of my patients to monitor when they think they're having a heart rhythm problem. So there's two that do that, AliveCor and ECG Check. And so they both have a case that fits on an iPhone, and I think they're both going to also work with Droid phones. I also recommend to my patients those - almost all of them have high blood pressure. So there's two really good apps for that, iHealth and Withings that connect to either a wrist cuff or an arm cuff. And then you get your blood pressures all charted on a really nice single screen graph. I could go on. There's just so many choices. FLATOW: Well, keep going. Go on. Let's talk about the - I'm fascinated by the glucose levels. So many people have diabetes and they're monitoring their glucose. This is something where you don't have to prick your finger for blood. You don't need a blood sample. TOPOL: Not quite. Not yet. FLATOW: Not quite? Not yet? TOPOL: Well, they exist. But they're not yet through the FDA. They're kind of in the queue. So now, you still have to do a fingerstick, but instead of having a separate device to do that analysis, it actually can go right to the phone. There's an iBGStar device that you can get at Apple Stores or order it online, and that basically can get your glucose all charted and, you know, it's a very nice, convenient thing. But we do want to get rid of fingersticks. FLATOW: What was the name? Yeah. What was of name of that? TOPOL: It's called iBG. It stands for I Blood Glucose Star. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. OK. TOPOL: And that's - these are all add-ons, so they all are - all these things require an attachment to the smartphone. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. What about an ultrasound app? TOPOL: Well, that one's not quite an app. But there are a couple of handheld, high-resolution ultrasound devices that also function as a phone. So you can't turn your smartphone into an ultrasound device, but you can get an ultrasound device that functions as a smartphone and you can send your images wirelessly. And so there's two: one is called the Vscan, GE, and other one is Mobisante. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. 1-800-989-8255 is our number, if you'd like to suggest an app or you have one that you think we should know about. Now everybody, sooner or later, looses sleep and we're all talking about sleepless nights. Is there an app to monitor your sleep? TOPOL: Oh, there's about 50 of them. (LAUGHTER)TOPOL: The problem, Ira, is that they don't measure sleep that accurately. They basically are relying on movement during sleep, which, you know, it's not like actually measuring your brainwaves. And so that one - you get a loose sense about the quality of sleep and duration of sleep. But it isn't really a hard data, you know, not that accurate. But since you mentioned sleep, you know, one of the most important things out there is the sleep apnea that is stopping breathing. And now you can get a smartphone connect to measure through your finger your oxygen throughout the night and your heart rate through the night. So you can get a really good screen for whether you have sleep apnea or not and whether the treatment for it is working. FLATOW: And what's the name of that app? TOPOL: Well, the one that I've used is Masimo, a Masimo app. That's the company that makes it. And it's - it really - it's a great screening tool. And it's - it can be reused. So if you have any other friends that have potential sleep apnea or your family, you can just pass it around. FLATOW: Yeah. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. I'm Ira Flatow, talking with Dr. Eric Topol, author of \"The Creative Destruction of Medicine,\" about useful medical apps. Do you - in your practice, do you - are there some patients who are just never going to get the hang of using an app and. . . TOPOL: You know, you would have thought that as I did. But what I'm learning is because people are getting their own data about their body and their medical condition, it's amazing how they quickly become data driven. And this is the one reason that people will really get into smartphones because it's really preserving their health. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Let's go to the phones. Let's go to Chicago with - Mohammad(ph) is in Chicago. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. MOHAMMAD: Hi. Thanks a lot for taking my call. FLATOW: Yeah. MOHAMMAD: I just wanted your guest to comment on people using these devices as a replacement for seeing the doctor because I can definitely see myself even on that slippery slope of jumping on Wikipedia, reading a few articles, not knowing all the information and coming to a conclusion that is, you know, at best fallacious, sometimes dangerous. FLATOW: Good question, Mohammad. Thanks for calling. What about that, Eric? TOPOL: Well, that's a really great point. And what a lot of these apps and add-ons do is essentially set up a bypass of the doctor so that algorithms are used. So, for example, there's one that you can convert the smartphone to an otoscope to look at a child's ear to see whether they have an infection. And that image, which is magnified, is sent to the cloud, algorithm interprets whether the child has an ear infection. Well, you don't even have to go to the doctor, for example, and you know whether there's a problem. So the problem of all this is when is it right to bypass the doctor and when do you want to consult with the doctor. And that's a whole new look that we never had before in this era of unplugged medicine. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. What was the name of that app, by the way? TOPOL: That's CellScope. FLATOW: CellScope. Are there any other ones that you know that normal doctor tools can be replaced with that we might use? TOPOL: Yeah. Well, if you're trying to get your eyes refracted and you don't want to go to the optometrist, there's a $2 add-on from EyeNetra that you can get your eyes refracted and a text made to get your glasses. It's a text for your glasses to be made, and it's a pretty convenient way to get your eye exam. FLATOW: Wow. TOPOL: There's, of course, the skin apps where you take a picture of a suspicious skin lesion. And there are algorithms that will tell you whether you should go to a dermatologist, have a biopsy or not. And some of those actually are quite well-validated, some are not. At one point. . . FLATOW: Give me a well-validated one. TOPOL: I think the skinScan and the University of Michigan skin app, which actually is - that's probably the best validate - those are probably the two that I'm most familiar with that I have confidence in. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. What app do you want to see that doesn't exist? TOPOL: Oh, gosh. Well, we want to have apps that will, for example, make asthma attacks a historical footnote because you can get lung function through the microphone of the smartphone, and you can put a band-aids on that would pick up air quality, pollution and all the other vital signs. So the whole idea would be not to ever get to the point where you're having wheezing, but you pick that up beforehand. There are also some really nice collections of sensors for detecting mood and depression. And hopefully that could help some people who are really getting severely depressed and make sure that whatever treatment they are getting is adequate. We'd love to have a heart attack app that predicts a heart attack, of course, days or couple weeks ahead of time so that can be prevented. FLATOW: Hmm. And, of course, these would also require an attachment, some sort of transducer of some sorts. TOPOL: Yeah. I don't think you're going to get away with any of these except for the skin lesion that you can do a picture. But otherwise, you're talking about add-ons to the phone. FLATOW: Do you see an app that could do DNA analysis at your home? TOPOL: Absolutely. Oh, I'm glad you mentioned that, Ira. So that other big thing about smartphones is with this so-called lab on a chip add-on, microfluidics. You can make that into a laboratory. So you can do a DNA - you can't do a whole sequence now, but you could do a genotype for a drug interaction. And you can also do things like thyroid function test, liver function test, kidney function test. So there's so much you could do. It's not yet available for consumers, but it will be in the near future. FLATOW: Yeah. We'll see that gene analysis coming real soon now also, I think so. Thank you, Eric, for taking time to be with us today. TOPOL: Sure. Great to talk with you, Ira. FLATOW: Good information.

We'd love to have a heart attack app that predicts a heart attack, of course, days or couple weeks ahead of time so that can be prevented. FLATOW: Hmm. And, of course, these would also require an attachment, some sort of transducer of some sorts. TOPOL: Yeah. I don't think you're going to get away with any of these except for the skin lesion that you can do a picture. But otherwise, you're talking about add-ons to the phone. FLATOW: Do you see an app that could do DNA analysis at your home? TOPOL: Absolutely. Oh, I'm glad you mentioned that, Ira. So that other big thing about smartphones is with this so-called lab on a chip add-on, microfluidics. You can make that into a laboratory. So you can do a DNA - you can't do a whole sequence now, but you could do a genotype for a drug interaction. And you can also do things like thyroid function test, liver function test, kidney function test. So there's so much you could do. It's not yet available for consumers, but it will be in the near future. FLATOW: Yeah. We'll see that gene analysis coming real soon now also, I think so. Thank you, Eric, for taking time to be with us today. TOPOL: Sure. Great to talk with you, Ira. FLATOW: Good information.

I'm Scott Simon. Coming up, A. J. Jacobs with some tennis trivia you won't hear anywhere else - boy, I hope it's true. But first, why worry about mobile phones when you can let someone know what's on your mind with no costly monthly contract? Two researchers at the University of Washington made a move - if you please - in that direction. Rajesh Rao is a professor of computer science. RAJESH RAO: I've always been fascinated by, you know, science fiction stories of telepathy and, you know, the mind meld and so on. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"STAR TREK\")SIMON: That's the Vulcan mind meld, which - all Trekkies to the contrary - is still fiction. Recently, Professor Rao and a collaborator sat down in separate labs of the University of Washington. RAO: I was wearing something that looks like a swim cap with these electrodes, these little wires to record my brain signals from the surface of my head. SIMON: Then Professor Rao started playing a video game. (SOUNDBITE OF BEEPING)RAO: I was trying to shoot these bad guys, these rockets being fired by a pirate ship. SIMON: Now, to shoot these bad guys, you have to hit the space bar on a keyboard. But Rajesh Rao just thought about hitting it and hoped his thought would travel electronically to cause a gentle zap in his friend's brain that would make him hit another keyboard. RAO: So, I would be imagining moving my right hand, and the computer would convey that signal over to Andrea on the other side of campus. ANDREA STOCCO: I was wearing a swim cap, and I was sitting on this chair, like a dentist's chair. And at that point I just wait. SIMON: That's Andrea Stocco, a psychology professor, who was, in this one moment, just a well-educated guinea pig with his finger over a keyboard. He couldn't see the video game. STOCCO: I was there. I was absolutely relaxing down on this chair. And I just noticed that my hand moved. RAO: His brain had then initiated the finger movement on his side. The finger movement then triggered the keyboard press, and that caused the rocket to be destroyed on my side. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Yes, success. STOCCO: I could see my collaborators that were in the lab, like cheering and they had this kind of big smiles and big eyes and I knew we had made it. And that was a great moment. SIMON: Now, this was just a small pilot study, but technology like this might eventually help people who are paralyzed to move. Rajesh Rao says it's not mind control. He didn't fill his friend's mind with complex, personal thoughts. And for his part, Professor Stocco just feels a little slighted to be the one who was getting zapped. STOCCO: That has been the recurring joke that the next turn we should swap chairs. (SOUNDBITE OF BEEPING) SCOTT SIMON, HOST:   This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. I'm Scott Simon. Coming up, A. J.

I'm Robert Siegel. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: And I'm Audie Cornish. Apple unveiled two new phones today. One of them, the iPhone 5C, is a lower-priced phone aimed at customers in the developing world. The other, a high-end model, comes with a fingerprint scanner called Touch ID. Now, the unveiling comes as the company faces pressure on several fronts - from rival phone makers, and from Wall Street investors clamoring for breakthrough products. NPR's Laura Sydell was at the product announcement today at Apple headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. , and joins us now. And Laura, let's start with the thing everybody is talking about, which is this fingerprint reader. What more can you tell us about it? LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE: Well, it is indeed a fingerprint reader. When you put your finger on the home button on the iPhone, it reads your finger; and it will automatically unlock your phone. And of course, for those people who are sick of remembering passwords, it's one less password to remember. And it will also, at this point, work with a few apps, I think. And I guess what - in terms of breakthroughs, it could potentially start something. Other companies could say - if it's popular,  they could start to add fingerprint instead of password. CORNISH: So what are some of the privacy and security concerns that, I assume, people will have when it comes to connecting your fingerprints to your phone? (LAUGHTER)SYDELL: Yeah, it does seem a little creepy, doesn't it? Well, this is what Apple says. Apple says that it is only on your phone. It is not going into the Cloud. You have possession of your fingerprints. And it's optional. So if you're uncomfortable using your fingerprint as an ID, you don't have to use it. CORNISH: Now, perhaps the biggest change for Apple is actually this new, low-cost version of the iPhone. How is it different from the other models? SYDELL: Well, you know, Jony Ive, the lead designer for Apple, said it's unapologetically plastic - which is kind of funny because Apple has always prided itself in using aluminum and these very high-quality materials. But the back of this is a solid sheet of plastic, and it comes in many different colors. So that's one of the biggest differences. It is not as powerful as, of course, as the new iPhone 5S. But in many ways, you know, it's up to par, I think, with maybe like an iPhone 4S. [POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: The iPhone 5C is comparable to the iPhone 5. ] So it looks pretty good. But I think the plastic is really the biggest change - and the price. You can get one for as little as 99 bucks for a two-year contract. And if you want to get the higher-end iPhone, that's going to cost you $199 to get in. CORNISH: So this low-cost version of the iPhone - I mean, what's the thinking behind this? What's the motivation? SYDELL: Apple's shareholders have not been happy. The company is losing market share, particularly in China and India and developing countries, because they don't have a product that's more reasonably priced. So other companies - like Samsung, in particular - are able to get into these markets. The idea here is, indeed, to try and give people an offering they can afford, that's got, you know, the Apple - the sexy Apple name behind it. And when they showed off an ad for the new product, they showed people of many colors from all over the world. And of course, the phone itself, the plastic comes in many colors. So I guess the question is whether or not just lowering the price will be enough. It's still probably going to be fairly expensive, compared to some of the other phones that are in the developing world. CORNISH: That's NPR's Laura Sydell. Laura, thanks so much.

SEBASTIAN THRUN: Well, you can test it out today. Just get yourself a cab driver and then read the newspaper, fall asleep, text, spend your time better. And then imagine the car driving itself without a taxi driver. RAZ: In other words, a driverless car. And Sebastian Thrun is one of the engineers behind Google's model. Now in some ways, that future of commuting is already here, at least for Sebastian, who's got his own driverless car. THRUN: When I take it to Lake Tahoe with my wife, I can either drive myself as a human driver or I can have the car drive me. And my wife usually begs me to let the car drive. Why? She actually feels safer. If you look at the ability of a self-driving car to stay in the lane and not to speed and keep a good distance to the car in front of you, it actually does better than me. RAZ: We're talking about a future in which, potentially, there are no accidents. THRUN: That would be fantastic. If we could do away with traffic accidents, that'd be wonderful. There'd be more than a million people saved every year on this planet. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)THRUN: Driving accidents are the number one cause of death for young people. And do you realize that almost all of those are due to human error and not machine error and can therefore be prevented by machines? Do you realize that we could change the capacity of highways by a factor of two or three if we didn't rely on human precision on staying in a lane, but on robotic precision? They would drive a little bit closer together, a little bit narrower lanes and do away with all traffic jams on highways. RAZ: It sounds totally amazing. So how does it work? THRUN: Well, it works by putting basically a computer into the driver's seat, so to speak. And adding robotic eyes, mostly on the roof of the vehicle actually. And they have this nice property. They can actually measure how far things are away. There's no texting, there's no distraction, they're always awake and they always see everything. RAZ: You could imagine a future in which - I don't know - you would go on a road trip across the country and you would strap yourself into like, a bed and fall asleep. THRUN: Yeah. RAZ: While the car drove through the night. THRUN: Just like a train. RAZ: Wow. THRUN: We do this with trains all the time. RAZ: Yeah. THRUN: Absolutely. And it has the same convenience as a car because it would bring you exactly to where you want to go. RAZ: So everybody would have their own, like, personal chauffeur. THRUN: I think it would be great. Honestly, the average American spends about 52 minutes a day in commute traffic. And as much as I love driving my car and many people like driving their car, commuting has never been fun for me. So if I could, like, shave off these 52 minutes a day, I could be significantly more productive. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)THRUN: This is 4 billion hours wasted in this country alone and is 2. 4 billion gallons of gasoline wasted. Now I think there's a vision here, a new technology and I'm really looking forward to a time when generations after us look back at us and say how ridiculous it was that humans were driving cars. RAZ: What more needs to happen now? I mean, how do you make the technology better or is it already there? THRUN: So we have to really get to the point where the technology is much more reliable. We have one incident every 50,000 or so miles. And if you had a chauffeur that would have one incident every four years, you would probably not like your chauffeur. And the cases that really concern us are all these rare things like the deer on the highway. So there's enough of these really kind of - I call them freak situations out there that we have to fix before we can be confident. But once we get there, it's going to be really amazing. RAZ: We could save the planet and gasoline and lives and we could maximize our time and be more efficient. And so, like - so when can I get one of these? I mean, how long? THRUN: I hope it's going to be less than five years. RAZ: Less than five years. THRUN: And five years in the Internet age is the world, but five years in the automotive age is actually not very much. RAZ: So you think that within five years people will be sitting in the passenger seat while their car drives them to work? THRUN: And back. RAZ: Sebastian Thrun.

NICHOLAS NEGROPONTE: I think that I'm a futurist by having felt that I've been there. So it's taking some place where you are and you're doing and sort of looking out as to what it might mean further on. It's a little bit like a traveler who's come back from being in a country. RAZ: And in that sense, Nicholas Negroponte has been traveling for years. As we mentioned earlier in the show, he spoke at the first-ever TED Conference in 1984 and he predicted touchscreens would be a big part of our lives some day. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)NEGROPONTE: I'm very interested in touch-sensitive displays, high-tech, high-touch. And a lot of people think that fingers are a very low-resolution sort of stylus for input into a display. In fact they're not. RAZ: Why was Nicholas Negroponte at the front end of so much of this stuff, and had his team at the MIT Media Lab predict, with so much confidence, so many of the things we'd be using? NEGROPONTE: I think we were very arrogant. In fact, people thought it was quite arrogant to suggest that this would be part of daily life. I was actually asked once to chair a session for an organization that doesn't even exist anymore. And I said I would if it could be called, computers in daily life. And they said, what do you mean? What is that? And so, it's. . . RAZ: And so how did you connect the dots? I mean, were you seeing what other researchers were doing? NEGROPONTE: Well, we did a great deal of it ourselves. We had access to one of the world's first continuous speech-recognition systems. We had access to really one of the first very large-screen, floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall displays. And we had access to a device that was done for fighter pilots, actually, that you could track its position in six dimensions - where it is in space. And we put the three of them together and made a system, perhaps one of the best I've ever been involved with in my life, where the user could stand in front of the screen, wear this thing on his or her wrist, and talk to the screen and say, put that there - with a gesture - and whatever was on the screen would move. So that's the sort of things we were doing back in the early and mid-seventies. RAZ: But that technology never really took off. I mean, we don't use that today. NEGROPONTE: Well, we certainly use speech with Siri, and you use touch with a lot of things. Putting them together still is slightly behind, but there's some people starting to - 'cause cell phones, everybody's looking for some kind of competitive edge - and there're people who are starting to use the camera now to look at you while you're looking at it. A lot more eye tracking will happen. Things will - again, this is pretty predictable in the next couple of years. RAZ: Do you think about the future a lot? I mean, about the things that'll change our world in say 10 or 20 years from now? NEGROPONTE: Well, I do spend time trying to think about what I cannot imagine. And whatever it is will be at the interface of silicon and biology. It's not going to be, you know, the iPhone 7 or the, you know, the Internet 2. And I think we're going to see things happen that are, you know, astonishing in terms of working at very, very small scales going down to the nanotechnology world that is going to surprise us what people do. Some of the things happening in biology, in genomics, in protonomics - it's going to be extraordinary, and the changes are going to be huge.

What is that? And so, it's. . . RAZ: And so how did you connect the dots? I mean, were you seeing what other researchers were doing? NEGROPONTE: Well, we did a great deal of it ourselves. We had access to one of the world's first continuous speech-recognition systems. We had access to really one of the first very large-screen, floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall displays. And we had access to a device that was done for fighter pilots, actually, that you could track its position in six dimensions - where it is in space. And we put the three of them together and made a system, perhaps one of the best I've ever been involved with in my life, where the user could stand in front of the screen, wear this thing on his or her wrist, and talk to the screen and say, put that there - with a gesture - and whatever was on the screen would move. So that's the sort of things we were doing back in the early and mid-seventies. RAZ: But that technology never really took off. I mean, we don't use that today. NEGROPONTE: Well, we certainly use speech with Siri, and you use touch with a lot of things. Putting them together still is slightly behind, but there's some people starting to - 'cause cell phones, everybody's looking for some kind of competitive edge - and there're people who are starting to use the camera now to look at you while you're looking at it. A lot more eye tracking will happen. Things will - again, this is pretty predictable in the next couple of years. RAZ: Do you think about the future a lot? I mean, about the things that'll change our world in say 10 or 20 years from now? NEGROPONTE: Well, I do spend time trying to think about what I cannot imagine. And whatever it is will be at the interface of silicon and biology. It's not going to be, you know, the iPhone 7 or the, you know, the Internet 2. And I think we're going to see things happen that are, you know, astonishing in terms of working at very, very small scales going down to the nanotechnology world that is going to surprise us what people do. Some of the things happening in biology, in genomics, in protonomics - it's going to be extraordinary, and the changes are going to be huge.

I'm Guy Raz. And today's show is all about predictions, connecting the dots from everything we see around us today to what we might actually have in the future. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)RICHARD RESNICK: Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the human genome. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: This is Richard Resnick on the TED stage. He runs a genetic software company. And behind him on the stage, a picture of 46 chromosomes. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)RESNICK: If you zoom in on this genome, what you see, of course, is this double helix structure. The code of life spelled out with these four biochemical letters or we call them bases, right. A, C, G and T. How many are there in the human genome? Three billion. And, perhaps because of its size, a group of people - all, by the way, with Y chromosomes - decided that they would want to sequence it. RAZ: Which they did, an amazing scientific feat. They mapped the code that makes up all human DNA. Now they're still trying to figure out what it means, but they already know what it could mean for the future. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)RESNICK: The world has completely changed and none of you know about it. RAZ: So how is it going to change the world? RESNICK: In a bunch of ways. The good news is it's going to help us immensely in treating cancer 'cause cancer is nothing more than a disease of the genome. It's a disease where one cell has certain changes, which cause it to get a little bit worse and then it reproduces. And by the time you've got a solid tumor, you've got this really heterogeneous population of cancerous cells. And if you sequence their genomes, they're a mess. And so right now, prior to genome sequencing, we're taking wild guesses at what the molecular basis of one's cancer is. And now going forward, what we're going to do is say, forget all of that, what is happening at the molecular level because this drug can target only those cancers that have the BRAF mutation, as an example. RAZ: So where is it headed? What can you imagine in 10 or 20 years or beyond? RESNICK: I think we will cure cancer. Genomics and sequencing at large will ultimately cure cancer. Whether that happens in 10 years or 50 years or more is difficult to say. RAZ: That's incredible. I mean, you can say that with total confidence? RESNICK: Absolutely. At some point, we'll snuff it out. I mean, people will still develop cancer, certainly, unless we get into genetic engineering of humans, which is something we ought to talk about, but it will be curable. RAZ: So what about other diseases? I mean, could you detect those by sequencing genes? RESNICK: Oh, that's not distant future. That's happening right now. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)RESNICK: So here's little Nick. Nick shows up at the children's hospital with this distended belly like a famine victim, and it's not that he's not eating. It's that when he eats, his intestine basically opens up and feces spill out into his gut. So a hundred surgeries later, right, he looks at his mom and says, Mom, please pray for me. I'm in so much pain. His pediatrician happens to have a background in clinical genetics and he has no idea what's going on, but he says let's get this kid's genome sequenced. And what they find is a single-point mutation in a gene responsible for controlling programmed cell death. So the theory is that he's having some immunological reaction to what's going on to the food, essentially, right. And so this informs, among other things, of course, a treatment for bone marrow transplant, which he undertakes. And after nine months of grueling recovery, he's now eating steak with A. 1. sauce. The prospect of using the genome as a universal diagnostic is upon us today. It's here. And what it means for all of us is that everybody in this room could live an extra 5, 10, 20 years just because of this one thing. RAZ: So walk us, like, 10 years from now or 20 years from now. You go into your doctor's office and something's wrong. I mean, this is going to be a normal part of seeing the doctor in the future? RESNICK: Oh, yeah. Absolutely. There's a new company called Oxford Nanopore now that has one of these sequencing machines. Instead of it taking up a whole room and costing $500,000, it's the size of an iPhone. And so it'll be so cheap to do this that it will become, you know, trivial, why wouldn't we just have a look? And I think if you come to the hospital and you're sick, somebody's going to be looking at DNA. RAZ: How fast is this happening? RESNICK: Faster than we can keep up with. You know, every week, there's a new company, there's a new test, there's a new competitor trying to create space in this industry for genetic testing. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)RESNICK: Consumer applications for genomics, they will flourish. Want to see whether you're genetically compatible with your girlfriend? Sure. DNA sequencing on your iPhone. There's an app for that. Personalized genomic massage, anyone? There's already a lab today that tests for allele 334 of the AVPR1 gene, the so-called cheating gene. So anybody whose here today with your significant other, just turn over to them and swab their mouth, send it to the lab and you'll know for sure. Do you really want to elect a president whose genome suggests cardiomyopathy? Now think of it. It's 2016, and the leading candidate releases not only her four years of back tax returns, but also her personal genome. And it looks really good and then she challenges all of her competitors to do the same. Do you think that's not going to happen? You think it would have helped John McCain? My father's father is one of ten Resnick brothers. They all hated each other, right. And they all moved to different parts of the planet, so it's likely that I'm related to every Resnick that I ever meet, but I don't know. So imagine if my genome were de-identified, sitting in software, right, and a third cousin's genome was also sitting there, and there was software that could compare these two and make these associations. Would you be willing to meet your third cousin? And if we both say yes, voila. Welcome to chromosomally LinkedIn, right. (LAUGHTER)RAZ: This is amazing, but I mean, it's also a little bit scary. RESNICK: Yeah, very scary. What we've discovered recently is that the entire genome of your baby in the mother's womb is circulating in the mother's blood. It's all there. With a simple blood draw, we can look at a baby's entire genome. So it's not so difficult to imagine looking at the same genes to try to understand whether your baby is going to have genes that are good for them. And so now you get into this very different world of designing babies by trial and error. RAZ: Is that science fiction or do you think that that might be within the realm of human possibility? RESNICK: No. It's technically possible right now. You could do that in a test tube. All the technology is available to do that today. It's up to us to as a society to figure out whether we want to have that happen. The knee-jerk is my, God, no. It's going to be Gattaca. It's going to be everything that we hate. But, you know, I mean, I'm a short, bald, Jewish guy with a bad back. If I could have had the choice to have genes that, you know, made my back not so painful and, you know, tall, with broad shoulders and long locks of hair well into my. . . RAZ: Ryan Gosling body. RESNICK: Right, you know. I mean, why wouldn't you choose that? And so it's time to answer the question. And I'm not taking a side on this question, but this is now a question that our society, in 2013, has to grapple with. RAZ: How long before the moment a baby comes into the world - like, their genome is sequenced in the hospital and we'll be able to know everything about that baby, about what will happen to that baby, physically? RESNICK: Less than 10 years. There's all sorts of discussions right now in the genetics community about, you know, sequencing babies upon birth and how that's going to affect health care in the future. The issue, of course, is sometimes you don't want to know. You don't want to know, and so how do you manage keeping that information in a place where the human can decide whether to look at it or not. There's - as soon as you get into this question of genetics and whether, you know, a genome should be sequenced, then all these ethical questions come out about what that means for the individual. RAZ: Have you sequenced your own genome? RESNICK: No. RAZ: Why not? RESNICK: Because I don't want to know. I don't want to - you know. I mean, if I were sick, I would do it for a diagnostic reason, but not for a prognostic reason. And that's the advice that I would give to anybody 'cause you may find a variant that suggests that you're going to get really sick with something terrible and it may never happen. And anyway, now that it's out there, there are times when certain agencies, like a life insurance, can have the right to look at that and make a guess. And in a world where every digital breadcrumb you leave behind can be tracked and looked at and watched, I would rather not have that information out there. RAZ: If you had, you know, like, a crystal ball and you could ask it anything about the field of genetic testing, and you wanted to know something for sure, what would you ask it? RESNICK: I guess I'd want to understand whether we're going to screw this one up, you know. I'd want to understand whether we can, in the 20, 50, 100-year future, whether we can wield this technology in a way that doesn't impinge upon people's basic human rights, but maximizes the benefits that could come from the technology. So where are we? What happened? How did we do? Is cancer still around? Is malaria been wiped out? Are babies still made the way that they're made today? I'd love to see how it all works out. RAZ: Richard Resnick. He runs a company called GenomeQuest, which makes genomic software. You can hear his entire talk at TED. com. GUY RAZ, HOST:  It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz.

Which is what Mark Goodman worries about. He used to be a beat cop with the LA police department and now he studies the future of crime and terrorism. MARK GOODMAN: Today I'm going to show you the flip side of all those technologies that we marvel at. The ones that we love. In the hands of the TED community these are awesome tools which will bring about great change for our world. But in the hands of suicide bombers, the future can look quite different. RAZ: And Mark Goodman believes we all caught a glimpse of that future in November 2008, when 10 men - just 10 men - brought a city of 20 million people to a standstill in Mumbai, India. (SOUNDBITE OF NEWS REPORT)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: . . . We're continuing to follow the deadly coordinated terror attacks there across the city. More than 80 people have been killed. Here's the latest report. . . (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)GOODMAN: The men that carried that attack out were armed with AK-47s, explosives and hand grenades. But heavy artillery is nothing new in terrorist operations. Guns and bombs are nothing new. What was different this time is the way that the terrorists used modern information communications technologies to locate additional victims and slaughter them. RAZ: So how did they do it? GOODMAN: What was different is that the terrorists innovated a terrorist ops center. So at the very same time that the attack was taking place on the ground in Mumbai there was an op center back in Pakistan monitoring, in real time, Al Jazeera. (SOUNDBITE OF NEWS REPORT)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: The police have cordoned off all of the areas in south Mumbai. . . GOODMAN: CNN. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: Reporting live from the scene as the Taj Hotel. . . GOODMAN: BBC. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #4: What you're hearing is a lot of explosions. . . GOODMAN: . . . As well as the Internet and they were culling all of that data for intelligence related to the attack and relaying that information to their terrorist operatives on the ground in real time. And that was something that we had never seen before. RAZ: The main target was a luxury hotel in downtown. It's called the Taj. And during the siege the terrorists went from room. . . GOODMAN: . . . to room and on the top floor of Taj there was a big suite. RAZ: They found a man hiding in his room. They tied him up and they interrogated him. GOODMAN: And they said to him, who are you? And what are you doing here? K. R. RAMAMOORTHY: So I said that I am a teacher. RAZ: This is that man, K. R. Ramamoorthy. RAMAMOORTHY: Then they asked me, where from you come? I said I come from Bangalore. GOODMAN: The terrorists were dumb but they weren't that dumb and they know that no Indian schoolteacher could afford to stay in the Taj, let alone in a suite. RAMAMOORTHY: They say what is your name? I said K. R. Ramamoorthy. But I didn't believe at the time they are doing Google search. GOODMAN: And what did they do? Using their smartphones, phoned it in to their terrorist operation center. And they began an open source intelligence search for the man. They were able to locate a photograph which matched the name and then over the phone they did a match comparison. RAMAMOORTHY: Then back came the questions from them. GOODMAN: The terrorist ops center asked the terrorists on the ground, your hostage. . . RAMAMOORTHY: . . . Is he bald in his head? GOODMAN: Is he bald in front? RAMAMOORTHY: He said yes. GOODMAN: Yes he is. RAMAMOORTHY: Is he wearing spectacles? GOODMAN: Wearing glasses? RAMAMOORTHY: Then they said yes. GOODMAN: Is he heavyset? RAMAMOORTHY: Is he heavy built? He said yes. It is at that stage possibly they identified who am I. RAZ: The ops center had a match and they saw that K. R. Ramamoorthy was actually a top executive at a bank. And so when they figured that out, what did they tell the gunmen? RAMAMOORTHY: I think they told him he's an important person. And kill him meant your life is under danger. RAZ: Obviously, K. R. Ramamoorthy survived. A blast in another part of the hotel distracted the terrorists and he was able to escape. But Mark Goodman thinks that what happened in that hotel in Mumbai was almost like a template for the future of crime and terrorism. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)GOODMAN: We've all seen 3-D  printers. We know with them that you can print in many materials. But I wonder for those people that strap bombs to their chests and blow themselves up - how might they use 3-D printers? We recently saw a case where some researchers made the H5N1 avian influenza virus more potent.  And the researchers who did this were so proud of their accomplishments, they wanted to publish it openly so that everybody could see this. In the United States there are 60,000 people who have a pacemaker that connects to the Internet. All of the physical objects in our space are being transformed into information technologies. Criminals understand this. Terrorists understand this. Hackers understand this. If you control the code, you control the world. This is the future that awaits us. RAZ: And you say this is the future that awaits us. And I saw that and I thought, that is not a future I want to be a part of. Like, that is frightening. GOODMAN: It could and perhaps should be cause for concern. The goal is not to be alarmist. I am a huge proponent of technology.  I work in Silicon Valley. But we are leading a life that is increasingly disintermediated through technology. We don't talk to people face-to-face anymore. We used to reach out to them on a telephone and then on a computer, and now it's on an iPhone phone, an iPad. When we look at our cars today the speedometer is not a manual speedometer, it's a computer. When you go into the hospital and they check your heart, that is a computer that is checking your heart. When pilots on aircraft look at their navigational signals and instruments, that's all a computer. And the one thing that we know is that there has never been built a computer system that could not be hacked. So when I look out into the future and see the technological horizon and the increased dependence upon technology, and knowing that all technology to date is fundamentally insecure, I do have some growing concerns about that future. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)GOODMAN: What to do? What to do about all this? That's what I get asked all the time. Policing doesn't scale globally, at least it hasn't. And our current system of guns, border guards, big gates and fences are outdated in the new world into which we're moving. Whether or not you realize it, we are at the dawn of a technological arms race. An arms race between people who are using technology for good, and those who are using it for ill. The threat is serious and the time to prepare for it is now. I can assure you that the terrorists and criminals are. My personal belief is that rather than having a small, elite force of highly trained government agents here to protect us all, we're much better off having average and ordinary citizens approaching this problem as a group and seeing what we can do. If we all do our part I think we'll be in a much better space. The tools to change the world are in everybody's hands. How we use them is not just up to me, it's up to all of us.

GUY RAZ, HOST:  OK, so after this point the future is looking pretty awesome, you know, all this incredible technology to cure disease and make us live better lives but like the force, there is of course a dark side. Which is what Mark Goodman worries about. He used to be a beat cop with the LA police department and now he studies the future of crime and terrorism. MARK GOODMAN: Today I'm going to show you the flip side of all those technologies that we marvel at. The ones that we love. In the hands of the TED community these are awesome tools which will bring about great change for our world. But in the hands of suicide bombers, the future can look quite different. RAZ: And Mark Goodman believes we all caught a glimpse of that future in November 2008, when 10 men - just 10 men - brought a city of 20 million people to a standstill in Mumbai, India. (SOUNDBITE OF NEWS REPORT) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: . . . We're continuing to follow the deadly coordinated terror attacks there across the city. More than 80 people have been killed. Here's the latest report. . . (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) GOODMAN: The men that carried that attack out were armed with AK-47s, explosives and hand grenades. But heavy artillery is nothing new in terrorist operations. Guns and bombs are nothing new. What was different this time is the way that the terrorists used modern information communications technologies to locate additional victims and slaughter them. RAZ: So how did they do it? GOODMAN: What was different is that the terrorists innovated a terrorist ops center. So at the very same time that the attack was taking place on the ground in Mumbai there was an op center back in Pakistan monitoring, in real time, Al Jazeera. (SOUNDBITE OF NEWS REPORT) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: The police have cordoned off all of the areas in south Mumbai. . . GOODMAN: CNN. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: Reporting live from the scene as the Taj Hotel. . . GOODMAN: BBC. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #4: What you're hearing is a lot of explosions. . . GOODMAN: . . . As well as the Internet and they were culling all of that data for intelligence related to the attack and relaying that information to their terrorist operatives on the ground in real time. And that was something that we had never seen before. RAZ: The main target was a luxury hotel in downtown. It's called the Taj. And during the siege the terrorists went from room. . . GOODMAN: . . . to room and on the top floor of Taj there was a big suite. RAZ: They found a man hiding in his room. They tied him up and they interrogated him. GOODMAN: And they said to him, who are you? And what are you doing here? K. R. RAMAMOORTHY: So I said that I am a teacher. RAZ: This is that man, K. R. Ramamoorthy. RAMAMOORTHY: Then they asked me, where from you come? I said I come from Bangalore. GOODMAN: The terrorists were dumb but they weren't that dumb and they know that no Indian schoolteacher could afford to stay in the Taj, let alone in a suite. RAMAMOORTHY: They say what is your name? I said K. R. Ramamoorthy. But I didn't believe at the time they are doing Google search. GOODMAN: And what did they do? Using their smartphones, phoned it in to their terrorist operation center. And they began an open source intelligence search for the man. They were able to locate a photograph which matched the name and then over the phone they did a match comparison. RAMAMOORTHY: Then back came the questions from them. GOODMAN: The terrorist ops center asked the terrorists on the ground, your hostage. . . RAMAMOORTHY: . . . Is he bald in his head? GOODMAN: Is he bald in front? RAMAMOORTHY: He said yes. GOODMAN: Yes he is. RAMAMOORTHY: Is he wearing spectacles? GOODMAN: Wearing glasses? RAMAMOORTHY: Then they said yes. GOODMAN: Is he heavyset? RAMAMOORTHY: Is he heavy built? He said yes. It is at that stage possibly they identified who am I. RAZ: The ops center had a match and they saw that K. R. Ramamoorthy was actually a top executive at a bank. And so when they figured that out, what did they tell the gunmen? RAMAMOORTHY: I think they told him he's an important person. And kill him meant your life is under danger. RAZ: Obviously, K. R. Ramamoorthy survived. A blast in another part of the hotel distracted the terrorists and he was able to escape. But Mark Goodman thinks that what happened in that hotel in Mumbai was almost like a template for the future of crime and terrorism. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) GOODMAN: We've all seen 3-D  printers. We know with them that you can print in many materials. But I wonder for those people that strap bombs to their chests and blow themselves up - how might they use 3-D printers? We recently saw a case where some researchers made the H5N1 avian influenza virus more potent.  And the researchers who did this were so proud of their accomplishments, they wanted to publish it openly so that everybody could see this. In the United States there are 60,000 people who have a pacemaker that connects to the Internet. All of the physical objects in our space are being transformed into information technologies. Criminals understand this. Terrorists understand this. Hackers understand this. If you control the code, you control the world. This is the future that awaits us. RAZ: And you say this is the future that awaits us. And I saw that and I thought, that is not a future I want to be a part of. Like, that is frightening. GOODMAN: It could and perhaps should be cause for concern. The goal is not to be alarmist. I am a huge proponent of technology.  I work in Silicon Valley. But we are leading a life that is increasingly disintermediated through technology. We don't talk to people face-to-face anymore. We used to reach out to them on a telephone and then on a computer, and now it's on an iPhone phone, an iPad. When we look at our cars today the speedometer is not a manual speedometer, it's a computer. When you go into the hospital and they check your heart, that is a computer that is checking your heart. When pilots on aircraft look at their navigational signals and instruments, that's all a computer. And the one thing that we know is that there has never been built a computer system that could not be hacked. So when I look out into the future and see the technological horizon and the increased dependence upon technology, and knowing that all technology to date is fundamentally insecure, I do have some growing concerns about that future. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) GOODMAN: What to do? What to do about all this? That's what I get asked all the time. Policing doesn't scale globally, at least it hasn't. And our current system of guns, border guards, big gates and fences are outdated in the new world into which we're moving. Whether or not you realize it, we are at the dawn of a technological arms race. An arms race between people who are using technology for good, and those who are using it for ill. The threat is serious and the time to prepare for it is now. I can assure you that the terrorists and criminals are. My personal belief is that rather than having a small, elite force of highly trained government agents here to protect us all, we're much better off having average and ordinary citizens approaching this problem as a group and seeing what we can do. If we all do our part I think we'll be in a much better space. The tools to change the world are in everybody's hands. How we use them is not just up to me, it's up to all of us.

Now imagine taking those cells from your heart or your liver and then growing a new heart and a new liver identical to the ones you have. That's where Nina's research is headed, which she described in her TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)NINA TANDON: I work in a lab where we take cells out of their native environment and we feed them, sterilely of course, with what we call cell culture media, which is like their food. And we grow them in incubators, but what we're really trying to do in my lab is to engineer tissues out of them. What does that even mean? Well, it means growing an actual heart, let's say, or grow a piece of bone that can be put into the body. Let's take the example of the heart - the topic of a lot of my research. What makes the heart unique? Well, the heart beats - rhythmically, tirelessly, faithfully. We copy this in the lab by outfitting cell culture systems with electrodes. These electrodes act like mini pacemakers to get the cells to contract in the lab. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)TANDON: And so if you can copy those two things in the technology that you use to grow the cells in the lab, you can get pretty far with tricking them into believing they're inside the body and therefore behaving much closer to the way they would behave in a petri dish than they would otherwise. RAZ: How far are we from growing spare parts for our bodies? TANDON: Well, the heart is pretty tough. But actually, we're just in the beginning stages of a startup right now where we're growing bones for skeletal reconstruction. So living, personalized, human bones in the right shape and with the right cells. And the idea of growing organs and growing spare parts for the human body - I like to call this the idea of body 3. 0, is spare living parts for the human body because, actually, they're not just parts anymore. They fully integrate back into the body. RAZ: I mean, this could end that whole system of organ donations. TANDON: Yeah. And if you think about organs where the lines for transplants are so long that people die waiting, this is huge. RAZ: OK, so if that idea doesn't blow your mind, just wait for this one. Tissue engineering that may lead to personalized medicine - made-to-order drugs for each and every person. Here's more from Nina Tandon's TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)TANDON: Well, let's think about the drug screening process for a moment. You go from drug formulation, lab testing, animal testing and then clinical trials, which you might call human testing, before the drugs get to market. Costs a lot of money, a lot of time. And sometimes, even when a drug hits the market, it acts in an unpredictable way and actually hurts people. And the later it fails, the worse the consequences. It all boils down to two issues. One, humans are not rats. And two, despite our incredible similarities to one another, actually, those tiny differences between you and I have huge impacts with how we metabolize drugs and how those drugs affect us. So what if we had better models in the lab that could not only mimic us better than rats, but also reflect our diversity? Let's see how we can do it with tissue engineering. One of the key technologies that's really important is what's called induced pluripotent stem cells. They were developed in Japan pretty recently. They're a lot like embryonic stem cells except without the controversy. We induce cells, OK, say skin cells, by adding a few genes to them, culturing them and then harvesting them. So they're skin cells that can be tricked, kind of like cellular amnesia, into an embryonic state. So without the controversy, that's cool thing number one. Cool thing number two, you can grow any type of tissue out of them - brain, heart, liver. You get the picture, but out of your cells. So we can make a model of your heart, your brain, on a chip. RAZ: That idea is so incredible, I mean, you can imagine how that will revolutionize the history of the world. And, you know, 10, 20, 30, 40 years from now you're diagnosed with, let's say, an aggressive form of bone cancer. If this technology heads in the direction where you think it might be headed, like, how do you imagine that person might be treated? TANDON: I can imagine taking stem cells from that patient, in addition to cancer cells from that patient, growing a piece of bone, probably growing, maybe, lymph tissue, breast tissue, and exposing those cells to certain type of drugs and seeing which ones would work best. I can also imagine developing cancer treatments that are specific to that cancer by using molecular biology techniques to actually make a targeted therapeutic for that patient. So it's kind of two things, you know, screening known drugs against those cancers, but then also, possibly, even in the future, developing a new drug specifically for that cancer. RAZ: Essentially, you could clone a part of a person with cancer and just experiment on that person's clone, just throw everything you have at it to see how it responds. TANDON: Yeah, and a person with cancer doesn't have a whole lot of time to waste and a whole lot of freedom to experiment on themselves. They really only have kind of one shot to try each and every thing. And so time is of the essence. RAZ: It's interesting 'cause right now, I mean, the way medicine works, it seems normal to us, like, there's a disease and a medication is developed for that disease. And then everyone who has that disease takes that medication, but I guess that probably won't be the way we do things in the future. TANDON: In the past, we've just sort of taken a statistical approach. We say, OK, 50 percent of people with depression respond to this drug so let's prescribe it to a hundred percent of the people and if it doesn't work, well, we'll try something else. That, in a way, is like - is low-hanging fruit. As we think about more and more complicated diseases with complicated mechanisms and if you consider that everybody's cancer is different, those kind of statistical methods don't work as well. They just don't. RAZ: So you could imagine actually creating like, an individual medicine for one person that might not ever be used on anybody else. TANDON: You can definitely see that, for sure. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)TANDON: Going forward, tissue engineering is actually poised to help revolutionize drug screening at every single step of the path - disease models making for better drug formulations, massively parallel human tissue models helping to revolutionize lab testing, reduce animal testing and human testing in clinical trials. And individualized therapies that disrupt what we even consider to be a market at all. Essentially, we're dramatically speeding up that feedback between developing a molecule and learning about how it acts in the human body. Our process for doing this is essentially transforming biotechnology and pharmacology into an information technology, helping us discover and evaluate drugs faster, more cheaply and more effectively.

Let me talk about how you might input information, and my favorite example is always fingers. I'm very interested in touch-sensitive displays - high-tech, high-touch.

I'm Guy Raz. And today's show is all about predicting the future. So GPS, pretty amazing, right? It's totally changed road trips forever. But for our next guest, GPS is a lot more than that. It's about the future of privacy, which as you will hear, may not exist. TODD HUMPHREYS: I'm Todd Humphreys. I'm an aerospace engineering professor at the University of Texas at Austin and the director of the Radionavigation Laboratory here at UT. RAZ: I mean, you're a GPS guy. HUMPHREYS: That's right. RAZ: Do you ever use paper maps? HUMPHREYS: I love paper maps. RAZ: But do you use them? HUMPHREYS: I still use them. RAZ: Do you use them, really? HUMPHREYS: Of course. I don't think that's going to go away anytime soon for me personally, but I see it going away for the community at large pretty fast. RAZ: To understand what got us here, why paper maps have become virtually extinct, you have to back to May 2, 2000. HUMPHREYS: And that was the day that ushered in this explosion of applications of GPS. RAZ: And that just happened, like that. HUMPHREYS: It was. It was magical. (SOUNDBITE OF NEWS REPORT)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Officials at the White House today announced that civilians will be able to find their way in the world a bit more easily after tonight. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HUMPHREYS: The change was silent, imperceptible, unless you knew exactly what to look for. U. S. president Bill Clinton ordered that a special switch be thrown in the orbiting satellites of the global positioning system. Instantaneously, every civilian GPS receiver around the globe went from errors the size of a football field to errors the size of a small room. It's hard to overstate the effect that this change in accuracy has had on us. Before this switch was thrown, we didn't have in-car navigation systems giving turn-by-turn directions because back then GPS couldn't tell you what block you were on, let alone what street. This level of accuracy has unleashed a firestorm of innovation. The holy grail, of course, is the GPS dot. Do you remember the movie \"The Da Vinci Code? \" Here's Professor Langdon examining a GPS dot, which his accomplice tells him is a tracking device accurate within two feet anywhere on the globe. But we know that in the world of nonfiction the GPS dot is impossible, right? For one thing, GPS doesn't work indoors, and for another, they don't make devices quite this small, especially when those devices have to relay their measurements back over a network. Well, these objections were perfectly reasonable a few years ago, but things have changed. There's been a strong trend toward miniaturization, better sensitivity. Compare that with the device released just months ago that's now packaged into something the size of a key fob. Imagine what we could do with a world full of GPS dots. It's not just that you'll never lose your wallet or your keys anymore, or your child when you're at Disneyland; you'll buy GPS dots in bulk and you'll stick them on everything you own worth more than a few tens of dollars. RAZ: So this is something that is just going to be normal, like, who knows, 10, 5, 10, 20 years from now. We just - we won't lose anything anymore. HUMPHREYS: That's right. I see this as moving what we are accustomed to in the cyber world into the physical world. We'll be able to search our possessions just as we search e-mails and pull up something that's old and still useful and figure out where it was. RAZ: So this is incredible. I mean, I can't see why I wouldn't - actually, you know what? I can see some reasons why I wouldn't want it now that I think about it. There are lots of reasons why you wouldn't want it. HUMPHREYS: Well, that's what I call the flipside. As soon as you try to extract utility from knowing exactly where you are or where your things are, you're giving away a lot about who you are and where you travel. But this is just a symptom of our connected world. And when we want somebody to predict our actions so that it can be useful for us, you know, tell us when the traffic's going to be high or when we can expect rain in a certain area, we want those predictors to know our patterns. But what's more private than our exact location? That's about as private as it gets. RAZ: Can you imagine a future in which governments - our government - could easily track us and make it a regular thing that it does? HUMPHREYS: You know, what's most interesting in the aftermath of the Edward Snowden revelations is that the metadata that the government requested from Verizon did include position data, but the government didn't make any use of it. Even though they admitted, legally, they could have. And for me, that's not much of a barrier to them going ahead and making use of our position data. I see this as - if not a foregone conclusion - it's going to be an irresistible temptation for the government to find out where we are and what we were doing. We are selling our privacy for convenience. And everyone is doing this every day a little bit more, a little bit more. If at one moment you wake up and you're wanting to reclaim your privacy, you'll have to do that by relinquishing a lot of conveniences you've come to depend on. RAZ: In your TED Talk, you mentioned something called a GPS spoofer. HUMPHREYS: That's right. RAZ: Which could do serious damage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HUMPHREYS: The idea behind the GPS spoofer is simple. Instead of jamming the GPS signals, you imitate them. And if you do it right, the device you're attacking doesn't even know it's being spoofed. Up until very recently, nobody worried about GPS spoofers. People figured that it would be too complex or too expensive for some hacker to build one. But I and a friend of mine from graduate school, we didn't see it that way. And we wanted to be the first to build one, so we could get out in front of the problem and help protect against GPS spoofing. Now the Dr. Frankenstein moment, when the spoofer finally came alive and I glimpsed its awful potential, came late one night when I tested the spoofer against my iPhone. And this little blue dot started at my house and went running off toward the north leaving me behind. I wasn't moving. What I then saw in this little moving blue dot was the potential for chaos. I saw airplanes and ships veering off course with the captain learning only too late that something was wrong. I saw the GPS derived timing of the New York Stock Exchange being manipulated by hackers. You can scarcely imagine the kind of havoc you could cause if you knew what you were doing with a GPS spoofer. RAZ: This is, like, a crazy, like, disaster movie. HUMPHREYS: It was for me too that night. And the truth is that in the year that's passed since that TED Talk, there's been nothing to dissuade me from seeing that as a potentially awful future where we can't trust the devices that are telling us where we are. Within the next few years, many of you will be the proud owner of a GPS dot. The GPS dot will fundamentally reorder your life, but will you be able to resist the temptation to track your fellow man? Or will you be able to resist the temptation to turn on a GPS spoofer to protect your own privacy? What we see just beyond the horizon is full of promise and peril. It'll be fascinating to see how this all turns out. Thanks. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: Todd Humphreys is a professor at UT Austin. Check out his whole talk at TED. NPR. org.

The school is called 42. It was founded by a telecom magnate who says the French education system is failing young people. And his aim is to reduce France's shortage of computer programmers, while giving those who've dropped out of school a second chance. NPR's Eleanor Beardsley sends this report. ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: Suitcases and sleeping bags are piled up in the hallways of 42, and people are stretched out on mattresses in some of the corners. There are showers and dozens of colorful bath towels. We're going up a staircase and there's towels on both sides on the railings. Living here for the next month are some of the 4,000 potential students who already made the first cut by passing cognitive skill tests online. Now, they have to clear another hurdle. They're thrown together and challenged with computer problems for 15 hours a day. Only 800 students will get a place, says 42's director Nicolas Sadirac. NICOLAS SADIRAC: It's very, very intensive. It's kind of selection, but on the long term. So, we don't just do an examination, we spend four weeks of choosing each student. BEARDSLEY: The only criteria for applying, is to be between the ages of 18 and 30. You don't need money and you don't need a particular level of academic achievement. A third of the applicants don't even have high school diplomas. Sadirac says they're not looking for how much students know but how they think. One of the schools main goals is to unearth talent in poor areas where kids don't fit into the traditional French academic mold. Youth unemployment in France is at a 14-year high. At the same time, French companies cannot find enough IT specialists and thousands of young computer enthusiasts can't get training. That prompted 42's founder Xavier Niel to invest $90 million of his own money in the school. Niel, the creator of France's third largest telecommunications company, Free, says the social elevator in France is broken. XAVIER NIEL: (Through Translator) If you're the son of a blue collar worker, you're going to be a blue collar worker. Children of elites stay elite. We have 200,000 kids a year who drop out of the French school system and have no hope. They become a drag on society. We want to help these young people take control of their lives. BEARDSLEY: For example, there are no teachers. Students learn by solving problems. SADIRAC: We don't want to teach them stuff we want them to find solutions on problem. Because we don't know the problem in the future. So, we are creating students able to learn by themselves. BEARDSLEY: Sadirac says in the past 20 years the world will change at a staggering pace. 42 is looking for young people who can think outside the box. He says formal academic training can sometimes hinder that. SADIRAC: Because when you go to academic you are trained to follow models, reproduce models and not try a new one. You are so much trained that you are not able anymore to create new. So, if we want to make people innovative or creative, we need to get out of this system. BEARDSLEY: During their final year, 42's students will work together on a huge project known as a masterpiece. Much like an apprenticeship, they build their talents and learn from each other. Eighteen-year-old candidate Lloyd Cochet loves the schools philosophy. LLOYD COCHET: (Through Translator) I had a hard time following in school. I can't concentrated and they forbid us to talk in class. And here, talking together and passing along tips is the key to succeeding. BEARDSLEY: Outside on the sidewalk 27-year-old Omar Marzougi is taking a break. His parents emigrated from Tunisia. Many young people with North African roots say they face discrimination in France. It's a complicated issue, says Marzougi, but one thing's for sure. . . OMAR MARZOUGI: (Foreign language spoken)BEARDSLEY: There's no discrimination at this school, he says, because getting in isn't based on your education level or social status. It's a true melting pot. Even though 42 doesn't yet offer a recognized diploma, potential students feel sure it will prepare them to face the future better than any state-sanctioned school.

I'm Michel Martin. Now it's time for our weekly parenting roundtable. Now every week we check in with a diverse group of parents to get their common sense and savvy parenting advice. But in honor of Hispanic Heritage Month we decided to have a special roundtable focusing on Latino moms and dads. We reached out to a number of our regular contributors about the issues they've been talking about most as parents. So we're going to talk about just a few of those topics today with Felix Contreras. He's a father of two. He's co-host of NPR's Alt. Latino podcast that focuses on new music from Latin America. Aracely Panameno is a mother of one. She's a regular guest in our parenting roundtables. She also works at the Center for Responsible Lending. And also with us is Resa Barillas. She is a mom of one and a contributor to Mamiverse. com. That's a site for Latino parents. Welcome to everyone. Thank you all so much for joining us. FELIX CONTRERAS, BYLINE: Thanks for having us. RESA BARILLAS: Thank you. MARTIN: Now when we reached out to listeners and contributors and people, you know, who follow the program and we asked them - like what is one of the number one concerns that you have? You know, you might be surprised that the number one thing that came up was the health of their kids. And in particular, fighting obesity. Resa, you said that this was a major concern of yours. Could you talk about that? BARILLAS: It is. Well, my family has - on both sides - has a history of lots of easily preventable diseases, like diabetes and heart disease, high blood pressure - and I mean, they're completely preventable because diet and exercise can completely alter the way that your body responds to genetic markers. So seeing the Latino side of my family  especially struck by this is, you know, because of the way they eat. It's high-fat, high sodium, carbs that are so low in complexity and actual nutritious value that, you know, our bodies just are deteriorating before our eyes because of that. And on top of that, with other Latinos - and really, the culture here in America as a whole - really, terrible foods are so cheap and easily available and convenient that it's easy to choose those kind of foods instead of whole nutritious foods that are more nourishing and better for our bodies. MARTIN: Felix, let me bring you into the conversation, and I know you're a journalist, like I am, and you know how we love our facts and figures - so, I'm struck by a speech that first lady Michelle Obama gave - you know, first lady Michelle Obama's made fitness, particularly kids' health, a particular focus of her time in Washington. This is a speech she gave to the National Council of La Raza's annual conference in July. I'll just play a short clip. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)M. OBAMA: Right now, nearly 40 percent of Hispanic children in this country are overweight or obese. Nearly 50 percent are on track to develop diabetes, a disease that is already far too common in so many of our communities. So, while food might be love, the truth is that we are loving ourselves and our kids to death. MARTIN: Now, Felix, I know you've got two boys - I know they're very active. They're both, you know, athletic. But is this a sensitive issue? I mean, is this the kind of thing that is hard to talk about because, as the first lady said, you know, food is love and a lot of the heritage foods that many people like do have some, you know, unhealthy attributes if eaten particularly in quantity and regularly. Is it sensitive? CONTRERAS: I think it is sensitive in a lot of ways. And I'll give you a very quick story. This weekend, we had some people over to the house and my wife, who's Italian-American - she made enchiladas from a recipe that we found on the Internet. And she poured salt in and we couldn't get the sauce right - what's going on? So we called a neighbor over, who's from Texas - who, you know,  knows things - and the amount of salt that he put in there to make it taste right was eye-opening. You know, and we all know - we hear the facts, we hear the figures, as Resa just said, we know what the food is doing to us. But being removed out here on the East Coast from the Mexican-American culture, you know, you can sort of, at a distance with that. And so to be reminded of that was really astounding. Getting back to your question - I think it is sensitive sometimes. You know, how you changed - how you change it up, how you cook. How you. . . MARTIN: Is it a hazing thing though in part? Because, you know, I think many of us - people from ethnic backgrounds - we've all had the experience of going to, say, a family reunion and, you know, if somebody goes for the fruit salad, I'll just say it - the people will say, what do you - you know, think you're acting white, for example. Or you're not -  kind of the suggestion is made that you're not really part of the culture anymore, that there's kind of a hazing that goes on. Is that something that you feel is a problem? CONTRERAS: I think it can be. I think I've seen it. I've experienced it in different social situations. You know, it's not always the case - and that's not always the reason but, you know, that can be a problem and, you know - it's just how people in the room react. MARTIN: Let's switch gears and talk a little bit about language. That's something we were talking about earlier in our conversation about social media. Is it important to you that your kid speaks Spanish? Felix? CONTRERAS: In our situation, it's a little different. We're in a very unique situation here. Like I said, my background is Mexican-American. I'm, like, second or third generation depending on which side of the family we're talking about, removed from Mexico. So people my age and my family, I think we've more or less lost the connection to the language - as a natural connection. MARTIN: You didn't speak Spanish to your kids at home? CONTRERAS: Well, we didn't speak Spanish when we were growing up, OK. My kids, living here in Washington, D. C. area, Montgomery County, are in a Spanish immersion program - and the Montgomery County schools has that program where they learn everything from kindergarten to sixth grade - everything. MARTIN: So your kids will be more fluent than you are? CONTRERAS: They're already there. MARTIN: I'm not being mean. I am just saying. CONTRERAS: No, no, no it's true. No it's true, it's very true. It's very true. MARTIN: Aracely, a different experience for you 'cause you come from an immigrant background. You're a first-generation immigrant, right, but your daughter was born here and grew up here. So is it important - I'm asking you to tell her business and now she's a grown young woman, OK, so I know you're going to get in trouble and so am I. I apologize for that. But was it important to you that she spoke Spanish? ARACELY PANAMENO: It was. It was very important for me for her to learn Spanish and because I knew that she was in a societal environment where the pressure was going to the Anglophone, I insisted that she be bilingual. And that was actually her first ABCs, her first words were Spanish. As a matter of fact, I got in trouble with my African-American side of the family - she's half black - my ex in-law would be upset because she would say, oh, my God, the baby doesn't speak English. What is going to happen to her? MARTIN: Well, in fact, though, there's a lot of evidence that suggests that, you know, that actually people grow up bilingual may develop language later but it's still forming in the brain. I mean, that sometimes they don't speak as - both languages early, but they speak well when they do. I mean, 'cause the brain is being trained, I mean, there's all this evidence, you know, from Switzerland and places - a lot of place where people speak - you know, or Africa, for example - many people speak several languages. So. . . PANAMENO: She learned the basics, you know, early in life and then I insisted that she become - that she take classes. MARTIN: Did she resist? PANAMENO: She did resist for some time because of the pressure. MARTIN: She didn't think it was cool? PANAMENO: Right, the pressure was there. The social pressure was there, and unfortunately, I live in an area where at the time the school - some school teachers would say, you're in the U. S. of A. now, we speak English here. And I have a number of my nephews who, at the time, when they were told this by their teachers stopped speaking Spanish. MARTIN: Well, that's true though. They are in the U. S. - English is the dominant language here. So what do you feel would be a better message? PANAMENO: Well, it doesn't preclude - well, you see, so then, thereafter, I had to pay for Spanish classes. And it's like, wait a second, this became a business now. I could have taught this to her at home, now I have to pay for it. But in the case of my daughter, I actually had her travel. She traveled, - went back to El Salvador, where I'm from. And, you know, every time she would come back to the United States she'd speak Spanish with a Salvadoran accent - which I, myself, don't have. But she would come back speaking with a Salvadoran accent. MARTIN: I want to talk a little bit about why you think that's important but let me bring Resa into the conversation - bring her back into the conversation. Resa, as I understand it, you mostly spoke English at home growing up but you have a different dream for your 2-year-old. Can you talk about that? BARILLAS: I did. I would love for my son to be more fluent than I am. And he actually speaks more Spanish in his father's home than he does in mine because I'm not as fluent in Spanish as his father is. So I'd like to actually learn with him, if that makes any sense at all. MARTIN: Sure, sure. Why is that important to you? BARILLAS: Like Fernando - or like Viviana had said in the previous segment, it's that pride and plus one. It's that understanding that you have something else that's driving who you are and who - something behind you. Not to mention that it actually is great for children's learning skills and developing cultural awareness. Just the idea that there are two words with the same meaning that different people will use unlocks so much for children, and this understanding that people may have different thoughts and different approaches to things, but, at the end of the day, we're a community of people. MARTIN: If you're just joining us, we're having our weekly parenting roundtable. Our guests today are Resa Barillas. That's who was speaking just now. Also with us, one of our regular contributors, Aracely Panameno. And Felix Contreras. You know him as the co-host of NPR's Alt. Latino. We asked him to put his parent hat on today. CONTRERAS: I never take it off. MARTIN: Never take it off. That's right, we never take it off. We never take it off. I wanted to ask each of you if there is a talk that Latino parents have with their kids that other people might not be aware of. I mean, in the wake of the tragedy involving Trayvon Martin and George Zimmerman - it came to the fore again for general conversation. The talk that a lot of black parents feel they have to have with their kids, particularly their sons about dealing with the police and with authority. Is there a similar talk that you feel you have to have with your kids that other people might not know about? Felix? CONTRERAS: I don't think so. Honestly, I don't - that never crossed my mind to have that kind of talk. No we've certainly, with my oldest, he's now - he's going to be 13 next month, in a couple of weeks, he's very socially aware of inequities and the way things work in the world. And so he's conscious and he's conscious of his own Latino and Italian heritage, but he's conscious of that. So he sees things a little differently than I think his peers do. So he's conscious and aware of how people can treat people differently sometimes. MARTIN: But you think partly - and I wonder if it's because they can be ethnically ambiguous. I mean, people don't need to know that they're Latino unless they tell them that they are? Or they know they're - I don't know. Aracely really wants to jump in on this one. PANAMENO: So as you know, Michel, I live in Prince William County. At one point the epicenter. . . MARTIN: It's a suburb outside of Washington D. C. PANAMENO: Virginia, yes. And at one point, the epicenter of controversy over immigration policy. And so, yes, I have had that conversation with my daughter. MARTIN: And what is that conversation? PANAMENO: The conversation of if you ever get stopped by the police, you know, how you will behave, how you get to prove that you're actually who you say you are, that you are actually legal, that you're an actual citizen. And I would actually ask her a series of questions and - not only that but she also - depending upon who looks at her. She either looks Afro-Latina or she would look African-American. Her boyfriend is also African-American and so they have, in fact, in Prince William County, been pulled off by virtue of them two being together in a nice vehicle. And they have been pulled off - and once they find out what her name is, obviously the questioning is are you a U. S. citizen, are you legal? And then of course if they look at her as black, then, you know, are you into trouble, is this a stolen vehicle kind of attitude. So I have had that conversation with her on a number of fronts, right - from being a U. S. citizen of Latino descent and then by also looking African-American and her boyfriend, her loved one, being an African-American, as well. MARTIN: Now Resa, your little guy is little. BARILLAS: He's very little. MARTIN: He's very little but is there a talk that your parents had with you or is there a talk that you feel you have to have with him that perhaps other people from different backgrounds might not know about? BARILLAS: I never had that - those kind of discussions with my family. I'm not sure if my brother did. My brother is full Salvadorian - he's my half-brother so I'm not sure if he ever had those talks with my parents but I know I never did. Granted, I'm also half-European kind of mix. I'm freckly and very, very pale. So. . MARTIN: So the talk might be wear sunscreen. BARILLAS: Right, exactly. PANAMENO: Sunblock. (CROSSTALK)BARILLAS: I'm very ethnically ambiguous. I love that phrase, actually. And my son is about the same complexion that I am - dark hair, dark eyes but very, very pale skin. Unless you know who we are. Unless you - we've talked about it, it's unlikely that people know our ethnicity. So it's not something that I've ever really had to consider or thought that I might have to consider discussing with him. MARTIN: Interesting. I wonder - do you think appearance, Aracely, makes a big difference in how people of Latino heritage kind of relate to these questions, whether how you look is perhaps more relevant than what country you're from or how - what heritage you claim or nationality, right? PANAMENO: So the issue of skin tone, skin color is very alive and well among Latinos. My family, I think, is a resemblance of the United Nations. And I am sort of like in the darker side of the complexion scheme. And so there are full-blooded brothers who, if they were to be stopped by the cops, they would be identified as a white-Anglo. I have nieces whose both parents - both my brothers and their mothers are from El Salvador - immigrants. They're looked upon as white. And when they find out that they are actually of Salvadoran parents, you know, people react very surprisingly. MARTIN: Let me just ask one quick question - we only have about a minute and a half left. Is it - a lot of people are saying that we are having a Latino moment, you know, in politics because of the demographics. You saw in the last election that Latino voters played a critical role. You see a lot of it in marketing now. Does it feel that way to you? And what does that mean for you as parents? CONTRERAS: It's yet another moment. You know, 'cause, I mean, I remember when I - the reason why I got into this business when I was in college back in the late '70s is because there was a Latino moment then. And so that framed how I pursued by career and how I make these choices. So I think it's one in a series of Latino moments. MARTIN: Does it feel good? CONTRERAS: It feels - yes and no. I mean, when there's that power and there's that recognition, but then there are low voter registration numbers, you know, and low participation in civil engagement, that reflect back on - negatively on the community - then, you know, they need to step it up a little bit I think. MARTIN: Resa, what about you? Final thought from you. BARILLAS: I agree with that. It's actually - it's wonderful that there is this attention on Latino issues and they're recognized as their own issues, but it is frustrating, like, he was saying, that, you know, there are things that reflect poorly on us by not actually showing up to the polls and not participating in something that is crucial to the success of our community. MARTIN: Well, I'll tell you like my parents used to tell me - all the bad people are going to be gone when you grow up. So it's all going to be better. Aracely Panameno was with us. She's a mom of one. Felix Contreras is the father of two. They were both with us in our Washington, D. C. studios. And joining us from member station KUCI in Irvine, California, Resa Barillas. Blogger and mom of one. Thank you all so much for speaking with us. CONTRERAS: Thank you. (CROSSTALK)PANAMENO: Gracias. MARTIN: And that's our program for today.

S. citizen of Latino descent and then by also looking African-American and her boyfriend, her loved one, being an African-American, as well. MARTIN: Now Resa, your little guy is little. BARILLAS: He's very little. MARTIN: He's very little but is there a talk that your parents had with you or is there a talk that you feel you have to have with him that perhaps other people from different backgrounds might not know about? BARILLAS: I never had that - those kind of discussions with my family. I'm not sure if my brother did. My brother is full Salvadorian - he's my half-brother so I'm not sure if he ever had those talks with my parents but I know I never did. Granted, I'm also half-European kind of mix. I'm freckly and very, very pale. So. . MARTIN: So the talk might be wear sunscreen. BARILLAS: Right, exactly. PANAMENO: Sunblock. (CROSSTALK) BARILLAS: I'm very ethnically ambiguous. I love that phrase, actually. And my son is about the same complexion that I am - dark hair, dark eyes but very, very pale skin. Unless you know who we are. Unless you - we've talked about it, it's unlikely that people know our ethnicity. So it's not something that I've ever really had to consider or thought that I might have to consider discussing with him. MARTIN: Interesting. I wonder - do you think appearance, Aracely, makes a big difference in how people of Latino heritage kind of relate to these questions, whether how you look is perhaps more relevant than what country you're from or how - what heritage you claim or nationality, right? PANAMENO: So the issue of skin tone, skin color is very alive and well among Latinos. My family, I think, is a resemblance of the United Nations. And I am sort of like in the darker side of the complexion scheme. And so there are full-blooded brothers who, if they were to be stopped by the cops, they would be identified as a white-Anglo. I have nieces whose both parents - both my brothers and their mothers are from El Salvador - immigrants. They're looked upon as white. And when they find out that they are actually of Salvadoran parents, you know, people react very surprisingly. MARTIN: Let me just ask one quick question - we only have about a minute and a half left. Is it - a lot of people are saying that we are having a Latino moment, you know, in politics because of the demographics. You saw in the last election that Latino voters played a critical role. You see a lot of it in marketing now. Does it feel that way to you? And what does that mean for you as parents? CONTRERAS: It's yet another moment. You know, 'cause, I mean, I remember when I - the reason why I got into this business when I was in college back in the late '70s is because there was a Latino moment then. And so that framed how I pursued by career and how I make these choices. So I think it's one in a series of Latino moments. MARTIN: Does it feel good? CONTRERAS: It feels - yes and no. I mean, when there's that power and there's that recognition, but then there are low voter registration numbers, you know, and low participation in civil engagement, that reflect back on - negatively on the community - then, you know, they need to step it up a little bit I think. MARTIN: Resa, what about you? Final thought from you. BARILLAS: I agree with that. It's actually - it's wonderful that there is this attention on Latino issues and they're recognized as their own issues, but it is frustrating, like, he was saying, that, you know, there are things that reflect poorly on us by not actually showing up to the polls and not participating in something that is crucial to the success of our community. MARTIN: Well, I'll tell you like my parents used to tell me - all the bad people are going to be gone when you grow up. So it's all going to be better. Aracely Panameno was with us. She's a mom of one. Felix Contreras is the father of two. They were both with us in our Washington, D. C. studios. And joining us from member station KUCI in Irvine, California, Resa Barillas. Blogger and mom of one. Thank you all so much for speaking with us. CONTRERAS: Thank you. (CROSSTALK) PANAMENO: Gracias. MARTIN: And that's our program for today.

S. We were talking about this in a special Google Plus hangout yesterday, and we'd like to invite you to join us today by using #NPRLatism on Twitter and Facebook. But I think one of the reasons that Latinos are over-indexed on social media is our next guest Viviana Hurtado. She's blogger-in-chief of the website The Wise Latina Club. She's also here with us in Washington, D. C. Welcome back. Thanks so much for joining us once again. VIVIANA HURTADO: Thank you, Michel. MARTIN: One of our regular contributors. Why do you think that - just giving more detail from the Pew Research poll - 68 percent of Latino Internet users say they use Facebook, Twitter or other social media sites, while only 58 percent of the general population says they use these sites. Why do you think that is? HURTADO: Well, I think it has a lot to do with representation. And we've seen that in the mainstream media - it's really not until the last maybe five years plus, give or take a little bit, that you've seen a really big push towards more representation of Latinos - including them in primetime television, including them more in the news. We also know that it is such a hot space, that everybody is rushing to reach these 50,000 Latinos that are turning 18 every year. We see the digital space has gotten a lot more crowded. Univision has merged with ABC in a new venture Fusion. Fox News Latino is out there in the digital space as is NBC Latino. But before that happened, we weren't represented, and so we turned to the social space - places like Facebook, Google Plus, Twitter - so that we can connect. And in that connection, we're speaking with each other. We're being listened to by each other. We're calling out each other and we're dreaming. We're dreaming big. That was just kind of - we were kind of like this invisible giant for many, many years until the technology and the digital space allowed that opening. MARTIN: Yesterday, for our Google Plus hangout, we talked with Ana Roca-Castro. Her organization focuses on Latinos in tech and social media. Fernando, she had the theory that the technology just overlaps very nicely with culture. That Latinos have a very strong desire, no matter which country they're from, to remain connected and often because you have family who are separated. FERNANDO ESPUELAS: Yeah. MARTIN: That it just dovetails very nicely with kind of a very strong cultural impetus. Do you think that that's true? ESPUELAS: Absolutely. One of the early experiences we had in the '90s with StarMedia was people told us that Colombians don't want to speak to Venezuelans, and Uruguayans to Chileans, and so forth and so on. And what in fact we found was that it was the direct opposite, that there was a tremendous interest of a Mexican who would never meet a Uruguayan or Chilean to connect through a chat engine or through whatever that would be. So yeah, I think culturally - look, we're all very different, you know, like every other culture. But at the same time, we share certain qualities and social media allows us to connect and share not just experiences, but really who we are in a way that is genuinely ourselves, without again, the filter of the representation of, you know, major media who may want to depict us in a certain way. MARTIN: Well, some of the critique has come from within, Viviana. One of our Twitter followers, @cpm05, tweeted us and said she turns away from a lot of traditional media because quote, I got tired of novelas and most shows on Univision - too sexist, unoriginal and no stimulant for the brain. And I wonder if you think that that's - do you think that that's in part true? That people - it's not just the outside-in gaze, people aren't loving the inside-out gaze. Do you think that that's true? HURTADO: I think it is. And, you know, it's really interesting because I think if we think about traditional media, certainly radio falls in that, but so does a television juggernaut like Univision. It is a little bit anachronistic. And so, yes, it is true that there is the novelas, for example, and that the 50,000 plus Latinos turning 18 every year aren't tuning into Univision. They're not tuning into Telemundo or NPR, maybe a little bit of ABC. . . MARTIN: NPR. Yes, they are. HURTADO: . . . But maybe a mix. And they're increasingly finding a lot of their information on social sites. And so it is there that they are finding, that they're picking and choosing - it's almost like they're curating this library of information of culture, of politics. The danger with that, of course, is that we can get stuck in these social silos where we're just kind of talking amongst ourselves and navel-gazing and not part of a larger, broader conversation where the power's at. MARTIN: Do you think that's happening now? HURTADO: I do actually. And it's interesting because. . . MARTIN: But that's true of all groups, isn't it? It's not only - or do you think it's that the size of the Latino market is such that it makes it easier for people to not really engage with anything outside of it? I mean. . . HURTADO: The demographics are so mind blowing of the changes, the profound changes, that are happening in this country led by the Latino community Democratic shift, particularly young kids - U. S. born and English dominant. MARTIN: I wanted to ask you - speaking of language - this is one thing I wanted to ask each of you about. I wanted to talk about language preference. Both of you are bilingual. And both of you broadcast, or shall we say distribute content in both languages. Correct? ESPUELAS: That's right. MARTIN: Right. I mean, I know. . . HURTADO: I'm predominantly in English. And I, you know, mix a little bit of Spanglish, but I do contribute to Univision, occasionally. MARTIN: Yeah, I do. HURTADO: I've been off and on the show. . . MARTIN: Yeah. HURTADO: . . . And I speak in Spanish. MARTIN: So I wanted to ask you, though, we've gotten a number of questions from listeners. Listener Alberto Morales Jr. (ph) offered this comment on our Google Plus hangout on Monday and he said, what language is the best way to communicate using social media? Should you have a social media tool and a website for your business in Spanish or is an English domain sufficient, given the fact that the population is predominately young and is English-dominant? What do you say? ESPUELAS: Well, I think that if you just look at some of the Pew research, by the third generation, the percentage of people who are Spanish-dominant is literally down to 2 percent. So if you have a forward-looking business, it will be in English. The pattern of language adoption is the same pattern of every other other immigrant group, which means by the third generation, it's fully in English. So I think, you know, my children - and I'm, you know, I'm probably going to get fired for this - but have never seen Univision TV. And not because we don't let them but because they have no interest. It's not for them. They're watching mainstream television. Now they have a high degree of identity with being Latinos, but it's not language driven. MARTIN: Are they fluent, though? Are they? ESPUELAS: No, they're not. I mean, we tried. But I think it's one of those things most - you see this in a lot of families - lots of parents who want to teach their kids Spanish. They try. The kids understand Spanish but don't speak it back. And, you know, I saw that in Brooklyn when I was young in Polish neighborhoods where, you know, the people would be speaking in English and the grandma would be speaking in Polish, and they'd be nodding their heads. MARTIN: Yeah, but the technology's different now. Grandma couldn't Skype back in the day. You know what I mean? HURTADO: Well, and I think. . . MARTIN: Right? HURTADO: . . . And I do think - Fernando is right. Just, organically, the patterns of assimilation mean that with every generation you're one degree removed from that culture and from that heritage. . . MARTIN: But you aren't. . . HURTADO: . . . And from the language. But what's different about U. S. -Latinos. . . MARTIN: Yeah. HURTADO: . . . Particularly from our generation on, is that there is a turn and you're seeing that particularly in the digital space with so many websites and blogs devoted to conserving the language and the culture and books in Spanish and bilingual tones. You're seeing this kind of desire to try to stay connected to that. But it's really a plus one. It is knowing and understanding that English is the language of power in this country. But it's also saying, but you know what, I'm plus one and I want to stay connected to that. And there's a lot of pride wrapped up in that and a lot of family and culture and connection. MARTIN: Interesting, 'cause we tried to - we tried again to connect with Ana Roca-Castro, who was part of our Google Plus hangout yesterday, and she's very deeply involved in tech - and told us that when it's a matter of, you know, business, she tends to go to English, but when it's a matter of feelings and family, she tends to go to Spanish. And I wondered, is that true for you, as well? ESPUELAS: Yeah. I mean, I think it's - for me, doing a bilingual show and just going back and forth between English and Spanish, depending on who I'm talking to - I get phone calls from young people who don't speak Spanish very well, so I switch to English. When I'm interviewing McCain or the president, obviously, I'm speaking in English. I think it's - either one is fine. MARTIN: I wanted to ask one more quick question very, very briefly about marketing. How are advertisers doing it so far? Are they kind of hitting the mark or is it too much, too little? HURTADO: Well, I - the thing about it is that brands would be absolutely delusional not to try to reach this audience. And I think one of the things that I'm going to challenge brands to do is not just to sell goods but to invest in this community. . . MARTIN: OK. HURTADO: . . . Because there is nothing more powerful than aspiration and giving the people the tools to be powerful. MARTIN: Viviana Hurtado is blogger-in-chief of the website The Wise Latina Club. Fernando Espuelas is the host of \"The Fernando Espuelas Show\" here in Washington, D. C. He was named by PODER Magazine as of the nation's 100 most influential Hispanics in 2012. Thank you both so much for joining us. ESPUELAS: Thank you. HURTADO: A ti, Michel. GraciasMARTIN: And remember, you can keep the conversation going using #NPRLatism on Twitter and Facebook.

Let's learn some more here. Officials tell NPR they understand how Edward Snowden got his hands on the documents he subsequently leaked. Here's NPR's Tom Gjelten. TOM GJELTEN, BYLINE: The Snowden disclosures just keep coming. Almost every week some newspaper publishes some new detail about the NSA's surveillance programs or the agency's relations with the court that oversees its activities. It may seem no one knows where this will end, but the NSA's chief information officer, Lonny Anderson, says investigators have Snowden's leaks mostly figured out. LONNY ANDERSON: We have an extremely good idea of exactly what data he got access to and how exactly he got access to it. GJELTEN: In interviews with NPR, two government officials share that part of the Snowden story in one of the most detailed discussions of the case to date. They say the documents that Snowden leaked, the memoranda, the PowerPoint slides, the reports, were all stored on a part of the NSA's internal website. The documents were put there so NSA analysts could read them online and discuss them. Anyone with the right top secret clearance could visit that page and read the documents. One lesson of 9/11 was that when secret information is shared, analysts are better able to connect the dots. As a systems administrator, Snowden actually had the responsibility to go to that intranet page and move especially sensitive documents to a more secure location. It was the perfect cover for someone who wanted to leak the documents. Because of Snowden's leaks, says the NSA's Lonny Anderson, that document sharing site has changed. ANDERSON: Someone today could get access to that intranet because it still exists. Could someone today do what he did? No. GJELTEN: Officials tell NPR Snowden was actually observed accessing secret documents, but the assumption was he was just doing his job. We now know he was taking the documents for his own purposes, even a top secret surveillance court opinion. Lonny Anderson. ANDERSON: Then you go back to who put the opinion there. He didn't put the opinion there. He just took advantage of the fact the opinion was there. GJELTEN: The officials interviewed by NPR won't say how Snowden was able to take the NSA documents out of his workplace. That question is part of an ongoing investigation. As of last June, when Snowden's leaks came out, some NSA computers were equipped with USB ports where thumb drives could be used. As the agency's chief technologist, Lonny Anderson says NSA security officers have now limited the options employees have for storing data on their own, thumb drives included. ANDERSON: One thing we have done post-media leaks, if you will, is lock those down hard so that those are all in two-person control areas. GJELTEN: Anderson says the NSA now intends to make it impossible for people like Snowden to work completely on their own. Going forward, Anderson says, the ability to move anonymously on NSA networks will be gone. ANDERSON: If you've got privileged access to our network like a systems administrator, if you're being given a privilege that very few people have, you're not going to do anything alone. GJELTEN: The NSA will now be tagging data with identifiers. This means people the agency leadership decide don't need to see a document won't be able to see it. And those who do see it will have their handling of that document monitored and recorded. Joel Brenner, a former NSA inspector general, says one lesson of the Snowden episode is that the agency apparently had trouble keeping two important ideas in mind at the same time. JOEL BRENNER: One of those important ideas was, and is, that we've to do a really good job at sharing information, at disseminating it to people who really need to know it, and doing it fast. The other really important idea is that a lot of this information, if it gets in the hands of people who ought not have it, hurts us very, very badly. So that information has to be protected. GJELTEN: With the NSA's new determination to protect information, there should be more security. The danger is that there may be less information sharing. Tom Gjelten, NPR News, Washington. INSKEEP: You hear Tom's reporting right here on MORNING EDITION from NPR News. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Okay. Let's learn some more here.

As a systems administrator, Snowden actually had the responsibility to go to that intranet page and move especially sensitive documents to a more secure location. It was the perfect cover for someone who wanted to leak the documents. Because of Snowden's leaks, says the NSA's Lonny Anderson, that document sharing site has changed. ANDERSON: Someone today could get access to that intranet because it still exists. Could someone today do what he did? No. GJELTEN: Officials tell NPR Snowden was actually observed accessing secret documents, but the assumption was he was just doing his job. We now know he was taking the documents for his own purposes, even a top secret surveillance court opinion. Lonny Anderson. ANDERSON: Then you go back to who put the opinion there. He didn't put the opinion there. He just took advantage of the fact the opinion was there. GJELTEN: The officials interviewed by NPR won't say how Snowden was able to take the NSA documents out of his workplace. That question is part of an ongoing investigation. As of last June, when Snowden's leaks came out, some NSA computers were equipped with USB ports where thumb drives could be used. As the agency's chief technologist, Lonny Anderson says NSA security officers have now limited the options employees have for storing data on their own, thumb drives included. ANDERSON: One thing we have done post-media leaks, if you will, is lock those down hard so that those are all in two-person control areas. GJELTEN: Anderson says the NSA now intends to make it impossible for people like Snowden to work completely on their own. Going forward, Anderson says, the ability to move anonymously on NSA networks will be gone. ANDERSON: If you've got privileged access to our network like a systems administrator, if you're being given a privilege that very few people have, you're not going to do anything alone. GJELTEN: The NSA will now be tagging data with identifiers. This means people the agency leadership decide don't need to see a document won't be able to see it. And those who do see it will have their handling of that document monitored and recorded. Joel Brenner, a former NSA inspector general, says one lesson of the Snowden episode is that the agency apparently had trouble keeping two important ideas in mind at the same time. JOEL BRENNER: One of those important ideas was, and is, that we've to do a really good job at sharing information, at disseminating it to people who really need to know it, and doing it fast. The other really important idea is that a lot of this information, if it gets in the hands of people who ought not have it, hurts us very, very badly. So that information has to be protected. GJELTEN: With the NSA's new determination to protect information, there should be more security. The danger is that there may be less information sharing. Tom Gjelten, NPR News, Washington.

I'm Audie Cornish. \"Irreversible and significant damage to U. S. national security\" - those words from Gen. Keith Alexander, director of the NSA. He was describing the result of repeated leaks by former contractor Edward Snowden. Since then, the agency has been considering whether it has to modify its approach to intelligence-gathering. NPR's Tom Gjelten recently raised that question with NSA leaders. TOM GJELTEN, BYLINE: The Snowden leaks so upset leaders of the U. S. intelligence community that they felt compelled to launch a massive damage assessment, to find out what effect the disclosures would have on intelligence operations. One official says it's by far the biggest such effort ever undertaken. At the NSA, the assessment has been led by Richard Ledgett, formerly the director of the agency's Threat Operations Center. He says the big concern is that potential terrorists, whose conversations were subject to NSA surveillance, might change to more secure communication now that details of the surveillance programs have been revealed. RICHARD LEDGETT: If there's disclosure that, you know, NSA can do this thing or that thing or that thing, then they can take action to close that vulnerability. GJELTEN: But even if terrorists do change their means of communication because of what they find out about NSA surveillance methods, the intercept program, Ledgett says, might still serve a purpose. LEDGETT: The question then becomes whether the existence of the program causes their operations to proceed more slowly or more difficult, less chance for real-time command and control. GJELTEN: For example, when Osama bin Laden learned the NSA was monitoring his satellite phone, he started sending messages by courier instead. The messages could not be intercepted, but the change meant bin Laden's communications after that were slower and more cumbersome. Ledgett says there is one way the Snowden leaks have clearly affected NSA operations: The damage assessment itself has kept NSA employees from doing their regular intelligence work. LEDGETT: We've devoted a lot of people to looking at the impact of what we think Snowden took. So it's people off task. GJELTEN: Off task because NSA people got reassigned from intelligence work to investigative work. NSA resources have also been diverted into beefing up security at the agency to prevent future leaks. The agency is now tagging data with restrictions so that analysts aren't able to access the data unless they have the right training, for example. Lonny Anderson, the NSA's chief information officer, says the change was already in the works before the Snowden disclosures, but it got speeded up. That move cost money the NSA had not planned on spending. LONNY ANDERSON: We haven't asked for additional resources. We've just said, we've got to do this. So something gives because we're not getting additional resources. So at this point, what gives for us is mission. GJELTEN: The NSA mission is intelligence gathering, now in danger of taking a backseat to security reforms, Anderson says. ANDERSON: We have to make sure that we don't cross a line where we're so busy locking down the networks that we're not busy defending the nation. GJELTEN: The Snowden episode, then, has forced the NSA to adapt. But Richard Ledgett, the chief leak investigator, says it has not prompted the NSA to rethink its whole surveillance operation - not yet, anyway. LEDGETT: It hasn't caused any major right or left turns yet, in the path the organization is taking, but those things tend to take longer to resolve. GJELTEN: So no redesign of the surveillance architecture; nor has there been any rethinking of the propriety of NSA surveillance activities in light of objections raised by privacy advocates. Jameel Jaffer, who directs the Center for Democracy at the American Civil Liberties Union, wishes NSA leaders paid more attention to the criticism of their surveillance operation. JAMEEL JAFFER: I haven't seen yet any willingness to reconsider the policies themselves. But in my view, that's exactly what should be going on. The NSA should be part of this conversation about how broad government surveillance policies ought to be. And thus far, all I've seen from the NSA is a kind of defensiveness about the programs that have been put in place. GJELTEN: Jaffer says it's ultimately up to Congress and the White House to consider changes in the NSA's surveillance authority. On that, NSA leaders agree. That's a policy decision, says Richard Ledgett, and we don't make that call. Tom Gjelten, NPR News, Washington.

I guess the smarter your smartphone gets, the more it can learn about you, and you don't even have to take it out of your pocket. All that data adds up to what is called the quantified self, a snapshot of your life based on the steps you take, the miles you run, where you go, who you meet, even how you sleep. So what do you think about all this? Do you use quantified self apps? Does this sound more like your personal privacy nightmare? You can call us at 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-TALK. Here to talk about it with us is Ellis Hamburger, who's a reported at the Verge here in New York. He joins us at SCIENCE FRIDAY. Ellis, welcome to the show. ELLIS HAMBURGER: Thanks for having me. DANKOSKY: So which one of these do you use? HAMBURGER: I actually use a combination of a few of them, and there are a few we can talk about. Some of them have more explicit goals for you, and some of them simply track you. So, the first one we can talk about is Moves. And you open it, you install it for the first time, and then you might just forget about it. You might check it at the end of every day. But as you move around every day, as you take a bike ride, go on the subway, it records what you're doing, how fast you're moving, decides if you're in the car or on a bike, and then, at the end of the day, you can actually see how many miles you've walked, how many miles you've biked, how many calories you've burned. DANKOSKY: So, first of all, let's just - I want to understand this. How does it know if I'm walking or biking or riding the train, or in my car? HAMBURGER: They use a lot of signals. It's a combination of triangulation from cell towers, GPS, whether you're connected to your Wi-Fi at home or at work, and it decides how fast you're moving using a combination of those signals. DANKOSKY: So you download this app and you put it in your pocket, and at the end of the day, what's it going to tell you? I mean, what's the report on you at the end of the day on Moves? HAMBURGER: The interesting thing about Moves is that it provides the tools to measure yourself, but it doesn't necessarily ask you to do anything with it. So you could see how many calories you've burned or how many miles you've walked. But there's another app that just came out a few weeks ago called Human that actually has a premise, a philosophy behind it, that 30 minutes per day of any kind of activity - whether you're walking or biking or running - can dramatically decrease your risk of just about any malady you can think of. So I think a goal like that is a little more accessible. DANKOSKY: I'm John Dankosky, and this is SCIENCE FRIDAY, from NPR. So, Human, this app, it has this very explicit goal, but it's not really giving you much more information than that. It's saying I want you to move around for 30 minutes a day, and essentially once you're done, yay, I've done it. Is that the point? HAMBURGER: That's the point. So, the premise of Human is based on this talk by Dr. Mike Evans. It was called \"23 and 1/2 Hours,\" and he was saying: What is the best thing you can do for your health? And his thesis was that it was 30 minutes of activity. And so Human tracks you the same way that Moves does, and at the end of the day, it says, hey, you only did 24 minutes a day. Maybe you should take a walk after dinner. And I think the habit-making, the changing your own behavior is what can matter the most here. Maybe tomorrow, you'd get off one subway stop early just so you hit your daily 30, as they call it. DANKOSKY: So, look, I pretty much am aware of what I'm doing every day. Why do I need to download an app to tell me what I'm doing every day? HAMBURGER: Are you sure you know what you're doing every day? DANKOSKY: Well, I think I know what I'm doing every day. HAMBURGER: I thought I did. DANKOSKY: OK. HAMBURGER: And once I installed a couple of these apps, I realized I was only walking 17 or 18 minutes a day. And that's what was most interesting to me, is that in your effort to move closer - especially in an urban area like New York, you want to move closer to the subway for work and for at home. And I realized I was walking three minutes to the subway in the morning, three minutes at night, a couple minutes to the office. I wasn't doing anything except walking to the bathroom during the day. And it helped me realize that maybe I should get off at Union Square and walk the rest of the way home. DANKOSKY: And you think these apps are better than some of the other devices that you can wear on your wrist or around your neck? They're - it's more convenient for you? HAMBURGER: I think convenient is the key word. If you look at something like the Jawbone Up or the Fitbit or the Nike Fuelband, you wear them, but you also have to recharge it every night. It's one more thing to maintain, even though the batteries last pretty long. And I think for most people, they love downloading apps onto their iPhone, and they love trying them out. And having it on your phone means that there's no upkeep. It's always there. And it can hurt your battery life a little bit, but on the whole, it's easier to try out, I think, than buying a $100 gadget. DANKOSKY: Tell us about - what is Memoto? HAMBURGER: Memoto is a little, square camera that you attach to your lapel - and this is a little more progressive. And it takes a photo every 30 seconds. And then, at the end of the day, it uploads the photos to the cloud, where you can review them on your computer or on your phone and see a 30-minute snapshot of every time you were meeting with somebody in the bathroom, at lunch, what have you. And the goals of that one are a little more abstract. It's kind of getting a window into recording everything you do and trying to remember all of it. DANKOSKY: So whether it's an app or a device that's taking pictures of you all the time, or one that's tracking your every movement, I would guess that there are a lot of people out there - perhaps myself included - who might think, well, this is pretty scary. I'm uploading this into the cloud. Somebody's got this information. I mean, what if my insurance company gets it? What if my boss gets it? I mean, what are the concerns here? HAMBURGER: I think there are definitely concerns. The utmost importance to most of these companies is keeping your data private. And a lot of these guys are on Amazon servers, the same way that big companies like Dropbox are. So this is industry-level. This is - sorry, government-level, like, encryption. And so you can worry about that, but I think that the benefits are greater. If you look at some of what some of these companies are doing, let's say Foursquare, which tracks the places that people go, there is so much to learn by all of this anonymized data - if we all decide to share it - about our health. That was one of the things that I learned when I was writing about Human, is that there have been so few long-term studies about something as simple as moving every day, and some of the ones they were citing were in the '90s from a company in China that was trying to create healthier lives for their workers. And they're really. . . DANKOSKY: Ah, but whenever somebody says I want to create a healthier life for you, I guess I'm worried about what they're doing - not that somebody's going to steal my data, but that the company I'm giving it to is going to do something I don't want them to do with it. HAMBURGER: Certainly a cause for concern, but I think that when you look at the level of transparency that some of these apps and gadgets give you, you can hopefully become healthier and make some changes in your life. But you're right. In the wrong hands, who knows what could happen? DANKOSKY: A last thing for you: Is there anything new that's coming out, anymore of this quantified self that we should be looking for? HAMBURGER: I think something that people don't always consider quantified self, but that's going to become more pervasive in our society is when you look at something like Google Glass, where you have the ability - not yet, because of the constraints of the battery on Google Glass. But some day, we're going to be able to record every minute of our lives. And I think people need to start thinking about what that means for them, and how that's going to affect their life and how they live it and what type of changes they might make based on what they can learn. Or maybe it's just sharing with your kids, here's what it was like when I was walking around every day. DANKOSKY: Well, we've run out of time. I'm going to go check to see how many calories I've burned during this interview. Thank you so much for joining us, Ellis Hamburger. HAMBURGER: Thanks for having me, John.

It announced on Tuesday that comments can be bad for science. And joining us to explain more about the decision is Jacob Ward, editor and chief of \"Popular Science\" magazine. Welcome to the program. JACOB WARD: Great to be with you. SIEGEL: Why are you ending comments? WARD: We had three deciding factors that it came down to. One is the rise of trolls, which is a pretty well-understood term these days - basically, people who come into a comment section of a website to be abusive or unpleasant. Second, we had bumped into on our own site, and then had seen it sort of confirmed in other places - and seen, also, studies about this - we discovered that troll behavior - that being unpleasant, being uncivil, sort being really fractious in a debate - can cause readers to actually misunderstand things that are scientifically validated. And third, we decided that it was a matter of resources. There is a way - there are many ways to patrol the comments on one's own site; but if we have a limited number of resources - and everybody does - I'd rather pour that into our primary mission, which is great journalism; putting out the best science journalism we can, rather than just trying to patrol our comments for all time. SIEGEL: Well, those were the negatives working against having comments on the articles anymore. What about the positive value of offering people the right to comment after an article they've read? WARD: You're absolutely right. There can be a great deal of lively, helpful discussion that should, in theory, compliment the primary mission of any publication, which is to put out the best journalism they can. We have, as a result, moved all of our commentary to Facebook and Twitter and Google Plus. You know, there are many, many ways for people to get in touch with us, let us know what they think of our articles. And we hope they will do so. SIEGEL: In making this decision, you cited a University of Wisconsin study which you say found that uncivil discourse in the comments after an article effects the way people digest what they just read and it can make a settled fact appear to be contentious, for example. But doesn't the study say actually that negative comments do not persuade, they only edify people who are leaning one way or another? WARD: The researchers found that the reaction was skewed by the level of fractiousness in the debate, that basically the more uncivil the discourse, the more people's perceptions had changed, their opinions changed over time. Now, you're absolutely right that a portion of readers are going to able to come through that unscathed and. . . SIEGEL: But was the finding of the University of Wisconsin study that readers typically were affected by comments or that readers who were leaning one way or the other leaned farther after reading those comments? WARD: The thing to keep in mind here is that in some cases it can intensify it. In some cases, it can skew people's understanding of an otherwise established scientific principle and it can lend this air of debate to places where science has really come to a place of consensus. SIEGEL: And you seem to have bumped into the problem here that science, at its heart, is not a populist enterprise. There's expertise. There are people who stage experiments and prove things and that's different from someone else having an opinion on the same subject. WARD: The nature of publishing a magazine about science involves sort of taking responsibility for translating science into layman's terms and that is a very holy responsibility. You know, it's one we've had for 147 years. We published Darwin. We published Isaac Asimov. We published Louis Pasteur. And so you don't, in trying to boil something down for you and I understand, cut corners. And so, we put so much work into making that possible that to then also try to take on this role of sort of comment moderation, referee, where you're inviting in any kind of commentary dressed up sometimes as science when it, in fact, is full of misleading information - that, to us, you know, it could have a place in what we do, but the way we are put together right now it's just not possible for us to control that kind of conversation. And so we decided to focus on what we can control. SIEGEL: Mr. Ward, thank you very much for talking with us. WARD: Thank you very much. Appreciate it.

That's after press reports earlier this month that the National Security Agency may have weakened computer software. The reason - to make it easier for the government to read encrypted messages. The stories have upset many encryption experts, the very people who help scramble digital communications to keep those messages secure. NPR's Larry Abramson reports. LARRY ABRAMSON, BYLINE: When Professor Matt Green, of Johns Hopkins University, chats online with his students, he takes an extra step to make sure no one else listens in. MATT GREEN: Let me see if I can find somebody who is online, who will talk to me. There's one of my grad students. ABRAMSON: Green is an expert in encryption, the science of using powerful math to encode messages. For his online chats, Green turns to Off the Record Messaging. GREEN: What I would do is, I would just choose initiate encrypted OTR chat. ABRAMSON: Green and his student must first exchange digital fingerprints, to verify their identities. GREEN: But if I do that, I can click accept. And then, from now on, all of our communications will be protected. And you can see that by the lock up in the corner. ABRAMSON: Strong encryption like this makes it extremely difficult, even for the National Security Agency, to unravel messages like these. That's why, according to reports based on leaks from Edward Snowden, the agency had to find another way in. The reports say NSA workers installed back doors in encryption programs so they could gain access when necessary. Security technologist Bruce Schneier has seen some of the encryption documents leaked by Snowden that have not been made public. Schneier says, imagine if you installed a lock on your front door that appears to be solid. BRUCE SCHNEIER: But if someone, a locksmith, goes in during install and, you know, makes it a lousy lock, you won't be able to tell the difference. It'll still work normally, but a burglar can get in. And it turns out the NSA is doing similar things with mathematics. ABRAMSON: Cryptographers are not just worried that the NSA will spy on them, more important, they say, is the chance that identity thieves, rival companies, even foreign governments might exploit that same back door. Matt Green says, once the door is open, you never know who will get in. GREEN: Turns out that for a whole bunch of technical reasons, it's very hard to build back doors that only you can find and only you can exploit. ABRAMSON: The National Security Agency won't comment directly on the allegation it is creating back doors, but it points out that breaking encryption is one of its chief roles. Richard Ledgett currently runs the NSA taskforce looking into the Snowden leaks. He points out that terrorists and spies use the same Internet to communicate as ordinary Americans. RICHARD LEDGETT: We have to be able to work against the technologies that that Internet uses. It doesn't mean that we're using that to go against Americans. ABRAMSON: Because the law forbids the agency from spying on U. S. persons and there's no evidence that the NSA has been decoding messages between innocent people. Still, the news stories have created anxiety across the tech world. Because of those concerns, the National Institute of Standards and Technology has reopened a widely used encryption standard for public comment and the security company RSA has told its clients to stop using that same standard. At the same time, the encryption kerfuffle may have created a new demand for more security technologies. Vic Hyder(ph) is chief operations officer for Silent Circle, which offers secure communications services. Hyder says Silent Circle creates and then quickly destroys a new encryption key for each conversation. VIC HYDER: At the end of the conversation, the key is deleted. It's dissolved and gone. There's nothing to pick up. ABRAMSON: Hyder says his company has never been approached by the NSA to install a back door in its software but media reports indicate other companies may have worked with the agency or been forced to. Former NSA general counsel Stewart Baker says the government has a powerful interest in making sure it can decode any messages. STEWART BAKER: And it will find a way to impose a requirement on manufacturers of a product. ABRAMSON: Among cryptographers, there is a sense that they have been betrayed by fellow code writers at the NSA. Matt Green of Johns Hopkins University takes the whole thing pretty personally. GREEN: That kind of offends me. And it offends me because it makes Americans less secure, not just because it facilitates the NSA's job. ABRAMSON: Still, despite all the suspicion, Green says encryption is essential. The answer, he says, is to keep coming up with products that are as secure as they can be. Larry Abramson, NPR News.

I'm Celeste Headlee. Michel Martin is away. Coming up, a New Jersey judge has ordered the state to allow same-sex marriage. We'll find out what that means in the garden state and beyond. But first, we're going to continue our look at Hispanic Heritage Month. We've been showcasing the different roles that Latinos play in everything from business to politics, but they're also making their presence felt online. And one blog is using the space to rebel. We're joined now by Julio Ricardo Varela. He's the founder of the blog Latino Rebels. Welcome to the program, Julio. JULIO RICARDO VARELA: Hi, Celeste, how are you? HEADLEE: You know, it's no surprise to me that you'd start this blog. I mean, obviously, you're filling a gap - a place where the media wasn't covering. Do you feel like you still need it? Is any of that gap between the news coming out of Latino America and the news that's being covered - is any of that gap shortening? VARELA: Oh, totally. It's totally shortening. I mean, we started LatinoRebels. com two years ago, 2011, and it was a time where we saw a lack of English-language underreported stories in the U. S. -Latino community. It was about the time that other outlets started to do it, but we were kind of one of the first and we were - since we're independent and a little bit alternative, we found our niche pretty quickly. But yeah, no, it's happening a lot. It's happening with Fox News Latino, NBC Latino, Fusion, which is a new ABC-Univision partnership, HuffPost Latino Voices. A lot of pages that we've seen the last couple of years and we have really good relationships with. They're all good people. And we're all kind of in this together to, like, quote \"High School Musical. \" And it's just a lot of fun. HEADLEE: Well, let me ask you about one of the issues. You know, sadly, this is one of the issues that, to a certain extent, is assumed Latinos care the most about and that's immigration. Although, I wonder if it still is. We did have the DREAMers, over the weekend, headed to the border. Is immigration the number one concern among Latinos in America? VARELA: I always say that it might not be the number one concern, but it's the number one issue within our hearts. And I think what's happened with the online world is that there's such an authentic, unfiltered voice out there. So, for example, the border action that's happening in Laredo today is something that is happening that was never planned, it was never something that people said, oh, let's - we have to do this. It's just honest voices that are now being covered by English-language outlets, particularly those that are interested in Latino issues. But it's something that we've always covered. And that online community's been around for years, but because now people are starting to see this as something that matters, I would argue that it might be the most important issue in our hearts. It might not be the most important issue in our heads. And I think we're kind of redefining identity because of that, and that's where there's so many opportunities to talk about it, dissect it, debate it, challenge it, criticize it, celebrate it, and that's what it's all about, right. That's what we try to do. HEADLEE: Well, since you've mentioned the word authentic, and this came up also at the beginning of this month when TELL ME MORE had a Google hangout chat focused on Latinos in the media. This idea of authenticity - how do you know when somebody outside the community is actually being authentic as opposed to pandering? VARELA: That's a great question. I think when people actually start seeing what's going on online and that a lot of the stories that we cover and we share, literally, come from the ground up. So when someone tweets us or when someone sends us a Facebook message or when someone posts or goes to our Tumblr site and they say this is a story that's important to me, we cover it. Why we do what we do comes to the matter - is that we love to listen what our community tells us. And it's a hard lesson for media outlets to stop believing that they are more important than their readers or their followers. We see everyone on the same level and that's what social media's all about. My profile is just as important as your profile, it's just as important as the person that has 10 followers. And that's freaking companies out because it's no longer a one-way communication, and good things come out of that. HEADLEE: And yet, another thing, which, as you say, might freak people out is that there's not a unified voice coming from the Latino community. I mean, the example of - for example, Little Miss Hispanic Delaware is a perfect example. And I think your blog doesn't shy away from criticizing your own community, but there's certainly not any kind of universal agreement on either what is a Latino-authentic persona, what looks like an authentic Latino-American. VARELA: Exactly, exactly. HEADLEE: I mean, that's a little freaky for people outside of the community as well, don't you think? VARELA: Well, yes it is and that's the problem. I think there's a lot of responsibilities here. You know, Latino Rebels represents probably about 10 countries and so our diversity is in the people that's in the group. And we just want that voice to continue to be reflected and, yeah, we are. When we do feel like something is being done for the wrong reasons, we have no problem, whether criticizing our own community or criticizing people that think they know our community. HEADLEE: Well, then let me get you on record here, the case that I'm talking about with Little Miss Hispanic Delaware - they were considering taking away her prize, and I guess, are in the process of taking it away - yeah, because they feel like she doesn't best represent Latino beauty. Many people think she looks too black. Her grandmother was from the Dominican Republic. Where do you fall down on that debate? VARELA: It's the biggest elephant in the room in terms of race and identity in the U. S. -Latino community. There are issues of the fact that when you look at mass media entertainment, particularly in Latin America and particularly in Spanish-language television in the United States, white is always seen as being superior. And what I love about all this is that the community knows that - you know, they know the scoop. They know that this is something that needs to be questioned, needs to get dissected, needs to be, like, called out and said, you know what, this is wrong. The only thing I can hope for is that something positive is going to come out of this. I feel really badly for the 7-year-old little girl. It's just something like - why, I mean, why did it have to happen? Someone got upset and it's because she was not, quote-unquote, Latina enough and she happened to be, like, darker skin tone? I mean, this is ridiculous. HEADLEE: That was Julio Ricardo Varela. He's the founder of the blog Latino Rebels. You can check them out at LatinoRebels. com. Kind enough to join us from member station WGBH in Boston. Julio, thanks so much. VARELA: It was a pleasure. Saludos (ph). CELESTE HEADLEE, HOST:  This is TELL ME MORE from NPR News.

It was about the time that other outlets started to do it, but we were kind of one of the first and we were - since we're independent and a little bit alternative, we found our niche pretty quickly. But yeah, no, it's happening a lot. It's happening with Fox News Latino, NBC Latino, Fusion, which is a new ABC-Univision partnership, HuffPost Latino Voices. A lot of pages that we've seen the last couple of years and we have really good relationships with. They're all good people. And we're all kind of in this together to, like, quote \"High School Musical. \" And it's just a lot of fun. HEADLEE: Well, let me ask you about one of the issues. You know, sadly, this is one of the issues that, to a certain extent, is assumed Latinos care the most about and that's immigration. Although, I wonder if it still is. We did have the DREAMers, over the weekend, headed to the border. Is immigration the number one concern among Latinos in America? VARELA: I always say that it might not be the number one concern, but it's the number one issue within our hearts. And I think what's happened with the online world is that there's such an authentic, unfiltered voice out there. So, for example, the border action that's happening in Laredo today is something that is happening that was never planned, it was never something that people said, oh, let's - we have to do this. It's just honest voices that are now being covered by English-language outlets, particularly those that are interested in Latino issues. But it's something that we've always covered. And that online community's been around for years, but because now people are starting to see this as something that matters, I would argue that it might be the most important issue in our hearts. It might not be the most important issue in our heads. And I think we're kind of redefining identity because of that, and that's where there's so many opportunities to talk about it, dissect it, debate it, challenge it, criticize it, celebrate it, and that's what it's all about, right. That's what we try to do. HEADLEE: Well, since you've mentioned the word authentic, and this came up also at the beginning of this month when TELL ME MORE had a Google hangout chat focused on Latinos in the media. This idea of authenticity - how do you know when somebody outside the community is actually being authentic as opposed to pandering? VARELA: That's a great question. I think when people actually start seeing what's going on online and that a lot of the stories that we cover and we share, literally, come from the ground up. So when someone tweets us or when someone sends us a Facebook message or when someone posts or goes to our Tumblr site and they say this is a story that's important to me, we cover it. Why we do what we do comes to the matter - is that we love to listen what our community tells us. And it's a hard lesson for media outlets to stop believing that they are more important than their readers or their followers. We see everyone on the same level and that's what social media's all about. My profile is just as important as your profile, it's just as important as the person that has 10 followers. And that's freaking companies out because it's no longer a one-way communication, and good things come out of that. HEADLEE: And yet, another thing, which, as you say, might freak people out is that there's not a unified voice coming from the Latino community. I mean, the example of - for example, Little Miss Hispanic Delaware is a perfect example. And I think your blog doesn't shy away from criticizing your own community, but there's certainly not any kind of universal agreement on either what is a Latino-authentic persona, what looks like an authentic Latino-American. VARELA: Exactly, exactly. HEADLEE: I mean, that's a little freaky for people outside of the community as well, don't you think? VARELA: Well, yes it is and that's the problem. I think there's a lot of responsibilities here. You know, Latino Rebels represents probably about 10 countries and so our diversity is in the people that's in the group. And we just want that voice to continue to be reflected and, yeah, we are. When we do feel like something is being done for the wrong reasons, we have no problem, whether criticizing our own community or criticizing people that think they know our community. HEADLEE: Well, then let me get you on record here, the case that I'm talking about with Little Miss Hispanic Delaware - they were considering taking away her prize, and I guess, are in the process of taking it away - yeah, because they feel like she doesn't best represent Latino beauty. Many people think she looks too black. Her grandmother was from the Dominican Republic. Where do you fall down on that debate? VARELA: It's the biggest elephant in the room in terms of race and identity in the U. S. -Latino community. There are issues of the fact that when you look at mass media entertainment, particularly in Latin America and particularly in Spanish-language television in the United States, white is always seen as being superior. And what I love about all this is that the community knows that - you know, they know the scoop. They know that this is something that needs to be questioned, needs to get dissected, needs to be, like, called out and said, you know what, this is wrong. The only thing I can hope for is that something positive is going to come out of this. I feel really badly for the 7-year-old little girl. It's just something like - why, I mean, why did it have to happen? Someone got upset and it's because she was not, quote-unquote, Latina enough and she happened to be, like, darker skin tone? I mean, this is ridiculous. HEADLEE: That was Julio Ricardo Varela. He's the founder of the blog Latino Rebels. You can check them out at LatinoRebels. com. Kind enough to join us from member station WGBH in Boston. Julio, thanks so much. VARELA: It was a pleasure. Saludos (ph).", "section": "Technology", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2013 NPR.

I'm Ira Flatow. One of the selling points of storing your data on the Cloud or an encrypted file you created with your high-tech software was the idea that no one, no one else could break in, even with the use of the world's most advanced supercomputers. But with the revelation that the NSA can see inside some of the codes on the data, you were assured was uncrackable, what does it all mean now? Joining me now to talk about it are some of the people who helped build the Internet security system. If you'd like to talk about this our number is 1-800-989-8255. And you can Tweet us at scifri. Matthew Green is an assistant research professor in the department of computer science at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. He specializes in cryptography. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. MATT GREEN: Hi, it's nice to be here. FLATOW: Thank you. Phil Zimmerman is the creator of PGP. You remember that? That's the encryption system involved in many communication systems, which used to be pretty good protection. He's also president and co-founder of Silent Circle Company developing secure messaging and voice communications that's based in the National Harbor, Maryland. Welcome back, Phil, to the program. PHIL ZIMMERMAN: Thanks, Ira. I'm glad you remember. I was here in the late '90s. FLATOW: Oh, when it comes to that stuff I never forget. Martin E. Hellman is a professor emeritus of electrical engineering at Stanford. He's perhaps best known for his invention of public key cryptography in cooperation with Whitfield Diffie and Ralph Merkle in the mid 1970s. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. MARTIN HELLMAN: Thank you, Ira. FLATOW: Let me - let's do some preliminary spade work here and talk. Matt, how was the NSA able to break into the supposedly secure files that we all thought were secure? GREEN: Well, we still don't completely know the answer to that. What we know now is a lot more than we knew a month ago. What we thought a month ago was that the algorithms in the systems we had were very secure, secure enough that that was the part of the system we didn't have to worry about. Unfortunately, what we've recently learned, thanks to a series of leaks, is that the NSA has been doing a number of things. They've actually been developing new attacks but they've also been going out and weakening some of the encryption standards and products that we use to make those files secure. And that seems to be one of the basic ways that they have to get by this encryption. FLATOW: You mean, they helped create the standards and so they knew how to break them. GREEN: Yes. In fact, the NSA's role, by law, is to both secure American information systems and also to attack foreign information systems. The problem here is that it's very hard to separate those two roles. So whenever they've had an opportunity to promote standards, it appears that they may have taken some of that opportunity to actually weaken the standards that we use here in America. FLATOW: Phil Zimmerman, does that mean that there's nothing that can be encrypted now that can't be broken? ZIMMERMAN: No, it doesn't mean that. There's a lot of encryption products out there and some of them are more carefully designed than others. I feel a little self-conscious in saying this but I'd like to point out that conspicuously absent from any of the Snowden documents is any mention of any of my products or. . . (LAUGHTER)ZIMMERMAN: . . . so I'm feeling pretty good about that. FLATOW: Do you think they haven't broken them, is that what you're saying? ZIMMERMAN: I think they haven't because they still use them for classified - protecting classified data. FLATOW: So what did you do in your product that made it unbreakable? ZIMMERMAN: Well, you know, I'm kind of a fanatic about these things, and my OCD personality kind of helps. (LAUGHTER)FLATOW: But there was also some mention in the reading of - the research on this that the companies had to - were forced to cooperate with the federal government in allowing their stuff to be broken into, or giving them over the records they were looking for. ZIMMERMAN: In some cases they were forced, if there was a particular case, you know, like if there was a court order. But in other cases I think it was a matter of the NSA just trying to get companies to cooperate with them in a friendly way, or maybe some way they were incentivized. FLATOW: Martin Hellman, you and your colleagues developed the idea of a public key encryption years ago. Give us a brief sketch of how that works. HELLMAN: Yeah, well, the other thing that we were involved in was fighting the weakening of the data encryption standard back in - when it came - was promulgated in 1975. One other thing I just want to add is there are many ways to get a data that's been encrypted without actually breaking the encryption system. There have been reports that Comodo, one of the certificate authorities may have been broken into by NSA. We used to think it was Iran that had done it. And so you can work around encryption very often. I mean, if you get a key logger put on someone's machine, for example, no encryption will get around that because you can see what they're typing in before it's encrypted. Do you still want me to go back to. . . FLATOW: No, no. Keep going with this. So this - in other words you can get into someone's computer and not have to break anything. HELLMAN: Right. And another example - this actually happened with SmartCard. There was a really good secret key built into SmartCards which were in heavy us in Europe. And a colleague of mine, Paul Kocher, figured out how you could read the secret key off just by how much power the chip was using basically as the chip - it goes to the secret key and does its operations. It uses less power when there's a zero in the secret key and more power when there's a one. So as it goes through the, let's say, thousand bits of secret key, you see low power, low power, high power and you know that's 001. You don't have to actually break the system. These are tempest attacks. So, there's lots of things that can be done. FLATOW: If you go with a, if you hire a foreign company to store your data that is immune from American government, would that be a safer thing to do, so that the government can't ask to see your stuff? HELLMAN: To paraphrase that, we don't know. (LAUGHTER)HELLMAN: First, we've got to worry about the foreign government and is the foreign government secure against NSA? Is it secure against the Russian equivalent? You know, it's a real problem. I think you have to be careful whenever you put something in the Cloud. And even put things on your computer. I mean. . . ZIMMERMAN: A lot of the governments take advantage of the fact that you're giving your data to a third party. You're giving it to a service provider and then they approach the service provider and ask them for the data. That's probably going on in other countries too. FLATOW: But you say, Phil, that you still think that you can - that your encryption stuff is good enough. ZIMMERMAN: Well, I would rather not say that myself. I'd rather have others say that. FLATOW: Are you putting a target on your head now? HELLMAN: Ira, one other thing. It's important to recognize that there are tradeoffs - this is Martin Hellman again. . . FLATOW: Yes. HELLMAN: . . . that there are tradeoffs involved here. And I mentioned, when your producer called me, that I'm not as active in this area as Phil or Matt is now. My primary concern for many years has been nuclear weapons and how we're going to survive possessing these things. And so right now everybody's up in arms over NSA's snooping, and rightly they should be. On the other hand, let there be a nuclear terrorist incident or even something like September 11th again and you'll find the country saying, who the hell was standing in the way of NSA's snooping? So we need to recognize that there's a tradeoff here. And I also think we need to recognize that one of the reasons we're a target - the main reason we're a target as a nation for terrorist activity and NSA doing things like this has some beneficial interest, is because we have such a heavy military emphasis on our foreign policy. Basically, our civil liberties are collateral damage to our national security state. FLATOW: Phil, would you agree with that? ZIMMERMAN: Yeah, I think that we went a little crazy after 9/11. And if we are attacked again we might go a little crazy again. Maybe as the years have gone by we've recovered our sanity. And now - and, you know, if we get attacked again our insanity will be refreshed. FLATOW: So we're talking about national security issues here, when national security is - it's a tradeoff to our privacy. HELLMAN: Exactly. And underlying it all is the fact that we have basically in a 24/7, 365-day year national security state, which is causing this. If we want our civil liberties back we're going to have to become a lot less militaristic in our approach to things. ZIMMERMAN: You know, in World War II we abridged the civil liberties of a lot of people, especially Japanese and put them in internment camps. And after the war was over we let them go and realized that that was a heavy-handed thing to do and inappropriate. And we kind of promised never to do it again. But that's because the war was over. What's happening now is that the war never ends. And so each level - each increment of the encroachment of civil liberties becomes the new normal. GREEN: So one of the - this is Matt Green - one of the points here is that we don't know what's going to happen in the future. We don't know who's going to be reading this information that's being collected by the NSA. We don't know who's going to be using these products that the NSA has weakened. So it's very important for us to make sure that in the time we have now, we build the infrastructure for people to have privacy and prevent that information from being scooped up into databases. And that's why what's happening now is so important. HELLMAN: I would add something to that, Matt. it's also important that we have better oversights than we now have. Like, I was unaware until I read the newspaper report that Chief Justice Roberts appoints all the FISA judges. That's a potential single point failure. GREEN: Yeah. HELLMAN: Or depending on your politics, it is a single point failure. GREEN: Yeah. FLATOW: Explain that. Explain that to our listeners. HELLMAN: Oh. There is this FISA court that has to approve warrants to go into - for domestic intelligence operations. And - but all of the judges are appointed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, currently Chief Justice Roberts. And the news reports have indicated that, I think, nine of his 12 appointees have been Republican. There's the potential for appointing a non-oversight oversight. And so we really need highly knowledgeable people, people like Matt and Phil, with high clearances who are reviewing what's being done and making sure that it's right. We shouldn't just have senators and congressmen involved in it. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Let me just play devil's advocate for a moment and, you know, in the height of the Cold War - on movies, on television, in the news - you would always hear when they talked about a Communist state. They would always say, well, we're doing this because of national security. You're able to - you know, we tap your phones, we listen in, we do whatever, because of national security. Doesn't that make you think that maybe, you know, we are sort of falling into that same kind of rhetoric here? GREEN: Yeah. Unfortunately, national security is the root password of the U. S. Constitution. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And it justifies any amount of loss of privacy. GREEN: It appears. I mean, that seems to be the way things are done. I think we need to recognize that part of our national security is in the civil liberties that we have. We lose national security when we create a surveillance infrastructure that's so powerful, trained on our own domestic population that some future administration could abuse to remain in power. We have no idea who will be in the White House in 2017. Will he have the moral sensibilities of Thomas Jefferson or Vladimir Putin? What would happen if a future government turns really bad and has the ability to know everything about everyone all the time? FLATOW: Facial recognition everywhere. GREEN: Yeah. Tracking of all of our movements, all of our transactions, all of our communications, every web page we look at, every little muscle twitch we make. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR talking with Phil Zimmerman and Matt Green and Martin Hellman. Phil, your company does secure chat and secure voice but it recently stopped secure email service. Why is that? ZIMMERMAN: Well, email is different from secure telephony and secure instant messaging in that it involves persistent keys that have to be managed over a long term. And, you know, the work that I did on PGP was encryption software that runs on your laptop computer. But we didn't have a version of PGP that could run on a smartphone and it would take us a long time to write one. And we'd have to write a mail application to go with it because you can't integrate something into, say, Apple's mail application or the one on Android. So it would take a lot of engineering effort that we didn't want to wait that long. So we put it on the server instead. But that means we'd have to store the keys on the server too and that means they're an invitation to a national security letter or some kind of court order. And we felt that that was a bit too vulnerable. But, you know, even if we didn't store the keys there, there would still be the metadata that would be exposed there. Even if the message bodies are encrypted, as they would with PGP, there's still the metadata, the information that says who it's from, who it's to, the subject line, the date and time stamp, the IP address of where it came from, that sort of thing. That's all exposed. And as we've seen from our recent revelations from Snowden, the metadata is extremely important. I mean, we always knew that in the business of - in the crypto business but we're seeing how that's applied in the real world and it is indeed an extremely powerful way of learning about what everyone's doing. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Matthew, Martin, any comment? GREEN: Well, I think that we - the only comment I would have is that as cryptographers, as security people, we've known about these attacks for a long time. Things like the vulnerability of metadata and how email is difficult to secure. It's very interesting to see it from the other perspective, to see that there are people at the NSA who are thinking about exactly the same things as we are and exploiting them. ZIMMERMAN: What I find so different from our theoretical considerations of what we imagined is that this is so breathtakingly comprehensive in its scope that we just never imagined it applied on such a grand scale. FLATOW: What's that famous line? Failure of the imagination. ZIMMERMAN: Yeah. HELLMAN: Yeah. Martin Hellman here. Computers get cheaper - computation and storage gets cheaper by about a factor of 10 every five years so it's to the point now where you could store on roughly $100 hard drive every conversation you have through your whole life. And so there's a lot of potential there. But this is - while there's some of these new risks that we're facing, a lot of this is old. Just recently, the George Washington University's national security archive, which is a great place for getting at formerly classified information using the Freedom of Information Act requests got a formerly classified NSA history that notes during the height of the Vietnam War protest movements in the late '60s and early '70s, NSA tapped the overseas communications of people like Martin Luther King, Muhammad Ali, New York Times journalists, and then Washington Post humor columnist Art Buchwald and most startlingly, they say, two prominent members of Congress, Senators Frank Church and Howard Baker. So what's new, I think, is the potential scale of what they can store and what they can get at. FLATOW: All right. We're going to take a break and talk lots more with Matthew Green, Phil Zimmerman, Martin Hellman. And your calls are number 1-800-989-8255. You can also tweet us at scifri. Go to our website sciencefriday. com, join the conversation there. We'll be right back after this break. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)FLATOW: This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour about encryption and security with my guests Matthew Green of Johns Hopkins University, Phil Zimmermann, creator of PGP and co-founder of Silent Circle, and Martin Hellman of Stanford. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. We're going to go to the phones. Before we go to the phones, though, Matt, I want to ask you what are some of the things that we know that the NSA has broken into? GREEN: So we have heard a number of things that we can probably credit for real. One of them is 4G phones - cell phones is mentioned. Those phones use encryption to keep people from being able to intercept and listen to your phone calls. That encryption has been weakened in some way. We don't know how. Another example, there are these things called random number generators that are used in almost every security product, including web servers. So when you go to Amazon. com and you see that little lock to protect your credit card number, there's a random number generator there. And we know that NSA through NIST, which is the National Institutes of Standards and Technology, has very likely put back doors in some of those standard algorithms that allow them to essentially break those systems entirely. FLATOW: You mean the NSA created those back doors? GREEN: That's exactly right. So NIST works with NSA and they're required to by law. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. GREEN: We thought that NSA was helping NIST build more secure standards for Americans to use. We now suspect and have strong evidence to believe that actually the situation was exactly the opposite, that NIST was being used to put out standards that the NSA could break. FLATOW: If I go to the Cloud now and I want to store stuff in one of these Cloud services that says don't worry, we're absolutely secure, is that a little bit misleading? ZIMMERMAN: In some cases it might be, but, you know, I think that regarding the random number generator, NIST has published several random number generators and one of them is just egregiously awful. And cryptographers recognized years ago that it was egregiously awful in its design and most - no competent cryptographer would knowingly use it unless he was turned to the dark side. GREEN: And yet. . . ZIMMERMAN: And yet RSA did a security - did use it as their default random number generator. And they do have competent cryptographers working there. So. FLATOW: How do you explain that? ZIMMERMAN: Well, I'm not going to - I think I'd rather not be the one to say. (LAUGHTER)FLATOW: But if someone else were to say it, what would they say? ZIMMERMAN: Well, someone else might say that maybe they were incentivized. HELLMAN: Let me - this is Martin Hellman. Let me bring up a question for the other two guys. Back in the - maybe we need a less confrontational approach to NSA. And I'll explain why historically I believe that. Back in the '70s and '80s and in the '90s when we were in confrontation with NSA over their attempts to weaken security, we didn't get good security. They used their export - their ability to control export to also control the domestic market because companies didn't want to have separate - most companies didn't want to have separate products domestically and internationally. And so while we fought a good fight, we didn't really get what we wanted. It was only after a National Research Council committee on which I served had a representative from NSA, a representative from law enforcement, as well as privacy advocates like myself and we got together and talked that we were able to get reasonably good crypto exportable. And so what if the option is if we don't have NSA's blessing everybody will be able to listen in, whereas with NSA's blessings, maybe the government will be able to listen in and maybe there will be adequate oversight if maybe we can negotiate that. GREEN: No. HELLMAN: What do you guys - is it different today? GREEN: Well, we did get the export controls lifted at the end of the '90s and now strong crypto is the norm in the industry. We're able to export strong crypto and we're able to design our own strong crypto without any help from NSA. Most of the NIST standards are good standards. They publish quite a few documents and I've read many of them and they're really excellent. It's only in rare cases - I mean, there was that random number generator and I haven't found anything else. Perhaps maybe some - there are some elliptic curves that they published that are not as strong as we now know how to design. But they still use them for secret and top secret government application. So I don't think that there's any weakness in them. ZIMMERMAN: Well, that's the really surprising part of this. And I just want to be clear. When we talk about crypto, we're not talking about hackers and criminals and members of Anonymous communicating with each other over the Internet. We're talking about you. We're talking about people visiting websites. GREEN: Yeah. ZIMMERMAN: We're talking about companies exchanging data with banks. GREEN: Sure. ZIMMERMAN: Banks exchanging data with the federal government, even sensitive data that might have national security implications. GREEN: Well, our health care records are encrypted by law. In fact, you know, I mean, the legislative environment today is so different than it was in the '90s. In the '90s if you used strong crypto you had to explain yourself. You had to make excuses. You had to defend allegations that you're a criminal and that you're up to no good and you want to hide your wrongdoing with strong crypto. Today, if you don't use strong crypto you have to explain yourself. You may be legally liable if you're not using strong crypto. If you're a doctor and you don't encrypt your patient records, then why aren't you? You know, you're not HIPAA compliant. If you leave your laptop in a taxi with 200,000 customer identities on it, you better hope that disc is encrypted because if it's not you have an obligation to come clean with the public and tell them that you've lost 200,000 customer identities. In England, it's even worse. You could even face criminal liabilities in that case. So crypto is required by law. For Sarbanes-Oxley, you know, for best practices of protecting corporate assets, you have to use crypto. And I mean there's all kinds of legal obligations to use strong crypto today. It's now mainstream. FLATOW: But if you have no, quote/unquote \"good reason\" to use strong crypto, if you don't belong to any of those groups and you're just a geeky guy or woman who wants to have strong crypto. Do you then become the target? Because what reason do you have to have this unless you're doing something bad. ZIMMERMAN: Well, everyone does online banking and every time you order something from Amazon you enter your credit card number and you've got to protect that with strong crypto. GREEN: Every time you use Facebook or Gmail you're using strong crypto whether you notice it or not. That crypto is there and it's also there to protect those companies from any kind of interception. FLATOW: Well, I had assumed that Skype was using cryptography for its voice calls until I learned that they voluntarily allowed the government to go in there. GREEN: Yeah. As I mentioned before, sometimes these companies voluntarily cooperate with the government. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. 1-800-989-8255. Let's get some callers in. Peter in Berkeley. Hi, Peter. PETER: Thank you, gentlemen, for this fascinating and very important discussion. It's kind of like being the founding fathers of a new age and I really appreciate it. So I'd like to comment about we need a less confrontational approach with NSA. I'm a patriot, like most Americans, and I don't mind being looked at, even helped in some way with some intrusion online, but I'd just like to know the source. I'd like the source to be identified. I'd like us to lean in overt versus covert intelligence and trust that honesty is, you know, the great virtue that can guide us, both the lookers and the participators. But last night, to give an example, I was working on a review under deadline for, by the way, a fabulous musical, \"1776,\" out here in San Francisco with ACP. FLATOW: It's a great musical, yeah. PETER: In a great theater. But here I was and I really wanted to get this out. And all of a sudden, in my Gmail, where I was composing, a lot of the text selectively got really tiny compared to the rest. And it looked like somebody was really there online with me, you know, manipulating, making suggestions. Well, look at this phrase again and look at that. But it was kind of discouraging, you know, also to be intruded and not know who was doing it. And I ended up not getting it out. So how can we protect our Gmail? A lot of people are Gmail users. ZIMMERMAN: I don't know how to tell you how to protect your Gmail because in the case of Gmail Google scans Gmail for key words and uses it to guide their decisions about what kind of advertising to show you. I don't use Gmail and I don't use Facebook. I, you know, I prefer to use email services that are private. Actually, I have my own mail server in my closet, so - but I don't know if I'm the norm. I would find a way to do email that's more private. GREEN: So I do think that the answer is, like we just discussed, the way that these web connections work, the Gmail, they're secured. We use cryptography to prevent people from intercepting those connections, from tampering with your account, from getting malware onto your computer. That's why we use this crypto. And we don't want it to be weakened for that reason. Yeah. FLATOW: Well, when you go into Gmail, the EULA, the End User License Agreement, tells you that they're going to be snooping around in your Gmail and you shouldn't be surprised by that. ZIMMERMAN: Yeah. A lot of these Internet companies monetize customer data and that's their business model. They're providing a free service. And in fact, their customer - you're not their customer. You're an asset that they sell to their real customers, which is advertisers. You know, I have a startup company called Silent Circle that encrypts phone calls and text messages and we don't monetize anything except by collecting money from customers that pay us actual money. And so, you know, our business model is part of our security model. We don't sell you out to anyone. We just - all we want is your money. Just give us your money and no one gets hurt. (LAUGHTER)HELLMAN: There's no free lunch. There's no free crypto. ZIMMERMAN: That's right. That's right. FLATOW: Matt, if you're looking to break into an encryption system, how do you go about doing that? GREEN: So we know that there are kind of three ways to do this. The one that you should not probably try is the hardest, which is to go after the actual mathematics of the encryption. The modern algorithms we use are mostly very strong and you could spend the rest of your life trying to break RSA or AS, which are two of the common algorithms we use on the Web. The way that you would probably do the best if you were trying to break into an encryption system is to attack the software that implements it. And I think Bruce Schneier, who is a very famous cryptographer, said it best when he looked at the Snowden documents himself. He said that the mathematics is strong but the code has been subverted. And by that he meant that the software we were using had in some way been weakened, even the crypto itself was strong. And so that seems to be the best way to go about weakening crypto. ZIMMERMAN: Sometimes this means that they will attack your computer or your mobile phone with some kind of attack that subverts the platform, the computer, instead of trying to break the crypto with cryptanalysis. Think of it as a - if you imagine if you have a steel door on your house, instead of trying to drill through six inches of solid steel, someone could just smash the window with their fist, reach inside, and turn the doorknob and open it. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. Let's go to the phones, see if we've got a phone call in. Frank in Washington D. C. Hi, Frank. FRANK: Hi. I'm calling about how the encryption system of PGP is also associated with the trapdoor codes. I think that came up already since I called. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. FRANK: That large prime numbers will make this kind of encryption more hard - harder to break. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Let me ask Phil. ZIMMERMAN: Yeah. I want to hasten to add here that, you know, trapdoors is a different thing than back doors. Trapdoor functions are. . . FLATOW: Trade craft talk here. ZIMMERMAN: Yeah. FLATOW: Tell us about that. ZIMMERMAN: I think he was just saying something nice about PGP. (LAUGHTER)FLATOW: So what's the different between a trapdoor and a back door? ZIMMERMAN: A back door is some kind of secret way that you can break in without knowing the key, or to get your hands on the key. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. ZIMMERMAN: A trapdoor is - in mathematics there are some mathematical functions that are easy to calculate in one direction but very hard to calculate in the reverse direction. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Let me see if - in the few minutes that I have left, let me ask all of you to where you see the future going with all of this. Let me start with you, Phil. ZIMMERMAN: Well, you know, when I think about - I mean, I often hear this question of where do I think the future is going. And to be the question of trying to predict the future is I never really want to try to predict the future. Instead, I try to make the future. The best way to predict the future is to make the future. What we should do is - there's something a little passive about predicting the future. What we should be doing is thinking of what we'd like to have in the future and working as hard as we can to get there. And what I'd like to have, is I'd like to change the laws. We can't do it all with technology. We have to push back in policy space. We have to change the laws. We have to realize that what we've done here is we went a little crazy after 9/11 and we've created this powerful surveillance infrastructure that's just incredibly powerful. That the NSA has created with 35,000 mathematicians and scientists applying their genius to create this thing. And it's so powerful that it is too tempting to the rest of the government. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. ZIMMERMAN: It's like that \"Lord of the Rings\" character - who was. . . GREEN: Boromir. ZIMMERMAN: Boromir, right. Who wanted to use the ring for good instead of evil. But in fact, the ring is so powerful that you can't. You just can't. FLATOW: Now, let me get - we're running out of time. Let me get another comment. Matt, what do you think? GREEN: Well, I think the public policy answers are important. We need to go to Congress; we need to get answers on this. I look at the technical answers. I think the very quick answer for me is that we need to start using open source software where it matters. We need to be able to see the code we're using and we need to know if there are back doors in it. So that's a start, anyway. ZIMMERMAN: Amen. FLATOW: And Martin? HELLMAN: Better oversight, which I emphasized before. You know, less confrontational approach, not just with NSA but a less confrontational approach as a nation.  If we keep getting into wars that we don't need to get into, then we're going to be this target and we're need this kind of snooping and we're going to have collateral damage to our civil liberties. FLATOW: All right. Gentlemen, I thank you for taking a lot of your time to be talking about this. It's just the beginning. There's lots to talk about. Phil Zimmerman, creator of PGP, also president and cofounder of Silent Circle. That's based in National Harbor, Maryland. Martin Hellman, professor emeritus of electrical engineering at Stanford. And Matthew Green, assistant research professor in the department of computer science at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Thank you all for taking time to be with us today. HELLMAN: Bye, Ira. FLATOW: You're welcome. ZIMMERMAN: So long. GREEN: Thank you. It's a pleasure to be here. IRA FLATOW, HOST:  This is SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. One of the selling points of storing your data on the Cloud or an encrypted file you created with your high-tech software was the idea that no one, no one else could break in, even with the use of the world's most advanced supercomputers. But with the revelation that the NSA can see inside some of the codes on the data, you were assured was uncrackable, what does it all mean now? Joining me now to talk about it are some of the people who helped build the Internet security system. If you'd like to talk about this our number is 1-800-989-8255. And you can Tweet us at scifri. Matthew Green is an assistant research professor in the department of computer science at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. He specializes in cryptography. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. MATT GREEN: Hi, it's nice to be here. FLATOW: Thank you. Phil Zimmerman is the creator of PGP. You remember that? That's the encryption system involved in many communication systems, which used to be pretty good protection. He's also president and co-founder of Silent Circle Company developing secure messaging and voice communications that's based in the National Harbor, Maryland. Welcome back, Phil, to the program. PHIL ZIMMERMAN: Thanks, Ira. I'm glad you remember. I was here in the late '90s. FLATOW: Oh, when it comes to that stuff I never forget. Martin E. Hellman is a professor emeritus of electrical engineering at Stanford. He's perhaps best known for his invention of public key cryptography in cooperation with Whitfield Diffie and Ralph Merkle in the mid 1970s. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. MARTIN HELLMAN: Thank you, Ira. FLATOW: Let me - let's do some preliminary spade work here and talk. Matt, how was the NSA able to break into the supposedly secure files that we all thought were secure? GREEN: Well, we still don't completely know the answer to that. What we know now is a lot more than we knew a month ago. What we thought a month ago was that the algorithms in the systems we had were very secure, secure enough that that was the part of the system we didn't have to worry about. Unfortunately, what we've recently learned, thanks to a series of leaks, is that the NSA has been doing a number of things. They've actually been developing new attacks but they've also been going out and weakening some of the encryption standards and products that we use to make those files secure. And that seems to be one of the basic ways that they have to get by this encryption. FLATOW: You mean, they helped create the standards and so they knew how to break them. GREEN: Yes. In fact, the NSA's role, by law, is to both secure American information systems and also to attack foreign information systems. The problem here is that it's very hard to separate those two roles. So whenever they've had an opportunity to promote standards, it appears that they may have taken some of that opportunity to actually weaken the standards that we use here in America. FLATOW: Phil Zimmerman, does that mean that there's nothing that can be encrypted now that can't be broken? ZIMMERMAN: No, it doesn't mean that. There's a lot of encryption products out there and some of them are more carefully designed than others. I feel a little self-conscious in saying this but I'd like to point out that conspicuously absent from any of the Snowden documents is any mention of any of my products or. . . (LAUGHTER) ZIMMERMAN: . . . so I'm feeling pretty good about that. FLATOW: Do you think they haven't broken them, is that what you're saying? ZIMMERMAN: I think they haven't because they still use them for classified - protecting classified data. FLATOW: So what did you do in your product that made it unbreakable? ZIMMERMAN: Well, you know, I'm kind of a fanatic about these things, and my OCD personality kind of helps. (LAUGHTER) FLATOW: But there was also some mention in the reading of - the research on this that the companies had to - were forced to cooperate with the federal government in allowing their stuff to be broken into, or giving them over the records they were looking for. ZIMMERMAN: In some cases they were forced, if there was a particular case, you know, like if there was a court order. But in other cases I think it was a matter of the NSA just trying to get companies to cooperate with them in a friendly way, or maybe some way they were incentivized. FLATOW: Martin Hellman, you and your colleagues developed the idea of a public key encryption years ago. Give us a brief sketch of how that works. HELLMAN: Yeah, well, the other thing that we were involved in was fighting the weakening of the data encryption standard back in - when it came - was promulgated in 1975. One other thing I just want to add is there are many ways to get a data that's been encrypted without actually breaking the encryption system. There have been reports that Comodo, one of the certificate authorities may have been broken into by NSA. We used to think it was Iran that had done it. And so you can work around encryption very often. I mean, if you get a key logger put on someone's machine, for example, no encryption will get around that because you can see what they're typing in before it's encrypted. Do you still want me to go back to. . . FLATOW: No, no. Keep going with this. So this - in other words you can get into someone's computer and not have to break anything. HELLMAN: Right. And another example - this actually happened with SmartCard. There was a really good secret key built into SmartCards which were in heavy us in Europe. And a colleague of mine, Paul Kocher, figured out how you could read the secret key off just by how much power the chip was using basically as the chip - it goes to the secret key and does its operations. It uses less power when there's a zero in the secret key and more power when there's a one. So as it goes through the, let's say, thousand bits of secret key, you see low power, low power, high power and you know that's 001. You don't have to actually break the system. These are tempest attacks. So, there's lots of things that can be done. FLATOW: If you go with a, if you hire a foreign company to store your data that is immune from American government, would that be a safer thing to do, so that the government can't ask to see your stuff? HELLMAN: To paraphrase that, we don't know. (LAUGHTER) HELLMAN: First, we've got to worry about the foreign government and is the foreign government secure against NSA? Is it secure against the Russian equivalent? You know, it's a real problem. I think you have to be careful whenever you put something in the Cloud. And even put things on your computer. I mean. . . ZIMMERMAN: A lot of the governments take advantage of the fact that you're giving your data to a third party. You're giving it to a service provider and then they approach the service provider and ask them for the data. That's probably going on in other countries too. FLATOW: But you say, Phil, that you still think that you can - that your encryption stuff is good enough. ZIMMERMAN: Well, I would rather not say that myself. I'd rather have others say that. FLATOW: Are you putting a target on your head now? HELLMAN: Ira, one other thing. It's important to recognize that there are tradeoffs - this is Martin Hellman again. . . FLATOW: Yes. HELLMAN: . . . that there are tradeoffs involved here. And I mentioned, when your producer called me, that I'm not as active in this area as Phil or Matt is now. My primary concern for many years has been nuclear weapons and how we're going to survive possessing these things. And so right now everybody's up in arms over NSA's snooping, and rightly they should be. On the other hand, let there be a nuclear terrorist incident or even something like September 11th again and you'll find the country saying, who the hell was standing in the way of NSA's snooping? So we need to recognize that there's a tradeoff here. And I also think we need to recognize that one of the reasons we're a target - the main reason we're a target as a nation for terrorist activity and NSA doing things like this has some beneficial interest, is because we have such a heavy military emphasis on our foreign policy. Basically, our civil liberties are collateral damage to our national security state. FLATOW: Phil, would you agree with that? ZIMMERMAN: Yeah, I think that we went a little crazy after 9/11. And if we are attacked again we might go a little crazy again. Maybe as the years have gone by we've recovered our sanity. And now - and, you know, if we get attacked again our insanity will be refreshed. FLATOW: So we're talking about national security issues here, when national security is - it's a tradeoff to our privacy. HELLMAN: Exactly. And underlying it all is the fact that we have basically in a 24/7, 365-day year national security state, which is causing this. If we want our civil liberties back we're going to have to become a lot less militaristic in our approach to things. ZIMMERMAN: You know, in World War II we abridged the civil liberties of a lot of people, especially Japanese and put them in internment camps. And after the war was over we let them go and realized that that was a heavy-handed thing to do and inappropriate. And we kind of promised never to do it again. But that's because the war was over. What's happening now is that the war never ends. And so each level - each increment of the encroachment of civil liberties becomes the new normal. GREEN: So one of the - this is Matt Green - one of the points here is that we don't know what's going to happen in the future. We don't know who's going to be reading this information that's being collected by the NSA. We don't know who's going to be using these products that the NSA has weakened. So it's very important for us to make sure that in the time we have now, we build the infrastructure for people to have privacy and prevent that information from being scooped up into databases. And that's why what's happening now is so important. HELLMAN: I would add something to that, Matt. it's also important that we have better oversights than we now have. Like, I was unaware until I read the newspaper report that Chief Justice Roberts appoints all the FISA judges. That's a potential single point failure. GREEN: Yeah. HELLMAN: Or depending on your politics, it is a single point failure. GREEN: Yeah. FLATOW: Explain that. Explain that to our listeners. HELLMAN: Oh. There is this FISA court that has to approve warrants to go into - for domestic intelligence operations. And - but all of the judges are appointed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, currently Chief Justice Roberts. And the news reports have indicated that, I think, nine of his 12 appointees have been Republican. There's the potential for appointing a non-oversight oversight. And so we really need highly knowledgeable people, people like Matt and Phil, with high clearances who are reviewing what's being done and making sure that it's right. We shouldn't just have senators and congressmen involved in it. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Let me just play devil's advocate for a moment and, you know, in the height of the Cold War - on movies, on television, in the news - you would always hear when they talked about a Communist state. They would always say, well, we're doing this because of national security. You're able to - you know, we tap your phones, we listen in, we do whatever, because of national security. Doesn't that make you think that maybe, you know, we are sort of falling into that same kind of rhetoric here? GREEN: Yeah. Unfortunately, national security is the root password of the U. S. Constitution. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And it justifies any amount of loss of privacy. GREEN: It appears. I mean, that seems to be the way things are done. I think we need to recognize that part of our national security is in the civil liberties that we have. We lose national security when we create a surveillance infrastructure that's so powerful, trained on our own domestic population that some future administration could abuse to remain in power. We have no idea who will be in the White House in 2017. Will he have the moral sensibilities of Thomas Jefferson or Vladimir Putin? What would happen if a future government turns really bad and has the ability to know everything about everyone all the time? FLATOW: Facial recognition everywhere. GREEN: Yeah. Tracking of all of our movements, all of our transactions, all of our communications, every web page we look at, every little muscle twitch we make. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR talking with Phil Zimmerman and Matt Green and Martin Hellman. Phil, your company does secure chat and secure voice but it recently stopped secure email service. Why is that? ZIMMERMAN: Well, email is different from secure telephony and secure instant messaging in that it involves persistent keys that have to be managed over a long term. And, you know, the work that I did on PGP was encryption software that runs on your laptop computer. But we didn't have a version of PGP that could run on a smartphone and it would take us a long time to write one. And we'd have to write a mail application to go with it because you can't integrate something into, say, Apple's mail application or the one on Android. So it would take a lot of engineering effort that we didn't want to wait that long. So we put it on the server instead. But that means we'd have to store the keys on the server too and that means they're an invitation to a national security letter or some kind of court order. And we felt that that was a bit too vulnerable. But, you know, even if we didn't store the keys there, there would still be the metadata that would be exposed there. Even if the message bodies are encrypted, as they would with PGP, there's still the metadata, the information that says who it's from, who it's to, the subject line, the date and time stamp, the IP address of where it came from, that sort of thing. That's all exposed. And as we've seen from our recent revelations from Snowden, the metadata is extremely important. I mean, we always knew that in the business of - in the crypto business but we're seeing how that's applied in the real world and it is indeed an extremely powerful way of learning about what everyone's doing. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Matthew, Martin, any comment? GREEN: Well, I think that we - the only comment I would have is that as cryptographers, as security people, we've known about these attacks for a long time. Things like the vulnerability of metadata and how email is difficult to secure. It's very interesting to see it from the other perspective, to see that there are people at the NSA who are thinking about exactly the same things as we are and exploiting them. ZIMMERMAN: What I find so different from our theoretical considerations of what we imagined is that this is so breathtakingly comprehensive in its scope that we just never imagined it applied on such a grand scale. FLATOW: What's that famous line? Failure of the imagination. ZIMMERMAN: Yeah. HELLMAN: Yeah. Martin Hellman here. Computers get cheaper - computation and storage gets cheaper by about a factor of 10 every five years so it's to the point now where you could store on roughly $100 hard drive every conversation you have through your whole life. And so there's a lot of potential there. But this is - while there's some of these new risks that we're facing, a lot of this is old. Just recently, the George Washington University's national security archive, which is a great place for getting at formerly classified information using the Freedom of Information Act requests got a formerly classified NSA history that notes during the height of the Vietnam War protest movements in the late '60s and early '70s, NSA tapped the overseas communications of people like Martin Luther King, Muhammad Ali, New York Times journalists, and then Washington Post humor columnist Art Buchwald and most startlingly, they say, two prominent members of Congress, Senators Frank Church and Howard Baker. So what's new, I think, is the potential scale of what they can store and what they can get at. FLATOW: All right. We're going to take a break and talk lots more with Matthew Green, Phil Zimmerman, Martin Hellman. And your calls are number 1-800-989-8255. You can also tweet us at scifri. Go to our website sciencefriday. com, join the conversation there. We'll be right back after this break. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FLATOW: This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour about encryption and security with my guests Matthew Green of Johns Hopkins University, Phil Zimmermann, creator of PGP and co-founder of Silent Circle, and Martin Hellman of Stanford. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. We're going to go to the phones. Before we go to the phones, though, Matt, I want to ask you what are some of the things that we know that the NSA has broken into? GREEN: So we have heard a number of things that we can probably credit for real. One of them is 4G phones - cell phones is mentioned. Those phones use encryption to keep people from being able to intercept and listen to your phone calls. That encryption has been weakened in some way. We don't know how. Another example, there are these things called random number generators that are used in almost every security product, including web servers. So when you go to Amazon. com and you see that little lock to protect your credit card number, there's a random number generator there. And we know that NSA through NIST, which is the National Institutes of Standards and Technology, has very likely put back doors in some of those standard algorithms that allow them to essentially break those systems entirely. FLATOW: You mean the NSA created those back doors? GREEN: That's exactly right. So NIST works with NSA and they're required to by law. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. GREEN: We thought that NSA was helping NIST build more secure standards for Americans to use. We now suspect and have strong evidence to believe that actually the situation was exactly the opposite, that NIST was being used to put out standards that the NSA could break. FLATOW: If I go to the Cloud now and I want to store stuff in one of these Cloud services that says don't worry, we're absolutely secure, is that a little bit misleading? ZIMMERMAN: In some cases it might be, but, you know, I think that regarding the random number generator, NIST has published several random number generators and one of them is just egregiously awful. And cryptographers recognized years ago that it was egregiously awful in its design and most - no competent cryptographer would knowingly use it unless he was turned to the dark side. GREEN: And yet. . . ZIMMERMAN: And yet RSA did a security - did use it as their default random number generator. And they do have competent cryptographers working there. So. FLATOW: How do you explain that? ZIMMERMAN: Well, I'm not going to - I think I'd rather not be the one to say. (LAUGHTER) FLATOW: But if someone else were to say it, what would they say? ZIMMERMAN: Well, someone else might say that maybe they were incentivized. HELLMAN: Let me - this is Martin Hellman. Let me bring up a question for the other two guys. Back in the - maybe we need a less confrontational approach to NSA. And I'll explain why historically I believe that. Back in the '70s and '80s and in the '90s when we were in confrontation with NSA over their attempts to weaken security, we didn't get good security. They used their export - their ability to control export to also control the domestic market because companies didn't want to have separate - most companies didn't want to have separate products domestically and internationally. And so while we fought a good fight, we didn't really get what we wanted. It was only after a National Research Council committee on which I served had a representative from NSA, a representative from law enforcement, as well as privacy advocates like myself and we got together and talked that we were able to get reasonably good crypto exportable. And so what if the option is if we don't have NSA's blessing everybody will be able to listen in, whereas with NSA's blessings, maybe the government will be able to listen in and maybe there will be adequate oversight if maybe we can negotiate that. GREEN: No. HELLMAN: What do you guys - is it different today? GREEN: Well, we did get the export controls lifted at the end of the '90s and now strong crypto is the norm in the industry. We're able to export strong crypto and we're able to design our own strong crypto without any help from NSA. Most of the NIST standards are good standards. They publish quite a few documents and I've read many of them and they're really excellent. It's only in rare cases - I mean, there was that random number generator and I haven't found anything else. Perhaps maybe some - there are some elliptic curves that they published that are not as strong as we now know how to design. But they still use them for secret and top secret government application. So I don't think that there's any weakness in them. ZIMMERMAN: Well, that's the really surprising part of this. And I just want to be clear. When we talk about crypto, we're not talking about hackers and criminals and members of Anonymous communicating with each other over the Internet. We're talking about you. We're talking about people visiting websites. GREEN: Yeah. ZIMMERMAN: We're talking about companies exchanging data with banks. GREEN: Sure. ZIMMERMAN: Banks exchanging data with the federal government, even sensitive data that might have national security implications. GREEN: Well, our health care records are encrypted by law. In fact, you know, I mean, the legislative environment today is so different than it was in the '90s. In the '90s if you used strong crypto you had to explain yourself. You had to make excuses. You had to defend allegations that you're a criminal and that you're up to no good and you want to hide your wrongdoing with strong crypto. Today, if you don't use strong crypto you have to explain yourself. You may be legally liable if you're not using strong crypto. If you're a doctor and you don't encrypt your patient records, then why aren't you? You know, you're not HIPAA compliant. If you leave your laptop in a taxi with 200,000 customer identities on it, you better hope that disc is encrypted because if it's not you have an obligation to come clean with the public and tell them that you've lost 200,000 customer identities. In England, it's even worse. You could even face criminal liabilities in that case. So crypto is required by law. For Sarbanes-Oxley, you know, for best practices of protecting corporate assets, you have to use crypto. And I mean there's all kinds of legal obligations to use strong crypto today. It's now mainstream. FLATOW: But if you have no, quote/unquote \"good reason\" to use strong crypto, if you don't belong to any of those groups and you're just a geeky guy or woman who wants to have strong crypto. Do you then become the target? Because what reason do you have to have this unless you're doing something bad. ZIMMERMAN: Well, everyone does online banking and every time you order something from Amazon you enter your credit card number and you've got to protect that with strong crypto. GREEN: Every time you use Facebook or Gmail you're using strong crypto whether you notice it or not. That crypto is there and it's also there to protect those companies from any kind of interception. FLATOW: Well, I had assumed that Skype was using cryptography for its voice calls until I learned that they voluntarily allowed the government to go in there. GREEN: Yeah. As I mentioned before, sometimes these companies voluntarily cooperate with the government. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. 1-800-989-8255. Let's get some callers in. Peter in Berkeley. Hi, Peter. PETER: Thank you, gentlemen, for this fascinating and very important discussion. It's kind of like being the founding fathers of a new age and I really appreciate it. So I'd like to comment about we need a less confrontational approach with NSA. I'm a patriot, like most Americans, and I don't mind being looked at, even helped in some way with some intrusion online, but I'd just like to know the source. I'd like the source to be identified. I'd like us to lean in overt versus covert intelligence and trust that honesty is, you know, the great virtue that can guide us, both the lookers and the participators. But last night, to give an example, I was working on a review under deadline for, by the way, a fabulous musical, \"1776,\" out here in San Francisco with ACP. FLATOW: It's a great musical, yeah. PETER: In a great theater. But here I was and I really wanted to get this out. And all of a sudden, in my Gmail, where I was composing, a lot of the text selectively got really tiny compared to the rest. And it looked like somebody was really there online with me, you know, manipulating, making suggestions. Well, look at this phrase again and look at that. But it was kind of discouraging, you know, also to be intruded and not know who was doing it. And I ended up not getting it out. So how can we protect our Gmail? A lot of people are Gmail users. ZIMMERMAN: I don't know how to tell you how to protect your Gmail because in the case of Gmail Google scans Gmail for key words and uses it to guide their decisions about what kind of advertising to show you. I don't use Gmail and I don't use Facebook. I, you know, I prefer to use email services that are private. Actually, I have my own mail server in my closet, so - but I don't know if I'm the norm. I would find a way to do email that's more private. GREEN: So I do think that the answer is, like we just discussed, the way that these web connections work, the Gmail, they're secured. We use cryptography to prevent people from intercepting those connections, from tampering with your account, from getting malware onto your computer. That's why we use this crypto. And we don't want it to be weakened for that reason. Yeah. FLATOW: Well, when you go into Gmail, the EULA, the End User License Agreement, tells you that they're going to be snooping around in your Gmail and you shouldn't be surprised by that. ZIMMERMAN: Yeah. A lot of these Internet companies monetize customer data and that's their business model. They're providing a free service. And in fact, their customer - you're not their customer. You're an asset that they sell to their real customers, which is advertisers. You know, I have a startup company called Silent Circle that encrypts phone calls and text messages and we don't monetize anything except by collecting money from customers that pay us actual money. And so, you know, our business model is part of our security model. We don't sell you out to anyone. We just - all we want is your money. Just give us your money and no one gets hurt. (LAUGHTER) HELLMAN: There's no free lunch. There's no free crypto. ZIMMERMAN: That's right. That's right. FLATOW: Matt, if you're looking to break into an encryption system, how do you go about doing that? GREEN: So we know that there are kind of three ways to do this. The one that you should not probably try is the hardest, which is to go after the actual mathematics of the encryption. The modern algorithms we use are mostly very strong and you could spend the rest of your life trying to break RSA or AS, which are two of the common algorithms we use on the Web. The way that you would probably do the best if you were trying to break into an encryption system is to attack the software that implements it. And I think Bruce Schneier, who is a very famous cryptographer, said it best when he looked at the Snowden documents himself. He said that the mathematics is strong but the code has been subverted. And by that he meant that the software we were using had in some way been weakened, even the crypto itself was strong. And so that seems to be the best way to go about weakening crypto. ZIMMERMAN: Sometimes this means that they will attack your computer or your mobile phone with some kind of attack that subverts the platform, the computer, instead of trying to break the crypto with cryptanalysis. Think of it as a - if you imagine if you have a steel door on your house, instead of trying to drill through six inches of solid steel, someone could just smash the window with their fist, reach inside, and turn the doorknob and open it. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. Let's go to the phones, see if we've got a phone call in. Frank in Washington D. C. Hi, Frank. FRANK: Hi. I'm calling about how the encryption system of PGP is also associated with the trapdoor codes. I think that came up already since I called. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. FRANK: That large prime numbers will make this kind of encryption more hard - harder to break. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Let me ask Phil. ZIMMERMAN: Yeah. I want to hasten to add here that, you know, trapdoors is a different thing than back doors. Trapdoor functions are. . . FLATOW: Trade craft talk here. ZIMMERMAN: Yeah. FLATOW: Tell us about that. ZIMMERMAN: I think he was just saying something nice about PGP. (LAUGHTER) FLATOW: So what's the different between a trapdoor and a back door? ZIMMERMAN: A back door is some kind of secret way that you can break in without knowing the key, or to get your hands on the key. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. ZIMMERMAN: A trapdoor is - in mathematics there are some mathematical functions that are easy to calculate in one direction but very hard to calculate in the reverse direction. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Let me see if - in the few minutes that I have left, let me ask all of you to where you see the future going with all of this. Let me start with you, Phil. ZIMMERMAN: Well, you know, when I think about - I mean, I often hear this question of where do I think the future is going. And to be the question of trying to predict the future is I never really want to try to predict the future. Instead, I try to make the future. The best way to predict the future is to make the future. What we should do is - there's something a little passive about predicting the future. What we should be doing is thinking of what we'd like to have in the future and working as hard as we can to get there. And what I'd like to have, is I'd like to change the laws. We can't do it all with technology. We have to push back in policy space. We have to change the laws. We have to realize that what we've done here is we went a little crazy after 9/11 and we've created this powerful surveillance infrastructure that's just incredibly powerful. That the NSA has created with 35,000 mathematicians and scientists applying their genius to create this thing. And it's so powerful that it is too tempting to the rest of the government. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. ZIMMERMAN: It's like that \"Lord of the Rings\" character - who was. . . GREEN: Boromir. ZIMMERMAN: Boromir, right. Who wanted to use the ring for good instead of evil. But in fact, the ring is so powerful that you can't. You just can't. FLATOW: Now, let me get - we're running out of time. Let me get another comment. Matt, what do you think? GREEN: Well, I think the public policy answers are important. We need to go to Congress; we need to get answers on this. I look at the technical answers. I think the very quick answer for me is that we need to start using open source software where it matters. We need to be able to see the code we're using and we need to know if there are back doors in it. So that's a start, anyway. ZIMMERMAN: Amen. FLATOW: And Martin? HELLMAN: Better oversight, which I emphasized before. You know, less confrontational approach, not just with NSA but a less confrontational approach as a nation.  If we keep getting into wars that we don't need to get into, then we're going to be this target and we're need this kind of snooping and we're going to have collateral damage to our civil liberties. FLATOW: All right. Gentlemen, I thank you for taking a lot of your time to be talking about this. It's just the beginning. There's lots to talk about. Phil Zimmerman, creator of PGP, also president and cofounder of Silent Circle. That's based in National Harbor, Maryland. Martin Hellman, professor emeritus of electrical engineering at Stanford. And Matthew Green, assistant research professor in the department of computer science at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Thank you all for taking time to be with us today. HELLMAN: Bye, Ira. FLATOW: You're welcome. ZIMMERMAN: So long. GREEN: Thank you. It's a pleasure to be here.", "section": "Technology", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2013 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Ben Prunty creates some of that music for a few of the popular independent video games out there, including this song, \"Mantis,\" from last year's giant hit \"Faster Than Light\" or \"FTL,\" nominated for IGN's best overall music and best PC sound of 2012. This week, Prunty is one of the featured speakers at the IndieCade Festival in L. A. , a gathering of independent game developers from around the world. And he joins me now in the studio. Ben, welcome. BEN PRUNTY: Hi. RATH: Tell us about this game, \"Faster Than Light. \" How do you play? PRUNTY: It's a spaceship simulator game. Instead of piloting the ship, you're more like the captain, kind of like in \"Star Trek. \" So you're commanding your crew. You're telling your crew to, like, oh, go fix the engines or go put out this fire in the room or. . . RATH: It's more strategy in chess game than first-person shooter, kind of. PRUNTY: Exactly. RATH: Let's hear a little bit of the battle sound, though, first. PRUNTY: Sure, yeah. (SOUNDBITE OF \"FASTER THAN LIGHT\" THEME MUSIC)RATH: All right, that's clearly a battle. Definitely something in a marshal mood. How do you make it so the music reacts to what's going on? PRUNTY: There are two tracks. I write a piece of music, but it doesn't have percussion, let's say. And then I'll write another version of the same track that has the same musical cues, the same chords, but then I add, let's say, percussion over that. While the game is going, they're technically both playing at the same time but then it cross-fades between the two. So when the battle starts, it just cross-fades to the other track. And it just sounds like it's suddenly changing. RATH: So they're all running simultaneously. PRUNTY: Yeah. RATH: Well, like an old eight-track tape player, right? PRUNTY: Yeah, a little bit. Yeah. RATH: And you're just flipping in between them when. . . PRUNTY: Yeah, except the game's doing it when you're playing, yeah. RATH: Right. You're currently working on sound for an upcoming game called \"Gravity Ghost\" with Indie game designer Erin Robinson. What was her vision for the music in this new project? PRUNTY: \"Gravity Ghost,\" Erin was like, I want it to be kind of weird and whimsical. RATH: What did you add to make it weird (unintelligible)? PRUNTY: I just sort of like, didn't leave out any instruments than I thought. Maybe it was like, oh, maybe we'll put in electric guitar, maybe we'll do like a rock drums or something or any kind of instrument I could think of. And she seemed to like all of it, so. . . (LAUGHTER)RATH: Let's take a listen to that. (SOUNDBITE OF \"GRAVITY GHOST\" THEME MUSIC)RATH: What's your setup as you're writing and deciding what kind of sounds you'll be pulling in? Like, what's your kind of bank of sounds that you're pulling from? PRUNTY: I find libraries online. There are a lot of unusual sound libraries. I found a sound library that was all just recordings of light bulbs being struck. And it's really strange, but it made for neat-sounding percussion. And it's giving the game a very unique sound that you won't hear, like, anywhere else. RATH: I want to play a little more music. There are some fan favorites out there. This one's called \"Milky Way. \"PRUNTY: Yes. RATH: Let's hear a little bit of that. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC, \"MILKY WAY\")RATH: It's one of the more retro ones, for sure. PRUNTY: It's very retro, yeah. RATH: I feel like I should be watching, like, a science program from 1981 or. . . PRUNTY: Yeah. (LAUGHTER)RATH: But it really puts you in that space. PRUNTY: Yeah, yeah. RATH: What kind of stuff do you listen to? What sort of music do you listen to for inspiration or just for pleasure? PRUNTY: I'm a huge fan of funk music, and that kind of influenced \"FTL\" a little because there's a lot of, like, strong baselines in \"FTL. \"RATH: Uh-huh. Nice.

Now she's back with another series of short films that she's written, directed and in which she stars. Like \"Green Porno,\" the new films take an unconventional look at the natural world and our accepted notions of it. The new series is called \"Mammas,\" and it deals with animal mothers and what they do for and sometimes to their children. Pat Dowell has more. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)PAT DOWELL, BYLINE: In one episode of \"Mammas,\" Isabella Rossellini appears on screen with a fish on her head. (SOUNDBITE OF WEB SERIES, \"MAMMAS\")ISABELLA ROSSELLINI: I'm a mouthbrooder. I incubate my eggs in my mouth. DOWELL: She swims through a stage set ocean and deposits her eggs, which look like little oranges, on a rock. Soon, she gets hit in the face with silly string. (SOUNDBITE OF WEB SERIES, \"MAMMAS\")ROSSELLINI: My films are comical films. They are made to laugh at. They are comical and scientifically correct. They are only these two things. DOWELL: It turns out that the actor and filmmaker is studying for a master's degree in animal behavior. She learned that women biologists are questioning the conventional wisdom that mothers are universally self-sacrificing. ROSSELLINI: And so they looked at all the animals to see if this was consistent behavior in all the species. And, of course, it isn't. And I found that research to be fascinating but also quite amusing. And that was the beginning of \"Mammas. \" And I contacted my Marlene Zuk. MARLENE ZUK: Sure she wanted somebody who would check on whether she was portraying an animal as, you know, having wings when it didn't or, you know, the wrong number of legs or something like that. DOWELL: Marlene Zuk is an author and biologist at the University of Minnesota. ZUK: But I think a lot more of it, and what I thought was so wonderful about the films, is that she wanted someone to make sure that she really got what the animals were doing, that she was really true to their essence as it is were. DOWELL: To get at the essence of hamsters, Isabella Rossellini dawns a furry suit and pulls little babies from between her legs, a litter of 10. (SOUNDBITE OF WEB SERIES, \"MAMMAS\")ROSSELLINI: How am I going to feed them all? DOWELL: She decides she can't. (SOUNDBITE OF WEB SERIES, \"MAMMAS\")ROSSELLINI: This one is so small and skinny. What will be of it? DOWELL: She eats it and another one. (SOUNDBITE OF WEB SERIES, \"MAMMAS\")ROSSELLINI: Eight is enough. DOWELL: The cheeky informality and the homemade look of the films are intentional, says Gregorio Franchetti, a young Italian filmmaker whom Rossellini describes as her strong right arm on the series. GREGORIO FRANCHETTI: Isabella always says, I like to do films that when my audience sees them they can think they can do them themselves in the kitchen. DOWELL: It's a look that characterized Rossellini's previous series for Sundance, \"Green Porno,\" which, despite the provocative title, is a similarly scientific look at the sexuality of other species and the threats they face. Her films all employ a tiny crew. She considers that essential to the way she works. ROSSELLINI: You know, I'm in a leotard all day long with a fish head. I can't have 150 people look, make comments, embarrassing me. It's very important that we work all together, like around the table, and you see everybody's face and everybody's collaborating. It really helps on shyness and embarrassment. DOWELL: It's hard to think of her as ever being shy if you've seen her in \"Blue Velvet\" or the experimental movies of Canadian filmmaker Guy Maddin, who Rossellini says encouraged her current work. For his part, Maddin says the short films are Isabella Rossellini. GUY MADDIN: She's bawdy, sometimes. At other times, she reminds you of old movie stars, of contemporary glamour, of some potty-mouthed kid. She's just so relaxed about the way the body works, the way our libidos work. And she's finally decided to make it the subject of her own work. DOWELL: Maddin notes that both he and Rossellini share a closeness to their mothers. She acknowledges her mother, film icon Ingrid Bergman, was often criticized in the 1950s for leaving her children to go make movies. ROSSELLINI: You know, this film made me think of my mom because, of course, she had a very big career at the time where women didn't have a career. And she was really criticized for it. And I thought, oh, I wish she was alive so that she would know that this idea that women are made to sacrifice and to be servant of their children or their husband or of the family, it's not something that is proven to be natural but is maybe culturally induced. And maybe she would have been relieved from any guilt. DOWELL: Isabella Rossellini's father was legendary Italian filmmaker Roberto Rossellini. Paternal instincts will be the subject of her next series. For NPR News, this is Pat Dowell. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ARUN RATH, HOST:  Film star Isabella Rossellini is also a star on the Internet. \"Green Porno,\" her series for the Sundance Channel and sundance. com, won two Webby Awards in 2009. Now she's back with another series of short films that she's written, directed and in which she stars. Like \"Green Porno,\" the new films take an unconventional look at the natural world and our accepted notions of it. The new series is called \"Mammas,\" and it deals with animal mothers and what they do for and sometimes to their children. Pat Dowell has more. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) PAT DOWELL, BYLINE: In one episode of \"Mammas,\" Isabella Rossellini appears on screen with a fish on her head. (SOUNDBITE OF WEB SERIES, \"MAMMAS\") ISABELLA ROSSELLINI: I'm a mouthbrooder. I incubate my eggs in my mouth. DOWELL: She swims through a stage set ocean and deposits her eggs, which look like little oranges, on a rock. Soon, she gets hit in the face with silly string. (SOUNDBITE OF WEB SERIES, \"MAMMAS\") ROSSELLINI: My films are comical films. They are made to laugh at. They are comical and scientifically correct. They are only these two things. DOWELL: It turns out that the actor and filmmaker is studying for a master's degree in animal behavior. She learned that women biologists are questioning the conventional wisdom that mothers are universally self-sacrificing. ROSSELLINI: And so they looked at all the animals to see if this was consistent behavior in all the species. And, of course, it isn't. And I found that research to be fascinating but also quite amusing. And that was the beginning of \"Mammas. \" And I contacted my Marlene Zuk. MARLENE ZUK: Sure she wanted somebody who would check on whether she was portraying an animal as, you know, having wings when it didn't or, you know, the wrong number of legs or something like that. DOWELL: Marlene Zuk is an author and biologist at the University of Minnesota. ZUK: But I think a lot more of it, and what I thought was so wonderful about the films, is that she wanted someone to make sure that she really got what the animals were doing, that she was really true to their essence as it is were. DOWELL: To get at the essence of hamsters, Isabella Rossellini dawns a furry suit and pulls little babies from between her legs, a litter of 10. (SOUNDBITE OF WEB SERIES, \"MAMMAS\") ROSSELLINI: How am I going to feed them all? DOWELL: She decides she can't. (SOUNDBITE OF WEB SERIES, \"MAMMAS\") ROSSELLINI: This one is so small and skinny. What will be of it? DOWELL: She eats it and another one. (SOUNDBITE OF WEB SERIES, \"MAMMAS\") ROSSELLINI: Eight is enough. DOWELL: The cheeky informality and the homemade look of the films are intentional, says Gregorio Franchetti, a young Italian filmmaker whom Rossellini describes as her strong right arm on the series. GREGORIO FRANCHETTI: Isabella always says, I like to do films that when my audience sees them they can think they can do them themselves in the kitchen. DOWELL: It's a look that characterized Rossellini's previous series for Sundance, \"Green Porno,\" which, despite the provocative title, is a similarly scientific look at the sexuality of other species and the threats they face. Her films all employ a tiny crew. She considers that essential to the way she works. ROSSELLINI: You know, I'm in a leotard all day long with a fish head. I can't have 150 people look, make comments, embarrassing me. It's very important that we work all together, like around the table, and you see everybody's face and everybody's collaborating. It really helps on shyness and embarrassment. DOWELL: It's hard to think of her as ever being shy if you've seen her in \"Blue Velvet\" or the experimental movies of Canadian filmmaker Guy Maddin, who Rossellini says encouraged her current work. For his part, Maddin says the short films are Isabella Rossellini. GUY MADDIN: She's bawdy, sometimes. At other times, she reminds you of old movie stars, of contemporary glamour, of some potty-mouthed kid. She's just so relaxed about the way the body works, the way our libidos work. And she's finally decided to make it the subject of her own work. DOWELL: Maddin notes that both he and Rossellini share a closeness to their mothers. She acknowledges her mother, film icon Ingrid Bergman, was often criticized in the 1950s for leaving her children to go make movies. ROSSELLINI: You know, this film made me think of my mom because, of course, she had a very big career at the time where women didn't have a career. And she was really criticized for it. And I thought, oh, I wish she was alive so that she would know that this idea that women are made to sacrifice and to be servant of their children or their husband or of the family, it's not something that is proven to be natural but is maybe culturally induced. And maybe she would have been relieved from any guilt. DOWELL: Isabella Rossellini's father was legendary Italian filmmaker Roberto Rossellini.

I'm Robert Siegel. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: I'm Melissa Block and it's time for All Tech Considered. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)BLOCK: Our focus today is on two services designed to keep Internet communications private and the National Security Agency's efforts to crack them. In a few minutes we'll hear about Tor, software that keeps people anonymous online. First, we're going to talk with the founder of an encrypted email service called Lavabit, a system much more secure than regular email such as Gmail or Yahoo. Lavabit was used by NSA leaker Edward Snowden. And in August, as the FBI pursued those leaks, Lavabit founder Ladar Levison shut down his company. He did so in the face of a government demand that he turn over the encryption keys and computer code that would unlock the data of his 400,000 customers. Levison said in a statement at the time that he would not become complicit in crimes against the American people. Ladar Levison joins me now from New York. Welcome to the program. LADAR LEVISON: Hi, Melissa. Thank you for having me. BLOCK: And we should explain that before this, you were subject to a gag order. But now, some federal court documents have been unsealed and you're free to talk. Is that right? LEVISON: Yes, and I think the most important piece has finally come out - just exactly what the government was asking for. And that was my private SSL encryption key. BLOCK: SSL encryption key, which would have done what? LEVISON: SSL is - the easiest way to describe it, it's the lock in your browser that secures e-commerce transactions. But it does more than that. It secures email as it traverses the Internet. It also authenticates a person's identity, so that they know they're talking to their bank or they know they're talking to my particular service. And what they wanted to do was effectively unpeel the encryption that was protecting that information, intercept and examine it. And presumably, only record the information for the one suspect. But they were also completely unwilling to provide any transparency back to me or any type of assurance that would be the only information they were collecting. BLOCK: Well, prosecutors argued before the judge that the metadata stream would be filtered, right? So only the one client that they were looking at would be targeted. They said no one has access to the other information. And the judge said, well, I think that's reasonable. Why is he wrong? LEVISON: Because they didn't know which incoming connections were going to belong to the particular user. They were going to have to decrypt everyone's incoming connections and monitor them until they came across the username and password associated with the account. And then make a decision whether or not to continue recording or drop. And if they had been willing to prove that that's what they were doing, I could've lived with them putting a device on my network and giving them the keys. But they absolutely refused. And I was completely uncomfortable with them having that level of access and losing control of my keys in that way, if they weren't going to provide transparency back to me. BLOCK: Do you recognize, though, that the government might have legitimate legal grounds for requesting encryption keys in cases or in systems like yours that are encrypted? LEVISON: Yeah, certainly. I mean, the government has a need to conduct surveillance on criminals. But it should be targeted. What I'm opposed to is the broad-based surveillance, the type of surveillance that violates the privacy rights of the many. And that's what was at stake here. Here was a system that was effectively secure and they wanted to crack it open with a sledgehammer, just so that they could conduct surveillance on one person. BLOCK: Why did you decide to shut down Lavabit without giving any notice to your clients? LEVISON: I had decided from the very beginning, as soon as I heard the request for the SSL keys, that if I was forced to surrender them and remain silent, I felt the only ethical choice would be to shut down the service. I had heard that other services like mine had threatened to shut down and were ordered via the courts to remain open, to remain in business. So I feared that if I gave any kind of warning that I might shut down the service as a result of this, I would receive a similar order. And if I had, and I'd still shut down the service, I would probably be sitting in jail right now. BLOCK: I've seen emails from a number of your customers who were quite angered by the fact that you shut down, that they were not given any notice and the rug was pulled out from under them. LEVISON: I'm in the same boat as them. I used my Lavabit email account for 10 years. It was my only email account. I'm now without email access. So I feel their pain. And I'm still holding out hope that one day I'll get my inbox back. BLOCK: Ladar Levison is founder of the now-shuttered encrypted email service Lavabit. Mr. Levison, thanks.

An anonymity tool known as Tor is also in the National Security Agency's sightlines. Tor is widely is used by dissident groups, journalists, even police as a way to surf the Internet and communicate online without revealing anyone's identity. NPR's Larry Abramson reports that while the NSA has been trying to hack into Tor, other branches of the U. S. government provide a large amount of Tor's funding. LARRY ABRAMSON, BYLINE: The name Tor stands for The Onion Router. It's a strategy developed by the U. S. Naval Research Laboratory. And the original idea was to help cloak government communications. Today, Tor is run by a non-profit organization. Tor's Karen Reilly says when you request a Web page, the onion routing system sends your information request across a maze of randomly chosen computer relays. KAREN REILLY: The end result is that no one relay has the full picture of what you're doing online. ABRAMSON: And the path your request follows keeps changing randomly. So unlike traditional Web surfing which leaves lots of footprints, with Tor there are no traces left behind. Tor relies on thousands of volunteers who donate their computer bandwidth. And the system also relies on the power of open source software. Unlike many commercial security products, which are tightly guarded, Tor's computer code is open for the world to see. So thousands of hackers out there can test the security of the system and help patch any holes. The goal, says Karen Reilly, is to provide dependable online anonymity for anyone. REILLY: You might want to use Tor because you're searching for the side effects of a medication that you're taking, and you don't want your Internet service provider to know that. ABRAMSON: Or, you might want to use Tor because you're a dissident in Iran or another country that polices online speech. That's one reason why the U. S. government provides about 60 percent of Tor's funding. Danilo Bakovic is with Freedom House, which has been supporting free speech since World War II. DANILO BAKOVIC: It is a very essential tool to bypass the Internet censorship and to protect user anonymity online. ABRAMSON: But government support for Tor has long raised questions about the program's promise of total anonymity. Those doubts have been underscored by recent revelations that the NSA has cajoled or forced companies to give the government access to encrypted messages. Tor says it has never done that. In fact, Karen Reilly says, the system is designed to provide the ultimate answer to anyone who asks the identity of a Tor user. REILLY: We don't have information. If you don't gather information, you can't be hacked into; you can't be bribed or threatened to give up this information. ABRAMSON: But that doesn't mean the government hasn't tried. Leaks from Edward Snowden to the Guardian newspaper and The Washington Post show the National Security Agency has struggled for years to crack Tor open. Those documents pay tribute to Tor's security, saying that from the perspective of government eavesdropping, quote, \"Tor stinks. \" The leaks indicate the agency was simply unable to come up with a reliable way to undermine Tor's anonymity strategy. But the documents say the NSA can exploit other mistakes that Tor users make. Christopher Soghoian works on security issues for the American Civil Liberties Union. He says these documents show that no single defense can keep out an agency with NSA's resources. CHRISTOPHER SOGHOIAN: They will try and get your data through the network. They will try and get your data by hacking into your device. They have many tools at their disposal. And, you know, whichever one works they'll use.

You've probably already heard that Latinos are more likely to use social media sites and to access the Internet from mobile devices than other groups are. But the number of Latinos involved in developing the technology is not where many people would like it to be. Hispanics only make up about 4 percent of the people working in the computer industry, according to the U. S. Census Bureau. Oscar G. Torres is trying to change that. He organizes hackathons at which Latinos are able to display innovative ideas and work collaboratively. He hopes this will open doors for even more Hispanics to pursue careers in tech. And Oscar G. Torres is with us now. He's the cofounder of Miner Labs Inc. That's a platform that creates a virtual storefront on mobile devices. Welcome, thanks so much for joining us. OSCAR G. TORRES: Oh, happy to be here. MARTIN: Well, first, can you clear something up for us? You know, a lot of people hear the word hacker and they think that that's somebody who breaks into computer systems and steals information - a criminal essentially, but you're saying that's not the case. Could you explain what is a hacker? TORRES: Yeah, absolutely. That word sort of got a bad term from the news and the media. The reality - a hacker is somebody who analyzes systems and then figures out how they work and repurposes them for a different purpose. So, like, let's say you find a computer program that you like, you might study how it works and then repurpose that program to do something else. And that has become more possible with things like open source technology, which is, you know, just programs, algorithms that you can recycle into - to do different things. MARTIN: How did you get interested in this field? You're also an artist, too, I want to mention, in addition to a hacker. You've been exhibited around the world actually. So how did you get interested in tech and working in this field? TORRES: Yeah, making the leap from fine arts, it really happened in grad school at NYU. There I got the chance to start working with open source frameworks and open source code, and then that's when I realized there was this whole brand-new exciting world of coding and development. Sooner than later, I started joining hackathons. And actually, hackathons were the bridge for me as an artist and technologist to entrepreneurship. So it was - I feel like that was a very interesting part. And now that I've experienced that, I want to sort of share that experience and hope that others can do the same. MARTIN: You organized a hackathon at the LATISM Conference. LATISM stands for Latinos in tech innovation and social media. You organized something called El Hackathon at this one this year. Tell us about it. What actually happens there? TORRES: Yeah, it's really interesting because when I joined LATISM in 2011, the innovation part of LATISM I felt was sort of lacking. So I had a few conversations with Ana Roca and a few of the organizers and voicing my opinion about the lack of innovation, or just people in the group that sort of innovated. There's a lot of consumption happening in the Latino community. But once I got involved in the entrepreneurship world, I realized that, hey, where are all the Latinos? And there are a lot of Latinos in entrepreneurship but there's very few in the tech industry, which I hope to change hopefully through these hackathons. So what happens at hackathons is that, normally, you come up with a theme - in this case we had education, health and business as the theme - so basically, you organize, put out a call to action, an invitation for hackers of all sorts who come in and then participate in these hackathons, which usually lasts around 24 hours, 38 hours, I mean, you know, there's different time periods. And then in that short time span, hackers take an idea and then make a prototype or a potential product that then they present to a group of judges. Then, you know, the judges pick the best project that they liked and then they awarded the prize. MARTIN: How does this get more people motivated to join the field or to get into the field? I mean, assuming you have to have a basic skill set to be there to begin with, right? TORRES: Yeah. MARTIN: How does this enhance people's involvement in this field and bring more people into the field? TORRES: Yeah, I think, first of all, it brings awareness to people that don't normally know how innovation happens, how new technology comes to be. So basically, hackers are not just only computer programmers, they can also be designers or entrepreneurs. For example, there's a big, you know, thing happening right now where this visual - I call him visual hacker, Banksy's just taking the art world by storm and doing graffiti. Likewise, entrepreneurs can come into hackathons, visual designers and then work - collaborated with computer programmers and sort of create this new prototype. And the part of the hackathon is the demo time. So sometimes hackers get anywhere between one and five minutes to present their idea. And I think really exposing a group like LATISM, where all of these conference-goers - you know, hundreds and hundreds of people - were witnesses to what happened in these 24 hours. And then to see an idea working in front of them and, you know, something that might seem, like, took months to build and it was just built overnight, it really encourages people to sort of be curious and start poking around and seeing how these things work and how technology works. And sort of bringing awareness that, hey, maybe technology is not as hard as it seems to be. And people can actually create new ideas in a short period of time. And that's what I'm trying to encourage - for people to get involved, for somebody who doesn't know what innovation is to sort of just come in and take a look. And if you're a businessperson, a designer, just get involved and start learning how this new innovative - this innovation process works, and then hopefully get involved. MARTIN: You've won several hackathons yourself, including a major one at TechCrunch in 2012. Can you tell us about the idea your team came up with? TORRES: Yeah. So I had many ideas. What happens at hackathons is you just meet people and start throwing ideas at them, and then if they like an idea - you know, it's like a back-and-forth and then eventually, before you know it, you create something new. What I created for TechCrunch was this hack called Thingscription. So basically, a website where you can subscribe to anything like razor blades, and T-shirts, you know, underwear, whatever it is - soap. And then once you subscribe, you would get the products every, you know, every week or every two weeks. So that was the general idea. Then the other ones were photo projects. And then my current startup, Miner Labs Inc. - Minerapp. com - came from Startup Weekend, which is a hackathon where the main attraction is to business developers, entrepreneurs, to come in and collaborate with hackers, and then come up with this new idea and make a business out of it. MARTIN: Well, that sounds exciting. Keep us posted on what you're doing, what's exciting. I'm trying to think of what I want to subscribe to. But Dunkin' Donuts is already down the street, so maybe I don't need it for that. TORRES: Yeah. Definitely. And check out Minerapp. com. We're going to be mobile storefronts, you know, that's going to be the future. Mobile consumption's increasing, so it's going to be the easy way for businesses to sell and market anywhere through mobile devices. And then for consumers to find, you know, pop-up storefronts at malls or destination airports and see what vendors are selling around those locations. MARTIN: Well, I would also like to hear more about some of the things - when we next get together about some of the education ideas that you came up with at El Hackathon at the LATISM Conference. I mean, education was the theme, so I'd love to hear more about what you come up with there. Oscar G. Torres is cofounder of Miner Labs Inc. He joined us from our bureau in New York. Oscar, thanks so much for joining us. TORRES: Absolutely, thank you. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  So we've been talking about science and getting people excited about science. You've probably already heard that Latinos are more likely to use social media sites and to access the Internet from mobile devices than other groups are. But the number of Latinos involved in developing the technology is not where many people would like it to be. Hispanics only make up about 4 percent of the people working in the computer industry, according to the U. S. Census Bureau. Oscar G. Torres is trying to change that. He organizes hackathons at which Latinos are able to display innovative ideas and work collaboratively. He hopes this will open doors for even more Hispanics to pursue careers in tech. And Oscar G. Torres is with us now. He's the cofounder of Miner Labs Inc. That's a platform that creates a virtual storefront on mobile devices. Welcome, thanks so much for joining us. OSCAR G. TORRES: Oh, happy to be here. MARTIN: Well, first, can you clear something up for us? You know, a lot of people hear the word hacker and they think that that's somebody who breaks into computer systems and steals information - a criminal essentially, but you're saying that's not the case. Could you explain what is a hacker? TORRES: Yeah, absolutely. That word sort of got a bad term from the news and the media. The reality - a hacker is somebody who analyzes systems and then figures out how they work and repurposes them for a different purpose. So, like, let's say you find a computer program that you like, you might study how it works and then repurpose that program to do something else. And that has become more possible with things like open source technology, which is, you know, just programs, algorithms that you can recycle into - to do different things. MARTIN: How did you get interested in this field? You're also an artist, too, I want to mention, in addition to a hacker. You've been exhibited around the world actually. So how did you get interested in tech and working in this field? TORRES: Yeah, making the leap from fine arts, it really happened in grad school at NYU. There I got the chance to start working with open source frameworks and open source code, and then that's when I realized there was this whole brand-new exciting world of coding and development. Sooner than later, I started joining hackathons. And actually, hackathons were the bridge for me as an artist and technologist to entrepreneurship. So it was - I feel like that was a very interesting part. And now that I've experienced that, I want to sort of share that experience and hope that others can do the same. MARTIN: You organized a hackathon at the LATISM Conference. LATISM stands for Latinos in tech innovation and social media. You organized something called El Hackathon at this one this year. Tell us about it. What actually happens there? TORRES: Yeah, it's really interesting because when I joined LATISM in 2011, the innovation part of LATISM I felt was sort of lacking. So I had a few conversations with Ana Roca and a few of the organizers and voicing my opinion about the lack of innovation, or just people in the group that sort of innovated. There's a lot of consumption happening in the Latino community. But once I got involved in the entrepreneurship world, I realized that, hey, where are all the Latinos? And there are a lot of Latinos in entrepreneurship but there's very few in the tech industry, which I hope to change hopefully through these hackathons. So what happens at hackathons is that, normally, you come up with a theme - in this case we had education, health and business as the theme - so basically, you organize, put out a call to action, an invitation for hackers of all sorts who come in and then participate in these hackathons, which usually lasts around 24 hours, 38 hours, I mean, you know, there's different time periods. And then in that short time span, hackers take an idea and then make a prototype or a potential product that then they present to a group of judges. Then, you know, the judges pick the best project that they liked and then they awarded the prize. MARTIN: How does this get more people motivated to join the field or to get into the field? I mean, assuming you have to have a basic skill set to be there to begin with, right? TORRES: Yeah. MARTIN: How does this enhance people's involvement in this field and bring more people into the field? TORRES: Yeah, I think, first of all, it brings awareness to people that don't normally know how innovation happens, how new technology comes to be. So basically, hackers are not just only computer programmers, they can also be designers or entrepreneurs. For example, there's a big, you know, thing happening right now where this visual - I call him visual hacker, Banksy's just taking the art world by storm and doing graffiti. Likewise, entrepreneurs can come into hackathons, visual designers and then work - collaborated with computer programmers and sort of create this new prototype. And the part of the hackathon is the demo time. So sometimes hackers get anywhere between one and five minutes to present their idea. And I think really exposing a group like LATISM, where all of these conference-goers - you know, hundreds and hundreds of people - were witnesses to what happened in these 24 hours. And then to see an idea working in front of them and, you know, something that might seem, like, took months to build and it was just built overnight, it really encourages people to sort of be curious and start poking around and seeing how these things work and how technology works. And sort of bringing awareness that, hey, maybe technology is not as hard as it seems to be. And people can actually create new ideas in a short period of time. And that's what I'm trying to encourage - for people to get involved, for somebody who doesn't know what innovation is to sort of just come in and take a look. And if you're a businessperson, a designer, just get involved and start learning how this new innovative - this innovation process works, and then hopefully get involved. MARTIN: You've won several hackathons yourself, including a major one at TechCrunch in 2012. Can you tell us about the idea your team came up with? TORRES: Yeah. So I had many ideas. What happens at hackathons is you just meet people and start throwing ideas at them, and then if they like an idea - you know, it's like a back-and-forth and then eventually, before you know it, you create something new. What I created for TechCrunch was this hack called Thingscription. So basically, a website where you can subscribe to anything like razor blades, and T-shirts, you know, underwear, whatever it is - soap. And then once you subscribe, you would get the products every, you know, every week or every two weeks. So that was the general idea. Then the other ones were photo projects. And then my current startup, Miner Labs Inc. - Minerapp. com - came from Startup Weekend, which is a hackathon where the main attraction is to business developers, entrepreneurs, to come in and collaborate with hackers, and then come up with this new idea and make a business out of it. MARTIN: Well, that sounds exciting. Keep us posted on what you're doing, what's exciting. I'm trying to think of what I want to subscribe to. But Dunkin' Donuts is already down the street, so maybe I don't need it for that. TORRES: Yeah. Definitely. And check out Minerapp. com. We're going to be mobile storefronts, you know, that's going to be the future. Mobile consumption's increasing, so it's going to be the easy way for businesses to sell and market anywhere through mobile devices.

I'm Melissa Block. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  And I'm Robert Siegel. One of the side effects of the government shutdown is the closure of many federal websites. The big ones, like the IRS and the White House, are still up and running. But there are others that have shut down, such as those of NASA or the Library of Congress. NPR's Sonari Glinton reports that while shutting the sites is likely to save money in the short run, it could create hassles down the road. SONARI GLINTON, BYLINE: What could be more fun than surfing government websites? Well, just about everything. But some government websites are more fun than others. Lance Ulanoff is with mashable. com. He says one of the best website's on the Net, government or otherwise, is NASA's. LANCE ULANOFF: That's a really rich site complete with live video, right? There' s a live video feed. So that takes a lot of people to run. GLINTON: Ulanoff says not for nothing, but when you're giving viewers that kind of rich content, it costs big money. ULANOFF: So if you're not doing of that, if you don't have people maintaining the site, writing short posts, taking pictures and posting them, updating video, doing live video, then you're probably saving a large chunk of money. GLINTON: NASA's not the only one. When you go to some of the other sites, they're not necessarily completely down. The pages still exist, but you get a message like this: Due to the lapse in federal government funding, this website is not available. We sincerely regret this inconvenience. CHESTER WIZNESKI: They took effort to put up a message saying you can't have the service, and it's probably taken more effort to do that than it would to continue to provide the service because humans are largely not involved. GLINTON: Chester Wizneski is a security adviser with Sophos. It's a company that makes computer security hardware and software like antivirus or encryption. He says pulling the sites offline may be saving money, but that took a lot of effort, and it could be inviting a security risk. WIZNESKI: I would argue they're more hackable now that they've shut them down than they were when they were operating because, once again, we've taken an emergency measure in order to do something out of the ordinary, and I highly doubt that these outage notifications and pages have been properly tested. STEVE SANTORELLI: I think the jury is pretty much still out on whether the correct course of action is to disable these websites, temporarily take them offline or leave them online. GLINTON: Steve Santorelli, formerly of Scotland Yard, now works with the Team Cymru, an Internet security firm. He says the sites that are down may not be as high profile or critical to running government or its security. SANTORELLI: But they're going to have less scrutiny over their logs. There's technical people actually reviewing things on the daily basis to make sure that nothing suspicious is actually caught. GLINTON: He points that the last time there was a government shutdown, the Web was in its infancy so there is no precedent for this Web-wise. SANTORELLI: The reality is there's a lot of things that will be going on that could be security events, but they aren't necessarily what we call security incidents. They are anomalous behavior that needs to be reviewed to make sure that it isn't, in fact, an attempt by a criminal hacker to breach the system. GLINTON: Santorelli says these websites just sitting there on the Net are targets. And the longer they're down, the more tempting they become. Sonari Glinton, NPR News.

It's about smartphone apps that help people track their sexual activity. We're not talking about hookup apps for sex around the corner. Rather, these apps help you get pregnant, and they're becoming very popular. From member station KQED in San Francisco, Aarti Shahani reports. AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: At Natural Resources, a baby store in San Francisco's Mission District, one mom is changing a diaper, and Lorain Acosta is taking her first prenatal class. The 30-year-old is pregnant. LORAIN ACOSTA: Fifteen weeks. SHAHANI: While Acosta wants to give birth the old-fashioned way, she got pregnant with the help of a very modern tool. ACOSTA: I tracked my fertility using OvuView. I'm an Android user, so I like this app for Android. SHAHANI: OvuView has more than 18,000 reviews in the app store, and gets mostly five out of five stars. When a woman is ovulating, her body temperature at rest goes up a degree or so. The app asks you to log that temperature before getting out of bed every morning. ACOSTA: It's synched with my alarm, so every day when my alarm went on, the app showed (unintelligible). SHAHANI: Acosta and her husband, Andre Sornellis, say the app made them feel more in control. The very month they wanted to conceive. . . ACOSTA: It helped us, and we got pregnant. ANDRES ORNELAS: Right away. SHAHANI: It told you when to have sex? ACOSTA: It just told me when I was more fertile. SHAHANI: Dozens of fertility self-tracking apps have popped up on the market in the last few years. I pull out my smartphone to show the couple one recently released, called Glow. Acosta reads off the screen as her husband listens. ACOSTA: Did you have sex, emotional discomfort, sad, angry, stress? Is it for fertility or for, like, sexual preferences or - I don't know. ORNELAS: Yeah, I'm kind of curious what it does with the answers that you give it. Those seem like questions that I've never seen related to fertility. SHAHANI: The founder of Glow, Max Levchin, is a computer scientist, the same one who helped start Paypal. Levchin says Glow is running a science experiment. MAX LEVCHIN: Part of our responsibility here is to actually gather enough data to run a study and say, you know what? People conceive faster if they tried it on their back or not. SHAHANI: Glow stores all its data on the cloud. Arguably, sexual position is more sensitive data than a credit card number, and this app does not strip people's names from their responses. Levchin says that's a service. If a Glow app user needs to visit a fertility doctor. . . LEVCHIN: You actually want to show up with a log that that person can understand. They can look at it and say, oh, you've been tracking your data. Let me tell you what your options are. DR. MARCELLE CEDARS: My goal, when couples are early in the process, is try to make things as simple and low stress as possible. SHAHANI: Dr. Marcelle Cedars is a fertility specialist at the University of California, San Francisco. CEDARS: And the more - sort of boxes you put around their sexuality, to me, tends to increase stress. SHAHANI: Cedars says the women who choose to use fertility apps like Glow may not represent women in general, and they may not tell the truth about their sexual activity. Cedars also says fertility apps have to be crystal clear about whom they cannot help. These apps assume a woman is ovulating regularly. CEDARS: But if you're having periods every two to three months, you may not be ovulating at all. And so it seems like there need to be some windows saying, you know, maybe you should talk to your doctor. SHAHANI: The Glow app is free. Founder Max Levchin says he's focused on getting new users. And Glow has a companion edition for the partner of the woman trying to conceive. Using data about her mood and ovulation, Glow makes suggestions like. . . LEVCHIN: This might be an excellent time to send a bouquet of flowers or a spa trip, or something like that. SHAHANI: Is this integrated with Flowers. com or Hotels. com? LEVCHIN: Not yet, but since I am on Yelp's board, I know exactly where to look for the best florists and spas, and we actually talked about it early on when we were designing this thing. ORNELAS: That is kind of creepy. SHAHANI: That's the gut reaction of Andres Ornelas, the father-to-be from the baby store. Ornelas is a fan of self-tracking, but doesn't want an app that intrudes on his marriage. ORNELAS: If an app told me, oh, now it's that time of the month to buy flowers for your wife, then I feel like I'm not giving them the flowers. I feel the app is doing it for me. SHAHANI: But the guy who always forgets to buy flowers, he might like that feature. Fertility apps are just in their infancy. The startup Glow hasn't even reached its first trimester.

I'm Arun Rath. It's time now for the New and the Next. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RATH: Carlos Watson is the co-founder of the online magazine Ozy. Each week, he joins us to talk about what's new and what's next. Welcome back, Carlos. CARLOS WATSON: Hey, Arun. Always good to be with you. RATH: So this week, you have a piece about a rising star in Uruguay, a man with a YouTube channel that - it's kind of reshaping the definition of what we consider news. WATSON: Augustin Ferrando kind of got depressed with a lot of the news he saw, and thought that little moments in life were just as interesting. So he's created an incredibly popular YouTube channel north of a million hits, in a country that only has 3 million people. It's become quite the sensation down south. And who knows, it could spread north. (SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO)AUGUSTIN FERRANDO: (Foreign language spoken)RATH: Tell us about the videos. They're about seven or eight minutes long. What kind of stuff is he featuring? WATSON: I mean, literally everything. These videos may be about a soccer game that some kid had. It may be about some interesting drink that a grandmother had that night. It might have been what was not on television. He's saying: If I tell the little, individual stories of what you had for dinner, what happened at this schoolhouse, even though that may not seem like classic big news, that that's really the stuff of real life. And it's gone from YouTube to their mainstream television channels there. They actually play clips of it every week. RATH: (Laughter) That's great. There's another Web-related story. This is about that service Vine. When it first hit the scene, I was wondering, how are six-second videos going to convey anything? But you pointed us to Will Sasso, who's made sort of an art out of this. (SOUNDBITE OF VINE VIDEO)WILL SASSO: Yeah, look, it's a Honda Accord. More like Honda according to Ah-nuld. You should get out of the way! WATSON: Yeah. So Will Sasso, who's been a comedian who's bounced around for years, has finally found his platform in Vine. What Will Sasso figured out is, you know, he can try and tell you stories - or he could do really funny impersonations. (SOUNDBITE OF VINE VIDEO)SASSO: Come on. Go! WATSON: The governator, Arnold Schwarzenegger. (SOUNDBITE OF VINE VIDEO)SASSO: (Singing) Sweet Caroline. . . WATSON: So he's done these great little episodes where he pretends to be Arnold driving. (SOUNDBITE OF VINE VIDEO)SASSO: I guess all I have to do to get to my destination is turn right here. GPS VOICE: Turn right on . . . SASSO: I know! That's what I just said! WATSON: It's funny. (LAUGHTER)RATH: And finally, a rising star you look at this week. Elise Andrew runs a popular science blog. It has a name we can't really say on the radio, but she loves science - that much of it we can say. WATSON: We can definitely say that. Twenty-four-year-old woman who is originally from Britain, was living in Canada at university; bored out of her mind - by her own telling - one day, and just suddenly posted a few science articles that she liked. And as you said, she put a very colorful headline: I blank love science. And before she knew it, she had 1,000 likes; and fast-forward 18 months later or so, and she's got 7 million followers on her Facebook page, all of whom are consuming various science articles, science videos - what have you - curated from around the net. It's quite a tribute to the triumph of nerd-dom. RATH: It's a cool story. And there's one disturbing part of it, though. She has this wonderful enthusiasm that she brings to the topic, but when it comes out that she is a woman. . . WATSON: So people didn't know that a 24-year-old, young woman was the person behind this incredibly popular site. And when she reveals herself, she got a bunch of negative comments. But rather than shrink from it, she leaned into it, in the best sense, and started posting essentially kind of the worst quote of the day. I think she calls it \"the crazy of the day. \" So I love that she turned that around, and that her popularity has only grown. And coming soon, you'll be able to enjoy her on Discovery. Discovery's got an online channel where they're going to be featuring Elise Andrew. So rather than shrink, she's growing. RATH: It's great. Carlos Watson is the co-founder of the online magazine Ozy. You can find links to the pieces we've talked about at our website. Carlos, thanks again. WATSON: Always my pleasure, Arun. I'll look forward to seeing you again next week. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ARUN RATH, HOST:  From NPR West, it's ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Arun Rath. It's time now for the New and the Next. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RATH: Carlos Watson is the co-founder of the online magazine Ozy. Each week, he joins us to talk about what's new and what's next. Welcome back, Carlos. CARLOS WATSON: Hey, Arun. Always good to be with you. RATH: So this week, you have a piece about a rising star in Uruguay, a man with a YouTube channel that - it's kind of reshaping the definition of what we consider news. WATSON: Augustin Ferrando kind of got depressed with a lot of the news he saw, and thought that little moments in life were just as interesting. So he's created an incredibly popular YouTube channel north of a million hits, in a country that only has 3 million people. It's become quite the sensation down south. And who knows, it could spread north. (SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO) AUGUSTIN FERRANDO: (Foreign language spoken) RATH: Tell us about the videos. They're about seven or eight minutes long. What kind of stuff is he featuring? WATSON: I mean, literally everything. These videos may be about a soccer game that some kid had. It may be about some interesting drink that a grandmother had that night. It might have been what was not on television. He's saying: If I tell the little, individual stories of what you had for dinner, what happened at this schoolhouse, even though that may not seem like classic big news, that that's really the stuff of real life. And it's gone from YouTube to their mainstream television channels there. They actually play clips of it every week. RATH: (Laughter) That's great. There's another Web-related story. This is about that service Vine. When it first hit the scene, I was wondering, how are six-second videos going to convey anything? But you pointed us to Will Sasso, who's made sort of an art out of this. (SOUNDBITE OF VINE VIDEO) WILL SASSO: Yeah, look, it's a Honda Accord. More like Honda according to Ah-nuld. You should get out of the way! WATSON: Yeah. So Will Sasso, who's been a comedian who's bounced around for years, has finally found his platform in Vine. What Will Sasso figured out is, you know, he can try and tell you stories - or he could do really funny impersonations. (SOUNDBITE OF VINE VIDEO) SASSO: Come on. Go! WATSON: The governator, Arnold Schwarzenegger. (SOUNDBITE OF VINE VIDEO) SASSO: (Singing) Sweet Caroline. . . WATSON: So he's done these great little episodes where he pretends to be Arnold driving. (SOUNDBITE OF VINE VIDEO) SASSO: I guess all I have to do to get to my destination is turn right here. GPS VOICE: Turn right on . . . SASSO: I know! That's what I just said! WATSON: It's funny. (LAUGHTER) RATH: And finally, a rising star you look at this week. Elise Andrew runs a popular science blog. It has a name we can't really say on the radio, but she loves science - that much of it we can say. WATSON: We can definitely say that. Twenty-four-year-old woman who is originally from Britain, was living in Canada at university; bored out of her mind - by her own telling - one day, and just suddenly posted a few science articles that she liked. And as you said, she put a very colorful headline: I blank love science. And before she knew it, she had 1,000 likes; and fast-forward 18 months later or so, and she's got 7 million followers on her Facebook page, all of whom are consuming various science articles, science videos - what have you - curated from around the net. It's quite a tribute to the triumph of nerd-dom. RATH: It's a cool story. And there's one disturbing part of it, though. She has this wonderful enthusiasm that she brings to the topic, but when it comes out that she is a woman. . . WATSON: So people didn't know that a 24-year-old, young woman was the person behind this incredibly popular site. And when she reveals herself, she got a bunch of negative comments. But rather than shrink from it, she leaned into it, in the best sense, and started posting essentially kind of the worst quote of the day. I think she calls it \"the crazy of the day. \" So I love that she turned that around, and that her popularity has only grown. And coming soon, you'll be able to enjoy her on Discovery. Discovery's got an online channel where they're going to be featuring Elise Andrew. So rather than shrink, she's growing. RATH: It's great. Carlos Watson is the co-founder of the online magazine Ozy.

But this year has brought an added layer of worry. The Common Application, used by hundreds of colleges and universities across the U. S. , has been overwhelmed by serious technical problems. As NPR's Eric Westervelt reports, kids and their parents are on edge and several schools are already extending early deadlines. ERIC WESTERVELT, BYLINE: The Common Application has long made the application process easier for students and schools. With one common form, students can apply to dozens of schools at once. But the number of schools using the form has grown a lot over the last decade. It's now accepted by more than 500 colleges and universities. The nonprofit company that runs the form, also called Common Application, had touted a major upgrade of software and applications as a way to streamline the process even more. Instead, the digital makeover has been a big bust and a big mess for many students and officials in higher education. Lisa Meyer is dean for enrollment at Lewis and Clark College in Portland, Ore. LISA MEYER: There have been issues with being able to import the application itself, with receiving the supplemental materials like the transcripts or letters of recommendations, those kinds of things. WESTERVELT: Those are big things, Lisa. MEYER: Those are very big things. It's very hard to read an application when you don't have a transcript to look at, hard to make a decision. So I think the colleges have been scrambling a bit. WESTERVELT: Other serious technical problems with the Common Application include payments that take days to register. Other students complain they simply couldn't log in, while others were repeatedly logged off for inactivity after waiting hours and hours to submit their applications. Then there's the personal essay, a key part of the admissions process. A formatting glitch left many students' essays looking like a giant stream of consciousness blur with no spaces, paragraphs or indentations. FREYA JAMES: No one likes applying to college anyway, and this is supposed to help and it's made it worse. WESTERVELT: Seventeen-year-old Freya James is a high school senior in Atlanta applying to five schools, all early admissions. She says the Common App has been a nightmare. JAMES: It's been stressful, to be honest 'cause I have spent a good number of hours just sitting there refreshing the page, doing nothing terribly productive except for trying to get this thing to work. And to be honest, it's not useful, it's not doing what it's meant to do. WESTERVELT: Many other high schoolers ranted against the Common App on Twitter. Some of the kinder comments: \"I'm freaking out, the common app isn't working. \" Another said, \"The common app is kind of the worst thing ever. \" A third posted, \"The common app is broken so we're all just not going to go to college, OK? \"Irena Smith, a college admissions consultant based in the San Francisco Bay area, says the problems are adding more stress for her student clients. IRENA SMITH: It's starting to look like application Armageddon. WESTERVELT: A growing list of colleges and universities is now rolling back early admissions deadlines. Schools are trying to reassure students that they won't be penalized for technical failures of the Common Application.

I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, the haves and the have-nots. Chrystia, who is the richest person in history? CHRYSTIA FREELAND: If you compared the wealth of individuals over time. . . RAZ: . . . Then you might think it's. . . FREELAND: . . . The Roman patricians. RAZ: Or. . . FREELAND: . . . The Renaissance princes. RAZ: Or. . . FREELAND: . . . The American robber barons. RAZ: But you and I would be wrong because the actual richest man - the winner is. . . FREELAND: . . . Carlos Slim, the Mexican billionaire. RAZ: So Carlos Slim is the richest person ever, who ever lived. FREELAND: Yeah, who ever lived. RAZ: Wow. So this is Chrystia Freeland. She wrote a book called \"Plutocrats,\" and it is about the super-rich. And she says the fact that the richest man in history is alive right now, it says a lot about what's happening when it comes to the huge gap between the haves and the have-nots. FREELAND: And that says that we really are living in a time of a disparity of fortune, which is greater than ever before. RAZ: It's amazing because you think about the richest people, right, and you think about huge disparities and, I mean, I don't know, I think of, like, Andrew Carnegie or JD Rockefeller or J. P. Morgan. You know, these guys that lived at a time when there was no law, there was no regulation and you had massive disparities in wealth. But you're saying it's worse now. FREELAND: It's certainly greater now. RAZ: And just how big is that gap between the super-rich and the rest of us? Well, you might have to sit down for this one and brace yourself for some staggering numbers. Here's Chrystia on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)FREELAND: In the 1970's, the 1 percent accounted for about 10 percent of the national income in the United States. Today, their share has more than doubled to above 20 percent. But what's even more striking is what's happening at the very tippy top of the income distribution. The 0. 1 percent in the U. S. today account for more than 8 percent of the national income. They are where the 1 percent was 30 years ago. Now as it happens, Warren Buffet likes to point out that in 1992, the combined wealth of the people on the Forbes 400 list, the 400 richest Americans was $300 billion. Just think about it. You didn't even need to be a billionaire to get on that list in 1992. Well, today, that figure has more than quintupled to 1. 7 trillion. And I probably don't need to tell you that we haven't seen anything similar happen to the middle class, whose wealth has stagnated, if not actually decreased. I think one reason that we don't notice is because the overall culture is, in many ways, one of symbolic equality in ways that didn't exist in the past. You know, in past times, what you wore was determined by how rich you were. Today, billionaires wear jeans. Today, people like Bill Gates brag about how much they like eating Big Macs. So I think that tends to paper over a little bit how big the gap is. I think the other thing is that today's explosion of super-wealth is partly a function of globalization, right. It's meaningful that the richest person who ever lived is a Mexican. The fact that all of these countries, all of these people - hundreds of millions, billions of people who were left out of the industrial revolution are now coming online. And that is another force, which is creating these super-fortunes. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)FREELAND: For the first time in history, if you are an energetic entrepreneur with a brilliant new idea, you have almost frictionless access to a global market of more than a billion people. As a result, if you are very, very smart and very, very lucky you can get very rich very quickly. The latest poster boy for this phenomenon is David Karp. The 26-year-old founder of Tumblr recently sold his company to Yahoo for 1. 1 billion dollars. Think about that for a minute - 1. 1 billion dollars, 26 years old. Those same, largely positive, forces, which are driving the rise of the global plutocracy also happen to be hollowing out the middle class. And in contrast with the Industrial Revolution, the titans of our new economy aren't creating that many new jobs. At its zenith, GM employed hundreds of thousands, Facebook, fewer than 10,000. The terrifying reality is that our countries are getting richer, our companies are getting more efficient, but we're not creating more jobs and we're not paying people, as a whole, more. What worries me more is a different nightmare scenario, is a universe in which a few geniuses invent Google and its ilk and the rest of us are employed giving them massages. RAZ: I mean, it sounds like what you're saying almost is that the way we've implemented capitalism has almost failed most people in the world. FREELAND: It's not a verdict on the whole history of capitalism, but it is true that it is not delivering for the vast majority of the population, and we have to do something about it. And there is a sort of a group of people at the summit of global business who, as they put it, worry that their social mandate to operate will be taken away if these forces of rising income inequality in a squeezed middle-class are allowed to go too much further. And I think that's a smart thing to worry about because if our economic systems continue to deliver for the very top but not to deliver for everybody else, people are going to say, you know what, this is not an economic system that I agree with. And I worry that we won't come up with a smart, moderate set of responses in time, but I really think it's going to be, you know, about hard work on many individual fronts. Every time we're looking at a social problem, every time a company is looking at a decision, pause and say, OK, what will the impact be on the squeezed middle-class? And if enough of us start working that way and thinking that way, then I think, collectively, we'll start coming up with a set of answers that work. RAZ: Chrystia Freeland.

JOEY M'POKO: I, like, could totally zone-out all the pain or whatever and just go into this total world of fantasy. And it was awesome, I didn't have to care about anything else. MARTIN: These are the kinds of things you often hear from addicts in recovery. But these guys aren't in rehab for drugs or alcohol. They're at a facility outside Seattle Washington, to try to kick their addiction to technology. RACHELL MONTAG: This is backyard area. We have chickens, which we can go over there. . . MARTIN: The program is called reSTART and it was set up in 2009 in a renovated cottage surrounded by pine trees. MONTAG: The clients are actually responsible for taking care of them, cleaning the cage, so it's kind of practicing responsibility for another. . . MARTIN: The program manager Rachell Montag is showing us around the property. She tells us there are beds for seven patients at a time. Besides the garden, there's a big treehouse with a zip-line and a huge grassy backyard where a few guys kick a soccer ball around between therapy appointments. (SOUNDBITE OF SOCCER BALL BEING KICKED)MARTIN: The center treats all sorts of technology addictions, but most of the young men who come through here - and they are all young men - have the biggest problem with video games. After the patients spend six intensive weeks of rehab, they go to a transitional situation, an apartment close by where they live with other former reSTART patients. That used to be called Level 2, but Montag says that was too similar to video game language so they changed it. MONTAG: In gaming, the goal is always to be moving forward and leveling up. And so, we didn't want our language to parallel that because it can actually have an affect on their behavior and their recovery process in that phase. MARTIN: One of the guys playing soccer is Joey M'Poko. M'POKO: M'P-O-K-O. (LAUGHTER)M'POKO: My dad is from the Congo. MARTIN: Joey's story is like a lot of people who come through this place. His personal life was unstable. His parents divorced, and he moved around a lot. [POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: M'Poko's parents are not divorced. ] A few years ago, he ended up in Chicago, where his grandparents live. [POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: M'Poko came to the United States about six months ago. ] He was shy, lonely, and he found a kind of escape in front of his computer. M'POKO: When I got Chicago I was really bored. MARTIN: Yeah. M'POKO: I didn't have any friends. I didn't know the area. But I had a laptop so I spent a lot of time on that. I would spend 12 hours-plus on it, either gaming or watching movies. I had bad hygiene. I'd lost like 10 to 15 pounds all over the course of, like, three, four months. MARTIN: What was a game? M'POKO: It was killed \"Age of Wushu. \" It's like a Ming Dynasty-type game where you create your own style of martial arts. MARTIN: These are these games where it's you and other people who are different characters in the game, and you're at this virtual community. . . M'POKO: Yeah. MARTIN: . . . playing together. M'POKO: Exactly. MARTIN: So did you have relationships with those people you were chatting with? M'POKO: Yeah. It was a little more personal than typing because the people I was being gild with we would speak to. I mean, I have people that I consider to be friends there only because I spent most of my time with them and I got to know them and stuff and. . . MARTIN: So your conversation expanded beyond the game. M'POKO: Yes. Yes. I mean, some of them I would - we became Facebook friends. MARTIN: The kicker here is that Joey thought he was doing pretty well because a couple years before, he was smoking a lot of pot. He started getting heavy into gaming as an alternative to getting high. M'POKO: It was just an environment to meet new people who had no interest in drugs or whatever and we're just looking for good, clean fun, I guess. And, you know, I can see how it's usually damaging for a person to hide behind that. But for me it actually kind of. . . MARTIN: It felt like a good choice. M'POKO: Yeah. I mean, well, it actually made me feel like socializing again. I started to feel like a person again. I could totally zone-out all the pain, all whatever and just go into this total world of fantasy. And it was awesome. I didn't have to care about anything else. DR. HILARIE CASH: Little by little, I was seeing these people coming into my office for therapy work and this was a common theme, is something to do with the Internet, and how out of control it was for them and how much it was affecting their lives. MARTIN: This is Hilarie Cash. She founded this rehab program and has been studying Internet and technology addition since the 1990s. CASH: And had the sense back then that I was seem to trickle before the flood. And the flood is upon us. I don't have to tell you, we live in a connected world and we're all online a lot. MARTIN: I don't have to tell you, we live in a connected world and we're all online a lot. How do you define being addicted to the Internet? How is it different than living a healthy life in a busy technological world? CASH: All addictions have certain characteristics in common, whether they're behavioral or chemical. And it has to do with engaging with the chemical or the behavior, to find either a high or relief, and doing it to such an extent that it begins to control you rather than you being able to control it. But if you can be really honest with yourself and say, OK, do I get enough exercise? Do I get enough sleep? Do I spend time face-to-face with people that I love and care about? You're good to go. But if it is interfering, then there's a problem there somewhere. MARTIN: So what is an unhealthy addiction look like? What changes someone from being a 19-year-old who likes Internet gaming to someone who finds himself tucked into your facility? CASH: Typically, these are guys who very often have been gaming since they were quite young. And so, this is an addiction that has been growing over many years. And they've been caught up, let's say, in video games and porn and general surfing and looking at anime and watching movies online. And they've been doing that rather than developing relationships face to face, rather than learning how to flirt and court and date, and rather than getting they are responsibilities met. And so often families who are trying to cope with this situation - even if they're letting their kids play a lot of video games and spend time alone - at least they're kind of on their case about getting through high school. And so the kid graduates and maybe goes off to college. But in college there's no longer that parental structure. So now there's nobody stopping them from just doing what they actually want to be doing, which is online all the time. And so that's when everything starts falling apart. (SOUNDBITE OF WATER AND COOKING UTENSILS)MARTIN: Building them back up happens in a lot of ways, some very basic, like teaching them how to cook healthy meals. M'POKO: Hey, so I really suck at cutting tomatoes. MONTAG: So cut in half, cut in half, cut in half, cut in half. MARTIN: Joey M'Poko is in the kitchen with a couple of the other patients making Italian chicken and pasta for dinner with help from the house manager. MONTAG: Smaller, like dicing slices. Just. . . M'POKO: Wait, you said. OK. Like this half? Should I cut like that? MONTAG: Yeah. MARTIN: In walks a big guy dressed in workout clothes - bald head, quick smile - there are high fives and friendly slaps on the back. (LAUGHTER)M'POKO: Isaac? ISAAC VEISBURG: How you been? M'POKO: You look good, dude. You been working out? VEISBURG: Yeah. M'POKO: Losing weight? MARTIN: This is Isaac Veisburg. He was born in Venezuela and raised between there and Miami. He's all done with the reSTART program and is now working as a personal trainer. But it was a long road. He went through the six week in-patient part of the program twice. VEISBURG: The first time, I was very guarded. I didn't want to hear the word addict. As far as I was concerned I could stop whenever I wanted. MARTIN: He bailed on the program after a few weeks, went back to college in Washington, D. C. At first he tried to stay away from gaming, but he was depressed. He was fighting with his parents. He had car problems. The stress started to mount and before classes even began, Isaac was back in front of the computer. VEISBURG: Right the Saturday before school was starting, a buddy of mine calls me up and says, hey man, we miss you around in the game. Why don't you come hang out with us? And I was really stressed out so, you know, I said, yeah, you know, I'll do that. So I turned on my computer, downloaded the game and then I didn't leave that computer for 42 hours. And then I slept and I slept through my first class Monday. And I didn't go to class the rest of that day, or the day after or for five weeks after that. MARTIN: His parents sent him back to the reSTART program and eventually he finished the whole thing. Isaac is now living in Redmond, Washington, hoping to eventually become a counselor for other people working through technology addiction. Do you miss gaming? VEISBURG: No. Not even a little bit. MARTIN: Really? Those people, those relationships? VEISBURG: They weren't relationships. You know, how well can you really know someone over the Internet? Eighty-some percent of human communication is nonverbal. Out here, there's real relationships, the relationships I have with the guys in there, you know, with my girlfriend, with my parents now that we can actually talk. Those are relationships. MARTIN: Isaac appears to be on the right track now but not everyone's path is so clear. WILL: November 5th will be end of the first year of me getting here. . . (LAUGHTER)WILL: . . . which I'm not really proud of. But it just takes this long. I mean for me. . . MARTIN: This is Will. He doesn't want us to use his last name. Will has had a series of relapses that have kept him here at reSTART for an entire year. At one point, he left the program and lived in a homeless shelter for a month. After a year in rehab, he's finally done and planning to move back home to Oklahoma to try to find a job. But that's tough to do without using a computer and an Internet connection. WILL: It's a constant struggle and you're not going to be able to really avoid using the Internet or anything like that. It's just that I have to structure my life to a point where I don't feel tempted to waste time on this. MARTIN: So, when you leave reSTART and go back into the world and move back to Oklahoma, how do you use the Internet in a healthy way? WILL: Even if I had to set my own restrictions, like, it's holding yourself accountable as well, because you're not always going to have someone who's going to watch over you, and you really don't want someone to watch over you at all times. My big thing is keeping myself on a consistent, structured basis, i. e. having a job, having a social life, eating healthy, exercising on a daily basis. And it's also if I need to use the Internet, giving myself a certain amount of time, and once that time limit hits, I'll say, OK, I need to get off. MARTIN: You feel like you can do that? WILL: Yeah. It's hard. It really is hard. Like, how much people use, like, cell phones nowadays. I don't think I'll probably get a smartphone for the next maybe two years. MARTIN: Hilarie Cash, the head therapist and founder of reSTART says those kinds of boundaries are key to any kind of addiction recovery. CASH: All addictions, they say, it takes about two years for the brain to really heal itself. And before they leave here, we ask them to design what we call a life balance plan. So, what are their goals? What are going to be the pitfalls along the way? When do they plan to have a computer again? When do they plan to have a smartphone again? When they do, how are they going to use it? What are going to be the boundaries they're going to set around it? And so once they leave here, they start implementing that. And actually what's hardest is implementing it successfully. But if they can do that for six months or more, then we're looking at somebody who has a really good shot at living a good, healthy life. MARTIN: And that means learning to relax in new ways. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: So, today, why don't we look at our thoughts, recognize a thought as it's occurring and then releasing the thought. . . MARTIN: Which is why reSTART includes weekly meditation sessions. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Can we check in with you, Joey? MARTIN: Joey M'Poko is sitting with the rest of the reSTART patients in a semicircle in the living room. The instructor is in the middle leading the meditation. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: And when these thoughts come in. . . MARTIN: Joey's done with the inpatient program in just a couple of days. He's not sticking around for the second part of the program when you're supposed to transition to regular life. He wants to move on - now. He may move to Japan to teach English. His family life is still shaky. His dad is moving back to the Congo. His mom is in Vermont. And Joey doesn't know where home is anymore. But he knows it is not inside of a video game. M'POKO: Anyone who's been in a 12-step program or any kind of recovery program will tell you that the addiction is just the symptom of something else. And I feel like I'm slowly cultivating skills that will help me deal with that and make me see that I don't have to escape and it's much healthier and it feels much better to just ride the storm, I guess. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MARTIN: Therapists and health care professionals across the United States use the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Master Disorders - or DSM, as it's known - to diagnose and treat patients. In May, a new disorder was added to the DSM's list of conditions that warrant more research - Internet gaming. Experts say the designation means this online activity is more likely to be recognized as a distinct form of addiction. You can see photos from the reSTART clinic and read more about the program on our website, npr. org, and share how addiction has touched your life by tweeting with the hashtag NPRAddiction.

DAN AMIRA: Carrot is basically a to-do list but it has kind of its own personality. And the personality is that of, like, kind of a friendly but also condescending dictator. CORNISH: That's Dan Amira, a senior editor at New York Magazine. We asked him to download the Carrot To-Do app and add reviewing it to his to-do list. AMIRA: The way it works is that you just -you put down your items one at a time. And when you're done with them, you swipe it off. And every four or so items that you remove from your list you get some kind of reward. One time my reward our a message popped up and it said: We're throwing you a party. Click your app to see where the party is. And it brought me to Antarctica. So it was obviously not a party I was going to attend. But, you know, it did make me - I'm not really a to-do list kind of guy in general. But it was fun using this because I liked the humor. And you never really know what's going to happen next, after you complete the next level. So I just found myself wanting to find out, and I would put things on the list that kind of had no business being on a to-do list; like, you know, eat today or go to work. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Stand clear of the closing doors, please. AMIRA: You know, don't murder anybody today. You know, just so I could like swipe it off the list and be like: I accomplished this. Usually when you complete a task it'll be like: Great job. But when it's mad and you complete a task it'll say something like: You're the worst and just like berate you. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Well, you slime eating dog. You scum sucking pig. You sons of a motherless goat. AMIRA: To sum it all up, the Carrot To-Do list is a pretty funny app. It's probably not going to change your life if you're not motivated already. But if you want to be slightly more motivated, if you're slightly curious about what's going to happen next, then it's a good way to get some stuff done.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, TAKING CARE OF BUSINESS)OVERDRIVE: (Singing) . . . taking care of business every day, it's all right, taking care of business. . . AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  Finally in Tech, an app with attitude, it's called Carrot To-Do and its goal is to help you get things done. DAN AMIRA: Carrot is basically a to-do list but it has kind of its own personality. And the personality is that of, like, kind of a friendly but also condescending dictator. CORNISH: That's Dan Amira, a senior editor at New York Magazine. We asked him to download the Carrot To-Do app and add reviewing it to his to-do list. AMIRA: The way it works is that you just -you put down your items one at a time. And when you're done with them, you swipe it off. And every four or so items that you remove from your list you get some kind of reward. One time my reward our a message popped up and it said: We're throwing you a party. Click your app to see where the party is. And it brought me to Antarctica. So it was obviously not a party I was going to attend. But, you know, it did make me - I'm not really a to-do list kind of guy in general. But it was fun using this because I liked the humor. And you never really know what's going to happen next, after you complete the next level. So I just found myself wanting to find out, and I would put things on the list that kind of had no business being on a to-do list; like, you know, eat today or go to work. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Stand clear of the closing doors, please. AMIRA: You know, don't murder anybody today. You know, just so I could like swipe it off the list and be like: I accomplished this. Usually when you complete a task it'll be like: Great job. But when it's mad and you complete a task it'll say something like: You're the worst and just like berate you. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Well, you slime eating dog. You scum sucking pig. You sons of a motherless goat. AMIRA: To sum it all up, the Carrot To-Do list is a pretty funny app. It's probably not going to change your life if you're not motivated already. But if you want to be slightly more motivated, if you're slightly curious about what's going to happen next, then it's a good way to get some stuff done.

I'm Audie Cornish. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: And I'm Melissa Block. It's time now for All Tech Considered, which today takes us to the small farming town of Harrodsburg, Ky. It's the home of something called Willow Glass - glass that's super thin and flexible, and soon to find its way into the high-tech marketplace. It's made by Corning in the same plant that developed Gorilla Glass; that's the stuff Apple uses to make the protective cover for its iPhone. NPR's Noah Adams visited the town, and sent this report. NOAH ADAMS, BYLINE: Harrodsburg is in central Kentucky - 8,000 people - surrounded by fields with stone fences, cattle, corn, and quite a bit of tobacco ready for harvest. ZACK ISON: We just finished housing the crop today. We got done at lunchtime today; finally got it all in the barn. ADAMS: How long have you been farming tobacco? ISON: My first crop that I raised, I was 15 years old. I'm 30 now. ADAMS: This is Zack Ison. He always knew he was going to farm, but he understands about his friends from high school who went the other way. ISON: The reason that a place like Corning comes to this area is to hire guys that have grown up on farms. They know how to work. ADAMS: There's also now a Wausau Paper plant here, and Hitachi has a big operation. Corning has been in town 60 years. They have 250 hourly union workers and now, 100 engineers in Harrodsburg. Half of them have arrived from outside Kentucky. I talked with two of the veteran engineers: Stephanie Sisk, who's from Georgia; Shawn Marcum, from New York state. STEPHANIE SISK: One of the things we love to do is, we raise cattle on a 150-acre farm. So when, particularly, our Asian colleagues come over, we like to bring them over for supper because they're so - it's such a different concept for them. (Laughter)SHAWN MARCUM: When you tell someone where I live and where I work, they're surprised that we have this high-tech manufacturing operation in the bluegrass area that's known for bourbon and horses and farmland. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Four thirty-five crate change requested. (BUZZER SOUNDS)ADAMS: Corning has production in 15 countries, but the folks here in Harrodsburg say they've got the go-to shop. And Gorilla Glass might prove that. Gorilla Glass is already protecting 1 and a half billion personal devices. It started with the iPhone early in 2007. CASEY DUFFEY: Apple's a sexy operation. It's a great thing to be associated with that customer. ADAMS: This is Casey Duffey. He's the plant manager at Harrodsburg. The word had come down from headquarters - Corning, N. Y. : Steve Jobs will not have that old, scratched-up, plastic screen on the brand-new Apple iPhone. Steve Jobs wants hard and silky-smooth. He wants glass. This was in January; the iPhone introduction was promised for late June. The iPhone did come out on time with the glass Corning had never made before. DUFFEY: Now, we didn't have the glass that ultimately we used for Apple, ready. But we had compositions and expertise in this area that led us to believe that we could develop something pretty quickly. (SOUNDBITE OF MACHINERY)ADAMS: We put on eye protection and go out into the Corning plant and up to the top floor, to watch sand from West Virginia glowing and melting into glass. TERRY OTT: Now, you start to get a little bit of a feel for the temperatures that are involved - when you stand closer. At this elevation, we're easily well over a thousand degrees. ADAMS: Terry Ott is the engineering manager for the plant. He won't talk about what other minerals are added to the mix, except to say they're all on the periodic table. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Four thirty-seven. . . ADAMS: This Corning Glass plant in Kentucky is always running - all day and all night. The big work is done by robots. We watch a full sheet of new glass slide into a vertical work space where it will be scored, and the edges removed. OTT: And the robot will come up and grab it, and pivot to separate it, and then pass it down the line. ADAMS: That robot looks like a big, yellow duck. OTT: (Laughter) Yes. You know, in this case, it's very similar to what - the robots that are classically used in the auto industry and everything else, just adapted for our purpose. ADAMS: We move on  to a different production line, and Terry Ott shows me a large roll of just-finished Willow Glass. It's glass about as thin as a dollar bill. Terry Ott, the top engineer, is uncharacteristically reverential. OTT: So this is 200 to 100 microns thick; roughly, a meter wide; and basically, spooled as one, continuous ribbon. This is relatively revolutionary for a pristine, untouched glass. ADAMS: Willow Glass from Corning is soon to be on the market. And an engineer at Harrodsburg might well go home after work these days imagining interactive white boards in every classroom in the world, huge highway and airport signs, antibacterial countertops in hospitals, computer displays you can roll up like a poster. And in Kentucky, you get to think about this sort of thing maybe out on the porch, watching the cows come back across the field at feeding time. Noah Adams, NPR News.

That's the total cost to create the online health insurance marketplace. Some 55 separate government contractors worked on it. And to computer programmer Rusty Foster, that number adds up to a problem. RUSTY FOSTER: Once you hear sort of the details of how this was intended to be done and rolled out, everybody just kind of nods their head and goes, yeah, that's not going to work. You have a human services agency managing 55 different government contractors, trying to produce one complex piece of software. Like, that's crazy. (LAUGHTER)FOSTER: I can't think of any way that could work. I'm sort of amazed at how well it does work, actually, which is, you know, where it kind of - it could've been worse. BLOCK: And that leads to the title of Foster's blog post for The New Yorker, \"Healthcare. gov: It Could've Been Worse. \" I asked Foster where he thinks the project went wrong. FOSTER: Overall, I think my sense is that they tried to do too much in too short a time. The project was managed the way that sort of government software projects have been managed. That's kind of what I talked about a lot in my blog post, was I went back to the FBI's rollout of their computer upgrade, which took more than 10 years and cost $1 billion, and there was one entire failed project involved. And this kind of went much the same way. So if anything, you know, the title \"It Could Be Worse\" means it took, you know, only a couple of years, and there is a site that exists. BLOCK: Well, you mentioned that it was done in too short a time. And you mentioned a New York Times story that claims that the government was very slow in writing specifications for the contract, so that the biggest contractor didn't start actually coding software until this past spring. Would that be too short a window to do this the right way? FOSTER: Yeah. I mean, I think absolutely, it was. Given the short window that they had, one approach they could have taken would have been more of a phased rollout, where perhaps the first launch of the site - I mean, they were on track to do this; the first launch of the site was just informational. Maybe the second phase of the site could've been you can make an account and sign in. And then after they had people making accounts and that was all working, they could've rolled out - now you can provide some information and we'll start looking up, you know, what kind of health insurance we can offer you. BLOCK: Based on what you've read - I know you're on the outside - but based on what you've read, does it seem to you that there was adequate testing of this system before it was launched? FOSTER: To an extent, there isn't any point in testing until you sort of feel like you're definitely finished. And I doubt many of the contractors felt like they were even finished. So, when somebody's giving you a deadline and saying it has to launch October 1st, come hell or high water, there isn't that much point running tests because they're going to push the code out anyway, and you're going to have a bunch of people using it regardless of whether your tests fail or not. BLOCK: Well, the Obama administration has announced what they're calling the tech surge, right, the best and brightest being brought in to work on this. FOSTER: Right. BLOCK: Does having more bodies thrown at the problem really help? Is it a numerical thing? If you have more people, you can fix problems faster? FOSTER: Not really. The conventional wisdom kind of comes from Brooks' - it's called Brooks' law, usually stated as adding programmers to a late software project makes it later. Because on the one hand, new programmers have to get up to speed on the system and some things, especially like this, is probably very complicated. And then at the same time, the people who are already working on the project have to sort of stop and train the new people in what they were doing. So there's a big slowdown across the board as soon as you try to add people to a project. BLOCK: So what would the solution be if not more bodies? FOSTER: That is hard to say. I mean, when you get yourself into kind of a bind with a software project, there aren't a whole lot of good options other than take the time and do the work.

He now builds software to make building new e-commerce sites even easier. And he says when you go to any website to buy something, you usually have just one or two simple questions you want answered before you click buy.

HENN: But before you can see how much your policy will cost, there are pages of forms to fill out. They're buggy. They crash. The reason for all this pain is that the price of insurance on the site will change depending on how much you make. The Affordable Care Act offers subsidies. It's the act's defining feature. So the website was designed to figure out what your subsidies could be as its very first step. And to figure all that out, the sight requires all sorts of sensitive personal information. It requires passwords and protections and security questions. The Fed's built a brand-new IRS database that would look up tax returns to verify your income. And all of that has to happen flawlessly before you get any kind of answer to that basic question you came with: How much is this going to cost? Sina Djafari says it didn't have to be this way. Just think about how you shop for a mortgage.

(SOUNDBITE OF COPY MACHINE)GREENE: Seventy-five years ago this week, an inventor named Chester Carlson produced the first-ever photocopy in his tiny apartment in Queens, New York. His invention made Xerox a household name and revolutionized the workplace. Forget the water cooler. I think some of the deepest conversations took place around the copier. From member station WXXI, Kate O'Connell reports. KATE O'CONNELL, BYLINE: Copy machines can be found in every office, and most of us take them for granted. But early models of the Xerox photocopiers weren't without their kinks. The first commercial model, the Xerox 914, was bulky and cumbersome. It weighed nearly 650 pounds. It was the size of about two washing machines and it was prone to spontaneous combustion. But even literally going up in flames wasn't enough to kill the product. In fact, it was in high demand. RAY BREWER: There was a distinct need for simple copying like this, and it just took off.  We sold thousands of these machines, and the demand was such that we were manufacturing them in large quantities. O'CONNELL: Ray Brewer is the historical archivist for Xerox. Brewer says the popularity of Xerox technology abroad inspired more clandestine uses for the copier. The 914 model had some James Bond flair in its past. Some machines even had miniature cameras built into them during the Cold War for the purpose of spying on other countries. While back at home, the copier was proving to be a godsend for secretaries. (SOUNDBITE OF AD)LYNN PERIL: I mean, that had to be fabulously liberating. O'CONNELL: Author and historian Lynn Peril says the machines were a real gift for office girls. PERIL: Oh my god, you didn't have to work with the lousy carbon paper and all of that. You could just take it and put it on this glass surface and press a button and you've got as many copies as you wanted? O'CONNELL: Peril says the beauty of the technology was that it saved time for the female office worker without making her workplace role obsolete. But despite its success and continuing legacy, the technology almost never saw the light of day. It took inventor Chester Carlson more than 20 years to take his invention from the kitchen of his small apartment to the commercial market. He used static electricity created with a handkerchief, coupled with light and dry powder to make the first copy. And once it hit offices, the Xerox machine prompted a dramatic change in the ability of a single person to communicate with large numbers of people. Angele Boyd is a business analyst at the International Data Corporation. She says copier technology created a more democratic information system. ANGELE BOYD: The laser printer brought to the desktop and the common man in the office the ability to produce output that until then you needed to go to a press or you needed to go to a third party external print shop to produce that kind of quality output. (SOUNDBITE OF AD)O'CONNELL: The core technology in the copier, later transferred to printers and scanners, has remained the same since the 1930s. For NPR News, I'm Kate O'Connell.

I'm Arun Rath. It's time now for The New and the Next. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RATH: Carlos Watson is the co-founder of the online magazine Ozy. Each week, he joins us to talk about what's new and what's next. Welcome back, Carlos. CARLOS WATSON: Arun, always good to be with you, this time live from Mountain View. RATH: So let's start out with some music this week. You have a profile of a young singer - I hadn't heard of her before this - Alexandra McDermott. WATSON: Unbelievable, this 18-year-old from Portland, Oregon. Arun, you got to do the audience a favor and play a little bit of her. She was discovered a couple of years ago on YouTube, just got signed literally this week to a big deal with Columbia Records, one of the major labels. And while she looks young and quiet, she's got one of those big powerful voices that makes everyone kind of stop and stare. RATH: Let's listen to that. This is her cover of \"Big Jet Plane. \"(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"BIG JET PLANE\")RATH: So she's taking off now, but she had a rough time in school? WATSON: She did. So she, sadly enough, she was bullied as a kid. And bullied badly enough, Arun, that she ultimately had to switch high schools. And then, at a friend's suggestion in 2011, got on stage, performed at a school talent fair, and everybody went silent after she sang Adele's \"Someone Like You\" and then less than 30 seconds later, burst out into applause, tears. So I'm looking forward to her first album dropping. RATH: You also have a piece about a blog - another one - I'd never heard of this before - it's starting to get a big following called Wait But Why. WATSON: You know, Arun, you and I and a ton of other people we know love infographics, the idea that the best way to explain something sometimes is clever graphics. This blog was started by two tutors - these guys were academic tutors - Tim Urban and Andrew Finn, and decided to get together and try and explain some of life's more important and sometimes more offbeat points. So one of their most interesting pieces are why they think millennials are sometimes perpetually unhappy, or I should say more specifically, they call them Gen-Y yuppies. They call them gypsies. RATH: So it's kind of inspiring. They've made it big, but they've stayed true to their nerdiness. WATSON: They have. And, you know, even though they only started in July - so less than six months - already have more than a quarter of a million subscribers. And really interesting, their ability to use graphs and charts to bring things alive. RATH: Finally, you have a surprising factoid in your Fast Forward section this week. There are rumors that a Harley Davidson dealership could be coming to Vietnam. WATSON: We all think of China as the booming economy in Asia. In the past, we thought certainly of Japan and even India. But increasingly, Vietnam is that place that's showing a lot of spark. They've been growing at 5 or 6 percent, now literally going back 20-plus years, third-largest oil producer. And one of the ways you see some of that financial success story and to show up, believe it or not, are more and more Harley Davidson motorcycles - and I know you own one, Arun. . . RATH: Of course. WATSON: . . . on the road of Ho Chi Minh City. RATH: And they're not, you know, they're popular. They're not like this symbol of, you know, imperialist capitalism. WATSON: Well, interestingly enough, no. It's funny - Arun, I've visited Vietnam a couple of times, and I'm not surprised to see this as kind of the next step. And while they can be quite expensive - in fact, they're heavily taxed in order to buy one there - you still are not only seeing more and more of them, but in fact, a Harley Davidson dealership is expected to open towards the end of this year or early next year.

I'm Arun Rath. Criticism of the federal government's online health care insurance portal, HealthCare. gov, has been relentless. And this week, President Obama added his voice to the chorus. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: There's no sugarcoating it. The website has been too slow. People have been getting stuck during the application process. And I think it's fair to say that nobody is more frustrated by that than I am. RATH: The president promised to get the problem sorted and the website running smoothly by the end of November. As NPR's Steve Henn reported earlier this week, the administration's critics argue in an era of eBay and Amazon, simply building an online health care marketplace should not have befuddled the federal government. STEVE HENN, BYLINE: Sina Djafari has built more than one successful online marketplace. He now builds software to make building new e-commerce sites even easier. And he says when you go to any website to buy something, you usually have just one or two simple questions you want answered before you click buy. SINA DJAFARI: When I went to HealthCare. gov for the first time, my only question I wanted answered was, how much is this going to cost me? And I just really wanted that answer, you know, as soon as possible. HENN: If that's the goal of HealthCare. gov, Sina Djafari says it should have been designed to deliver an answer to that question as quickly and painlessly as possible. DJAFARI: You actually want to encourage people to move as far along in the process as possible without requiring any information from them. HENN: But before you can see how much your policy will cost, there are pages of forms to fill out. They're buggy. They crash. The reason for all this pain is that the price of insurance on the site will change depending on how much you make. The Affordable Care Act offers subsidies. It's the act's defining feature, so the website was designed to figure out what your subsidies could be as its very first step. And to figure all that out, the site requires all sorts of sensitive personal information. It requires passwords and protections and security questions. The feds built a brand-new IRS database that would look up tax returns to verify your income, and all of that has to happen, flawlessly, before you get any kind of answer to that basic question you came with: How much is this going to cost? Sina Djafari says it didn't have to be this way. Just think about how you shop for a mortgage. You can go to any one of a dozen websites and type in your income anonymously, then enter your best guess as to your current credit rating, and then type how much you want to borrow. DJAFARI: You know, it's a marketplace system. HENN: In fact, it's a pretty good analogy for the health care marketplace. You have a lot of different businesses offering products through one portal. But lenders on mortgage sites all agree to put off the tedious bits, like verifying your income, until after you've had a chance to peruse the goods and make a decision. Still, this system works. DJAFARI: If you don't put the right information in early on, you're wasting your time. So you might as well put in the most accurate information you can now so that when you get an answer, it's the right answer. HENN: And in the mortgage industry, at least these days, everyone knows your income will actually be checked. In fact, the IRS offers income verification electronically to mortgage lenders. It's not instant, but it doesn't derail the process of applying for a loan either. Jeff Sutherland is CEO of Scrum Inc. He says problems like these should have been spotted long before the site went live. JEFF SUTHERLAND: We should stop this in its tracks, reset it, fix it in the right way and probably get, you know, 99 percent of the people involved with this off the payroll, because all they did was screw it up. HENN: Sutherland helped pioneer a software design philosophy that breaks big projects like HealthCare. gov down into small digestible tasks. But he says given how the site was developed and taken live with little testing, failure was almost inevitable. Steve Henn, NPR News, Silicon Valley.

That was from \"Romeo and Juliet,\" by the way, where - spoiler alert - love is a dagger in their hearts. For centuries, art and song celebrated religious devotion, not romance. But today, most music - from opera to hip-hop, Puccini to Katy Perry - is about romantic love. So do we need new songs for an era in which you don't see someone across a crowded room or under moonlight, but online?

But as with a lot of things on the Internet, how do you know that you can trust what you're reading? That's a question that occupies a lot of time for the people at the Wikimedia Foundation, which is the not-for-profit organization that operates the online encyclopedia. Sue Gardner is the executive director leading the fight against the so-called sockpuppets, who might not have your best interests at heart, when you read certain entries. She joins us from member station KQED in San Francisco. Sue, thanks for being with us. SUE GARDNER: Hey, Rachel. How are you? MARTIN: I'm doing well. What are these infamous sockpuppets? GARDNER: Wikipedians noticed some suspicious editing patterns on Wikipedia starting, I don't know, about six months ago, I think. And what was happening was there were a bunch of user accounts on Wikipedia that were editing articles and seeming to insert promotional puffery language into them, and using a number of kind of deceptive-seeming practices. And so, just recently the investigation kind of culminated in the banning of 250 user accounts for sockpuppetry. Do you know what sockpuppetry is? MARTIN: I mean I'm thinking of a hand in a puppet and a lot of kids sitting around. GARDNER: That's kind of the analogy. So what it is, is if I am one person, my name is Sue Gardner, I'm on Wikipedia, my user account is named Sue Gardner. I could also make a bunch of other accounts, you know, Sue Gardner 2, Jim Smith - whatever, right? Those are sockpuppets. And so, what it is, is when you use multiple accounts to mask the fact that you are one person making a bunch of edits. And sometimes sockpuppets do things, like, I might go into an article and say: Ooh, Sue Gardner 1, what a great edit. You are doing really well here. You know? And so you can use multiple accounts to support your own actions and make it appear that there's consensus that your work is good, when it isn't good. MARTIN: So are these rogue individuals or they're working for corporations who want to use Wikipedia as free advertising, propaganda? GARDNER: That's not clear right now. What we do know is - so we have these hundreds of accounts and they've been making promotional edits on Wikipedia, and they've been using message to make those edits that are deceptive. Is it likely that somebody just really, really likes all these small companies and wants to burnish their reputations for fun - like as a leisure activity? That is not likely. What's likely is that they are working for somebody - probably a black hat PR firm of some kind and they're engaged in bad practices. MARTIN: So what's the punishment if you can identify these actors? GARDNER: Yeah, they're banned. So they've all, you know, 250 of them have been banned. More will probably be banned. This is the largest sort of mass banning that has happened in our history for this purpose. MARTIN: Was this just part of the deal? Is this just kind of the price of doing business with this kind of crowdsourcing? GARDNER: I think so, yeah. And I mean, certainly all the studies show that every article in Wikipedia gets better over time, right? Time is what makes a good article, time and multiple editors. So if you look at Wikipedia, our best articles are articles on, for example, Barack Obama, right? It's been edited by thousands of people over many, many years. It is richly, you know, studded with citations. It takes you to the original sources where you can confirm what it says. It's a superb article. Not everything on Wikipedia is going to be that level of quality today. The bargain, in effect, that you're making is that most people who edit the encyclopedia are doing a really great job, and they care about quality. They want to bring useful information to people. But the price tag on that is that it's open to everyone to edit. And so, yeah, I mean that creates some vulnerabilities - that's what we're seeing here.

I'm Celeste Headlee. Michel Martin is away. Coming up, you may know her as the daughter of legendary actress Phylicia Rashad, but now Condola Rashad is stepping into the spotlight herself. She talks about her starring role in the new Broadway production of \"Romeo and Juliet\" in a moment. But first, representatives from historically black colleges and universities are meeting this week to talk about African-Americans in the tech world. According to a recent study by the National Science Foundation, black men and women made up 5 percent of scientists and engineers working in their field in 2010. We took to Facebook and Twitter using the hashtag #NPRblacksintech to ask listeners about what African-American technologists they thought we should keep our eye on and what issues they might face. Here's what Maurice Cherry, who talks to black web developers and graphic designers on his podcast Revision Path, told us. MAURICE CHERRY: In most of these types of industries where you have tech people working, they're really behind the scenes. And the ones that are out there and visible that might be speaking at conferences or representing the company are usually not people of color. So we're not necessarily visible. That's not saying that we're not there. We're just not seen. We're sort of behind the scenes, if you will. HEADLEE: We wanted to find out more, so we called on Greg Greenlee. He's the founder of Blacks in Technology. That's a website and online community devoted to connecting African-Americans in the tech world. Also with us is Ayori Selassie. She's a strategic advisor at Blacks in Technology and also cofounder and executive director of Pitch Mixer Entrepreneur Forum. That's a group that helps aspiring tech entrepreneurs pitch their ideas to exports. And joining this program once again, Walter Kimbrough, president of Dillard University, an HBCU in New Orleans. Welcome, all of you. GREG GREENLEE: Thanks, Celeste. Thanks for having me. WALTER KIMBROUGH: Thank you. HEADLEE: I'm glad you guys are all there. You scared me there for a second. Let's begin with you, Greg. And, I mean, talk about blacks in technology and the need for it. Is there a reason why we should be concerned? You know, 5 percent is obviously a very low amount of African-Americans in the tech world. Do we have to be concerned about that? GREENLEE: I think so. I think that as a whole, the technology sector should be concerned just because they're missing out on a increased pool of resources and talent. So if you don't - or if you're not trying to diversify your company or the tech field, you're missing out on a slew of people who have ideas, who have the talent and the skill level to actually - to, you know, increase technology as a whole. HEADLEE: Well, Walter, where does this disparity come from? Are there not - I mean, you educate people all the time. Are people of African-American descent not going into tech? Are they not getting degrees in that, or are they having trouble once they get their degree getting a job? KIMBROUGH: Well, I think that there are people that are going into the tech fields, and of course HBCUs are always producing a disproportionate number of those people. But just overall, you don't have enough people in the pipeline that are going - that are finishing high school, going to college and then entering into those fields. So, you know, it starts even before it gets to my level. We still have some major disparities in the K-12 pipeline to get them ready to enter college. Once they get there, we're able to produce. But I think we're going to have to focus on that level, but people are interested. People of color are interested in doing very well, but we've got to really ramp up those numbers and make sure that more K-12 institutions are helping young people prepare so that when they enter college, they're able to then successfully navigate into those careers. HEADLEE: OK, but, Walter, that's a - I mean, that's a major undertaking. I mean, colleges have had troubles in the past trying to at all venture into K-12 education or in any way, shape or form confront the idea of curriculum. How do you encourage kids in any particular field of study on the K-12 level? KIMBROUGH: Well, it has to be, I think, a holistic approach. It can't just be one sector. It's difficult for higher education to try to mandate to K-12. And so I think conversations like this to make sure people are aware of some of these disparities - and we hear of that 5 percent figure, even though the nation is 12 percent African-American. We've got to have engaged communities to be a part of this. So I think, from the higher-education perspective, we have to make sure people know that this is an issue, that we all can be engaged. But it's not something that I would say higher education is going to solve, but we can play a major role in increasing their awareness. But, I mean, we need state and local elected officials and the tech industry and everybody engaged in this situation. HEADLEE: So, Greg, where do you begin this, especially with your group Blacks in Technology? Do you begin by reaching out to younger generations to try to get them in involved in tech, or do you support those who are already there? GREENLEE: I think it's a combination of both. I think one of the things that's definitely needed is - and we've said it before - is more visibility for the people that are already doing magnificent things in the tech world. I think where Blacks in Technology fits in there is that we're trying to provide - that we are providing a platform for people of color that are already in the tech field. And we're giving them an outlet to engage each other, to network and also to be seen and be heard. We do podcasts. We have an online technology blog that represents, you know, African-Americans in technology. All the blogs are written by African-Americans in technology. So I think that, you know, the visibility part - to be able to see someone and to go to someone who looks like that person is definitely a great start. HEADLEE: Well, let me bring you into this, Ayori Selassie. You're a strategic advisor at Blacks in Technology. I have to imagine that, especially for African-American women, this is a doubly difficult challenge. We've heard a lot about some of the alleged misogyny in the tech community. How do you strategically try to encourage African-American women especially? AYORI SELASSIE: Oh, that's a great question. And, I mean, definitely we - you know, we have to really reach across, I think, the board in terms of engaging with as many organizations as we can. So I work with the Anita Borg Institute. We have a Black Women in Computing organization. I meet with, you know, women in technology - black women in technology through across the board, and, you know, we try and make sure that this is something that we're engaging at the level of, you know, families in the companies that we work for, and, you know, just across the board. So, yeah, I mean, Black Girls Code is a great example, I think, of what black women in technology have been doing. Kimberly Bryant sort of set the stage, but she's got this force of volunteers that come and just do amazing things and work with these young kids. HEADLEE: If you're just joining us, we're talking about African-Americans in the world of technology. You just heard Ayori Selassie, product manager at Salesforce. Also with me, Greg Greenlee, founder of Blacks in Tech, and Walter Kimbrough, president of Dillard University. Let me ask both Greg and Ayori, if you could maybe give us an example - and let me begin with you, Ayori - maybe somebody that we haven't heard of that we should keep our eye on - an African-American in the tech world. SELASSIE: Oh, definitely. I mean, there's a whole list. And, I mean, the thing that I think is important about what Greg has built at blacksintechnology. net is that, you know, we're constantly sort of putting names out there. So if you go onto that website today, you can find a bunch of names that I've mentioned. But one that I want to mention in particular is Jason Young and Kilimanjaro Robbs. And they're right here in Oakland. They started a program called the Hidden Genius Project. And this project works specifically with young black boys and teaching them how to code. But not just how to code, but also, you know, various different skills. And what they're doing is they're multiplying themselves and these young men. And it's just so wonderful to see what they're doing. I mean, it's, like, it gives me chills. So, I mean, definitely look out for those guys. HEADLEE: And, Greg, you have an example of somebody we should keep our eye on? GREENLEE: Like Ayori said, there's a lot of people that's registered on the site that are members of the community, but one in particular - and I'm bringing this person up because they just had a big technology leadership conference over this past weekend - is Andrew West. He's the founder of the National Black Information Technology Leadership Organization. And what - and their mission is - for their organization - is designed to support the goals of black technology leaders by equipping them with resources and professional development designed to strengthen and refine their skills in support of their larger vision. Him, along with Anjuan Simmons, along with Kai Dupe' are three African-American men who were giving talks at the NBITLO conference over the weekend. And actually, Anjuan just released a book. He just published a book, be called \"Minority Tech. \"HEADLEE: Well, let me go back to you, Walter, because we were talking earlier about encouraging kids in K-12 to study STEM sciences to get into tech. But this study from the National Science Foundation says underrepresented minorities - blacks, Hispanics and American Indians - are less likely than whites to attend college or graduate. So perhaps getting African-American kids into college at all is part of the challenge. KIMBROUGH: Oh, definitely. It is part of the challenge, and then the other challenge on top of that is having the resources to complete college, as well. So that makes it just a very complex problem that I think a lot of institutions are really concerned about, particularly members of the HBCU community are working to remedy that - as well as in finding new avenues, such as this upcoming HBCU conference to talk about innovation at the institutions where we develop strategies so that HBCUs, in particular, can help faculty members develop practices and working with Silicon Valley so that we  provide more opportunities for technology, which will hopefully then generate companies that can fund those institutions, as well as provide support for students. So I think there's some unique and exciting things that are happening there. HEADLEE: All right. So let me do a quick response from all three of you on one particular question. You may have heard over the summer, Kanye West, the rapper, compared himself to Steve Jobs. I'm not going to ask you guys all to give me your opinion on whether that's a fair comparison, but let me ask you - and maybe begin with you, Greg - what do you think it'll take before we get an African-American who is in that type of visibility job, like a Steve Jobs, that kind of inspiring figure in tech? GREENLEE: What would it take? That's a pretty good question. I think it's going to take - even before - we have to increase the visibility of blacks in tech because there are people out there right now that are doing amazing and creating amazing technologies within the tech world who are African-American. So it's really more about creating that avenue, creating that - giving them a platform to be able to be seen and to be heard so that we know exactly what these people are working on. I can't remember - maybe Ayori can remember this guy's name from Bitcasa. You know, he's a CEO of Bitcasa, which is, you know, a company that's similar to Drop Box, and he created this, you know, entire platform around that. And, you know, people like that is who needs the spotlight. HEADLEE: OK, well, let me take that to Ayori then. GREENLEE: OK. HEADLEE: It sounds like Greg is saying that there are these kind of figures out. We just need to give them the opportunity to shine. Ayori, what do you think? SELASSIE: Yeah, I think the - cultural exchange is really important. And I think that we have folks who are doing wonderful things, and we just need more. And the only way that we're going to be able to do that is to facilitate cultural exchange between areas and regions like Silicon Valley with areas like Detroit, Brooklyn, Oakland, California. And we create those things by building communities and sharing resources and making friendships sort of across these communities, and, I mean, deep friendships. So, you know, you can't just - it doesn't just come out of nowhere. HEADLEE: Right. SELASSIE: Technology is created by people. And what I really love about sort of the urban centers and what we're talking about when we say the value of diversity and what it brings to innovation, is we're talking about young people with fresh ideas, fresh mindsets. And once you enable and then equip them with technology, they're going to apply that to different things, and that's where you're going to get the Steve Jobs coming from. That's where you're going to get these widely new innovative ideas that are going to break the traditions that we're used to today. That's what innovation is. HEADLEE: Yeah. All right. Well, Walter, you've got about 90 seconds. I hate to do that to you. But, you know, we've all heard these stories about tech people saying - becoming really famous, but they never finished college. I'm sure you've heard those stories. KIMBROUGH: Right. Right. Exactly. HEADLEE: So give me the pitch for the next Steve Jobs to go to Dillard and actually finish that degree. KIMBROUGH: Well, I think those persons, as you heard, our two content experts say that those persons exist. And so I think as our country continues to become more diverse, we're going to have to have different people with different experiences lifted up as these heroes for technology. And so, you know, I'm waiting for that person to have their Sheryl Sandberg moment - that they come out and then everyone's raving about this person from, you know, an African-American background who is now this technology wizard. So I think. . . HEADLEE: Sheryl Sandberg who wrote the book \"Lean In. \"KIMBROUGH: Right. HEADLEE: Just to remind our listeners. Go ahead. KIMBROUGH: So I think those persons do exist. And I think that - particularly, some of the work that HBCUs are doing - we will generate those people. We're connecting with the urban centers, as I already mentioned that. That's what we do best, and so we will be a pipeline for those persons. But, you know, I agree with both of the guests that those persons are there. We just need to put the spotlight on them. HEADLEE: So your answer, Walter, is that our African-American Steve Jobs or Sheryl Sandberg is already out there somewhere. KIMBROUGH: They're there. I believe that in my heart. That person is there, but someone has to say, I'm going to lift this person up to really bring in a diverse group of people to inspire people in technologies. So I'm sorry to Kanye - it won't be him - but there is someone out there. HEADLEE: He's got other stuff going on. KIMBROUGH: He does. HEADLEE: Ayori, do we already have, out there, somewhere, our version - our African-American version of Steve Jobs? SELASSIE: Yes. Absolutely, we do. But guess what? We're not going to see the development in that African-American Steve Jobs if he's not being mentored. You know, Steve Jobs was mentored by, you know, a lot of amazing people including, you know, one of the CEOs of Intel and all sorts of other people. And what they do is they get in there, they work with you, they help you through these challenges and they share their network. They sponsor you, and they support you. And that's what we have to have. That's why that cross-cultural exchange is so important because if we don't start integrating, you know, and having real, you know, diversity and different people involved in our friendships and our relationships and in our companies, then we're not going to have that mentorship that we need that crosses the racial lines. HEADLEE: That's Ayori Selassie. She's cofounder and executive director of Pitch Mixer Entrepreneur Forum based in Oakland, California and a strategic advisor for Blacks in Tech.

I think where Blacks in Technology fits in there is that we're trying to provide - that we are providing a platform for people of color that are already in the tech field. And we're giving them an outlet to engage each other, to network and also to be seen and be heard. We do podcasts. We have an online technology blog that represents, you know, African-Americans in technology. All the blogs are written by African-Americans in technology. So I think that, you know, the visibility part - to be able to see someone and to go to someone who looks like that person is definitely a great start. HEADLEE: Well, let me bring you into this, Ayori Selassie. You're a strategic advisor at Blacks in Technology. I have to imagine that, especially for African-American women, this is a doubly difficult challenge. We've heard a lot about some of the alleged misogyny in the tech community. How do you strategically try to encourage African-American women especially? AYORI SELASSIE: Oh, that's a great question. And, I mean, definitely we - you know, we have to really reach across, I think, the board in terms of engaging with as many organizations as we can. So I work with the Anita Borg Institute. We have a Black Women in Computing organization. I meet with, you know, women in technology - black women in technology through across the board, and, you know, we try and make sure that this is something that we're engaging at the level of, you know, families in the companies that we work for, and, you know, just across the board. So, yeah, I mean, Black Girls Code is a great example, I think, of what black women in technology have been doing. Kimberly Bryant sort of set the stage, but she's got this force of volunteers that come and just do amazing things and work with these young kids. HEADLEE: If you're just joining us, we're talking about African-Americans in the world of technology. You just heard Ayori Selassie, product manager at Salesforce. Also with me, Greg Greenlee, founder of Blacks in Tech, and Walter Kimbrough, president of Dillard University. Let me ask both Greg and Ayori, if you could maybe give us an example - and let me begin with you, Ayori - maybe somebody that we haven't heard of that we should keep our eye on - an African-American in the tech world. SELASSIE: Oh, definitely. I mean, there's a whole list. And, I mean, the thing that I think is important about what Greg has built at blacksintechnology. net is that, you know, we're constantly sort of putting names out there. So if you go onto that website today, you can find a bunch of names that I've mentioned. But one that I want to mention in particular is Jason Young and Kilimanjaro Robbs. And they're right here in Oakland. They started a program called the Hidden Genius Project. And this project works specifically with young black boys and teaching them how to code. But not just how to code, but also, you know, various different skills. And what they're doing is they're multiplying themselves and these young men. And it's just so wonderful to see what they're doing. I mean, it's, like, it gives me chills. So, I mean, definitely look out for those guys. HEADLEE: And, Greg, you have an example of somebody we should keep our eye on? GREENLEE: Like Ayori said, there's a lot of people that's registered on the site that are members of the community, but one in particular - and I'm bringing this person up because they just had a big technology leadership conference over this past weekend - is Andrew West. He's the founder of the National Black Information Technology Leadership Organization. And what - and their mission is - for their organization - is designed to support the goals of black technology leaders by equipping them with resources and professional development designed to strengthen and refine their skills in support of their larger vision. Him, along with Anjuan Simmons, along with Kai Dupe' are three African-American men who were giving talks at the NBITLO conference over the weekend. And actually, Anjuan just released a book. He just published a book, be called \"Minority Tech. \" HEADLEE: Well, let me go back to you, Walter, because we were talking earlier about encouraging kids in K-12 to study STEM sciences to get into tech. But this study from the National Science Foundation says underrepresented minorities - blacks, Hispanics and American Indians - are less likely than whites to attend college or graduate. So perhaps getting African-American kids into college at all is part of the challenge. KIMBROUGH: Oh, definitely. It is part of the challenge, and then the other challenge on top of that is having the resources to complete college, as well. So that makes it just a very complex problem that I think a lot of institutions are really concerned about, particularly members of the HBCU community are working to remedy that - as well as in finding new avenues, such as this upcoming HBCU conference to talk about innovation at the institutions where we develop strategies so that HBCUs, in particular, can help faculty members develop practices and working with Silicon Valley so that we  provide more opportunities for technology, which will hopefully then generate companies that can fund those institutions, as well as provide support for students. So I think there's some unique and exciting things that are happening there. HEADLEE: All right. So let me do a quick response from all three of you on one particular question. You may have heard over the summer, Kanye West, the rapper, compared himself to Steve Jobs. I'm not going to ask you guys all to give me your opinion on whether that's a fair comparison, but let me ask you - and maybe begin with you, Greg - what do you think it'll take before we get an African-American who is in that type of visibility job, like a Steve Jobs, that kind of inspiring figure in tech? GREENLEE: What would it take? That's a pretty good question. I think it's going to take - even before - we have to increase the visibility of blacks in tech because there are people out there right now that are doing amazing and creating amazing technologies within the tech world who are African-American. So it's really more about creating that avenue, creating that - giving them a platform to be able to be seen and to be heard so that we know exactly what these people are working on. I can't remember - maybe Ayori can remember this guy's name from Bitcasa. You know, he's a CEO of Bitcasa, which is, you know, a company that's similar to Drop Box, and he created this, you know, entire platform around that. And, you know, people like that is who needs the spotlight. HEADLEE: OK, well, let me take that to Ayori then. GREENLEE: OK. HEADLEE: It sounds like Greg is saying that there are these kind of figures out. We just need to give them the opportunity to shine. Ayori, what do you think? SELASSIE: Yeah, I think the - cultural exchange is really important. And I think that we have folks who are doing wonderful things, and we just need more. And the only way that we're going to be able to do that is to facilitate cultural exchange between areas and regions like Silicon Valley with areas like Detroit, Brooklyn, Oakland, California. And we create those things by building communities and sharing resources and making friendships sort of across these communities, and, I mean, deep friendships. So, you know, you can't just - it doesn't just come out of nowhere. HEADLEE: Right. SELASSIE: Technology is created by people. And what I really love about sort of the urban centers and what we're talking about when we say the value of diversity and what it brings to innovation, is we're talking about young people with fresh ideas, fresh mindsets. And once you enable and then equip them with technology, they're going to apply that to different things, and that's where you're going to get the Steve Jobs coming from. That's where you're going to get these widely new innovative ideas that are going to break the traditions that we're used to today. That's what innovation is. HEADLEE: Yeah. All right. Well, Walter, you've got about 90 seconds. I hate to do that to you. But, you know, we've all heard these stories about tech people saying - becoming really famous, but they never finished college. I'm sure you've heard those stories. KIMBROUGH: Right. Right. Exactly. HEADLEE: So give me the pitch for the next Steve Jobs to go to Dillard and actually finish that degree. KIMBROUGH: Well, I think those persons, as you heard, our two content experts say that those persons exist. And so I think as our country continues to become more diverse, we're going to have to have different people with different experiences lifted up as these heroes for technology. And so, you know, I'm waiting for that person to have their Sheryl Sandberg moment - that they come out and then everyone's raving about this person from, you know, an African-American background who is now this technology wizard. So I think. . . HEADLEE: Sheryl Sandberg who wrote the book \"Lean In. \" KIMBROUGH: Right. HEADLEE: Just to remind our listeners. Go ahead. KIMBROUGH: So I think those persons do exist. And I think that - particularly, some of the work that HBCUs are doing - we will generate those people. We're connecting with the urban centers, as I already mentioned that. That's what we do best, and so we will be a pipeline for those persons. But, you know, I agree with both of the guests that those persons are there. We just need to put the spotlight on them. HEADLEE: So your answer, Walter, is that our African-American Steve Jobs or Sheryl Sandberg is already out there somewhere. KIMBROUGH: They're there. I believe that in my heart. That person is there, but someone has to say, I'm going to lift this person up to really bring in a diverse group of people to inspire people in technologies. So I'm sorry to Kanye - it won't be him - but there is someone out there. HEADLEE: He's got other stuff going on. KIMBROUGH: He does. HEADLEE: Ayori, do we already have, out there, somewhere, our version - our African-American version of Steve Jobs? SELASSIE: Yes. Absolutely, we do. But guess what? We're not going to see the development in that African-American Steve Jobs if he's not being mentored. You know, Steve Jobs was mentored by, you know, a lot of amazing people including, you know, one of the CEOs of Intel and all sorts of other people. And what they do is they get in there, they work with you, they help you through these challenges and they share their network. They sponsor you, and they support you. And that's what we have to have. That's why that cross-cultural exchange is so important because if we don't start integrating, you know, and having real, you know, diversity and different people involved in our friendships and our relationships and in our companies, then we're not going to have that mentorship that we need that crosses the racial lines. HEADLEE: That's Ayori Selassie. She's cofounder and executive director of Pitch Mixer Entrepreneur Forum based in Oakland, California and a strategic advisor for Blacks in Tech. She joined us from a studio in San Francisco, California. Greg Greenlee is the founder of Blacks in Tech. It's a website dedicated to connecting African-Americans in the tech world. He joined us from member station WVXU in Cincinnati, Ohio. And we also heard from Walter Kimbrough, president of Dillard University. He joined us from member station WWNO in New Orleans. Thank you all for joining us. KIMBROUGH: Thanks. GREENLEE: Thank you. SELASSIE: Thank you. HEADLEE: Don't forget, we're looking for you to hook us up with more prominent African-Americans in the world of tech.

Up till now, Amazon has been stocking up on a manufacturer's products so that when you bought it on the website, Amazon could send it directly to you. would obtain the product from a manufacturer, then send it on to you. Amazon has been acting like a traditional retailer. Now the company is trying to have a product directly from the manufacturer's warehouse to your front door. NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports on an effort to make deliveries faster and cheaper. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Amazon's business is built on three basic concepts: faster delivery, greater selection and cheaper prices. In service of that, it's built enormous warehouses staffed largely by robots that shuttle around pulling goods out of bins at remarkable speed. From order to shipment can take a matter of minutes. And lately, it's pursuing a program where Amazon goes directly into manufacturers, and manages their logistics and online retailing. MARSHAL COHEN: It fits right into world domination for Amazon, because what this is doing is now allowing them to even broaden wider the scope of products that they're going to offer. NOGUCHI: Marshal Cohen is chief retail analyst for NPD Group. He says Amazon's so-called Vendor Flex program benefits manufacturers, because they can sell more of their products directly to consumers. And it gives Amazon a bigger warehouse footprint, enabling it to ship more goods faster. So again: more goods, faster, cheaper. COHEN: It's kind of like a win-win-win. There are three wins. NOGUCHI: For the manufacturer, Amazon, and the consumer. COHEN: The only ones that's not going to win are traditional brick and mortar retailers, which now have just gotten an additional competitor in categories that they've traditionally not had online competition in. NOGUCHI: Amazon declined to discuss the program. But it shocked Vendor Flex to various manufacturers, including Procter & Gamble. John Replogle is CEO of Seventh Generation, a cleaning products company that has worked with Amazon since the online retailer's early days. Although he declined comment about Vendor Flex, he says the company is thinking about new sales channels. JOHN REPLOGLE: I think the notion of what it means to be a big box is being redefined. NOGUCHI: Replogle says for his company, direct online sales make up a low, single-digit percentage of sales. But he expects it to double in the next few years, because fewer people want the traditional suburban experience of hauling bulky consumer products in their cars. REPLOGLE: If you look at the consumer today, it tends to be young and well-educated. And increasingly, you know, what they're doing is living in urban centers. You know, their shopping behavior is shifting increasingly to online and in urban centers. So, as we think about strategically how we position ourselves, we've got to move with that consumer. NOGUCHI: Walmart and others also realize that and are responding, by beefing up their online presence and delivery speeds. But retailers like Walmart also have a big advantage over purely online retailers. Namely, they have physical locations close to their consumers. Tom Forte is an Internet analyst with the Telsey Advisory Group. TOM FORTE: Walmart has a huge, much larger logistical footprint than Amazon. NOGUCHI: And by partnering with manufacturers, Amazon is essentially trying to expand its geographic footprint quickly, to get closer to the customer. Forte calls faster delivery the new frontier of Internet competition. EBay's eBay Now service is experimenting with delivery of goods in an hour, and Google's Shopping Express promises same-day delivery. FORTE: Amazon's adding fulfillment centers outside of major metropolitan areas. And eBay and Google are leveraging the retail stores within the major metros. So they should, at least in theory, be able to get the merchandise faster to the consumer than Amazon, which I think is a risk for Amazon. NOGUCHI: But Amazon, too, is running its own same-day delivery experiments in Seattle and Los Angeles. FORTE: The average consumer visits a grocery store 2. 2 times a week, so one of the reasons that Amazon is rolling out grocery is they want that frequency of purchase. NOGUCHI: And Forte says that's only skimming the surface of what's to come. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News, Washington. INSKEEP: It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News.

I'm Ira Flatow. Chances are, you're carrying a digital camera in your pocket right now. No, it's not - it's hard not to be carrying one. You know, they're built into even the cheapest Smartphones. But do you have any idea how it works? Back in the good ol' days and I mean, oh, 20 years ago, talking about the days of those big clunky film cameras, if you wanted to it wasn't hard to figure out how the camera worked. You just opened the back up. You could see the mirror, the shutter, the lens. Even saw where the film went across, you know, in the back there. It was easy to imagine how the image ended up on your film. These days, forget about it, as we say here in New York. But maybe my next guest can help demystify the digital camera for us. He's got a new kit for kids and adults that lets you build a digital camera and you learn as you go along. Yeah. Shree Nayar is a professor of computer science at Columbia University here in New York. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY Dr. Nayar. SHREE NAYAR: Thank you, Ira. A pleasure to be here. FLATOW: What was the idea for this camera? NAYAR: Well, the whole idea is we live in a time when all these gadgets that we use are, just like you said, highly mystified, very dense, very packed and you have really no idea what's going on inside. And soothe whole premise here was to demystify the working of the camera but not just that, not just to describe how a camera works, but use the camera which has tremendous appeal in society as a draw and redesign it so as to convey to the user as many science and engineering concepts as possible. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Now, it's called the Big Shot Camera Kit and for everyone who doesn't have one sitting in front of them right now, give us an idea of what this looks like, what it has in it. NAYAR: Well, it comes as a kit that you put together. Now, the idea here is not for an eight-year-old to necessarily solder all the parts together. There's a lot of precision engineering that goes on in a camera - the optics and the mechanics. So that would be unreasonable. On the other hand, the idea is to - at a time when things are mystified, like I said, to touch and feel all the underlying components and in the process get exposed to the underlying science concepts. And the design is such that we have included certain features that you wouldn't commonly find in other cameras. For example, it has a rechargeable battery but if you're out on a shoot and you happen to run out of charge, it also has a power generator that you can crank up manually and generate enough power to take a few photos. Now, as you can imagine, that's not a necessary component of a camera but it's been put in there on purpose so that we can describe to the user how the mechanics of a gearbox works, how electromagnetic induction works, which is the basis of motors and dynamos and so on. So there's many different features that one would commonly not find in other cameras but have been introduced in the design so as to use them as a pivot into these concepts. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Maybe you have one of these Big-Shot Camera Kits. Maybe you'd like to get one. How easy is it to build? It's got to be, you know, as you say, even a child can do it, but not too young a child. NAYAR: Well, it really is meant for a very wide audience. If it's an eight-year-old I think it would make a wonderful project with a parent or an older sibling. A teenager I think can do the entire thing by themselves. And then of course you also notice there's a very large community of camera enthusiasts who might also pick up a thing or two about cameras during the process. The entire build process would be somewhere between, I'd say, 30 minutes and an hour but during that process there is also an accompanying website that you can use to learn the underlying concepts. And this is where I think it's a little bit different from many of the science kits out there where you might put it together and play with it a bit and then you sort of move on. But here you have this website with educational material including a textbook which has nine different chapters and interactive demonstrations that help you visualize the underlying concepts. That's sort of unusual. So if you were so inclined you could just build it and use it, but if you were really interested you could come back again and again to the website and learn various concepts at different levels of depth. And in this website, some of the topics that we actually cover are those that would be commonly covered at a college level. And we've tried to make it accessible to a very young audience. But in terms. . . FLATOW: For example. . . NAYAR: . . . of build itself - yeah. Go ahead. FLATOW: For example, what kind of topics? NAYAR: For example. . . FLATOW: Are you talking about? NAYAR: . . . we talk about image processing. You know, I mean, if you think about image processing and how all the things within Photoshop look, for instance, that make images look better and change their geometric structure and distortions and all of that stuff, that's typically something we would cover in a university, but we've tried to explain those concepts in a very simple way on this website. FLATOW: Do you explain what's actually going on inside those big circuit boards? You know, people have no idea what those little boxes and lines and things. . . NAYAR: Yeah. FLATOW: . . . do on that. NAYAR: Especially these days. Yeah. Absolutely. FLATOW: Yeah. NAYAR: I mean, you know, this is the whole thing that - I  actually work in a computer science department and as you know we live in an age where software dominates. And the younger generation is getting very comfortable with that. But I do believe we want the next generation to also understand this stuff that software sits on top of. Get their hands dirty. And so what we've tried to do with electronics - now, of course, with the mechanics, the gearbox and the dynamo and the optics, we let them touch and feel all of that, but when it comes to memory chips and image sensors and input/output and USB works and so on, there's only so much you can go. You can't open these chips up. FLATOW: Yeah. NAYAR: But what we have tried to do on the website is have a layout where all the steps that take place from the minute that you hit the shoot button to the capture of the image, the storage, and its display on the screen, all of those things are displayed and shown in a very visual way. You can follow the steps corresponding to each line of software code that sits on the camera. And so we've really tried our best to try and, you know, make this as visual as possible. FLATOW: Now that you've given us all - you've whet out appetite about building this camera, can you give us a thumbnail sketch of how a standard digital camera works? Instead of film, how does a digital camera capture an image? NAYAR: Well, I mean, as you know if you've bought one of these, it's turned into recently a very complex beast. But I'll boil it down to two very important components. The first component is the lens, of course. The lens, the main purpose of it is to capture as much light as possible and then create behind the lens an image of the scene in front of the lens which is as sharp as possible. To focus light onto a plane. And that technology has evolved, really, over centuries. But where I think there's been very rapid evolution is the image sensor - or the electronic image sensor that's replaced film. And it's a chip. And this chip has on it millions and millions of little pixels. And these pixels are really buckets that collect light - photons - and then convert them into electrons. And once they have converted them into electrons, then these millions of different measurements have to be read out. And so the chip works really hard at reading these things out in as faithful a manner as possible. In fact, these image sensors have become so sophisticated that they're even able to enhance the quality of the image, remove graininess, make the colors more vivid, and maybe even compress the image for more efficient storage all within the chip. So we're talking about a chip that might be few tens of milligrams in weight that's able to do things that a large computer couldn't do 20 years ago. And that's where, you know, a lot of the innovation has taken place. So I'll just boil it down to those two major components. FLATOW: Yeah. Yeah. You know, being an old film person myself, I remember in film and I used to work in a darkroom and do all that kind of hobby stuff. That in film there were different color emulsions on the film itself. How do you get different colors on the chip? NAYAR: Interesting question because you - I mean, at the end of the day, you can essentially measure one color at each pixel. So what you do is you have different colors being measured by neighboring pixels. So if I'm measuring red then my neighbors are measuring green and blue. And then you put all of that together using image processing techniques. It's a technique called demosaicing. And that's how - that's very different from the way color works. I mean, sorry, film works. FLATOW: Yeah. NAYAR: But that's how digital image sensors create a color range. FLATOW: All right. Let's go to the phones, 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to Philly. Eva in Philadelphia, hi. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. EVA: Hi. Thank you very much for a very interesting program. I know two boys and two men who would love putting together one of these cameras, especially thinking about them for the holidays. Where may I purchase them? NAYAR: We have a website which is bigshotcamera. com. EVA: Big Shot? NAYAR: Bigshot. Bigshot. EVA: OKNAYAR: B-I-G-S-H-O-T. Which is a play on words. It's the idea of exposing kids to these concepts and turning them into bigshots. EVA: Good. NAYAR: So bigshotcamera is one word, dot com. And the camera is available there online to buy. EVA: Wonderful. FLATOW: Eva, do you. . . EVA: How much is it? NAYAR: It's $89. EVA: Wonderful. OK. Thank you so very much for a very, very. . . FLATOW: Are your kids. . . EVA: . . interesting information. I love it. FLATOW: Are your kids hobbyists? They like to build stuff? EVA: Well, I've tried to teach them as much as possible about scientific things and make them immediate for them. So yes. FLATOW: Yeah. EVA: Sometimes they like to build stuff. Sometimes they like to read about stuff. It depends. FLATOW: Yeah. All right. Thanks for calling. 3EVA: Thank you very much. NAYAR: Thank you. EVA: As always, an interesting show. FLATOW: You're welcome. Thanks. 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Let's see if we can go to Jacob in Valdosta, Georgia. Hi, Jacob. JACOB: Hi. Thanks for taking my call. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Go ahead. JACOB: My question is what sets this kit apart from other DIY electronics hobby kits and how do you plan on getting these into the hands of, I don't know, students and people who might be interested. I've noticed that the market is saturated with all sorts of DIY projects kits but, you know, what's the plan to get more people interested? FLATOW: Yeah. You've got all these maker kits and things like that, old Radio Shack stuff. NAYAR: So let me start with your first question. I think that's a really interesting one. There's lots of fascinating kits out there. There's robots and there's circuits that can build. One of the things that we find that's really interesting about Big Shot is that because of the inherent nature of the camera itself, it allows you to juxtapose the sciences and the arts. So, you know, you learn and you build and you learn these science concepts but once you're done you have a fully functioning digital camera with which you walk into the world of photograph and storytelling and documentation. And that's the art. So as a teacher or a parent or just a student, you can imagine getting both these experiences within a single process and that's somewhat unusual. In terms of getting this in the hands of kids, I mean, you know, we have a lot of various conversations that we're having such as this one and hopefully the word will get out and people will get to know about it. But one of the things that we are doing is that a part of the royalties that we get from the sales of cameras, we're using it to gift cameras to highly underprivileged kids in various parts of the world. We think that that's an important piece of the mission and hopefully as we do well on sales we'll also be able to live out that aspect or position. FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. Talking with Shree Nayar who is professor of computer science at Columbia University here in New York. Why the camera? Why not part of the phone or something? NAYAR: Well, once again, I mean, it's - you know, it comes down the fact that the camera is really a unique piece of technology. It allows us to express ourselves, to communicate with each other. Using it is an emotional experience. There really are very few other things like it. I mean, I'm certainly thinking about other gadgets we might be able to use, but is very special. And so we thought this would be the ideal one to start off with, but also in part because my lab at Columbia does quite a bit of work in computer vision and new types of cameras. So there was also a natural fit there. FLATOW: Speaking of your lab art, are you working on new types of cameras? What. . . NAYAR: So. . . FLATOW: Things that might be different? NAYAR: Yeah. This line of work really started in the mid-'90s when we were interested in building cameras that would create three-dimensional depth images, panoramic images, high dynamic range images that give you more brightness in colors, more colors than red, green, and blue. So these are very, I would say, more on the high end application side of things. And maybe about seven or eight years ago I started thinking about how we could leverage what we know about cameras to make a social impact, a broader social impact, and that was the genesis of Big Shot. FLATOW: So are these cameras sort of discounted from where they might be? Are you trying to keep the price down on them or--? NAYAR: We have worked very hard to keep the price down. And, in fact, one of the reasons we sell online is because we do cut out certain parts of the pipeline and we are able to control the costs. And, of course, whenever you have a product that comes out initially, it's typically made in smaller quantities and therefore the price is difficult to control. But at $89, if you compare it with many other kits out there, and the fact that after you're done you actually have a fully functioning device that you can use on a daily basis, I think. . . FLATOW: Yeah. NAYAR: . . . plus the website that adds quite a bit of value, I think it's fine and we'll see where things go from here. FLATOW: How do you get the images off the camera? Do you plug it in to your laptop? NAYAR: It's just - yeah. There's a memory chip on the camera itself. You plug it in using USB. FLATOW: Ah. NAYAR: And in fact, there's a piece of software. The camera takes three types of pictures: a regular shot, a panoramic or wide angled shot, and then the third one is interesting. It captures an anaglyph which allows you to wear red-green glasses and see what you've shot in 3D. And as you can imagine, that's interesting for. . . FLATOW: Yeah. NAYAR: . . . kids and grownups. And so. . . FLATOW: Thank you. NAYAR: . . . the software knows which type of photo has been captured and processes it and produces the final image for you. FLATOW: Huh. What about the maker movement? You know, the maker fair people, people who show up there? Isn't that sort of doing what you've done with this camera but more on a grassroots scale? NAYAR: Absolutely. I mean, we just had a maker fair last month here in New York and it's a huge movement and one that I'm extremely excited about. A lot of educators around the world have talked about how making not only fosters learning and creativity but also really makes kids happy. And I would say that the same arguments apply to grownups as well. It's really, really important. One of the things that we have tried to do here is sort of go the extra mile, which is ask the question is making enough. Because a lot of the concepts that we're talking about are based on very strict laws of nature. You know, let's call them fundamentals. And these fundamentals, of course, cannot be gained in their full glory through purely making. And I think making is a piece of it and then after that there's the educational material that comes with it. FLATOW: And you can get the camera where? You can get the camera. The website is? NAYAR: It's bigshotcamera. com. Bigshotcamera one word, yeah. FLATOW: All right. Yeah. We have it on our website also. Thank you, Shree. NAYAR: Thank you so much. FLATOW: For taking time to be with us. NAYAR: My pleasure. FLATOW: Shree Nayar is professor of computer science at Columbia University here in New York. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) IRA FLATOW, HOST:  This is SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. Chances are, you're carrying a digital camera in your pocket right now. No, it's not - it's hard not to be carrying one. You know, they're built into even the cheapest Smartphones. But do you have any idea how it works? Back in the good ol' days and I mean, oh, 20 years ago, talking about the days of those big clunky film cameras, if you wanted to it wasn't hard to figure out how the camera worked. You just opened the back up. You could see the mirror, the shutter, the lens. Even saw where the film went across, you know, in the back there. It was easy to imagine how the image ended up on your film. These days, forget about it, as we say here in New York. But maybe my next guest can help demystify the digital camera for us. He's got a new kit for kids and adults that lets you build a digital camera and you learn as you go along. Yeah. Shree Nayar is a professor of computer science at Columbia University here in New York. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY Dr. Nayar. SHREE NAYAR: Thank you, Ira. A pleasure to be here. FLATOW: What was the idea for this camera? NAYAR: Well, the whole idea is we live in a time when all these gadgets that we use are, just like you said, highly mystified, very dense, very packed and you have really no idea what's going on inside. And soothe whole premise here was to demystify the working of the camera but not just that, not just to describe how a camera works, but use the camera which has tremendous appeal in society as a draw and redesign it so as to convey to the user as many science and engineering concepts as possible. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Now, it's called the Big Shot Camera Kit and for everyone who doesn't have one sitting in front of them right now, give us an idea of what this looks like, what it has in it. NAYAR: Well, it comes as a kit that you put together. Now, the idea here is not for an eight-year-old to necessarily solder all the parts together. There's a lot of precision engineering that goes on in a camera - the optics and the mechanics. So that would be unreasonable. On the other hand, the idea is to - at a time when things are mystified, like I said, to touch and feel all the underlying components and in the process get exposed to the underlying science concepts. And the design is such that we have included certain features that you wouldn't commonly find in other cameras. For example, it has a rechargeable battery but if you're out on a shoot and you happen to run out of charge, it also has a power generator that you can crank up manually and generate enough power to take a few photos. Now, as you can imagine, that's not a necessary component of a camera but it's been put in there on purpose so that we can describe to the user how the mechanics of a gearbox works, how electromagnetic induction works, which is the basis of motors and dynamos and so on. So there's many different features that one would commonly not find in other cameras but have been introduced in the design so as to use them as a pivot into these concepts. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Maybe you have one of these Big-Shot Camera Kits. Maybe you'd like to get one. How easy is it to build? It's got to be, you know, as you say, even a child can do it, but not too young a child. NAYAR: Well, it really is meant for a very wide audience. If it's an eight-year-old I think it would make a wonderful project with a parent or an older sibling. A teenager I think can do the entire thing by themselves. And then of course you also notice there's a very large community of camera enthusiasts who might also pick up a thing or two about cameras during the process. The entire build process would be somewhere between, I'd say, 30 minutes and an hour but during that process there is also an accompanying website that you can use to learn the underlying concepts. And this is where I think it's a little bit different from many of the science kits out there where you might put it together and play with it a bit and then you sort of move on. But here you have this website with educational material including a textbook which has nine different chapters and interactive demonstrations that help you visualize the underlying concepts. That's sort of unusual. So if you were so inclined you could just build it and use it, but if you were really interested you could come back again and again to the website and learn various concepts at different levels of depth. And in this website, some of the topics that we actually cover are those that would be commonly covered at a college level. And we've tried to make it accessible to a very young audience. But in terms. . . FLATOW: For example. . . NAYAR: . . . of build itself - yeah. Go ahead. FLATOW: For example, what kind of topics? NAYAR: For example. . . FLATOW: Are you talking about?

FLATOW: Do you explain what's actually going on inside those big circuit boards? You know, people have no idea what those little boxes and lines and things. . . NAYAR: Yeah. FLATOW: . . . do on that.

I'm Audie Cornish, this week at NPR West in California. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: And I'm Melissa Block in Washington, D. C. (SOUNDBITE OF BELL RINGING)BLOCK: Ringing the bell to open trading on the New York Stock Exchange today, @SirPatStew, @vivienneharr and @CherylFiandaca - all of them big users of Twitter - to mark the day the social networking site became a publicly traded company. CORNISH: @SirPatStew is Sir Patrick Stewart of \"Star Trek\" fame. Nine-year-old Vivienne Harr used Twitter to spread awareness of child slavery. And Cheryl Fiandaca is a spokeswoman with the Boston Police Department. She relied on Twitter during the Boston Marathon bombing in April to share key updates with the public. BLOCK: Well, after trading started, Twitter stock shot up from the initial price of $26 per share to more than $45, and it stayed there for most of the trading day, closing within pennies at $44. 90. NPR's Steve Henn joins us now from Silicon Valley to walk us through the details. And, Steve, how do you explain why Twitter stock traded so high above the initial price? STEVE HENN, BYLINE: Well, basically, it's a function of supply and demand. Twitter has become a cultural force. The pope tweets, President Obama tweets. We talk about tweets and hashtags on the air all the time. BLOCK: We do. (LAUGHTER)HENN: So hundreds of millions of people use Twitter. Billions of people know about it. But in the end, Twitter actually didn't end up selling that much stock. It offered just 70 million shares. That's 13 percent of the total company. And so while interest in Twitter is enormous, the supply of stock was kind of tiny. And that mismatch between supply and demand seems to be driving the price more than earnings or Twitter's business fundamentals. A lot of investing professionals I've spoken with about this said that this is all by design. They expect Twitter to come back to Wall Street and try to issue more stock a few months from now or a few years from now. And they say Twitter is trying to create goodwill among investors, generate some excitement about its stock so that later, people are eager to invest again. BLOCK: So, Steve, a basic question here. Twitter yesterday was selling stock for $26 a share to big investors. If I as, you know, Joe Schmo or Jolyn Schmo wanted in on that great deal, would I be out of luck? HENN: Yeah. I mean, basically, the people who got to buy at that price are people who participate in new IPOs all the time. Twitter really ran kind of an old fashioned IPO, and that meant that retail investors, people like you or me who might be fans of the company or interested in buying the stock, really didn't get a chance to buy anything until shares started trading basically at $45 a share this morning. And the thing to remember about all that is the people who were selling the stock this morning are the same folks who bought it last night at that low price. So while Twitter raised close to $2 billion in its IPO to finance its growth, Wall Street's big investment funds made roughly $1. 5 billion in just a matter of minutes this morning. BLOCK: Wow. HENN: Yeah. But, you know, if you're still interested in the stock, now you can go to your broker. And if you're willing to pay, you know, $45 a share, you can go ahead and do it. BLOCK: OK. Well, what does Twitter's business model look like today as opposed to the market for its stock? Is it believable that the company can generate the kind of revenue and the profits that it would need to justify the share price? HENN: It's possible. Plausible might be a bit of a stretch. I mean, Twitter makes a lot of its money from advertising but it's tiny in comparison to its biggest competitors, Google and Facebook. You know, they measure their audience in billions and Twitter is just a fraction of that. BLOCK: OK. NPR technology correspondent Steve Henn. Steve, thanks. HENN: My pleasure. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Audie Cornish, this week at NPR West in California. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:  And I'm Melissa Block in Washington, D. C. (SOUNDBITE OF BELL RINGING) BLOCK: Ringing the bell to open trading on the New York Stock Exchange today, @SirPatStew, @vivienneharr and @CherylFiandaca - all of them big users of Twitter - to mark the day the social networking site became a publicly traded company. CORNISH: @SirPatStew is Sir Patrick Stewart of \"Star Trek\" fame. Nine-year-old Vivienne Harr used Twitter to spread awareness of child slavery. And Cheryl Fiandaca is a spokeswoman with the Boston Police Department. She relied on Twitter during the Boston Marathon bombing in April to share key updates with the public. BLOCK: Well, after trading started, Twitter stock shot up from the initial price of $26 per share to more than $45, and it stayed there for most of the trading day, closing within pennies at $44. 90. NPR's Steve Henn joins us now from Silicon Valley to walk us through the details. And, Steve, how do you explain why Twitter stock traded so high above the initial price? STEVE HENN, BYLINE: Well, basically, it's a function of supply and demand. Twitter has become a cultural force. The pope tweets, President Obama tweets. We talk about tweets and hashtags on the air all the time. BLOCK: We do. (LAUGHTER) HENN: So hundreds of millions of people use Twitter. Billions of people know about it. But in the end, Twitter actually didn't end up selling that much stock. It offered just 70 million shares. That's 13 percent of the total company. And so while interest in Twitter is enormous, the supply of stock was kind of tiny.

There's been criticism along with the celebration, though. Among other things, it's hard to ignore that Twitter has no women on its board, and only one among its executive officers. Facebook, too, was criticized when they went public last year with an all-male board of directors. Women represent a small fraction of engineers, investors and executives in the industry, and the absence is striking when it comes to companies like Facebook and Twitter. At the same time, a recent study from the Pew Research Center found that women are more likely than men to use social media. With me to talk about women in the tech industry is Randi Zuckerberg. She's the CEO of Zuckerberg Media, the former marketing director for Facebook, and the sister of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. She's also the author of a new book, \"Dot Complicated: Untangling Our Wired Lives. \" Randi Zuckerberg, welcome. RANDI ZUCKERBERG: Thank you. It's great to be here. RATH: So you started out in Silicon Valley at Facebook, in its very early days. In your book, you say one of the biggest challenges was being thought of as a roadie. And I don't think that means what I would've thought it meant, originally. ZUCKERBERG: That's right. I joined Facebook in 2005. It was still very much kind of a \"brogrammer\" culture, if you will; very, very few women, especially in senior positions. And it was definitely a bit of a fight, especially as a nontechnical employee, to be heard at the same level in Silicon Valley. RATH: You know, Randi, there's a paradox here that these are technology companies, right? And they're the most forward-looking entities that you could think of. And they're so backwards in this way, in terms of female representation. Do you think that is a paradox, and why is it so dramatic? ZUCKERBERG: It's certainly a paradox. I think there's a few things going on here. First of all, when you look at some of the top universities in sciences, math, engineering, you're seeing 90 percent male in those graduation rates. So the issue is starting - it's not even on the corporate level. The issue is starting on the high school and the college level, I think, is where we need to start looking at it; where we need to start encouraging women to go into these professions a lot more. I think at the corporate level, things have changed for the better quite a bit in the almost 10 years that I've been in Silicon Valley. Obviously, there's still a lot of work that needs to be done there in order to make sure that the user base, which many of these companies is majority female, is being represented on the senior level. RATH: If we got to that level, if we got better representation - more women executives, more women engineers - how do you think things would be different? ZUCKERBERG: It's interesting because when you look at a company like Pinterest, Pinterest didn't grow out of super tech users in Silicon Valley. It didn't grow because the traditional investors were throwing money at it. It grew because it hit a nerve with women in the middle of the country. Now, I think in a situation where you have more female investors, female engineers, women in more powerful positions in Silicon Valley, they're poised to better identify opportunities like that first, and help expand them more quickly. I do think we've seen a lot of progress in the past few years on seeing more women step into leadership in entrepreneurial roles. And you're starting to see the traditional male VC firms taking a look at companies that are more traditionally targeted to women. RATH: Which is another thing that - you know, venture capitalists, the vast majority are male. ZUCKERBERG: That's right. I think that it takes time to shift norms. When you have this ecosystem where all the top graduates coming into the system are male, all of the investors are male, all the leaders are male, they're thinking of things in a very narrow way. Suddenly, when you start to introduce women in powerful positions into the mix, when you start to introduce minorities in powerful positions into the mix, you suddenly start getting this much richer ecosystem of startups and consumers that you can reach. RATH: Your new book, \"Dot Complicated,\" it's about how technology and social media have infiltrated our lives, and how to learn when we need to disconnect - which seems like, you know, obviously, it seems like a funny thing coming from you, Randi Zuckerberg. ZUCKERBERG: It definitely - I can definitely see how it seems ironic coming from someone with the last name Zuckerberg. But I do think when you look at the early stages of social media, people didn't really understand yet, at that point, that these services were mostly powerful for connecting to people you already knew. Suddenly, we're at this point where we've realized, gosh, it's overwhelming to keep in touch with hundreds or thousands of people we don't know very well. And in fact, it's taking us away from our lives, from our enjoyment of the people right next to us. So I think we're seeing a backlash. People are trying to reclaim a bit of their time, their sanity; and be less overwhelmed by technology. RATH: Randi Zuckerberg is the founder and CEO of Zuckerberg Media. She's also the author of two new books, \"Dot\" and \"Dot Complicated: Untangling our Wired Lives. \" Randi, thank you. ZUCKERBERG: Thank you very much.

Now it's time to take a visit to the Beauty Shop. That's where our panel of women commentators and journalists get a fresh cut on the week's hot topics. Sitting in the chairs for a new 'do this week are Demetria Lucas. She is a contributing editor for TheRoot. com and author of \"A Belle in Brooklyn: The Go-To Girl for Advice on Living Your Best Life. \" She's with us from New York. With us from NPR West is Anne Ishii. She's a freelance writer and translator. She's also editor-in-chief of \"They're All So Beautiful. \" That's an online forum that looks at race and dating. With us from Philadelphia is Veronica Miller. She writes about fashion and race for xoJane. com. She's a former member of the TELL ME MORE staff. And with us from North Carolina is Deonna Kelli Sayed. She's a freelance writer and editor of the website LoveInshallah. com. Ladies, thank you all so much for joining us. DEMETRIA LUCAS: Thank you for having me. DEONNA KELLI SAYED: Hi. Thank you. ANNE ISHII: Thank you. MARTIN: And, you know, I kind of understand why people might be thinking, you know, war, famine, natural disaster - why are we talking about this? Well, a recent Pew study found that online dating is a significant - an increasingly significant and an already significant part of people's social lives now. And a recent Pew study found that millions of people are pursuing romance in this relatively new way through online dating. But it turns out they're bringing a lot of old ideas about race with them. The dating site AreYouInterested. com analyzed more than 2 million interactions on their site. They have something like 75 million installations of the site, which means 75 million people have at least signed up for the site. And they found that - analyzing these interactions - that Asian women are more likely to get a message from a man of any race, unless those men are Asian. And the analysis also found that white men are pursued the most by women of all races except black women. And black women are the least likely to get a message from anybody. And this tracks with findings from previous surveys. For example, a researcher at the University of California San Diego analyzed messages by the site OKCupid, which has also done similar surveys. So we really wanted to talk about this. So I'll start with you, Anne Ishii. Your site \"They're All So Beautiful\" takes on some of these issues. And you say the findings don't surprise you. But you also say there's kind of an ick factor to this. Why don't you talk about that? ISHII: Yeah. I mean, you know, this is purely personal anecdotal evidence, but I don't know a single Asian-American woman who hasn't been addressed or cat called or hit on based on her ethnicity. And, you know, like, I personally get a lot of ni hao's and sort of Chinese oriented things. And I don't know what's more offensive - that they've called me out for being Asian, or the fact that I'm not Chinese, you know? So it's like, OK, get it right. But then if they do, then it's not like it's any better, but. . . MARTIN: Do they think it's flattering? Is that supposed to be flattering. . . ISHII: Yeah, actually. MARTIN: . . . Or appealing to you? ISHII: Absolutely. It sounds, 9 times out of 10, like they want to impress me with their quote-unquote tolerance for something. Oh, I actually love sushi - it's like, you know, welcome to the 21st century. MARTIN: Well, so do I. And I'm not Asian, I have to say. So, Veronica, you've told us that you've actually tried online dating. And this kind of tracks with what you've experienced yourself. You say that, you know, you've been approached online by men of all races. But what is that experience like? Do you find it flattering, not? VERONICA MILLER: It can be flattering, but then it's the weird thing when you get on to that first date. I found that I've sat across a man who's white or who's Latino or who's Asian, and I always get to the moment in the date where they're trying to prove how down they are. And so they ask me questions like, who's better, Tupac and Biggie? And I'm always like, well, I listened to Spice Girls when that happened, so I don't really know. Or, you know, or accosting me 'cause I hadn't seen \"The Princess and the Frog\" when it had come out - the Disney movie. And saying, what are you doing, it's Disney's first black princess. And I'm like, yeah, I was probably working. But it was just this weird thing of trying to connect, but not really having much to connect on and saying, well, maybe I'll impress her with my black card. MARTIN: Interesting. What about you, Deonna Sayed? What about you? SAYED: Well, my story's a little different. I'm a white woman, but I'm a Muslim. And I've encountered some really interesting scenarios in the online dating world. I actually reached out to one guy that, you know, he was local and I just wanted to say hello, what's up. And he responded immediately by saying, I've been to the Middle East and I really have zero interest in you because of your religion. So, you know, I'm othered - even though I'm white, I'm othered because I have a face that people perceive as being foreign. MARTIN: Did you find that - how did you respond to that? I mean, on the one hand, one might say I - is it wrong for somebody to say, I'm not interested in dating outside my religion because, for whatever reason, I mean. But what - how did you interpret that? SAYED: Well, I just don't respond to stupid. So I left it at that. (LAUGHTER)MARTIN: OK. Now, Demetria, you write about dating and relationships. What do you make of all this? LUCAS: You know, I'm actually happy for Asian women, that they're actually getting some attention, you know, online. So many people go online and they have such terrible stories, so, you know, it's good that Asian women are winning in some respect. I do, however, think that it's for the wrong reasons. As all the other women have said, it seems that there's sort of a fetishizing of Asian women here. You know, probably throwing out some model minority ideas, or some, you know, some geisha, or something like that, ideas. And they think that all Asian women adhere to that. So that's where it's a huge problem. And it's unfortunate that the ignorance of the outside world, you know, it doesn't go away when it gets online. And perhaps it actually gets worse. MARTIN: Anne, do you think that that's true? ISHII: Yeah. Absolutely. MARTIN: Do you think some of this is kind of fetishizing? ISHII: Yeah. I mean, I have only to point out that stupid music video of Asian girls - I don't know if you all remember - that came out a couple months or few months ago. But there's this idea that, you know - the old school mentality is that, yeah, we absolutely represent some sort of meek ideal, even if it's just that subconscious level. There's this idea of the geisha, or the concubine or, you know, like a submissive wife and whatever. You know, the unfortunate thing, I think, is that Asian-American women have to prove themselves against that stereotype by outperforming as, you know, oh, we're actually quite aggressive or, you know, we have to actually counterbalance that some way. And it just makes it really difficult for us to be ourselves. MARTIN: Veronica, you were telling us that you actually find these surveys distressing. And you wonder why people keep actually doing them at all. MILLER: It's - yeah. It's not very encouraging if you are a woman of color dating online because if you're an Asian woman, as the women have already said, you're worried about somebody fetishizing you and telling you how much, you know, he loves karate. Or if you're a black woman, you're like, nobody likes me. You're kind of like the unpopular kid at the party. So it's like - I wonder why these studies keep being released and promoted because it's not terribly encouraging. MARTIN: Well, I think I can make an argument that it is, in part, that there's just more interest in wondering whether - if you're willing to go outside the traditional boundary of having to know someone to introduce you, are you willing to go outside of other boundaries? I mean, that might be an argument. In fact, there's an interesting thing, the - this study that I read about - online, of course - it said that users from all racial backgrounds are equally likely or more likely to cross a racial boundary when reciprocating than when initiating romantic conduct. I mean, contact, rather. This was in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that utilized online dating data from OkCupid. And it says that, you know, if somebody is messaged by someone of a different race, they're more likely to respond even if they don't reach out themselves. And the researchers speculated that maybe it's because people are kind of used to the idea that they might be rejected, so they kind of stick to their own corner. But that if somebody else reaches out, they're likely to reciprocate. So could it be a question of, are you willing to expand your options like that? MILLER: I think - yeah. I think that's a fair question. I think the men I responded to - I don't message anyone, when I was dating online. I didn't message anybody. I just waited for a message to come to me 'cause I'm a girl and that's how I operate. But when the men did message me, and if they did seem interesting, I did respond. You know, it was kind of interesting to see that it was a more diverse pool than I was used to. MARTIN: Overall, can I just ask each of you, are you encouraged or discouraged by what you're hearing about - or even experienced yourself - about online dating? Deonna, maybe I'll start with you. You just think what? SAYED: I. . . MARTIN: Go ahead. SAYED: Well, I'm a little discouraged because I think being - I'm 40 years old. I don't know how old everyone else is. But being at this age, and when you're working full-time and you have a child, you don't have a lot of time to hang out with losers. I mean, you need to know that the person you're going to spend time with, even if it's not romantically successful, at least you're going to get something out of it. You're going to enjoy the person. And I think it's really discouraging if you do have - if you are othered in some way or considered a minority, then do you really have time for all this? MARTIN: Have you met anybody nice online? SAYED: I've met a few people. I have met a few nice people, but no one that I felt I could really have a second date with. MARTIN: Anne, what about you? Are you ultimately encouraged or discouraged by what you're seeing about the dating scene with the addition of the online piece? ISHII: Right. I mean, as a consummate, monogamous, you know, serial monogamist, as they say, and somebody who's never done online dating, I guess I'm sort of encouraged at the metalevel, where it encourages a lot of discussion. I think it's actually kind of a strange privilege that women of, you know, my ethnic extraction or Asian women altogether are able to talk about this so that it explores sexuality in general because, you know, it's obviously not just a binary. I think a lot about the things I hear from gay Asian men and, you know, I mean, their experience is a little bit more similar to, I think, what Deonna is talking about, where it's just a categorical kibosh just because they're Asian. And so, you know, those things sort of being icky or unsavory, notwithstanding, just the ability for all of us to talk about all of it, I think, is really the only silver lining in the quote-unquote fetishism. MARTIN: Demetria, what about you? LUCAS: Yeah. I think it's very disheartening, especially for African-American women, just because, like a previous commenter said, every study comes out - they always do the same study. It always gets the same result. And it's always about how no one's reaching out for black women. Black women are rejected. And just as a black woman who, you know, is having a hard time dating in that realm, like, I totally get it. It's like, so, in person it's a problem. Online it's a problem. Like, it can get very depressing for someone who's looking for love. MARTIN: I'm sorry I brought it up, then. I'm sorry. LUCAS: Oh, no. I'm engaged but. . . (LAUGHTER)MARTIN: Oh, congratulations. That's wonderful. LUCAS: Thank you, thank you. But no, I'm just thinking of my - like, I'm a life coach. So I'm speak of my clients. And, you know, there's a real frustration out there about, like, well, you know, black guys have issues with black women. And then white guys have issues. And then Asian guys have issues. Like, it's like, who's looking to love us? And so just another study coming out and sort of reinforcing what's already been said a million times before - it can be very disheartening. MARTIN: Well, the one thing I will say about the study - it said that people from all ethnic groups seem to not want to be pursuing people from their own ethnic group. I mean, it said that Asian men are not the top responders to Asian women on these sites. That's kind of interesting. And it also said that, you know, white women are the ones who respond most often to white men. But other than that, it seems like everybody's kind of confused. I don't know that that makes anybody feel better. But if you're just joining us, we're in our Beauty Shop. We're catching up on the week's hot topics with Demetria Lucas of TheRoot. com, Anne Ishii of TheyreAllSoBeautiful. com, writer Veronica Miller, and blogger Deonna Kelli Sayed. Well, you know what, this isn't going to make anybody feel better, either. But the web isn't a place just to find a mate. Apparently, it's also a place now where people are airing their dirty laundry. And there's a website called - actually, there are two. There's a website called ShesAHomewrecker. com that allows partners to air their grievances against, you know, women who they say have interfered in their relationships. And there's also a he's a homewrecker site. And I just - Demetria, why don't I start with you on this. What do you think about this? LUCAS: You know, I saw that segment - I want to say it was on ABC last week, like, after \"Scandal,\" oddly enough. And, you know, I get it on some level, how these women, you know, they want revenge. They feel wronged. But what I couldn't understand, like, there's so much anger directed at the other woman, but not at the husband. Like, one women very specifically said, you know, like, he left me with three kids and now he's living with this woman. And, you know, they have a child together. And she said that she would forgive her husband, but there was no way she was forgiving that woman, or taking that information down from the site. And I'm like, your husband is the one that took vows for you. And just like he lied to you, he probably lied to this other woman, too. Like, he probably told her, you know, oh, I'm going to leave my wife and I'm unhappy. And I'm only there for the kids. And this woman's thinking something entirely different. He didn't really tell her that, you know, I like being with my wife and I like being with you. And I can't choose, and I'll only do so because you make me. I'm just a horrible person. But I'm like, you're not - we're directing all this energy to the other woman, but what about the man? I feel like he's getting let off the hook here. MARTIN: They get their own site, though. What do you think, Veronica? MILLER: You ever scroll Facebook and you come across someone's status who - someone has a really personal, depressing, melancholy status and then you're uncomfortable because you're like, that was really too much information. Now I'm sad. That's what I feel like when I read about these sites. I question the merit of even airing your dirty laundry like that in the first place. Like, I understand it's a release and, you know, it's a highly emotionally charged situation and people want to talk about it. But that's what your girlfriends are for. That's what your sisters and your cousins are for. You know, you can call them up and, you know, go on a hoo-ride and handle it that way. But I don't know if posting it publicly on the Internet is productive, or if it has any benefit for anybody involved. MARTIN: Maybe, other than - I don't know. It seems to be therapeutic for some people. They seem to feel better. I don't know. Anne, what do you think? ISHII: I hate to play devil's advocate, but I have to say two of my favorite shows are \"Cheaters\" and \"Catfish. \" And there's little bit of the getting the rug pulled out from under your feet feeling when you see somebody get caught. And, you know, I actually enjoy that as entertainment. I tend to agree that it's really depressing to see it online when it's, you know, it comes directly from the so-called victim. Who's slut-shaming, as it were. But I have to say, I mean, at least when it's on television and it looks sort of more like, you know, professional wrestling - it looks staged. But I just love how corny it is and how emotional people get when there's a camera in front of them. And they're in nothing but, you know, a bed sheet. MARTIN: Deonna, what about you? What do you think? SAYED: Well, I think the whole thing is little bit 8th grade because you're not just hurting the person who committed, or who may have approached the husband or the wife, but you're also hurting, potentially, children who may get wind of it. And it's just - and we don't know the context of what was happening in the marriage and what deficiencies may have already been in place. I just - I feel it's inappropriate to handle things that way. It is slut-shaming. And it's hurtful to many more people involved. MARTIN: What about the man? What about the he's a homewrecker site? I mean, one of the things that I found interesting in reading the comments there is that there were a lot of people who felt that these men were serial predators. And that was why they were enjoying calling them out. They said, oh, he knew how to get exactly what he wanted, that kind of thing. I mean, is there kind of a double standard here, where the men are always perceived to be in charge of the interaction, and the woman is always kind of the - I don't know. I mean, help me out here. ISHII: Yeah, I. . . MARTIN: Go ahead. SAYED: I think it's wrong on both counts. I think it's wrong on both counts. People deserve a little bit of dignity, even when they screw up. MARTIN: OK. Anne, what do you think? I'll give you the final word on this. ISHII: I totally agree, except that with men, unfortunately, I don't think slut-shaming works. So, you know, that's the other thing is if it really is about vengeance, you know, their dignity notwithstanding, if somebody really wants to hurt them, I don't think calling them, well, maybe predator is a little bit more offensive. But a homewrecker I doubt really does anything to their ego. MARTIN: Well, I'm sorry I couldn't make this a more uplifting Beauty Shop, ladies. Can we go out on a positive note? I'm happy for all the good stuff going on your life. You are all fabulous. LUCAS: Thank you. SAYED: Thank you. MARTIN: Well-read and interesting and smart. And if any of you are kind of unattached and looking, there's some very fine women right here who, I think, would appreciate interesting conversation and an elegant date. No, you know, fetishizing allowed here. LUCAS: That's important. MARTIN: That's right.

MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  I'm Michel Martin and this is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. Now it's time to take a visit to the Beauty Shop. That's where our panel of women commentators and journalists get a fresh cut on the week's hot topics. Sitting in the chairs for a new 'do this week are Demetria Lucas. She is a contributing editor for TheRoot. com and author of \"A Belle in Brooklyn: The Go-To Girl for Advice on Living Your Best Life. \" She's with us from New York. With us from NPR West is Anne Ishii. She's a freelance writer and translator. She's also editor-in-chief of \"They're All So Beautiful. \" That's an online forum that looks at race and dating. With us from Philadelphia is Veronica Miller. She writes about fashion and race for xoJane. com. She's a former member of the TELL ME MORE staff. And with us from North Carolina is Deonna Kelli Sayed. She's a freelance writer and editor of the website LoveInshallah. com. Ladies, thank you all so much for joining us. DEMETRIA LUCAS: Thank you for having me. DEONNA KELLI SAYED: Hi. Thank you. ANNE ISHII: Thank you. MARTIN: And, you know, I kind of understand why people might be thinking, you know, war, famine, natural disaster - why are we talking about this? Well, a recent Pew study found that online dating is a significant - an increasingly significant and an already significant part of people's social lives now. And a recent Pew study found that millions of people are pursuing romance in this relatively new way through online dating. But it turns out they're bringing a lot of old ideas about race with them. The dating site AreYouInterested. com analyzed more than 2 million interactions on their site. They have something like 75 million installations of the site, which means 75 million people have at least signed up for the site. And they found that - analyzing these interactions - that Asian women are more likely to get a message from a man of any race, unless those men are Asian. And the analysis also found that white men are pursued the most by women of all races except black women. And black women are the least likely to get a message from anybody. And this tracks with findings from previous surveys. For example, a researcher at the University of California San Diego analyzed messages by the site OKCupid, which has also done similar surveys. So we really wanted to talk about this. So I'll start with you, Anne Ishii. Your site \"They're All So Beautiful\" takes on some of these issues. And you say the findings don't surprise you. But you also say there's kind of an ick factor to this. Why don't you talk about that? ISHII: Yeah. I mean, you know, this is purely personal anecdotal evidence, but I don't know a single Asian-American woman who hasn't been addressed or cat called or hit on based on her ethnicity. And, you know, like, I personally get a lot of ni hao's and sort of Chinese oriented things. And I don't know what's more offensive - that they've called me out for being Asian, or the fact that I'm not Chinese, you know? So it's like, OK, get it right. But then if they do, then it's not like it's any better, but. . . MARTIN: Do they think it's flattering? Is that supposed to be flattering. . . ISHII: Yeah, actually. MARTIN: . . . Or appealing to you? ISHII: Absolutely. It sounds, 9 times out of 10, like they want to impress me with their quote-unquote tolerance for something. Oh, I actually love sushi - it's like, you know, welcome to the 21st century. MARTIN: Well, so do I. And I'm not Asian, I have to say. So, Veronica, you've told us that you've actually tried online dating. And this kind of tracks with what you've experienced yourself. You say that, you know, you've been approached online by men of all races. But what is that experience like? Do you find it flattering, not? VERONICA MILLER: It can be flattering, but then it's the weird thing when you get on to that first date. I found that I've sat across a man who's white or who's Latino or who's Asian, and I always get to the moment in the date where they're trying to prove how down they are. And so they ask me questions like, who's better, Tupac and Biggie? And I'm always like, well, I listened to Spice Girls when that happened, so I don't really know. Or, you know, or accosting me 'cause I hadn't seen \"The Princess and the Frog\" when it had come out - the Disney movie. And saying, what are you doing, it's Disney's first black princess. And I'm like, yeah, I was probably working. But it was just this weird thing of trying to connect, but not really having much to connect on and saying, well, maybe I'll impress her with my black card. MARTIN: Interesting. What about you, Deonna Sayed? What about you? SAYED: Well, my story's a little different. I'm a white woman, but I'm a Muslim. And I've encountered some really interesting scenarios in the online dating world. I actually reached out to one guy that, you know, he was local and I just wanted to say hello, what's up. And he responded immediately by saying, I've been to the Middle East and I really have zero interest in you because of your religion. So, you know, I'm othered - even though I'm white, I'm othered because I have a face that people perceive as being foreign. MARTIN: Did you find that - how did you respond to that? I mean, on the one hand, one might say I - is it wrong for somebody to say, I'm not interested in dating outside my religion because, for whatever reason, I mean. But what - how did you interpret that? SAYED: Well, I just don't respond to stupid. So I left it at that. (LAUGHTER) MARTIN: OK. Now, Demetria, you write about dating and relationships. What do you make of all this? LUCAS: You know, I'm actually happy for Asian women, that they're actually getting some attention, you know, online. So many people go online and they have such terrible stories, so, you know, it's good that Asian women are winning in some respect. I do, however, think that it's for the wrong reasons. As all the other women have said, it seems that there's sort of a fetishizing of Asian women here. You know, probably throwing out some model minority ideas, or some, you know, some geisha, or something like that, ideas. And they think that all Asian women adhere to that. So that's where it's a huge problem. And it's unfortunate that the ignorance of the outside world, you know, it doesn't go away when it gets online. And perhaps it actually gets worse. MARTIN: Anne, do you think that that's true? ISHII: Yeah. Absolutely. MARTIN: Do you think some of this is kind of fetishizing? ISHII: Yeah. I mean, I have only to point out that stupid music video of Asian girls - I don't know if you all remember - that came out a couple months or few months ago. But there's this idea that, you know - the old school mentality is that, yeah, we absolutely represent some sort of meek ideal, even if it's just that subconscious level. There's this idea of the geisha, or the concubine or, you know, like a submissive wife and whatever. You know, the unfortunate thing, I think, is that Asian-American women have to prove themselves against that stereotype by outperforming as, you know, oh, we're actually quite aggressive or, you know, we have to actually counterbalance that some way. And it just makes it really difficult for us to be ourselves. MARTIN: Veronica, you were telling us that you actually find these surveys distressing. And you wonder why people keep actually doing them at all. MILLER: It's - yeah. It's not very encouraging if you are a woman of color dating online because if you're an Asian woman, as the women have already said, you're worried about somebody fetishizing you and telling you how much, you know, he loves karate. Or if you're a black woman, you're like, nobody likes me. You're kind of like the unpopular kid at the party. So it's like - I wonder why these studies keep being released and promoted because it's not terribly encouraging. MARTIN: Well, I think I can make an argument that it is, in part, that there's just more interest in wondering whether - if you're willing to go outside the traditional boundary of having to know someone to introduce you, are you willing to go outside of other boundaries? I mean, that might be an argument. In fact, there's an interesting thing, the - this study that I read about - online, of course - it said that users from all racial backgrounds are equally likely or more likely to cross a racial boundary when reciprocating than when initiating romantic conduct. I mean, contact, rather. This was in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that utilized online dating data from OkCupid. And it says that, you know, if somebody is messaged by someone of a different race, they're more likely to respond even if they don't reach out themselves. And the researchers speculated that maybe it's because people are kind of used to the idea that they might be rejected, so they kind of stick to their own corner. But that if somebody else reaches out, they're likely to reciprocate. So could it be a question of, are you willing to expand your options like that? MILLER: I think - yeah. I think that's a fair question. I think the men I responded to - I don't message anyone, when I was dating online. I didn't message anybody. I just waited for a message to come to me 'cause I'm a girl and that's how I operate. But when the men did message me, and if they did seem interesting, I did respond. You know, it was kind of interesting to see that it was a more diverse pool than I was used to. MARTIN: Overall, can I just ask each of you, are you encouraged or discouraged by what you're hearing about - or even experienced yourself - about online dating? Deonna, maybe I'll start with you. You just think what? SAYED: I. . . MARTIN: Go ahead. SAYED: Well, I'm a little discouraged because I think being - I'm 40 years old. I don't know how old everyone else is. But being at this age, and when you're working full-time and you have a child, you don't have a lot of time to hang out with losers. I mean, you need to know that the person you're going to spend time with, even if it's not romantically successful, at least you're going to get something out of it. You're going to enjoy the person. And I think it's really discouraging if you do have - if you are othered in some way or considered a minority, then do you really have time for all this? MARTIN: Have you met anybody nice online? SAYED: I've met a few people. I have met a few nice people, but no one that I felt I could really have a second date with. MARTIN: Anne, what about you? Are you ultimately encouraged or discouraged by what you're seeing about the dating scene with the addition of the online piece? ISHII: Right. I mean, as a consummate, monogamous, you know, serial monogamist, as they say, and somebody who's never done online dating, I guess I'm sort of encouraged at the metalevel, where it encourages a lot of discussion. I think it's actually kind of a strange privilege that women of, you know, my ethnic extraction or Asian women altogether are able to talk about this so that it explores sexuality in general because, you know, it's obviously not just a binary. I think a lot about the things I hear from gay Asian men and, you know, I mean, their experience is a little bit more similar to, I think, what Deonna is talking about, where it's just a categorical kibosh just because they're Asian. And so, you know, those things sort of being icky or unsavory, notwithstanding, just the ability for all of us to talk about all of it, I think, is really the only silver lining in the quote-unquote fetishism. MARTIN: Demetria, what about you? LUCAS: Yeah. I think it's very disheartening, especially for African-American women, just because, like a previous commenter said, every study comes out - they always do the same study. It always gets the same result. And it's always about how no one's reaching out for black women. Black women are rejected. And just as a black woman who, you know, is having a hard time dating in that realm, like, I totally get it. It's like, so, in person it's a problem. Online it's a problem. Like, it can get very depressing for someone who's looking for love. MARTIN: I'm sorry I brought it up, then. I'm sorry. LUCAS: Oh, no. I'm engaged but. . . (LAUGHTER) MARTIN: Oh, congratulations. That's wonderful. LUCAS: Thank you, thank you. But no, I'm just thinking of my - like, I'm a life coach. So I'm speak of my clients. And, you know, there's a real frustration out there about, like, well, you know, black guys have issues with black women. And then white guys have issues. And then Asian guys have issues. Like, it's like, who's looking to love us? And so just another study coming out and sort of reinforcing what's already been said a million times before - it can be very disheartening. MARTIN: Well, the one thing I will say about the study - it said that people from all ethnic groups seem to not want to be pursuing people from their own ethnic group. I mean, it said that Asian men are not the top responders to Asian women on these sites. That's kind of interesting. And it also said that, you know, white women are the ones who respond most often to white men. But other than that, it seems like everybody's kind of confused. I don't know that that makes anybody feel better. But if you're just joining us, we're in our Beauty Shop. We're catching up on the week's hot topics with Demetria Lucas of TheRoot. com, Anne Ishii of TheyreAllSoBeautiful. com, writer Veronica Miller, and blogger Deonna Kelli Sayed. Well, you know what, this isn't going to make anybody feel better, either. But the web isn't a place just to find a mate.

And today, we're going to talk about mobile payments. Ever gone out to eat with your friends and when the bill arrives, you realize it's cash only and, oh, you have no cash. What are you going to do? Somebody picks up the check, right? Your friends pick up the tab and, of course, you want to pay them back. You don't want to stiff them for the check, and you want to pay them right now. Well, guess what, you can do that. There's an app for that, and a lot of apps, actually. And here with us to talk about it is Ellis Hamburger. He's a reporter at The Verge here in New York. And he joins us on our New York studios. Welcome. ELLIS HAMBURGER: Thanks for having me. FLATOW: Well, I mentioned that app, but there's also something called Square Cash, too, right? HAMBURGER: That's the hottest new thing. And the funny thing is that it's not even an app. That's the barrier to entry for a lot of people. You talk to your buddy, you say, hey, we just split dinner. . . FLATOW: Right. HAMBURGER: . . . but you got to download this app, so we can pay each other. And you say, oh, I just downloaded another app last week when I had dinner with another friend. FLATOW: Right. HAMBURGER: But the idea behind Square Cash is that everyone knows how to use email. Everybody already has the email app on their phone, everybody's got their friends' email addresses already stored in their phone. So the virtue of Square Cash is that in order to use it, I would send an email to you. . . FLATOW: Right. HAMBURGER: . . . and I would cc cash@square. com, and type a number in the subject line, let's say, $20. And that's it. FLATOW: That's it. HAMBURGER: If it's the first time you're using it or the first time you're receiving it, you get a page in your email to type in your debit card, and you're done. There's no creating an account. There's no login with Facebook. There's no add all your friends and follow all your friends so you can do it. It's the most seamless experience I've used for sending money to a friend. FLATOW: But I know I would be afraid of giving out my bank account number on an email. Should I? HAMBURGER: That's the thing, is that you're not giving out anything in an email. All you're doing is stating your intent. So they send you to their secure Square homepage where you enter in your debit card and from that point, they associate it with your email. So there's not actually anything taking place in email, even if that's the clever illusion that, I think, is alluring for a lot of people. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Quite interesting. Talking with Ellis Hamburger on SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. Is that the only with non-app way to send cash to each other? HAMBURGER: Just about. FLATOW: Yeah. HAMBURGER: They're all apps. There's Google Wallet. There's Venmo. There's PayPal, which has been around for a long, long time. They're great variety of ways to do it, but they all ask you to set up your bank account, look for your routing number, look for your bank account number, wait for the deposits to come in so they can verify that it's actually your bank account. And Square has done a lot of clever work with banks to make it pretty seamless. You enter in your debit card, and they do a lot of background checks in the background to see if they can figure out who you are. And that's how they go about that process. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. What about - I have seen ads from banks themselves now saying, you know, paying the babysitter right there, and you can just send a little bit of cash. HAMBURGER: Right. FLATOW: Is that a viable alternative to these things, or is it as good or better or - where would you rank that? HAMBURGER: I think the experience in some ways is faster, but it's only for people who are members at the same bank. So if I'm trying - if I bank at Chase and you bank at Citi, I can't Chase QuickPay you. FLATOW: Right. HAMBURGER: So the idea - the holy grail, in a way, is to have one app, one service so you can send somebody money with as little barrier to entry as possible. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. With Square Cash though, what happens if somebody writes themselves an email from my account. . . HAMBURGER: That's a great question. FLATOW: . . . send some money. (LAUGHTER)HAMBURGER: So the premise that they're operating on is that your email is already a very secure place. For a lot of people, your emails are some of your most personal documents in your life. And there are various ways to protect your email, which I would suggest anybody does, everybody does, namely two-factor verification. And that sounds complicated, but really all it is, is you go into your Google settings, and you say anytime anyone tries to log in to my Gmail, not only do they need the right password but will text your phone with a little code - maybe four, five digits - and you also have to enter that. So really it's another 30 seconds, but it offers an immeasurably secure experience. FLATOW: What about, you know, there are some gas stations now. You just swipe a card right by the - paying for the gas - what about doing that in other venues? HAMBURGER: That's the idea behind this standard called NFC. So instead of going through the Internet, going through email, NFC is saying, well, I'm right next to you. Why can't we just bounce our phones together and pay? But it ends up that there's a lot of regulatory measures that make that a lot harder to implement than it sounds, namely the fact that Google was trying with Google Wallet to create one platform so you can pay your friends, you can pay McDonald's, you can pay Starbucks. But the carriers were not down with that idea. They wanted to come up with their own payment scheme that they could get all their customers rolled up in. And that actually just launched last week. It's called Isis. But no doubt, Verizon and AT&T aren't going to be able to come up with as nice of a user experience as San Francisco startups. FLATOW: Well, you think that the credit card companies would say, hey, this is a great idea for us. Why aren't they doing that then? HAMBURGER: You would think. And I think they are probably realizing that right about the time when Square debuted their little white reader. FLATOW: Right. HAMBURGER: That's $10. FLATOW: Right. HAMBURGER: And guess what most restaurants are using? They're using that big, bulky brick of a piece of plastic and it makes the credit card companies look like idiots. But they're not only, in a lot of cases, renting those out to people, but if you look at the technology that's still running over the phone line, it really makes the consumers realize how far behind they are and how the credit card technology, in a way, is very static and hasn't changed. And there are new security measures but not new ways to pay people. And that's one of the things that Square, with their original reader, let alone Cash, I think, really illuminated. FLATOW: And to what advantage also over PayPal? PayPal has been around a lot. HAMBURGER: PayPal is a great one. And a lot of people already have a PayPal account to send money to your friends. One of the things about PayPal is that not only do you need to hook up your bank account with your routing number and all that stuff. So, it's harder to convince your new friend, hey, let's just set you up with a PayPal. You got 20 minutes. FLATOW: Right. HAMBURGER: Or three days. But the other thing about Square Cash is that it aims to get your money to you within one, two days with no holding account in the middle. Whereas PayPal not only holds on to your money for, let's say, five to seven days, but you also have to actively withdraw it. You have to go into the app and say, I want my money out. Whereas the Square Cash, if we're both set up, I send you the email, cc cash@square. com, and you get it within two days. FLATOW: Right. When they hold your cash, they're making money in your cash holding it. All right. Thank you, Ellis, very much. HAMBURGER: Oh, my pleasure. Thanks for having me. FLATOW: Thank you. Ellis Hamburger is a reporter at The Verge here in New York. And that's all the time we have for today. IRA FLATOW, HOST:  Now up, it's time for another episode of our App Chat series, where we review the latest apps and talk about new ways to use your smartphone. And today, we're going to talk about mobile payments. Ever gone out to eat with your friends and when the bill arrives, you realize it's cash only and, oh, you have no cash. What are you going to do? Somebody picks up the check, right? Your friends pick up the tab and, of course, you want to pay them back. You don't want to stiff them for the check, and you want to pay them right now. Well, guess what, you can do that. There's an app for that, and a lot of apps, actually. And here with us to talk about it is Ellis Hamburger. He's a reporter at The Verge here in New York. And he joins us on our New York studios. Welcome. ELLIS HAMBURGER: Thanks for having me. FLATOW: Well, I mentioned that app, but there's also something called Square Cash, too, right? HAMBURGER: That's the hottest new thing. And the funny thing is that it's not even an app. That's the barrier to entry for a lot of people. You talk to your buddy, you say, hey, we just split dinner. . . FLATOW: Right. HAMBURGER: . . . but you got to download this app, so we can pay each other. And you say, oh, I just downloaded another app last week when I had dinner with another friend. FLATOW: Right. HAMBURGER: But the idea behind Square Cash is that everyone knows how to use email. Everybody already has the email app on their phone, everybody's got their friends' email addresses already stored in their phone. So the virtue of Square Cash is that in order to use it, I would send an email to you. . . FLATOW: Right. HAMBURGER: . . . and I would cc cash@square. com, and type a number in the subject line, let's say, $20. And that's it. FLATOW: That's it. HAMBURGER: If it's the first time you're using it or the first time you're receiving it, you get a page in your email to type in your debit card, and you're done. There's no creating an account. There's no login with Facebook. There's no add all your friends and follow all your friends so you can do it. It's the most seamless experience I've used for sending money to a friend. FLATOW: But I know I would be afraid of giving out my bank account number on an email. Should I? HAMBURGER: That's the thing, is that you're not giving out anything in an email. All you're doing is stating your intent. So they send you to their secure Square homepage where you enter in your debit card and from that point, they associate it with your email. So there's not actually anything taking place in email, even if that's the clever illusion that, I think, is alluring for a lot of people. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Quite interesting. Talking with Ellis Hamburger on SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. Is that the only with non-app way to send cash to each other? HAMBURGER: Just about. FLATOW: Yeah. HAMBURGER: They're all apps. There's Google Wallet. There's Venmo. There's PayPal, which has been around for a long, long time. They're great variety of ways to do it, but they all ask you to set up your bank account, look for your routing number, look for your bank account number, wait for the deposits to come in so they can verify that it's actually your bank account. And Square has done a lot of clever work with banks to make it pretty seamless. You enter in your debit card, and they do a lot of background checks in the background to see if they can figure out who you are. And that's how they go about that process. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. What about - I have seen ads from banks themselves now saying, you know, paying the babysitter right there, and you can just send a little bit of cash. HAMBURGER: Right. FLATOW: Is that a viable alternative to these things, or is it as good or better or - where would you rank that?

Last week the social media giant went public, transforming itself into a company worth $25 billion. Yeah, that's billion with a B. How the heck did that happen? How did Twitter go from being a sort of confusing service where you shared the news that you were eating a vegan peanut butter cookie to a fire hose of breaking news and a tool for revolutionaries? Well, that's the story my next guest tells in his new book \"Hatching Twitter: The True Story of Money, Power, Friendship, and Betrayal. \"FLATOW: And, yes, there's way more backstabbing, lies, and vodka-Red Bulls involved in that creation myth than you might have thought. And here to talk about it is Nick Bilton, author of \"Hatching Twitter. \" He's also a columnist and reporter for the New York Times in San Francisco. He joins us from KQED in that fair town there. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. NICK BILTON: Thanks for having me. FLATOW: You know, this book reads like a great political drama with all the lies and the backstabbing and the secret meetings. And the weeping, throwing up in trash cans. Who would thought this goes on in beautiful, you know, Tweeterville? BILTON: Tweeterville. Tweeterville where there are vodka-Red Bulls and peanut butter vegan cookies. You know, when I first set out to write this book I had no idea I was going to be - you know, there was going to be so much drama that was involved in the founding of this company but as you said, it was a - it reads like a - a lot of people say it reads like a murder mystery. Because you don't really know what's going on and who's running the company at any given time and everyone's backstabbing each other and pushing each other out. But, you know, there are two major themes kind of to this book and one is, you know, it's a story about a company that changed the way we do everything. I mean, it changed the way we do radio. It changed the way we perform business, religion, politics. You have, you know, presidents of different countries tweeting at each other. But, you know, the other part of the story which you just alluded to is the story about four guys who were once very close friends who built this service with the hope of connecting to each other and to other people and in the process ended up tearing their friendships apart. FLATOW: Is that what's unique about this story? Because, you know, over the years we've covered technology stories. Well, here in New York we know Wall Street. We know what goes on there. There's a lot of backstabbing and betrayal. Is it because it's friends that makes it unique in this case? BILTON: Well, it's interesting. It's a great question and I think there are a couple of things that make it unique. One is that, you know, you bring up Wall Street. I mean, I lived in New York for 15 years and I've been involved in stories in the paper, the New York Times, about Wall Street and bankers and so on. FLATOW: Right. BILTON: And the thing I find when I meet a banker is they're like, hey, I want to be rich. I want a private jet and I want a house in the Hamptons and I want, you know, I want my hood ornament to be a Cadillac. You know, I just - they are very proud of the fact that that's what they're in it for. And then Silicon Valley, there's a - it's this thing we call the creation myth. And these creation myths are that these people are in these technologies and building these technologies because they want to make the world a better place. And while that is true in many instances, they also want to be rich. And there's nothing wrong with that but they feel the need to kind of hide that and suppress that and also to hide any of the backstabbing and betrayal that goes on because that doesn't jive necessarily with this story of how, you know, they're here to make the world a better place. And, you know, nowhere is that more prevalent than with the Twitter story where you had these four people that were very, very close friends. I mean they were best friends. As you said, they were drinking vodka-Red Bulls and going out and partying together. And some of them, you know, in the process of this company growing became billionaires and celebrities and some of them ended up with nothing. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. Talking about the book \"Hatching Twitter\" with Nick Bilton. So did you know where this would take you when you started out with all. . . BILTON: No. I had no idea. I had no idea. So I knew that there was some sort of, you know, there was drama behind the book. FLATOW: Yeah. BILTON: But the original proposal that I wrote was, you know, Jack Dorsey, who is everyone sees is the creator of Twitter, you know, I believed in the proposal I wrote. I told my publisher that he was the sole founder of Twitter and the next Steve Jobs and he was unjustly thrown out of the company by his other founders for power and control. And then when I started writing the story I started to realize that my synopsis was very wrong. And what happened was, that I found truly fascinating, was - so I originally started reporting and at first the founders didn't want to talk to me. In the end they all ended up spending quite a considerable amount of time with me. But there was a point in the beginning where I got access to some early documents and some internal emails and things like that where I started to kind of realize that the story was much more in depth. Then I started interviewing people and so on. But what was really fascinating was the role that social media played in my reporting. I was able to go back - and I hired some researchers and we went through the, you know, the first couple of years of tweets from all of the founders and the people that were involved in the company and even, you know, their spouses. And so we were able to kind of pinpoint where people were, what they were wearing, who they were with, and a variety of other things that I don't think you could've ever done if you'd have reported a book like this even three, four years ago. FLATOW: Hmm. And Jack Dorsey is a very interesting character in your book, one of the stranger characters if you can just single him out as any stranger than anyone else. BILTON: Yeah. Jack is a very, very strange character in the story. You know, when he first moved to San Francisco he came here, he had scruffy hair and a nose ring and he used to go to punk clubs and rave parties and so on. And he did strange things, like he would walk around San Francisco with a t-shirt with his phone number on the front and he would wait for people to call him so he could talk to them. He would - what were some of the other things he did? He didn't have anything to sell on eBay so he auctioned off the ability to read \"Good Night Moon\" and people paid $100 for that, which was quite bizarre. Some other things he did were - he just had these very kind of strange ideas, but some of the ideas were actually good. You know, one of the ideas was that you would be able to create a website where you could update your status of what you were doing at that moment in time. And that's the story that we've kind of heard as the creation myth and the founding of Twitter, but what really I found during the reporting was that there was another guy - his name was Noah Glass - and, you know, we call him the forgotten founder. Noah and Jack were best friends and they worked at this company called Odeo which actually, ironically, trying to destroy your job, Ira, by destroying radio. But Odeo went out of, you know, was having a lot of trouble and out of this conversation. FLATOW: Just shows you. BILTON: Yeah, just shows. . . (LAUGHTER)BILTON: Out of these conversations. They were talking about all these different ideas that kind of led to Twitter but there was one seminal moment and it was one night. It was in a car. It was rainy. It was on Valencia Street in San Francisco and Jack Dorsey and Noah Glass had been out drinking. And Noah was going through a very difficult time. He was going through a divorce. His company, Odeo, was failing and all of his friendships were kind of tearing apart. And he felt incredibly alone and he kept telling everyone how lonely he felt. And Jack had brought up this idea again, this idea to update your status online. And there were a number of other services out there that did that. There was Dodgeball. Facebook was just coming about. There was a thing called Text Mob. So no one really kind of glammed onto it. But what Noah thought was, hey, wait a second. As he sat in this car and the rain's coming down and his lonely feelings, he thinks, well, if this thing existed I could actually connect with my friends and feel less alone. FLATOW: All right. BILTON: And that was the moment that it really started out. FLATOW: OK. We're going to have many more moments with Nick Bilton talking about \"Hatching Twitter. \" Stay with us. We'll be right back after this break. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)FLATOW: This is SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour about the new book \"Hatching Twitter\" with Nick Bilton, who's the author. He's also a columnist and reporter for the New York Times in San Francisco, and one I rudely interrupted, Nick, as I'm wont to do with everybody, it seems. He was telling us about how the idea was hatched by Noah - was it Noah Glass? Is that his name? BILTON: Noah Glass and Jack Dorsey, yeah. FLATOW: Yeah. And sitting in a car. . . BILTON: Drunk in a car. FLATOW: . . . on a lonely night, it sounds like. BILTON: Well, this is the thing that I think was really fascinating to me, you know, and this was something I didn't know setting out to write the book, was, you know, you look around today - you sit in a coffee shop, you sit in a restaurant, you go out for dinner with friends and everyone's sitting there pecking at their phone, right? FLATOW: Mm-hmm. BILTON: They're looking for something that's far away even though they have these people that are directly in front of them. And the guys that created this service, the guys that created Twitter that we all do that with today were doing the same thing when they created it. You know, they were looking for connections. And the story in the book, you know, kind of follows these four people and how they kind of grow and learn - and some of them do and some of them don't - that loneliness and feeling alone cannot connect you to other people. And, without giving away the end of the book too much, some of them actually learn that and some of them don't. But at the same time, you know, you have instances today where people in far flung places that can't talk to other people - for example, the astronauts in space, which is one of the my favorite examples - they are connected to people that are far away through these technologies, through Twitter and so on. And so this is a really fascinating juxtaposition that I kind of present in the story, in the book, that asks that question. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Do you see any trends going anywhere? You know, I just know that Twitter just hired NPR's former CEO Vivian Schiller to be head of the news partnership. Are they going to be doing news on Twitter? Do you think? BILTON: Well, I think that news is - you know, we're all doing news if, you know, you're in New York City right now, right? If across the street, you know, God forbid, a bomb exploded and you were walking out of the building you were in, your phone would come out and you would start taking pictures and tweeting almost instinctively. It's the same way you used to, you know, that reporters used to do that. And I think that what Twitter is trying to do is figure out a way to say, well, I want to know if that gentleman who is doing that is actually there and if this is a real event and things like that. FLATOW: Yeah. BILTON: And also, in addition, I think they want to start training reporters to be able to utilize these things more and more. The thing I found fascinating about the Iranian revolution was that - the latest one was when Bill Keller, who was editor-in-chief at the New York Times at the time, was there and writing stories and he was actually in Iran but he was also looking at Twitter to get people's voices that were on the streets in Iran at the time. And, you know, it's a perfect example of what they want to try to do more of. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And all in 140 characters. BILTON: Well, the 140 characters thing is actually quite interesting. When, you know, and this is in the book, when it first started out it was not limited to 140 characters. So, you know, you could've written, you know, a novel if you wanted. The problem was is it was all done over text message, using SMS. And so if you sent something that was over - actually it was 160 characters is the length of a text message, it would've been truncated into several messages. And eventually in October of 2006 they make a decision that they're going to actually limit to 160 characters and then later, a few months later, they actually bring it down to 140 characters so they can append a person's username. And now what you're seeing happening, if you go to the Twitter website or you use the Twitter mobile app or whatever it is, the 140 characters is almost like the cover of an envelope. And the things that are inside are actually embedded. So you can embed a photo and you can embed links and things like that and those are expandable. And so the 140 characters is actually - I don't think it's exactly accurate in the way that we perceive it today. FLATOW: It's the headline that gets you. BILTON: Yes, exactly. FLATOW: Into the other stuff. Is there another car someplace on a rainy night in San Francisco. . . (LAUGHTER)FLATOW: . . . with other people sitting and thinking of the next big thing? BILTON: Well, it's funny you say that. Before I came on here I quickly filed a blog post about Snapchat and, you know, the news this week has been about that Snapchat turned down a $3 billion offer from Facebook. . . FLATOW: Tell Snapchat for our listeners who don't know what that is. BILTON: Snapchat is essentially - it's almost like an ephemeral Instagram. It's a way that you can take a picture on your phone and you can send it to someone or a group of people and they have up to 10 seconds to view it once it's opened, but then after that it's gone forever. And it really kind of goes against the entire concept of what digital sharing is. You know, the Facebook sees itself, and Twitter and all these other services, see themselves as places to add permanence to the things that you share and collect. And they want your timelines to go back till the day you were born and document everything, you know, from here, there, and in between. Snapchat took up a completely different approach where they wanted to be able to let people share things that would disappear. FLATOW: Right. You can always get a copy from the NSA, probably. BILTON: You can probably get a copy of anything from the NSA, but. . . (LAUGHTER)BILTON: But what happened was I wrote one of the first articles about Snapchat in May of 2012, 18 months ago, and at the time, the guys who founded it were still in school at Stanford. And I remember it was very funny because one of the founders, Evan Spiegel, I said, hey, can you speak for this column I'm writing? And he was like I can't talk; I'm doing finals right now. So I'm just too busy. But yet, 18 months later this company is now valued at $4 billion. And I think what that really kind of shows me is just how quickly these things can go from nothing, from something that exists in a dorm room, to one of the biggest new businesses in Silicon Valley. FLATOW: But a business is supposed to make money. BILTON: Well, that's exactly - it's funny. I just thought to myself did I just use the right word there when I said business? (LAUGHTER)BILTON: That's true. So, you know, Google and Facebook are offering $3 billion to $4 billion for this company and venture capitalists are throwing money into it, you know, like it's some kind of golden rainbow. FLATOW: Right. BILTON: And the reality is Snapchat literally has made $0 in revenue. And so that's the anomaly of the Valley. But, you know, I mean, when you look at the Twitter story, you know, through the book I tell these stories of this company that is. . . FLATOW: Mm-hmm. BILTON: . . . it's just growing immensely. You know, they're on the cover of Time magazine. The founders go on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show. \" They're featured, you know, on the cover of every newspaper across America at some point or another and yet they have $0 in revenue. FLATOW: Could the. . . BILTON: But, eventually. . . FLATOW: Yes. Yes. BILTON: They eventually - they start to make money. FLATOW: But could there be a social media bubble growing where people. . . BILTON: I absolutely think there is. I think there's a technology bubble right now. FLATOW: Yeah. BILTON: You know, I mean, you know, Snapchat is worth $3 billion to $4 billion. You have Pinterest that just raised money at over $3. 5 billion. They'll have $0 in revenue. You have fab. com which is worth $1 billion and they're not profitable. I mean I could just probably just use the rest of the show just going through a list of companies that are worth X billions of dollars and have no revenue. Or very little revenue. And I think that there's this - because of the companies that do make money, which is the Facebooks and the Twitters and the Googles and so on, and they make so much of it, I think that there is an irrational exuberance by the venture capitalists and people here in the Valley that think that they can - they know which one is going to be the next Twitter or Facebook. FLATOW: So any new idea, really, can draw some venture money to it. BILTON: Yeah. And the irony, I think, of this whole thing is, you know, with these stories is they're all going after the teen market. Right? FLATOW: Yeah. BILTON: If you have teens you're, like, the next big thing. But as all these reports have shown, a Pew Research report, a Piper Jaffray report, have all shown that teens, they have about, like, a two-year lifespan on a startup and then they're just gone. So they were, you know, 85 percent of teens in 2007, 2006 were on MySpace. FLATOW: Right. BILTON: Now it's seven percent. FLATOW: My what? What was that called? My? BILTON: Exactly. FLATOW: Yeah. BILTON: And the numbers are happening now with Facebook where they're dropping off and they're going into other places. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. But then you sell the company and you get out, right? You've made your billions. BILTON: Well, if you're lucky enough. FLATOW: Yeah. BILTON: But, you know, if you're lucky enough. But then, you know, there are - do you remember the company Chat Roulette? FLATOW: No. I don't. (LAUGHTER)BILTON: So Chat Roulette. It was the darling of - it was everywhere. FLATOW: Yeah. BILTON: It was picked up in every newspaper, magazine. It was this kid in Russia who'd built it in his bedroom and it was worth, you know, millions and millions of dollars. FLATOW: Right. BILTON: And he chose not to sell it, even though he had all of these offers, because he thought it was going to be bigger. And as I just said, do you remember it; and you said no. FLATOW: No. BILTON: So it's gone. FLATOW: Yeah. A lot of people complain about Facebook's seemingly disregard for privacy, but Twitter has always sort of had this higher ethical standard. Have they maintained that idea? Is it slipping? And now that they're going to be bought out, when they're bought out, you know? BILTON: Yeah. It's a great question. It's one of the things that actually really drew me to write this book, actually more than anything. It was a company - you know, I've written hundreds and hundreds of articles on social media for the New York Times and the ones I've written on Facebook are always, you know, often related to privacy problems. And especially in the early days. And I haven't ever had to write that story about Twitter. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. BILTON: And the reason is because Twitter had a stance in the very beginning that they were going to be a company that was going to kind of approach privacy and protecting its users in a different way. And it partially goes back to one of the cofounders, actually, two of the cofounders, Evan Williams and Biz Stone, who were very important and integral in blogging the very early days in 2000, 2001, 2002. And they had this philosophy that you had what was called push button publishing for the people so that anyone could have a voice online. And they were very adamant about that. There was another founder, another partner, Jason Goldman, who was involved in it too. And the three of them really believed that what they were doing and what they were building were services that were going to give people a voice that had never had one before. And they brought those ideals to Twitter and those ideals carried through. You know, during the revolution they chose to keep the website online in Iran so that people could use it to organize protests. During the Occupy Wall Street they defended some of the people that the police were trying to get access to. And there are dozens of stories in the book of this example, of this being a company that did that. That being said, now that they're public, the question is will they continue to do that? FLATOW: Right. BILTON: Or will they, you know, make decisions in lieu of the shareholders? FLATOW: So then that's to be continued, as we say. BILTON: Yes. That'll be an add-on at the end. FLATOW: Yeah. Well, are you working on the next book, on a follow-up? Yeah? BILTON: I'm exploring ideas. You know, I think that these stories in the Valley are just so fascinating. You know. FLATOW: Yeah. BILTON: I mean, it is the largest area of wealth in a 50 square mile area in the history of humanity. And there is so much change that is happening here and it's affecting everything, from politics to religion. And you just look at Twitter. It was a seven year old company that went from a drunken conversation in a car one night to being worth $25 billion and changing the world. And I just think there's some just truly fascinating stories there. FLATOW: Well, I'm sure you know that there are more IT people in New York now than there are Wall Street people. BILTON: Are there really? FLATOW: Yeah. Well, yeah. Well, maybe we will now see that community going in Hudson Square some placeBILTON: I did have a question for you, actually. FLATOW: Yeah. BILTON: You said in the beginning of the show that, you know, that backstabbing and betrayal, you know, was like Wall Street and so on. Do you have that in the radio industry? Do you guys all kind of. . . FLATOW: Oh, yeah. Everybody. . . BILTON: . . . unplug each other's mics? FLATOW: Everybody has it. Oh, there used to be - in the old - 50 years ago they would burn your copy. You had live radio. They'd take a match to your script while you're reading it. BILTON: Really? FLATOW: Oh, yeah. BILTON: Wow. FLATOW: We'll talk some other time, Nick. (LAUGHTER)FLATOW: Another show. Thanks. But it's a great book. Thanks for coming on and talking about it. BILTON: Thank you for having me. I appreciate it. FLATOW: Nick Bilton is author of \"Hatching Twitter. \" He's also a columnist and reporter for the New York Times in San Francisco. I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) IRA FLATOW, HOST:  Next up, get your tweets ready because we're talking about Twitter. Last week the social media giant went public, transforming itself into a company worth $25 billion. Yeah, that's billion with a B. How the heck did that happen? How did Twitter go from being a sort of confusing service where you shared the news that you were eating a vegan peanut butter cookie to a fire hose of breaking news and a tool for revolutionaries? Well, that's the story my next guest tells in his new book \"Hatching Twitter: The True Story of Money, Power, Friendship, and Betrayal. \" FLATOW: And, yes, there's way more backstabbing, lies, and vodka-Red Bulls involved in that creation myth than you might have thought. And here to talk about it is Nick Bilton, author of \"Hatching Twitter. \" He's also a columnist and reporter for the New York Times in San Francisco. He joins us from KQED in that fair town there. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. NICK BILTON: Thanks for having me. FLATOW: You know, this book reads like a great political drama with all the lies and the backstabbing and the secret meetings. And the weeping, throwing up in trash cans. Who would thought this goes on in beautiful, you know, Tweeterville? BILTON: Tweeterville. Tweeterville where there are vodka-Red Bulls and peanut butter vegan cookies. You know, when I first set out to write this book I had no idea I was going to be - you know, there was going to be so much drama that was involved in the founding of this company but as you said, it was a - it reads like a - a lot of people say it reads like a murder mystery. Because you don't really know what's going on and who's running the company at any given time and everyone's backstabbing each other and pushing each other out. But, you know, there are two major themes kind of to this book and one is, you know, it's a story about a company that changed the way we do everything. I mean, it changed the way we do radio. It changed the way we perform business, religion, politics. You have, you know, presidents of different countries tweeting at each other. But, you know, the other part of the story which you just alluded to is the story about four guys who were once very close friends who built this service with the hope of connecting to each other and to other people and in the process ended up tearing their friendships apart. FLATOW: Is that what's unique about this story? Because, you know, over the years we've covered technology stories. Well, here in New York we know Wall Street. We know what goes on there. There's a lot of backstabbing and betrayal. Is it because it's friends that makes it unique in this case? BILTON: Well, it's interesting. It's a great question and I think there are a couple of things that make it unique. One is that, you know, you bring up Wall Street. I mean, I lived in New York for 15 years and I've been involved in stories in the paper, the New York Times, about Wall Street and bankers and so on. FLATOW: Right. BILTON: And the thing I find when I meet a banker is they're like, hey, I want to be rich. I want a private jet and I want a house in the Hamptons and I want, you know, I want my hood ornament to be a Cadillac. You know, I just - they are very proud of the fact that that's what they're in it for. And then Silicon Valley, there's a - it's this thing we call the creation myth. And these creation myths are that these people are in these technologies and building these technologies because they want to make the world a better place. And while that is true in many instances, they also want to be rich. And there's nothing wrong with that but they feel the need to kind of hide that and suppress that and also to hide any of the backstabbing and betrayal that goes on because that doesn't jive necessarily with this story of how, you know, they're here to make the world a better place. And, you know, nowhere is that more prevalent than with the Twitter story where you had these four people that were very, very close friends. I mean they were best friends. As you said, they were drinking vodka-Red Bulls and going out and partying together. And some of them, you know, in the process of this company growing became billionaires and celebrities and some of them ended up with nothing. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. Talking about the book \"Hatching Twitter\" with Nick Bilton. So did you know where this would take you when you started out with all. . . BILTON: No. I had no idea. I had no idea. So I knew that there was some sort of, you know, there was drama behind the book. FLATOW: Yeah. BILTON: But the original proposal that I wrote was, you know, Jack Dorsey, who is everyone sees is the creator of Twitter, you know, I believed in the proposal I wrote. I told my publisher that he was the sole founder of Twitter and the next Steve Jobs and he was unjustly thrown out of the company by his other founders for power and control. And then when I started writing the story I started to realize that my synopsis was very wrong. And what happened was, that I found truly fascinating, was - so I originally started reporting and at first the founders didn't want to talk to me. In the end they all ended up spending quite a considerable amount of time with me. But there was a point in the beginning where I got access to some early documents and some internal emails and things like that where I started to kind of realize that the story was much more in depth. Then I started interviewing people and so on. But what was really fascinating was the role that social media played in my reporting. I was able to go back - and I hired some researchers and we went through the, you know, the first couple of years of tweets from all of the founders and the people that were involved in the company and even, you know, their spouses. And so we were able to kind of pinpoint where people were, what they were wearing, who they were with, and a variety of other things that I don't think you could've ever done if you'd have reported a book like this even three, four years ago. FLATOW: Hmm. And Jack Dorsey is a very interesting character in your book, one of the stranger characters if you can just single him out as any stranger than anyone else. BILTON: Yeah. Jack is a very, very strange character in the story. You know, when he first moved to San Francisco he came here, he had scruffy hair and a nose ring and he used to go to punk clubs and rave parties and so on. And he did strange things, like he would walk around San Francisco with a t-shirt with his phone number on the front and he would wait for people to call him so he could talk to them. He would - what were some of the other things he did? He didn't have anything to sell on eBay so he auctioned off the ability to read \"Good Night Moon\" and people paid $100 for that, which was quite bizarre. Some other things he did were - he just had these very kind of strange ideas, but some of the ideas were actually good. You know, one of the ideas was that you would be able to create a website where you could update your status of what you were doing at that moment in time. And that's the story that we've kind of heard as the creation myth and the founding of Twitter, but what really I found during the reporting was that there was another guy - his name was Noah Glass - and, you know, we call him the forgotten founder. Noah and Jack were best friends and they worked at this company called Odeo which actually, ironically, trying to destroy your job, Ira, by destroying radio. But Odeo went out of, you know, was having a lot of trouble and out of this conversation. FLATOW: Just shows you. BILTON: Yeah, just shows. . . (LAUGHTER) BILTON: Out of these conversations. They were talking about all these different ideas that kind of led to Twitter but there was one seminal moment and it was one night. It was in a car. It was rainy. It was on Valencia Street in San Francisco and Jack Dorsey and Noah Glass had been out drinking. And Noah was going through a very difficult time. He was going through a divorce. His company, Odeo, was failing and all of his friendships were kind of tearing apart. And he felt incredibly alone and he kept telling everyone how lonely he felt. And Jack had brought up this idea again, this idea to update your status online. And there were a number of other services out there that did that. There was Dodgeball. Facebook was just coming about. There was a thing called Text Mob. So no one really kind of glammed onto it. But what Noah thought was, hey, wait a second. As he sat in this car and the rain's coming down and his lonely feelings, he thinks, well, if this thing existed I could actually connect with my friends and feel less alone. FLATOW: All right. BILTON: And that was the moment that it really started out. FLATOW: OK. We're going to have many more moments with Nick Bilton talking about \"Hatching Twitter. \" Stay with us. We'll be right back after this break. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FLATOW: This is SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour about the new book \"Hatching Twitter\" with Nick Bilton, who's the author. He's also a columnist and reporter for the New York Times in San Francisco, and one I rudely interrupted, Nick, as I'm wont to do with everybody, it seems. He was telling us about how the idea was hatched by Noah - was it Noah Glass? Is that his name? BILTON: Noah Glass and Jack Dorsey, yeah. FLATOW: Yeah. And sitting in a car. . . BILTON: Drunk in a car. FLATOW: . . . on a lonely night, it sounds like. BILTON: Well, this is the thing that I think was really fascinating to me, you know, and this was something I didn't know setting out to write the book, was, you know, you look around today - you sit in a coffee shop, you sit in a restaurant, you go out for dinner with friends and everyone's sitting there pecking at their phone, right? FLATOW: Mm-hmm. BILTON: They're looking for something that's far away even though they have these people that are directly in front of them. And the guys that created this service, the guys that created Twitter that we all do that with today were doing the same thing when they created it. You know, they were looking for connections. And the story in the book, you know, kind of follows these four people and how they kind of grow and learn - and some of them do and some of them don't - that loneliness and feeling alone cannot connect you to other people. And, without giving away the end of the book too much, some of them actually learn that and some of them don't. But at the same time, you know, you have instances today where people in far flung places that can't talk to other people - for example, the astronauts in space, which is one of the my favorite examples - they are connected to people that are far away through these technologies, through Twitter and so on. And so this is a really fascinating juxtaposition that I kind of present in the story, in the book, that asks that question. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Do you see any trends going anywhere? You know, I just know that Twitter just hired NPR's former CEO Vivian Schiller to be head of the news partnership. Are they going to be doing news on Twitter? Do you think? BILTON: Well, I think that news is - you know, we're all doing news if, you know, you're in New York City right now, right? If across the street, you know, God forbid, a bomb exploded and you were walking out of the building you were in, your phone would come out and you would start taking pictures and tweeting almost instinctively. It's the same way you used to, you know, that reporters used to do that. And I think that what Twitter is trying to do is figure out a way to say, well, I want to know if that gentleman who is doing that is actually there and if this is a real event and things like that. FLATOW: Yeah. BILTON: And also, in addition, I think they want to start training reporters to be able to utilize these things more and more. The thing I found fascinating about the Iranian revolution was that - the latest one was when Bill Keller, who was editor-in-chief at the New York Times at the time, was there and writing stories and he was actually in Iran but he was also looking at Twitter to get people's voices that were on the streets in Iran at the time. And, you know, it's a perfect example of what they want to try to do more of. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And all in 140 characters. BILTON: Well, the 140 characters thing is actually quite interesting. When, you know, and this is in the book, when it first started out it was not limited to 140 characters. So, you know, you could've written, you know, a novel if you wanted. The problem was is it was all done over text message, using SMS. And so if you sent something that was over - actually it was 160 characters is the length of a text message, it would've been truncated into several messages. And eventually in October of 2006 they make a decision that they're going to actually limit to 160 characters and then later, a few months later, they actually bring it down to 140 characters so they can append a person's username. And now what you're seeing happening, if you go to the Twitter website or you use the Twitter mobile app or whatever it is, the 140 characters is almost like the cover of an envelope. And the things that are inside are actually embedded. So you can embed a photo and you can embed links and things like that and those are expandable. And so the 140 characters is actually - I don't think it's exactly accurate in the way that we perceive it today. FLATOW: It's the headline that gets you. BILTON: Yes, exactly. FLATOW: Into the other stuff. Is there another car someplace on a rainy night in San Francisco. . . (LAUGHTER) FLATOW: . . . with other people sitting and thinking of the next big thing? BILTON: Well, it's funny you say that. Before I came on here I quickly filed a blog post about Snapchat and, you know, the news this week has been about that Snapchat turned down a $3 billion offer from Facebook. . . FLATOW: Tell Snapchat for our listeners who don't know what that is. BILTON: Snapchat is essentially - it's almost like an ephemeral Instagram. It's a way that you can take a picture on your phone and you can send it to someone or a group of people and they have up to 10 seconds to view it once it's opened, but then after that it's gone forever. And it really kind of goes against the entire concept of what digital sharing is. You know, the Facebook sees itself, and Twitter and all these other services, see themselves as places to add permanence to the things that you share and collect. And they want your timelines to go back till the day you were born and document everything, you know, from here, there, and in between. Snapchat took up a completely different approach where they wanted to be able to let people share things that would disappear. FLATOW: Right. You can always get a copy from the NSA, probably. BILTON: You can probably get a copy of anything from the NSA, but. . . (LAUGHTER) BILTON: But what happened was I wrote one of the first articles about Snapchat in May of 2012, 18 months ago, and at the time, the guys who founded it were still in school at Stanford. And I remember it was very funny because one of the founders, Evan Spiegel, I said, hey, can you speak for this column I'm writing? And he was like I can't talk; I'm doing finals right now. So I'm just too busy. But yet, 18 months later this company is now valued at $4 billion. And I think what that really kind of shows me is just how quickly these things can go from nothing, from something that exists in a dorm room, to one of the biggest new businesses in Silicon Valley. FLATOW: But a business is supposed to make money. BILTON: Well, that's exactly - it's funny. I just thought to myself did I just use the right word there when I said business? (LAUGHTER) BILTON: That's true. So, you know, Google and Facebook are offering $3 billion to $4 billion for this company and venture capitalists are throwing money into it, you know, like it's some kind of golden rainbow. FLATOW: Right. BILTON: And the reality is Snapchat literally has made $0 in revenue. And so that's the anomaly of the Valley. But, you know, I mean, when you look at the Twitter story, you know, through the book I tell these stories of this company that is. . . FLATOW: Mm-hmm. BILTON: . . . it's just growing immensely. You know, they're on the cover of Time magazine. The founders go on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show. \" They're featured, you know, on the cover of every newspaper across America at some point or another and yet they have $0 in revenue. FLATOW: Could the. . . BILTON: But, eventually. . . FLATOW: Yes. Yes. BILTON: They eventually - they start to make money. FLATOW: But could there be a social media bubble growing where people. . . BILTON: I absolutely think there is. I think there's a technology bubble right now. FLATOW: Yeah. BILTON: You know, I mean, you know, Snapchat is worth $3 billion to $4 billion. You have Pinterest that just raised money at over $3. 5 billion. They'll have $0 in revenue. You have fab. com which is worth $1 billion and they're not profitable. I mean I could just probably just use the rest of the show just going through a list of companies that are worth X billions of dollars and have no revenue. Or very little revenue. And I think that there's this - because of the companies that do make money, which is the Facebooks and the Twitters and the Googles and so on, and they make so much of it, I think that there is an irrational exuberance by the venture capitalists and people here in the Valley that think that they can - they know which one is going to be the next Twitter or Facebook. FLATOW: So any new idea, really, can draw some venture money to it. BILTON: Yeah. And the irony, I think, of this whole thing is, you know, with these stories is they're all going after the teen market. Right? FLATOW: Yeah. BILTON: If you have teens you're, like, the next big thing. But as all these reports have shown, a Pew Research report, a Piper Jaffray report, have all shown that teens, they have about, like, a two-year lifespan on a startup and then they're just gone. So they were, you know, 85 percent of teens in 2007, 2006 were on MySpace. FLATOW: Right. BILTON: Now it's seven percent. FLATOW: My what? What was that called? My? BILTON: Exactly. FLATOW: Yeah. BILTON: And the numbers are happening now with Facebook where they're dropping off and they're going into other places. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. But then you sell the company and you get out, right? You've made your billions. BILTON: Well, if you're lucky enough. FLATOW: Yeah. BILTON: But, you know, if you're lucky enough. But then, you know, there are - do you remember the company Chat Roulette? FLATOW: No. I don't. (LAUGHTER) BILTON: So Chat Roulette. It was the darling of - it was everywhere. FLATOW: Yeah. BILTON: It was picked up in every newspaper, magazine. It was this kid in Russia who'd built it in his bedroom and it was worth, you know, millions and millions of dollars. FLATOW: Right. BILTON: And he chose not to sell it, even though he had all of these offers, because he thought it was going to be bigger. And as I just said, do you remember it; and you said no. FLATOW: No. BILTON: So it's gone. FLATOW: Yeah. A lot of people complain about Facebook's seemingly disregard for privacy, but Twitter has always sort of had this higher ethical standard. Have they maintained that idea? Is it slipping? And now that they're going to be bought out, when they're bought out, you know? BILTON: Yeah. It's a great question. It's one of the things that actually really drew me to write this book, actually more than anything.

I'm Guy Raz. And our show today is all about misconceptions. So here's something we all know, right, it absolutely sucks to be a Chinese factory worker. Right? (SOUNDBITE OF VARIOUS NEWS REPORTS)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: Long hours and low wages. Forced labor, dangerous environment. . . UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: Work environments are dangerous and living conditions are humiliating. . . UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: And a growing number of these workers are either killing themselves or trying to. RAZ: Leslie Chang was a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in China for 10 years. And she wanted to see for herself if in fact it was so hard to be a worker in a Chinese factory. Here's the opening from her TED talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)LESLIE T. CHANG: Hi. So I'd like to talk a little bit about the people who make the things we use every day. Our shoes, our handbags, our computers and cellphones. It's taken for granted that Chinese factories are oppressive and that it's our desire for cheap goods that makes them so. So this simple narrative equating Western demand and Chinese suffering is appealing. Especially at a time when many of us already feel guilty about our impact on the world. But it's also inaccurate and disrespectful. Chinese workers are not forced into factories because of our insatiable desire for iPods. They choose to leave their homes in order to earn money, to learn new skills and to see the world. RAZ: This is like so counterintuitive. This is not what many of us have been led to believe. CHANG: That was kind of the starting point for my research into factory workers in China - was that everyone always assumes, oh, these poor workers - they're suffering, they're slaves all for the sake of making our iPhones and iPads and iPods. And I was thinking, even before I went down to these factory towns, that can't be true. There can't be millions of people who are leaving their villages and going to the cities purely to suffer. I mean, that isn't how things work. RAZ: Right, can we go back to the narrative that we thought we knew, right? The New York Times had this whole series on it. There were - there was the infamous stories by Mike Daisey and his one-man show. I mean, where does that narrative come from? I mean, it can't be entirely false. CHANG: It depends on what you're asking. I mean, certainly there are cases where workers have terrible conditions - where they get injured, where they get killed on the job. What I'm saying is it doesn't happen to every worker, which you might say, of course, that's obvious. We know it doesn't happen to every worker. But when you only write stories about the abuses and the injuries, it really gives people an impression that these people are just suffering 24/7. And that's what motivated me to go down to Dongguan, this factory city in South China, for the first time. RAZ: What are some of, like, the products that we use that are made in Dongguan? CHANG: Oh, gosh. Everything. Everything connected with your mobile phone, desktop computer, laptop computers. Nokia has a big plant. Samsung has a big plant. They make handbags. They make Coach bags. The Sports Sac, Dooney and Burke. Clothing, housewares, shoes - Adidas, Nike, Reebok.  Plastic - everything. Basically, anything you think of when you think of made in China is probably made in some form in Dongguan. RAZ: And in Dongguan, Leslie spent about two years getting to know lots of factory workers down there. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CHANG: Certain subjects came up over and over - how much money they made, what kind of husband they hope to marry, whether they should jump to another factory or stay where they were. Other subjects came up almost never. Including living conditions, that to me, looked close to prison life. Ten or 15 workers in one room. Fifty people sharing a single bathroom. Days and nights ruled by the factory clock. Everyone they knew lived in similar circumstances and it was still better than the dormitories and homes of rural China. The workers really spoke about the products they made. And they often had great difficulty explaining what exactly they did. When I asked Lu Qing Min - the young woman I got to know best - what exactly she did on the factory floor, she said something to me in Chinese that sounded like chu xi (ph). Only much later did I realize that she'd been saying QC or quality control. Karl Marx saw this as the tragedy of capitalism - the alienation of the worker from the product of his labor. But like so many theories that Marx arrived at, sitting in the reading room of the British Museum, he got this one wrong. Just because a person spends her time making a piece of something, does not mean that she becomes that - a piece of something. What she does with the money she earns, what she learns in that place and how it changes her - these are the things that matter. RAZ: So this young woman that you got to know, Min, right, in Dongguan, what did she think about how conflicted, you know, so many people are about all this in the West? I mean, would she even care? CHANG: No. No, they don't. She doesn't and the workers that I've met don't. And that's another huge misconception that I feel about how American consumers see these Chinese workers - in a very abstract way is they assume that that worker is thinking, oh, it's so horrible, the person buying this is so rich and I'm so poor. It's so terrible. My iPhone - I'd have to work five months to be able to afford to buy an iPhone. I mean, they're not thinking these things at all, you know. As far as all the work I've encountered, they're thinking, OK, I want to save this much money this month and then I want to go take an English class. And then I want to jump to another factory and become a secretary. And then I want to marry my boyfriend. And then I want to live in the city. And then I want to - you know, they're thinking about their own plans and their own futures. And the product they're making is exactly that, it's a product. It's just a tool for their own life and their own future. And why is that so different from a worker anywhere else? (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CHANG: The first time I met Min she had just turned 18 and quit her first job on the assembly line of an electronics factory. Over the next two years, I watched as she switched jobs five times, eventually landing a lucrative post in the purchasing department of a hardware factory. Later, she married a fellow migrant worker, moved with him to his village, gave birth to two daughters, and saved enough money to buy a secondhand Buick for herself and an apartment for her parents. She recently returned to Dongguan on her own to take a job in a factory that makes construction cranes, temporarily leaving her husband and children back in the village. In a recent e-mail to me, she explained a person should have some ambition while she is young so that in old age she can look back on her life and feel that it was not lived to no purpose. RAZ: I mean, that's social mobility. I mean, clearly she moved to a different class. And is the assumption that her children will be educated and won't work in factories? CHANG: Yeah. I think this story of industrialization and urbanization is a story of millions of people leaving their villages and moving to the cities and becoming middle-class. And someone like Min, she is now living in the city with her husband and her two kids. And, yeah, eventually those girls will become indistinguishable from other city girls. So yeah, it's a huge story of social mobility, which is the story of China. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CHANG: Across China there are 150 million workers like her, one-third of them women, who have left their villages to work in the factories, the hotels, the restaurants and the construction sites of the big cities. Together, they make up the largest migration in history. And it is globalization, this chain that begins in a Chinese farming village and ends with iPhones in our pockets and Nikes on our feet and Coach handbags on our arms, that has changed the way these millions of people work and marry and live and think. Very few of them would want to go back to the way things used to be. RAZ: Someone might be hearing this lesson and they might say, well, I mean, you're just absolving us of our responsibility in this sort of cycle. I mean, are you? CHANG: I don't know where that assumption of guilt comes from. I mean, this is the global marketplace. Why is it that when we buy products we automatically have to assume guilt along our purchases, you know? I mean, I think, how does this story of a poor farmer's children making these products tie in with this other image we have of China, which is this monolithic giant that's about to swallow up America? These two pictures kind of don't match, right? So what I get from that is it's good to have this curiosity and to try to figure out more of how - what is the complicated picture of China today? RAZ: Why do you think the main narrative was so attractive - like, was so appealing? CHANG: A few reasons. I mean, I think Americans - Westerners - often well-meaning - feel a lot of guilt about all of the wealth that they have and this awareness that the people who're making these products don't have any kind of wealth. And sometimes it can be condescension. Like, assuming that those people who are very poor and ignorant and don't have any thoughts and are only doing this because they have no choice. And when you really kind of look into their lives, you realize that many of them are very intelligent, very thoughtful, have very complicated lives and a lot of inspiration and aspiration for their own futures. RAZ: Leslie Chang, her book about this is called \"Factory Girls. \" You can find her full talk at TED. com. GUY RAZ, HOST:  It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. And our show today is all about misconceptions. So here's something we all know, right, it absolutely sucks to be a Chinese factory worker. Right? (SOUNDBITE OF VARIOUS NEWS REPORTS) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: Long hours and low wages. Forced labor, dangerous environment. . . UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: Work environments are dangerous and living conditions are humiliating. . . UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: And a growing number of these workers are either killing themselves or trying to. RAZ: Leslie Chang was a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in China for 10 years. And she wanted to see for herself if in fact it was so hard to be a worker in a Chinese factory. Here's the opening from her TED talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) LESLIE T. CHANG: Hi. So I'd like to talk a little bit about the people who make the things we use every day. Our shoes, our handbags, our computers and cellphones. It's taken for granted that Chinese factories are oppressive and that it's our desire for cheap goods that makes them so. So this simple narrative equating Western demand and Chinese suffering is appealing. Especially at a time when many of us already feel guilty about our impact on the world. But it's also inaccurate and disrespectful. Chinese workers are not forced into factories because of our insatiable desire for iPods. They choose to leave their homes in order to earn money, to learn new skills and to see the world. RAZ: This is like so counterintuitive. This is not what many of us have been led to believe. CHANG: That was kind of the starting point for my research into factory workers in China - was that everyone always assumes, oh, these poor workers - they're suffering, they're slaves all for the sake of making our iPhones and iPads and iPods. And I was thinking, even before I went down to these factory towns, that can't be true. There can't be millions of people who are leaving their villages and going to the cities purely to suffer. I mean, that isn't how things work. RAZ: Right, can we go back to the narrative that we thought we knew, right? The New York Times had this whole series on it. There were - there was the infamous stories by Mike Daisey and his one-man show. I mean, where does that narrative come from? I mean, it can't be entirely false. CHANG: It depends on what you're asking. I mean, certainly there are cases where workers have terrible conditions - where they get injured, where they get killed on the job.

I'm Don Gonyea. Some news this week got us thinking about how radically our viewing habits are changing. The broadband service company, Sandvine, released a study that shows that Netflix and YouTube now account for more than half of the data we consume on fixed networks, which is to say at home or work. It's just one more bit of evidence that Americans are increasingly turning to online video sources for news and entertainment, rather than TV, which mean advertisers have to do the same. To talk more about what advertisers are doing, we've called up Mike Shields, Adweek's digital editor. He joins us from our bureau in New York. Mike, welcome. MIKE SHIELDS: Thank you. GONYEA: So YouTube reigns supreme over Internet usage. What does that mean for advertisers who traditionally would have relied on television to find an audience? SHIELDS: Well, it's interesting because for a lot of folks, let's say 35 or over, 40 or over, YouTube's a search engine for video. It's a place where you see viral videos. But for Millenials and younger, it's really like a primary form of entertainment. There are huge stars on YouTube who have massive followings. Kids and teens and tweens have subscribed to channels and have real relationships with these artists. And it's still a place where I think advertisers are reckoning with about how to advertise that environment. On the flipside, every brand in the industry now is trying to become a publisher themselves and putting out YouTube videos. They're acting like media companies on YouTube. GONYEA: And I've read that spending on online video advertising is expected to almost double just this year from last, to over $4 billion. What are the kind of ads that major companies are making for the YouTube audience? SHIELDS: Really, right now the kind of ads you see on YouTube are repurposed TV ads. I mean, that's generally what brands have done. Everyone has always been crying out for advertisers to do something better, do something really over the Web and interactive. That's still, I would say, the exception right now. It's still mostly TV ads. GONYEA: What's the risk in that? SHIELDS: Well, the complaint you always hear is you're asking someone to sit through a 30-second ad running before a minute and a half of content. You know, the deal on TV is everybody complains about commercials but it's a pretty fair deal. You get a half-hour show, you get to watch maybe half a dozen commercials. The balance is kind of off when you're throwing TV spots in front of video content. These brands spend, you know, half a million dollars on a TV spot. They don't necessarily inclined to do something unique for the Web. They want to get the most out of that and reuse it. GONYEA: At some point it seems like they're going to have to flip that though. SHIELDS: Yeah, I mean, these things take time. There's a lot of inertia in the television business. I mean, you're talking about Web video advertising doubling but, you know, the TV industry's still really healthy. It might also be like a generational change that has to happen, you know. The guys that control the dollars are still of a certain age and generation. Things have tended to move slow in this regard. GONYEA: Let's go back to the experience of watching an ad on YouTube. We're going to play a clip of a ChapStick ad that we heard on YouTube this morning. (SOUNDBITE OF CHAPSTICK AD)GONYEA: That feels like one of those television ads. SHIELDS: Well, the first thing I think of is someone's going to be reaching for the skip button really quick. That's the thing about YouTube. Google sells what they call true view ads on YouTube, which let you skip after a certain number of seconds. You know, there's people in the ad industry that think that's an impossible burden. Even in a 30-second spot, some of these things have to build over time, right, so it's a very difficult bar. GONYEA: I find myself watching that five-second countdown and not even looking at the ad. SHIELDS: Yeah, I mean, that's tough. You know, you can train yourself on the Web to not pay attention to bad ads. People have gotten really good about that. And now with Web video, you train yourself to, like, OK, I'm watching a video; I'm gearing up to skip at soon as I can. I think that's why you're seeing a lot of brands saying, you know what? We're going to be content producers ourselves; play made-for-the-Web spots that are a minute or two minutes long. They're not skipable because they are the content. You're going to have a new generation of creative artists that have to think a really different way for the YouTube world. GONYEA: Mike Shields is the digital editor at Adweek. Thanks for joining us.

I'm Arun Rath. On Thursday, authorities in Canada announced they had busted an enormous international child pornography operation. It was the end of a three-year investigation into a website that trafficked in illicit videos of young boys. Three hundred and forty-eight people have been arrested in connection with the videos, 76 of them in the U. S. Investigations like this end with press conferences and high-profile trials, but they begin far away from the public eye with one of the most difficult jobs in the world. NPR's Rebecca Hersher reports. But first, a warning. This story contains content that some listeners may find disturbing. REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: Rich Brown knows how to crack a child pornography case. For decades, he was a cop for the New Jersey State Police. He worked on the Internet crimes against children task force. And part of his job was to look through suspects' hard drives, image by image, which meant he saw some terrible, terrible things. RICHARD BROWN: You know, there's - I think there's certain things that are more difficult. I do remember seeing the first molestation video. It was a husband that was molesting his two daughters. HERSHER: When he went home at night, it was difficult for Brown to forget what he had seen. BROWN: I have two boys, and I remember being ultra-protective of my boys during the time that I was involved with this type of work, and I think that's pretty common. HERSHER: Brown says this kind of work can be traumatic. Some officers had trouble sleeping or marriage problems. But cops are no longer the only people getting paid to review images of child pornography. The rise of Internet porn has created a shadow industry of people working for tech companies like Google, Microsoft and Facebook. They spend eight hours a day, 40 hours a week looking at pictures and videos and asking themselves, is this child pornography? SARAH ROBERTS: This is a shadow industry by design. So you're not going to find an association of commercial content moderators publishing statistics and necessarily making themselves known in that way. There's value to the invisibility. HERSHER: That's Sarah Roberts of Western University. She's one of the few people who systematically studies those who do this work. She says even though the Internet couldn't function without content moderators, very few have heard of them, even within the tech industry. ROBERTS: A lot of them are under nondisclosure agreements, so they're precluded from speaking to the media, and it is difficult to reach out and find them. And I think there's an aspect of trauma that can often go along with this work, and many workers would rather go home and tune out and not talk about it. So I think the unknown aspect of this work is certainly by design. It's no mistake that it's difficult to find workers who will talk to you about this. HERSHER: Microsoft and Google both declined to put me in touch with any of the people who review images for their services. Samantha Doerr is the director of child protection at Microsoft. SAMANTHA DOERR: It's a yucky job. In fact, Microsoft has to invest in, you know, wellness programs for people that work on this. HERSHER: In March, Microsoft and eight other tech companies came out with guidelines for such wellness programs. They suggest employees take their minds off traumatic content by, for example, taking a 15-minute walk or engaging in a hobby. Many companies have a counseling hotline for employees. But Sarah Roberts says that may not be enough. ROBERTS: We're also talking about a culture in which your success at your job is directly tied to your ability to stomach this imagery. So if someone were to access these kinds of support services, there may be an implicit suggestion that they're not cut out for the work that they're trying to do for a living. HERSHER: Doerr says Internet service providers are investing in ways to decrease the number of people who need to do this kind of work, and with good reason. DOERR: Unlike any other kind of, you know, offensive or illegal content online, the image itself is a crime scene, and every new viewing of that image is a re-victimization of that child. HERSHER: Scott Rubin is a spokesman for Google. SCOTT RUBIN: When we become aware of one of those images, we will create this digital signature. It's like a fingerprint. It's a series of ones and zeroes unique to that particular image. HERSHER: In an effort to automate the process, Microsoft and Google have both created such software. Tagged pictures are sent to a database at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which coordinates with law enforcement. And earlier this year, Twitter also began using the Microsoft program to screen every photo posted to that site. But despite the software advances, the need for content moderators is still growing. And Sarah Roberts says that workers she's spoken to often feel stigmatized. ROBERTS: They've said things to me like, you don't want an Internet without our interventions. But at the same time it's exacting a toll on these workers. And because this industry is so new and the need for this work is so new, I think the jury is out as to what the real implications are going to be for these people later on in their life. HERSHER: And as demand grows, companies are looking to cheap foreign workers to do some of the most difficult work. Rebecca Hersher, NPR News. ARUN RATH, HOST:  It's ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Arun Rath. On Thursday, authorities in Canada announced they had busted an enormous international child pornography operation. It was the end of a three-year investigation into a website that trafficked in illicit videos of young boys. Three hundred and forty-eight people have been arrested in connection with the videos, 76 of them in the U. S. Investigations like this end with press conferences and high-profile trials, but they begin far away from the public eye with one of the most difficult jobs in the world. NPR's Rebecca Hersher reports. But first, a warning. This story contains content that some listeners may find disturbing. REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: Rich Brown knows how to crack a child pornography case. For decades, he was a cop for the New Jersey State Police. He worked on the Internet crimes against children task force. And part of his job was to look through suspects' hard drives, image by image, which meant he saw some terrible, terrible things. RICHARD BROWN: You know, there's - I think there's certain things that are more difficult. I do remember seeing the first molestation video. It was a husband that was molesting his two daughters. HERSHER: When he went home at night, it was difficult for Brown to forget what he had seen. BROWN: I have two boys, and I remember being ultra-protective of my boys during the time that I was involved with this type of work, and I think that's pretty common. HERSHER: Brown says this kind of work can be traumatic. Some officers had trouble sleeping or marriage problems. But cops are no longer the only people getting paid to review images of child pornography. The rise of Internet porn has created a shadow industry of people working for tech companies like Google, Microsoft and Facebook. They spend eight hours a day, 40 hours a week looking at pictures and videos and asking themselves, is this child pornography? SARAH ROBERTS: This is a shadow industry by design. So you're not going to find an association of commercial content moderators publishing statistics and necessarily making themselves known in that way. There's value to the invisibility. HERSHER: That's Sarah Roberts of Western University. She's one of the few people who systematically studies those who do this work. She says even though the Internet couldn't function without content moderators, very few have heard of them, even within the tech industry. ROBERTS: A lot of them are under nondisclosure agreements, so they're precluded from speaking to the media, and it is difficult to reach out and find them. And I think there's an aspect of trauma that can often go along with this work, and many workers would rather go home and tune out and not talk about it. So I think the unknown aspect of this work is certainly by design. It's no mistake that it's difficult to find workers who will talk to you about this. HERSHER: Microsoft and Google both declined to put me in touch with any of the people who review images for their services. Samantha Doerr is the director of child protection at Microsoft. SAMANTHA DOERR: It's a yucky job. In fact, Microsoft has to invest in, you know, wellness programs for people that work on this. HERSHER: In March, Microsoft and eight other tech companies came out with guidelines for such wellness programs. They suggest employees take their minds off traumatic content by, for example, taking a 15-minute walk or engaging in a hobby. Many companies have a counseling hotline for employees. But Sarah Roberts says that may not be enough. ROBERTS: We're also talking about a culture in which your success at your job is directly tied to your ability to stomach this imagery. So if someone were to access these kinds of support services, there may be an implicit suggestion that they're not cut out for the work that they're trying to do for a living. HERSHER: Doerr says Internet service providers are investing in ways to decrease the number of people who need to do this kind of work, and with good reason. DOERR: Unlike any other kind of, you know, offensive or illegal content online, the image itself is a crime scene, and every new viewing of that image is a re-victimization of that child. HERSHER: Scott Rubin is a spokesman for Google. SCOTT RUBIN: When we become aware of one of those images, we will create this digital signature. It's like a fingerprint. It's a series of ones and zeroes unique to that particular image. HERSHER: In an effort to automate the process, Microsoft and Google have both created such software. Tagged pictures are sent to a database at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which coordinates with law enforcement. And earlier this year, Twitter also began using the Microsoft program to screen every photo posted to that site. But despite the software advances, the need for content moderators is still growing. And Sarah Roberts says that workers she's spoken to often feel stigmatized. ROBERTS: They've said things to me like, you don't want an Internet without our interventions. But at the same time it's exacting a toll on these workers. And because this industry is so new and the need for this work is so new, I think the jury is out as to what the real implications are going to be for these people later on in their life. HERSHER: And as demand grows, companies are looking to cheap foreign workers to do some of the most difficult work.

Along with five other countries, they'll be trying to figure out a way forward on Iran's controversial nuclear program. But aside from the public press conferences and official statements, a lot of the stories played out online, especially on the Iranian side. In fact, Iran has launched a kind of online charm offensive with a new English language website and Twitter feeds and Facebook pages for top officials. Robin Wright has been following all this. She's an expert on Iran and a senior fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Center. Robin, thank you for joining us. ROBIN WRIGHT: Great to be with you. RATH: So I want to start off with the English language website. It was launched earlier this month apparently by the government. And the website is nuclearenergy. ir. Could you describe what it looks like and what they're trying to do? WRIGHT: Well, the most interesting thing is that it's in English, so it's clearly an attempt to reach out to the outside world, most notably the United States. And it is very sophisticated in that it deals with all the key questions of what Iran is doing in its various nuclear sites, what its intentions are. And it puts out Iran's case in what is sophisticated, thoughtful language now. There are probably a lot of nuclear experts who would say this presents only part of the story, but it is interesting that it came out just on the eve of the first round of talks in Geneva. RATH: Of course, the Iranians aren't just building websites, but there's been this active engagement through social media. Who among the main Iranian political figures are using social networks? WRIGHT: It's astounding actually that since the election in June - or actually since the campaign, many in - of the candidates in Iran started campaigning on Twitter or on their Facebook pages, even though both sites are technically illegal. But so many people in Iran have access through dialing in through foreign channels that they have access to what's going on. And the president of Iran actually had an account in English. And he has, since being elected in June, used his Twitter and Facebook pages to reach out to the world, to try to define his program to Iranians. Now, during the last round of talks in Geneva, President Hassan Rouhani tweeted 10 times during the day, during the last of three days of talks, saying: The West should not miss out this unique opportunity. Our nation is participating in the Geneva negotiations with strong will and determination. The supreme leader of Iran tweeted the last day in English on his Twitter account: Our negotiators are children of the revolution. We strongly support those in charge of our diplomacy, which was actually designed to push back against the hard-liners in Iran who rejected or questioned the diplomatic outreach by Iran to try to find something other than a military confrontation over its nuclear program. So it's been really interesting to see what is the most ambitious public diplomacy campaign since Iran's 1979 revolution. RATH: Twitter is banned - I'm assuming that it's condemned in some way. How do they square that, that when a supreme leader is out and active on the service himself? WRIGHT: Well, there are a lot of Iranians who are making that point. And, in fact, when the foreign minister was in New York at the opening of the United Nations General Assembly, he was tweeting regular accounts of his meetings and what he was doing, very kind of familiar accounts. He would tell about how some of the meetings were so boring he could barely keep his eyes open and so forth. And at one point when he was on his way home, he tweeted that he was having a hard time getting service at some facility. And he had hundreds of people who came back and said to him, well, now you know what it's like for the rest of us in Iran. It's very interesting how social media is being used by the new Iranian government but also being a source to hold the new Iranian government to account. RATH: That's Robin Wright. She's a senior fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Center. And you can find her analysis at iranprimer. com. Robin, thank you so much. WRIGHT: Thank you.

He summoned industry executives, watchdogs and law enforcement to Number 10 Downing Street. The result was an ambitious new initiative aimed at curtailing some, though not all, online access to child pornography. Vicki Barker has the story and the back-story. VICKI BARKER, BYLINE: Last July, David Cameron issued a pointed challenge to the giants of the Web. The British prime minister, a father of young children, simply refused to accept the companies' argument that there was little they could do to stop people accessing indecent images of children. PRIME MINISTER DAVID CAMERON: I have a very clear message for Google, Bing, Yahoo and the rest. You have a duty to act on this and it is a moral duty. BARKER: Fail to act, Cameron suggested, and he'd push for legislation making it a legal duty. What followed was an intensive collaboration among Internet companies and watchdogs, law enforcement officials, and the British government. And today, Microsoft and Google, which, together, account for 95 percent of online searches, said they're introducing algorithms to block up to 100,000 search terms for child pornography. And other Internet firms are following suit. Peter Barron of Google. PETER BARRON: Child sexual abuse is illegal in every country around the world. There's consensus on that. And it's absolutely right that we identify it, remove it, and report it to the authorities. BARKER: People using Microsoft's Bing or Google or any other participating search engines to look for images of child sexual abuse will instead see a warning that it's illegal. Joanna Shields is the U. K. 's ambassador for digital industries. She was part of the consultation process and calls the breakthrough unprecedented. JOANNA SHIELDS: In the tests, we have not been able to find any illegal material. And this is the first time that we've been able to say that, that the tests have proven that. BARKER: The blocking software is being used for English-language terms at first. But it will be expanded to more than 150 languages and countries within six months. Conservative lawmaker Claire Perry. CLAIRE PERRY: So people right across the globe will be safer as a result of the action that Britain's taking today. BARKER: But Jim Gamble, a former police chief fighting child porn, says the new software will only catch the amateurs and dabblers. JIM GAMBLE: Pedophiles do not go online and search out their images on Google or Bing or Yahoo, for that matter. The hardcore pedophile lives in the deepest, darkest recesses of the Internet. BARKER: True, says Internet watchdog John Carr, but the most hardcore pedophiles started out as amateurs and dabblers. Carr says the new blocks could deliver a salutary shock to them. JOHN CARR: For some of these guys, that will be enough to pull them up short. They'll stop and they'll never go back to it. BARKER: Among the measures being piloted is software that blocks pathways to torrent networks, the almost-untraceable peer-to-peer networks favored by serious pedophiles. Speaking after his summit, the prime minister couldn't hide a certain note of triumph. CAMERON: We really should be clear today that what we were previously told couldn't and shouldn't be done in terms of cleaning up searches for these vile terms, it will be done. It is being done. 100,000 terms in 159 countries, not just here in the U. K. BARKER: Cameron says the next step should be another collaboration. This one, between British and U. S. intelligence officials, targeting the so-called dark Web, where the worst of the abuse takes place. For NPR News, I'm Vicki Barker in London.

SIEGEL: And how big is the video game market? DAVISON: So this year, it'll be a little north of a $20 billion business, which - to put that into some context - movie box offices in 2013 will be a little over 10 billion. SIEGEL: Twice as big as movies, you're saying. DAVISON: Yep. SIEGEL: According to the Entertainment Software Association, they say 58 percent of Americans play video games. Do we know how many of them are people who own a console and, you know, put in serious time into doing that and how many like me may play against the free chess app once every few weeks, 'cause I can win against this thing. . . (LAUGHTER)DAVISON: I mean, it varies. I mean we know how many of the individual consoles sold. So something like the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 had sold between 70 and 80 million units worldwide. You know, in previous generations of hardware, we've seen that number go north of a hundred million worldwide and a good percentage of that is in the U. S. When you start looking at games on your phone, though - there's a game called \"Candy Crush Saga\" - they announced last week that they have now been downloaded half a billion times. (LAUGHTER)SIEGEL: These are like \"Angry Birds\" kind of numbers that you're talking about. DAVISON: Yeah. SIEGEL: So in that sense, there's a bit of that population that is familiar with playing games on at least a small screen. And then there still are millions and millions of people who own these consoles. DAVISON: Yes, I mean, very much so. And I think the - as a business, the games industry has relied on the 18 to 35-year-old guys that are still the real core of the audience. And we've seen that expand. And I think, as people have grown up with video games, they're introducing their kids to it now. They're introducing their spouses to it. And on the high-end of it - I'm sort of past the high-end of that now, and I. . . (LAUGHTER)DAVISON: . . . you know, my kids have grown up with video games around them all the time. And I think what we're seeing is that its gone from being this almost niche part of entertainment to being a real staple of everyone's entertainment diet. SIEGEL: Does the market look so good to Sony or other game developers that they can wait for more kids to grow up and have their own kids and play video games  or do they need to get older guys like me involved in this for the market to check out? DAVISON: Ultimately, we want everybody playing. I've been writing about video games for over 20 years.

I think one thing that is very encouraging right now is - much like in the movie business - there's a very thriving indie video game development scene. And it's global and these are small teams of people that are making very experimental and arty games that are pushing the boundaries of what people expect from a video game.

I'm Melissa Block. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  And I'm Robert Siegel. On Capitol Hill, a first today, a hearing on Bitcoin. That's the virtual currency that tech-types and venture capitalists are excited about and that government and law enforcement are wary of. Bitcoin is a type of digital cash that can make online transactions fast and easy, which appeals to criminal elements. It also makes transactions cheaper, which would be nice for the rest of us. Joining us is NPR technology correspondent Steve Henn. And, Steve, Bitcoin goes to Washington. Does that mean it's being taken seriously or that it's in some kind of trouble? STEVE HENN, BYLINE: Well, I think it would be very difficult for any government, including ours, to completely kill Bitcoin off. You know, Bitcoin is run on a completely decentralized volunteer network. So it's not like you could take out a central server and shut it down. What I think ultimately was at issue in the Senate hearing is whether or not this kind of digital payment method is going to become more closely integrated into the regulated financial system or really pushed further underground. And I think the early indications are pretty good for Bitcoin. Officials from the Justice Department and the Treasury Department testified today that virtual currencies like Bitcoin are not inherently illegal. But they still expressed some concern that currencies like these could be attractive to criminals because they can be used to launder money or perhaps create anonymous or nearly anonymous online transactions. SIEGEL: Now, one might have expected this hearing to be before the finance committee, but it was actually before the Senate committee that deals with homeland security because of a connection between Bitcoin and what's known as the Silk Road economy. Tell us about that. HENN: Well, the Silk Road was, until recently, a thriving online illegal marketplace. Depending on whose estimates you believe, the Silk Road site facilitated between 200 million and perhaps as much as $1 billion in illegal transactions, mostly drug deals. The thing that made the Silk Road famous was that it only accepted payments in Bitcoins. The theory on the site was that because Bitcoins aren't attached to a bank account, they wouldn't trigger typical money laundering alarms. And there's a widely held perception that Bitcoin transactions are anonymous. But in fact, that's simply not true. The way a computer knows that a Bitcoin is a real Bitcoin is that there's a public history of every transaction that piece of currency has been used in. That history is built into the code. In fact, that digital trail is likely to feature prominently in the persecution of the folks who allegedly created the Silk Road. SIEGEL: The prosecution of them, you mean. HENN: Right. SIEGEL: Now, what came out of the hearing today? And what's next for Bitcoin if it doesn't offer anonymity online? HENN: Well, I think what came out of this hearing is that regulators really don't want to quash this thing. There was a pretty big Bitcoin rally today with the virtual currency hitting all new time all-time highs. And I don't think Bitcoin's future is really on sites like the Silk Road. The thing that has venture capitalists so excited is that Bitcoin makes it possible to process online transactions for almost nothing. And that could be a big help in the developing world, as well as here at home. So there are some smart folks betting millions of dollars that if Bitcoin goes mainstream, it could actually undercut big companies like Visa and MasterCard and online commerce. SIEGEL: OK.

It's a word that's risen to new prominence. And the word is selfie. The Oxford people define it as, quote, a photograph that one has taken of oneself - typically, one taken with a smart phone or webcam and uploaded to a social media website, unquote. Since the announcement, people have been going selfie crazy on Twitter and Facebook. So we wanted to talk more about that. So we called Kate Myers, NPR's social media project manager. Welcome back, thank's so much for joining us once again. KATE MYERS, BYLINE: Thanks, Michel. MARTIN: So how did the word start? Do you remember? MYERS: Selfie, according to the Oxford Dictionary, came around 2002, I think, on the Internet as sort of a self-deprecating way to say here I am, and here I am and the rest of the world. MARTIN: Though, I think some people think it's rude. Like, it has an association with some rather untoward pictures that some have taken. Particularly people in the public view who are giving a little bit more of a public view than perhaps many of us would want. Former congressman, Anthony Weiner, comes to mind. But is that kind of the norm or is it really - most people aren't taking pictures of their underwear or whatever? MYERS: Luckily for us, most people are not taking such infamous pictures. Selfies are just a way to show that you are part of the world. Show here I am and the world is more interesting because I'm in it. Before, photographs and portraiture were only limited to a certain number of people. Now everybody has a camera in their pocket - almost everyone has a camera in their pocket all the time. She you can take a picture of yourself doing any number of different things. So it's a natural extension of an impulsive we've had for a long time. MARTIN: Have you noticed any kind - well, it's true. I mean, the Oxford Dictionaries people do make the point that self-portraiture has been around forever. And that this is something that, you know, the wealthy used to do to kind of show that they had arrived. They would commission portraits or they'd - painters would make portraits of themselves. Photographers - artists have always made, you know, art of themselves. Probably often 'cause they couldn't afford to pay, you know, models, right? MYERS: Well, exactly. That was one of the reasons that van Gogh was such a great self-portrait artists because he didn't have the money to pay models to actually model for him. The other thing that you saw, you saw a large rise of self-portraiture in the Renaissance because mirrors came out. So now you could see yourself and actually depict yourself out to the world. MARTIN: Have you noticed a trend in the kinds of pictures people like to send? For example, we were trying to coax one of our colleagues into posting a selfie and he said, nah, that's not a guy thing. Do you agree? MYERS: There's definitely some gender - ways that you can look at selfies from a gendered lens. And to have an ability for a woman to say I am going to put myself out there versus seeing myself through the lens of a man. MARTIN: Are there any surprising selfies that you've come across? MYERS: I certainly think the last few days have certainly covered a lot of those in the news. You've seen the selfie of the Pope, the Obama's in the White House, lots of celebrity selfies. MARTIN: Can we get through this conversation without mentioning Kim Kardashian? Can we? Can we? MYERS: I don't actually. . . MARTIN: Probably not. MYERS: I think that we're contractually required as soon as we start talking about selfies. MARTIN: Talk about Kim Kardashian and her images, pre-baby, especially, you know, post-baby. MYERS: It is a great way for someone to - especially someone who is photographed a lot by people not themselves - to say here I am and I am putting myself out into the world in the way that I see myself. MARTIN: And finally, why do we spell it -ie instead of -y. MYERS: The Oxford English Dictionary pointed out that they believe that it has - originally this spelling of selfie came out from Australia - that they originally sourced it to a 2002 message board posting. But the -ie ending is something that is common in Australian slang. Also now you've seen it be a little bit self-deprecating. When you're talking about taking a selfie, selfie connotes that it's a throwaway. And. . . MARTIN: A kinder, gentler self-portrait? MYERS: Exactly. MARTIN: Thanks Kate. Kate Myers is NPR's social media project manager. And some of us here at TELL ME MORE have posted our own selfies. Just go to NPR. org/TELLMEMORE to check them out.

And while you're checking out those holiday bargains, somebody or something may be checking you out. Stores may not only be reaching into your pocket for your cash, but also for your smartphone. Yeah. Some retailers are tracking customers through their phones, using your smartphone to learn about your shopping habits. You like that? You're upset by that? Is there a way to shop under the radar? What information can stores grab from the phones? Yeah. Quentin Hardy is deputy technology editor at The New York Times. He's based out there in San Francisco, California. Welcome. QUENTIN HARDY: It's great to be here. FLATOW: Wow. You know? What are they learning about us from our phones as we're shopping? HARDY: Well, any number of things, but let's start with the simple stuff. There's a company out here I wrote about called Euclid Analytics. And this was some guys who came out of Google and realized something pretty smart. That is that the phone is signaling cellular towers, but the phone companies also want you to kind of move off when possible. They can't have too many people in the spectrum crowding it out. They're trying to offload you to Wi-Fi, you know, in-house wireless networks. So these are in a lot of phones. And so the phone is always pinging to see if there's a Wi-Fi antenna, a little Wi-Fi network you can get off of. And that ping, that test is information itself. You can see if somebody's coming by and if they ping that antenna. And a store might be interested in this, you know, take a little bit of the Euclid software and tell us, well, when they change the display, did more people seem to come into the store? They walk by slower? If you have two antennas, of course, you can triangulate and see whether they actually came into the store and where they went into the store once they got inside. FLATOW: So they're looking to see where - what parts of the store you're shopping at. HARDY: That's right. FLATOW: Are they at the point where if they see that you're standing in front of the socks, they're going to give you an ad on your phone for socks or something? HARDY: Well, that's something we talked about doing someday. They're not doing that now. But recently, Apple added something called iBeacon, which is another one of these wireless signals. And in this case, you - if you had a certain kind of app you got it onto your phone, yeah, it will offer you a coupon when you come in. And you may be standing in the handbags, and they'll say, hey, 30 percent off handbags. We know you're interested. FLATOW: Are there even video cameras that can detect the emotion that we're. . . HARDY: Oh, my gosh. There are cameras that tell where you went in the store, what the popular aisles are. When you read a digital sign, there might be a camera inside the sign to see if you like it, if you were happy, if the kid liked it, so you stayed. They can tell, you know, the height of the person who looked at it. There are identifiers all over society now, of course. Yesterday, I was at Intel, and they bragged about a company they worked with in China that could identify every license plate going down the highway in 300 milliseconds. FLATOW: This is, you know, this is beginning to sound like \"Minority Report,\" you know, where - which tracks people's vision. . . HARDY: Well, yes. This is the future we've chosen. (LAUGHTER)FLATOW: . . . which, you know, what I'm talking about? He was walking through, and they would look at his eye and see what he's looking at, and then an ad would pop up and offer him something to buy. HARDY: Well, yeah. Philip K. Dick, the guy who wrote that story, was a genius and, you know, satire is based on the present, right? What can I say? There - in many ways, there are elements of this. And that seems sinister and horrifying to some extent, but it's also so very convenient. And that's the way they sell it to you. And it's an interesting thing, Ira. They really put it in the context of Internet shopping. When I first saw these guys at Euclid, the ones doing the Wi-Fi, they said, we're trying to give to brick-and-mortar stores the same kind of awareness that e-tailers get when you shop online. Because, of course, when you go online, they put cookies in your browser and track you that way. So, the kind of thing people use to find a little bit odd or creepy in the Internet is now a matter of course, and the question becomes, well, how do we get that Internet value out there in the real world, too? FLATOW: Yeah. Yeah. I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY, from NPR. Talking with Quentin Hardy, deputy technical - technology editor at The New York Times. Let's go to the phones, quick call here to John in Fairfax, Virginia. Hi, John. JOHN: How do you do? FLATOW: Hey, there. JOHN: Wonderful. I was wondering about the RFIDs. My understanding was that they could use those to inventory their stores so they can, presumably, identify when RFIDs - you pick up a shirt or a piece of nugget(ph) or something, and you're walk into the store with this RFID tag, and they can develop a profile on you as you walk to the store and pick stuff up. Can your guest say anything about that? HARDY: I've not heard of an application like that, but it certainly seems probable. FLATOW: And how widespread, then, is all of this snooping through your cellphone or the cameras and whatever? HARDY: I think the question is compared to when and heading to what, it's becoming more and more prevalent. And Nordstrom started it, and it got kind of a bad rap, so they shut down. But they will continue to do consumer education and let people know they're doing this. And in the name of convenience, I think many, many people would accept it. Say you were offered an hour's free parking to go into the store and spend five minutes looking at a display. You know, a lot of people would take that deal and sign over the privacy, wouldn't they? FLATOW: Yeah. But I bet a lot of people would also want to shut off their phone. Would that work. . . HARDY: Well. . . FLATOW: . . . if you did that? HARDY: Yes. If you - you can go into the settings and shut off the Wi-Fi, and that alone will work, and you can still get phone calls later in the store. And Euclid does put signs up, the retailers put signs up saying this is going on, that you're being tracked this way. FLATOW: And companies that are doing this is sort of bragging to Wall Street, saying give us some more money. We can do more of this tracking. HARDY: Well, they're looking for customers, that's for sure. FLATOW: Yeah. And where do you see this going? How fast is it moving? HARDY: It's moving very fast. We are in a position now where we can identify people in 3D. You know, you check into Foursquare, and you're being identified. You check in passively all the time. Your apps are being updated all the time. I had an interesting session the other day. I was giving a lecture in this class, and I asked everybody: How often are you on the Internet? Anybody here on more than three hours a day? And, you know, a couple people raised their hands. But the real answer is if you have a smartphone, you're on all the time, because you're being watched and apps are being updated and you don't really need to participate to be on the Internet anymore. FLATOW: Well, chilling thought to some people, I bet. (LAUGHTER)HARDY: They'll call it convenience. In many ways, they'll be offering you deals. They'll be. . . FLATOW: Yeah. HARDY: . . . sending you ads, they say, are more appropriate. And that's how it seems to be proceeding. FLATOW: All right, Quentin. Thank you very much for enlightening us. HARDY: Oh, it's a pleasure. FLATOW: Yeah. Keep that cellphone working. Quentin Hardy, deputy technology editor or The New York Times. We're going to take a break. When we come back, we're going to talk about which mission would you rather have: Curiosity or Cassini? Maybe - well, you won't have the choice, but some people may be making a choice about which one to turn off. Maybe we'll vote on it, see what you think. Stay with us. We'll be right back after this break. I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY, from NPR.

That is that the phone is signaling cellular towers, but the phone companies also want you to kind of move off when possible. They can't have too many people in the spectrum crowding it out. They're trying to offload you to Wi-Fi, you know, in-house wireless networks. So these are in a lot of phones. And so the phone is always pinging to see if there's a Wi-Fi antenna, a little Wi-Fi network you can get off of. And that ping, that test is information itself. You can see if somebody's coming by and if they ping that antenna. And a store might be interested in this, you know, take a little bit of the Euclid software and tell us, well, when they change the display, did more people seem to come into the store? They walk by slower? If you have two antennas, of course, you can triangulate and see whether they actually came into the store and where they went into the store once they got inside. FLATOW: So they're looking to see where - what parts of the store you're shopping at. HARDY: That's right. FLATOW: Are they at the point where if they see that you're standing in front of the socks, they're going to give you an ad on your phone for socks or something? HARDY: Well, that's something we talked about doing someday. They're not doing that now. But recently, Apple added something called iBeacon, which is another one of these wireless signals. And in this case, you - if you had a certain kind of app you got it onto your phone, yeah, it will offer you a coupon when you come in. And you may be standing in the handbags, and they'll say, hey, 30 percent off handbags. We know you're interested. FLATOW: Are there even video cameras that can detect the emotion that we're. . . HARDY: Oh, my gosh. There are cameras that tell where you went in the store, what the popular aisles are. When you read a digital sign, there might be a camera inside the sign to see if you like it, if you were happy, if the kid liked it, so you stayed. They can tell, you know, the height of the person who looked at it. There are identifiers all over society now, of course. Yesterday, I was at Intel, and they bragged about a company they worked with in China that could identify every license plate going down the highway in 300 milliseconds. FLATOW: This is, you know, this is beginning to sound like \"Minority Report,\" you know, where - which tracks people's vision. . . HARDY: Well, yes. This is the future we've chosen. (LAUGHTER) FLATOW: . . . which, you know, what I'm talking about? He was walking through, and they would look at his eye and see what he's looking at, and then an ad would pop up and offer him something to buy. HARDY: Well, yeah. Philip K. Dick, the guy who wrote that story, was a genius and, you know, satire is based on the present, right? What can I say? There - in many ways, there are elements of this. And that seems sinister and horrifying to some extent, but it's also so very convenient. And that's the way they sell it to you. And it's an interesting thing, Ira. They really put it in the context of Internet shopping. When I first saw these guys at Euclid, the ones doing the Wi-Fi, they said, we're trying to give to brick-and-mortar stores the same kind of awareness that e-tailers get when you shop online. Because, of course, when you go online, they put cookies in your browser and track you that way. So, the kind of thing people use to find a little bit odd or creepy in the Internet is now a matter of course, and the question becomes, well, how do we get that Internet value out there in the real world, too? FLATOW: Yeah. Yeah. I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY, from NPR. Talking with Quentin Hardy, deputy technical - technology editor at The New York Times. Let's go to the phones, quick call here to John in Fairfax, Virginia. Hi, John. JOHN: How do you do? FLATOW: Hey, there. JOHN: Wonderful. I was wondering about the RFIDs. My understanding was that they could use those to inventory their stores so they can, presumably, identify when RFIDs - you pick up a shirt or a piece of nugget(ph) or something, and you're walk into the store with this RFID tag, and they can develop a profile on you as you walk to the store and pick stuff up. Can your guest say anything about that? HARDY: I've not heard of an application like that, but it certainly seems probable. FLATOW: And how widespread, then, is all of this snooping through your cellphone or the cameras and whatever? HARDY: I think the question is compared to when and heading to what, it's becoming more and more prevalent. And Nordstrom started it, and it got kind of a bad rap, so they shut down. But they will continue to do consumer education and let people know they're doing this. And in the name of convenience, I think many, many people would accept it. Say you were offered an hour's free parking to go into the store and spend five minutes looking at a display. You know, a lot of people would take that deal and sign over the privacy, wouldn't they? FLATOW: Yeah. But I bet a lot of people would also want to shut off their phone. Would that work. . . HARDY: Well. . . FLATOW: . . . if you did that? HARDY: Yes. If you - you can go into the settings and shut off the Wi-Fi, and that alone will work, and you can still get phone calls later in the store. And Euclid does put signs up, the retailers put signs up saying this is going on, that you're being tracked this way. FLATOW: And companies that are doing this is sort of bragging to Wall Street, saying give us some more money. We can do more of this tracking. HARDY: Well, they're looking for customers, that's for sure. FLATOW: Yeah. And where do you see this going? How fast is it moving? HARDY: It's moving very fast. We are in a position now where we can identify people in 3D. You know, you check into Foursquare, and you're being identified. You check in passively all the time. Your apps are being updated all the time. I had an interesting session the other day. I was giving a lecture in this class, and I asked everybody: How often are you on the Internet? Anybody here on more than three hours a day? And, you know, a couple people raised their hands. But the real answer is if you have a smartphone, you're on all the time, because you're being watched and apps are being updated and you don't really need to participate to be on the Internet anymore. FLATOW: Well, chilling thought to some people, I bet. (LAUGHTER) HARDY: They'll call it convenience. In many ways, they'll be offering you deals. They'll be. . . FLATOW: Yeah. HARDY: . . . sending you ads, they say, are more appropriate. And that's how it seems to be proceeding. FLATOW: All right, Quentin. Thank you very much for enlightening us. HARDY: Oh, it's a pleasure. FLATOW: Yeah. Keep that cellphone working. Quentin Hardy, deputy technology editor or The New York Times. We're going to take a break. When we come back, we're going to talk about which mission would you rather have: Curiosity or Cassini? Maybe - well, you won't have the choice, but some people may be making a choice about which one to turn off. Maybe we'll vote on it, see what you think. Stay with us. We'll be right back after this break. I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY, from NPR.", "section": "Technology", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2013 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Each week, he joins us to talk about what's new and what's next. Welcome back, Carlos. CARLOS WATSON: Arun, always good to be with you. RATH: Good to have you back. You introduce us to Kathryn Finney this week. She's a black female tech entrepreneur, which is a really rare thing, and she's very discontent for that as a rare thing. Tell us what she's doing about it. WATSON: So, incredibly interesting woman, a Yale graduate, although she had heard for years that the dearth of women - and particularly women of color - in Silicon Valley companies was due to, quote, unquote, \"a pipeline issue,\" she said that's not true. There are great women out there who want to get involved, and so she launched a conference last year called Focus 100. Lo and behold, several hundred black women who were interested in launching tech startups showed up. And subsequently, she's built an entire company around it called Digital Undivided that is helping, in a sense, to incubate, mentor and, in some cases, find investment for black female entrepreneurs. And Kathryn's work has taken her to Detroit, to East Palo Alto, to parts of St. Louis, to Harlem, and she's saying there's incredible talent there as well. RATH: It was something from the piece that I found shocking. I mean, I expected there to be a disparity, but I think the figure was - am I right - 1 percent of venture capital money is going to African-Americans? WATSON: Sadly. And, by the way, less than 10 percent were women of any color. So part of Kathryn's view was there's a huge opportunity here, but she thought that it needed some coordinated incubating. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RATH: Now, that - that's pretty recognizable as a sound of a ukulele, but this one is designed in a unique way, right? WATSON: So these wonderful, guitar-like instruments for years have required really fancy woods and other things. If you were building a classic ukulele from the acacia tree on Hawaii, you'd use something called koa. But a guy named Joe Lutwack in San Francisco - who is very environmentally focused - said, is there a way that we could build a premium instrument but do it in a way that was eco friendly, and consequently helped create a number of interesting materials, including one that he calls e-Koa. And so he won't give us too much on what goes into those ingredients, but what we know is that these beautiful instruments aren't just used by everyday people, but the guy who's known as the Jimi Hendrix of the ukulele space - a guy named Jake Shimabukuro - even uses them himself. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RATH: Finally, Carlos, there's a piece from you this week about this hotel in Hong Kong that - well, why don't you tell us why it's so amazing. WATSON: Well, Arun, now, I've traveled to over 50 countries, from Iceland to Zimbabwe. I've probably stayed in, by my last count, some 500 hotels. But my favorite hotel in all the world is a space in Hong Kong called the Upper House. Now, this hotel's a couple of years old, an absolutely stunningly designed hotel, with the most magical service ever. So I love to play basketball, Arun - not a very skilled basketball player - but everywhere in the world I go, I love to play. I was having the hardest time finding a court in Hong Kong, and I had been there no less than 12 hours before they found me a midnight basketball game packed with 50 other Hong Kong natives playing basketball in the steamy heat. And so. . . RATH: It's quite a concierge that can hook you up with midnight basketball in Hong Kong.

It's ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR West. I'm Arun Rath. We've all been there. You start out with just one episode of a new TV show and before you know it things spiral out of control. I watched four seasons of \"Breaking Bad\" in less than two weeks. I know. I hated myself. And networks are trying to capitalize on our binge-watching habits. Last week, after a fierce bidding war, the Fox spinoff channel, FXX, won the rights to make all seasons of \"The Simpsons\" available for online streaming. It might be the largest TV syndication deal ever. Anthony Breznican is a senior writer at Entertainment Weekly, and he's been paying attention to the deal. Anthony, welcome to the show. ANTHONY BREZNICAN: Happy to be here. RATH: So \"The Simpsons'\" deal, this is going to allow people to binge-watch the show, and I know people are going to do that. But will \"The Simpsons\" streaming be commercial free? : Well, that's probably not going to happen in the near future. They like to keep commercials as a part of their programming. If you want it commercial free, you're going to have to get DVDs. RATH: That's so 2005. : Yeah, exactly. RATH: So mostly with binge-watching, we associate it with streaming services like Netflix or other online services that have been at the forefront. But now, networks are trying to get in on it. What do you make of that? : They're really looking toward the future. Right now, there's a movement afoot called cutting the cord. I don't know if you've heard about that. . . RATH: Yeah. : . . . where people look at their cable bills, like I did recently, and saw $130 going out the door every month for hundreds of channels that we don't watch. And if you could choose ala carte which channels you want, you could perhaps save a lot of money. And I think that's what Fox is looking at with \"The Simpsons. \": Really, there are no fans of AMC. There are fans of \"Mad Men\" and \"Breaking Bad. \" And so FXX, their streaming service, I think, is going to be very important over the next 10 years as we see how the consumer relationship with streaming services shakes out. RATH: Well, and what's weird now is that they're making the shows, it feels like, with that in mind. Say, the \"Arrested Development\" season that was on Netflix. . . : Mm-hmm. Exactly. RATH: . . . they sort of interconnected them in a way that - like watching them as a whole was part of the fun of it. Is that the direction that you think we're moving? : I think it's going to change the way these shows are written, yes. It changes the amount of exposition you have to shoehorn into each episode. And I think you're going end up seeing a whole season of television that feels like one long movie. RATH: Do you think that moving this incremental way towards paying for content directly that we might be moving towards the death of commercials? : Well, the death of commercials, I think that's been predicted for a long time. And where we actually are seeing the death of commercials is in broadcast television and TiVo and DVR. When you watch it on Hulu, for instance, you can't skip those commercials. You only get one or two, but you've got to watch them. RATH: I've tried. : So, yeah. Actually, I think the streaming services are a very clever way of forcing commercials back on the consumer. And as long as the TV viewer has a tolerance for that, I don't think those are going away. RATH: Is that where these are going? Because, you know, these shows, these are high-voltage, high-production value programs. : Yeah. The production of TV shows is very expensive. And as we see businesses like Hulu and Netflix producing their own shows, they're going to have to find a way to recoup those costs. They're no longer just licensing some movies for us to watch. They're going to need a way to make their money back. And I think commercials are one way that we've always been able to make some money for content providers. RATH: So they'll be around at least for a little while longer. : Yeah. Maybe they'll be - as long as they're not - I actually object to commercials less than product placement. I find that so much more offensive and intolerable. (LAUGHTER)RATH: That's right. Anthony Breznican is a senior writer at Entertainment Weekly.

I'm Melissa Block. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: And I'm Audie Cornish. Time now for All Tech Considered. (SOUNDBITE OF THEME MUSIC)CORNISH: And we turn our attention this week to the subject of digital technology and senior citizens. People over the age of 65 are the fastest-growing group on social media. That's according to the Pew Research Center's Internet and American Life Project. The group's director is Lee Rainie. LEE RAINIE: In our first survey in March of 2000, only about a sixth of older Americans were using the Internet. Now it's more than half. And the big milestone, the breakthrough came last year when more than 50 percent became Internet users. CORNISH: So, for a little context, we're going to talk now with Laura Carstensen. She directs Center on Longevity at Stanford University in California. Welcome to the program. LAURA CARSTENSEN: Thank you. CORNISH: So why is this such a fast-growing group? CARSTENSEN: Well, there are two reasons that older people are the fastest growing segment of the population adopting digital technologies for social reasons. One is that younger generations are pretty well saturated, almost all of them already are. And the other reason we see this increase in adoption is that everyday thousands of people turned 65. And so, this group of the elderly is changing all the time. And a lot of the people who are arriving at old age are now coming to old age with a lot of technological sophistication. CORNISH: So what are the myths that we used to have about older adults online? CARSTENSEN: Well, I think one of the myths is older people just can't manage technology because of cognitive deficits. But it appears that a bigger reason for the failure to use digital technologies is the lack of perceived need. For a lot of older people, they're quite satisfied with their social relationships, their friendships, their contact with loved ones. CORNISH: And you've said in the past that older adults tend to have smaller social networks compared to younger people. CARSTENSEN: That's right. Across adulthood we see social networks narrow. And for many years, people were very concerned and thought this would lead to depression and loneliness and all sorts of problem. And it turns out, what's happening instead is that older people seem to be pruning their social networks; eliminating some of the more peripheral contacts from their networks but maintaining those people to whom they feel very close. That inner circle is maintained into very, very advanced ages. So that doesn't shrink, rather it's the more peripheral part of the network that shrinks. CORNISH: It's interesting 'cause it's at odds with what we think of in terms of social networking, which tends to be, like, casts this enormous net, right, whether you're close with these folks are not? CARSTENSEN: That's right. And I think that's part of the reason older people often don't see the ability to contact lots and lots of people who. . . (LAUGHTER)CARSTENSEN: . . . they hardly know as appealing. CORNISH: Now, is this a temporary situation? I mean, by the time the baby boomer generation gets to be of age, are they going to be essentially plugged in? CARSTENSEN: Yes, I think they will be. I think they will be plugged in. But, you know, of course, technology changes all the time. And it changes faster and faster as we move forward, you know, into the future. And so, people who say today - young people will say, well, I'm, you know, great with technology, I have no problem with it and I think it's wonderful, they're not going to be using the same kind of technologies, they can rest assured when they're 70 and 80 years old. So the kinds of technologies that we'll have that access to are certainly going to change. CORNISH: Laura Carstensen, thank you so much for speaking with us. CARSTENSEN: Thank you. It was a pleasure. CORNISH: Laura Carstensen, she's director of the Stanford Center on Longevity. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:  This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Melissa Block. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  And I'm Audie Cornish. Time now for All Tech Considered. (SOUNDBITE OF THEME MUSIC) CORNISH: And we turn our attention this week to the subject of digital technology and senior citizens. People over the age of 65 are the fastest-growing group on social media. That's according to the Pew Research Center's Internet and American Life Project. The group's director is Lee Rainie. LEE RAINIE: In our first survey in March of 2000, only about a sixth of older Americans were using the Internet. Now it's more than half. And the big milestone, the breakthrough came last year when more than 50 percent became Internet users. CORNISH: So, for a little context, we're going to talk now with Laura Carstensen. She directs Center on Longevity at Stanford University in California. Welcome to the program. LAURA CARSTENSEN: Thank you. CORNISH: So why is this such a fast-growing group? CARSTENSEN: Well, there are two reasons that older people are the fastest growing segment of the population adopting digital technologies for social reasons. One is that younger generations are pretty well saturated, almost all of them already are. And the other reason we see this increase in adoption is that everyday thousands of people turned 65. And so, this group of the elderly is changing all the time. And a lot of the people who are arriving at old age are now coming to old age with a lot of technological sophistication. CORNISH: So what are the myths that we used to have about older adults online? CARSTENSEN: Well, I think one of the myths is older people just can't manage technology because of cognitive deficits. But it appears that a bigger reason for the failure to use digital technologies is the lack of perceived need. For a lot of older people, they're quite satisfied with their social relationships, their friendships, their contact with loved ones. CORNISH: And you've said in the past that older adults tend to have smaller social networks compared to younger people. CARSTENSEN: That's right. Across adulthood we see social networks narrow. And for many years, people were very concerned and thought this would lead to depression and loneliness and all sorts of problem. And it turns out, what's happening instead is that older people seem to be pruning their social networks; eliminating some of the more peripheral contacts from their networks but maintaining those people to whom they feel very close. That inner circle is maintained into very, very advanced ages. So that doesn't shrink, rather it's the more peripheral part of the network that shrinks. CORNISH: It's interesting 'cause it's at odds with what we think of in terms of social networking, which tends to be, like, casts this enormous net, right, whether you're close with these folks are not? CARSTENSEN: That's right. And I think that's part of the reason older people often don't see the ability to contact lots and lots of people who. . . (LAUGHTER) CARSTENSEN: . . . they hardly know as appealing. CORNISH: Now, is this a temporary situation? I mean, by the time the baby boomer generation gets to be of age, are they going to be essentially plugged in? CARSTENSEN: Yes, I think they will be. I think they will be plugged in. But, you know, of course, technology changes all the time. And it changes faster and faster as we move forward, you know, into the future. And so, people who say today - young people will say, well, I'm, you know, great with technology, I have no problem with it and I think it's wonderful, they're not going to be using the same kind of technologies, they can rest assured when they're 70 and 80 years old. So the kinds of technologies that we'll have that access to are certainly going to change. CORNISH: Laura Carstensen, thank you so much for speaking with us. CARSTENSEN: Thank you. It was a pleasure.

The troubled healthcare. gov website has many ancestors, as NPR's Brian Naylor reports. BRIAN NAYLOR, BYLINE: The new software system was glitchy, it was behind schedule and over budget. University of Pennsylvania computer scientist Matt Blaze said the problems were foreseeable. MATT BLAZE, UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA: Even at the beginning, the requirements for this system weren't very well specified, and they kept being changed as they were going along. This is well understood to be a recipe for disaster in large software projects. NAYLOR: Blaze was not talking about the healthcare. gov website, although he might well have been. He was interviewed in 2005 as the FBI struggled to modernize its computer software. Botched government IT programs are a well-established tradition in the federal government. Along with the FBI, the IRS, the VA, the Defense Department and the DEA have all had software modernization issues. President Obama, in trying to explain the failures of the Obamacare website, says part of the problem is the way the government buys or procures IT. Here he is talking to The Wall Street Journal last week. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: The way the federal government does procurement and does IT is just generally not very efficient. In fact, there's probably no bigger gap between the private sector and the public sector than IT. NAYLOR: Aneesh Chopra has seen the problem from the inside. President Obama appointed Chopra as the government's first chief technology officer. Chopra says buying IT systems is a bit different than purchasing, say, office equipment. ANEESH CHOPRA: When I want to buy furniture, I pretty much know what I want. But when I'm buying an IT system, it's a lot more art than it is science, with respect to which vendor can perform best against those requirements. NAYLOR: A big problem, he says, is translating the idea behind the proposed system into language that programmers and vendors can understand. CHOPRA: A policy might be, I would like folks to be able to shop for health plans. What that means from a software development standpoint is we need a catalog, we need a quarrying feature, we need some kind of search function, et cetera, et cetera. So a lot is often lost in that translation. NAYLOR: Here's another problem: finding qualified contractors. CLAY JOHNSON: The door of getting the government is extraordinarily heavy. NAYLOR: Clay Johnson was on the IT team that helped get President Obama elected in 2008. Now head of a company called The Department of Better Technology, Johnson says there are a lot of small IT firms that would like to do business with the government but that it's easier said than done. JOHNSON: If you want to start a Web design firm and you want to work with the private sector, then the first person that you would hire would be a Web designer. If you want to start a Web design firm and you want to work with government, then the first person that you should hire should be a lawyer. NAYLOR: Because that's what you'll need, he says, to navigate the legalese and thousands of pages of regulations necessary to get a government contract. So how to fix this? Johnson says the government could lower some barriers to make it easier for smaller IT firms to do business with the government, and it would be smart, he says, to create a new department just to handle the government's IT programs. JOHNSON: If you create a digital services department that's in charge of all of this technology, then not only do you get a better work result, but you also know who to fire when things go bad.

I'm Michel Martin. Finally today, this is the time of year when many students and parents are thinking about the future. Students are heading home for the holidays, they're finishing college applications or waiting for decisions. So we wanted to think about opportunity in the future. And for some time now, economists have been predicting that the STEM fields - science, technology, engineering and math - will provide a growing number of the jobs. At the same time, though, there is concern that people of color could be left behind. Today, we're going to drill down on one particular group. According to a study by the National Science Foundation, African-Americans were just 5 percent of scientists and engineers working in those fields in 2010, even though blacks represent 12 percent of the U. S. population. And yet there are African-Americans making their mark in the industry, and we thought you should meet some of them. In the coming days at TELL ME MORE, we'll turn to social media to hear from African-Americans in tech. Between Dec. 2nd and 20th, black tech thinkers from across the country will live tweet a day in their lives for us. They'll be using the hashtag #NPRblacksintech. And today, we're going to jump-start the conversation. Freeman Hrabowski is the president of the University of Maryland Baltimore County. That school is a leader in graduating students of color in the STEM fields. Once again, that's science, technology, engineering and math. He's here with us in our Washington, D. C. studios. Welcome back. Thanks for joining us once again. FREEMAN HRABOWSKI: Thank you, Michel. Delighted to be here. MARTIN: From New York, digital lifestyle expert and tech commentator Mario Armstrong. He'll be keeping an eye on social media channels around our Twitter series and reporting back with the highlights. Mario, welcome back to you. Thank you for joining us. MARIO ARMSTRONG: Thanks for having me. Thanks so much. Dr. Hrabowski, good to hear your voice. HRABOWSKI: Good to hear yours, Mario. MARTIN: And in San Francisco, we are joined by Ayori Selassie. She is the cofounder and executive director of Pitch Mixer Entrepreneur Forum. That's a group that helps aspiring tech entrepreneurs pitch their ideas. Ayori, welcome to you. Thank you for joining us. AYORI SELASSIE: Thank you. I'm very excited to be here with all these wonderful people. MARTIN: So President Hrabowski, let me start with you. Stanford University recently hosted a number of historically black college officials to encourage more black students to engage around technology and in entrepreneurship. Why put the spotlight on this issue? Why does this matter? HRABOWSKI: It matters because the population in our country is becoming increasingly diverse. We know that well before the midpoint of the century - something like 2040 quite frankly - we will no longer talk about minority and majority. We're talking about people of color representing at least 50 percent of the population. And there's so many jobs to be filled. And so we need ways of increasing the number of people from all races - men and women - who can succeed in these areas. MARTIN: What do you see as some of the challenges in doing that? Why hasn't that happened to this point? HRABOWSKI: Sure. Well, you know, I've spent the past 40 years teaching math and working in STEM areas. And I would say, number one, we need to increase the number of African-Americans and other students from all races who can succeed in school in general. I'm always surprised that people have not made the connection between reading and math and thinking and technology. And I would argue that the more we teach kids to read well and to want to be smart and the more we teach them how to solve math problems and give them experience and exposure to technology, the more kids will decide to go into STEM areas. MARTIN: Mario, you've been on tour speaking to students across the country. ARMSTRONG: Yes. MARTIN: Your tour is called Dream, Create, Go! - what do you see as the biggest challenge facing black students in particular? We're focusing on that today. ARMSTRONG: You know what's interesting? I see this huge appetite. Kids want to go into these fields. The problem that I see quite often is that there's a disconnect between connecting why they should pursue these fields and their passions. In other words, a lot of times, I see people wanting to push technology down kids throats and get them to try to fulfill these pipeline issues. Where I think if you take a different approach, which we do on our show, is we try to find out what are kids' passions? And how do we tie - I call it STEAM 'cause we do add arts into this - STEAM - how do we tie that to their passions? Thereby giving them relevancy to wanting to learn math. If you want to become a video game programmer, you cannot do that if you don't understand trigonometry, geometry and the basics of laws of physics. So if you can tap into a child's passion, then you peel back the layers and find out what the STEM or STEAM is in those passions. MARTIN: Ayori, what about you? As we mentioned, you're based in San Francisco and you help aspiring tech entrepreneurs pitch their ideas to experts. What do you see as - why aren't there more African-Americans in Silicon Valley? SELASSIE: I think it's all social. I think it's all about community and how people gain exposure and how people gain support in those communities. So particularly in the Africa-American community, we've had - we've suffered from the digital divide for a long time. Now we see that closing with mobile devices and things of that nature, but that divide has affected our communities and our society until this point. And so parents are particularly unprepared to handle their children and to support their children in STEAM and STEM - STEM especially. And so we really need to address that social issue and help in that area. MARTIN: Well, could you talk a little more about that, Ayori, because, you know, we were talking about swimming, for example, and we were talking to a famous, you know, Olympic swimmer who's African-American. And he was saying that because a lot of parents of color - black parents in particular - don't have exposure to swimming, they say they treat water like fire. Stay away from it. But that's not really the case with tech is it? I mean, these parents are not discouraging their kids from engaging with it. I mean - so where do you think the gap is? Is it just that they don't know - they don't know how to steer their kids? What do you think it is? SELASSIE: Yeah. So I think that the parents don't discourage the children from going into STEM, but other areas do. Right? So, for example, if you look at the image of technology, if you look at the sciences - do you see African-Americans reflected there in highly visible areas and highly visible positions in the media? No, you don't. So that's an automatic discouragement. But then on the other side, with regard to encouragement, our parents don't generally encourage us to study these areas and say, you know what, you're really going to be great in this area and, by the way, here is how I'm going to support you. So we really need to support the parents and the families and give them that extra support so they know how to encourage them and they really feel supported in encouraging those students. MARTIN: Professor Hrabowski? HRABOWSKI: Right. You might be surprised to know, Michel, that a third of the students who go to college of all races, including African-Americans, go to college with an interest in majoring in STEM. So there is more interest than we know, that's number one. The problem is that most of the students, of all races, who go to college with an interest in STEM don't graduate in STEM. So there are two things to be done. Number one, to encourage more kids to know more about the possibilities. Mario's right, we need to be showing the connection between their passions and the technology. When we bring kids on campus from the city - from Baltimore - to our campus and they see students from 150 countries, including African-Americans, working in technology, really focused on the work - the kids get excited. They want to know about it. They want to know what does it take to get to this point. So we can do that by exposing the children to the possibilities and by helping teachers. We have to give teachers more exposure so that they can know how you use geometry one day in engineering, for example. But secondly, we've got much more to do at the college level in supporting students of all races - including African-Americans - to ensure that those who come with an interest in those areas actually succeed in those areas. MARTIN: If you're just joining us, we are previewing our upcoming social media series - NPR blacks in tech. We are with Freeman Hrabowski, he's president of the University of Maryland Baltimore County, Ayori Selassie of Pitch Mixer and digital lifestyle expert Mario Armstrong. So let's - talking about supporting students - let's encourage the students who we know are already interested from Howard University Middle School. They've actually sent us some questions that they would like us to answer. Mario, you are our official hashtag-ologist. You know we made that up for the series. And you're going to observe conversations around the hashtag #NPRblacksintech on Twitter. ARMSTRONG: That's right. MARTIN: So let me just start with some of the questions. Here is one from a student named Miles. Here it is. MILES: As a minority in America, why do you think it is so imperative to give back to the community and why do you think it's important to cooperate with other African-Americans to help other people? MARTIN: Mario do you want to take that? ARMSTRONG: Yeah, I just think that this is exactly what we're talking about, when people want to write off, if you will, kids' interest in really wanting to be positive, impact makers in their lives. This is a seventh-grade kid that's asking a very thought-provoking question. And he's trying to interpret and understand and get the resources and the steps to take. We have to take a more active role of embracing, picking up someone else's child to help them see a role model that they may have not seen before and answer these questions because it's all about - and Dr. Hrabowski will totally support this, and this is what he's all about - it's about problem solving. HRABOWSKI: Yeah. ARMSTRONG: He's asking a question to solve a problem that he's dealing with. And if we can develop more problem solvers, we have more kids that we'll find into these disciplines. MARTIN: I have a different - I have a different question for Dr. Hrabowski. So, Mario, I'm going to ask you - ask you, though, to focus on his specific point, though. Do you think there is some special obligation? Some people don't think there is. I mean, some people feel that this kind of focusing on different ethnic groups is polarizing and destructive. ARMSTRONG: So look, I come from understanding that perspective as well as wanting to embrace a larger picture. So with that being said, you cannot leave behind - it is my obligation to make sure that I reach back - and in droves, not one or two. If I can impact one, that's great. If someone listening can impact one, that is phenomenal. But if we can impact many within our own culture, that is phenomenal. But I don't want to be exclusive to the broader impact and the broader culture. So, yes. MARTIN: I am going to ask you to answer that, Dr. Hrabowski. HRABOWSKI: I want to answer that. You know what I love about UMBC? Students of all races want to help children. And so I've got kids who are white, Asian-American and African-American working with Baltimore City kids. And what those children see is authenticity. I do want African-Americans to be interested in helping other students, including African-Americans, but I also want people to think about helping children. What happens is this - when those kids of any race see a student or any adult who cares, they connect to that person. And so I want to encourage us, in our country, to reach out to help these children - African-Americans, Hispanic, poor white kids and others. And it's amazing to me how children connect to authenticity. MARTIN: Ayori, I have a question for you. This is from Xavier, who's another student at Howard University Middle School. XAVIER: Do you have a portfolio in the stock market? And what made you want learn entrepreneurship? MARTIN: Drilling right down into your business, Ayori. HRABOWSKI: Love it. SELASSIE: Oh, my God. That's awesome. I do have a portfolio in the stock market. And I've wanted to pursue entrepreneurship because independence is important to me. I wanted to ensure that I was able to provide support for not only my daughter, but also my nieces, my nephews, my grandchildren. And it's really important for us to leave an inheritance for our next generations, and that is our social responsibility. And we really need to really charge forward in fulfilling that. And in order to do that, we have to work together. We have to share. We have to share knowledge. We have to - we can't have those behind us have to do the same struggles that we faced. And so it is our social responsibility to help each other. MARTIN: Well, yeah. In fact, people say, look, I don't mind that you struggle. I don't want you to struggle in the same way that I struggled. That's the whole kind of point, isn't it? And if you want to see more of these very incisive questions - and if you can even answer them, we'd appreciate it - from Howard University Middle School students, you can go to NPR. org. Go to NPR. org/TellMeMore. Ayori, you're going to be the first one tweeting a day in your life beginning on Monday for our NPR Blacks in Tech series. What do you - what are you hoping that this social media experiment will reveal? SELASSIE: I'm hoping that black Twitter really just rises up. And that this message of technology really penetrates through all areas from using technology - especially our teenagers in high school and our middle schoolers, but also to parents who are on Twitter. We have a lot of mothers. We have a lot of fathers who are on Twitter doing, you know, fun things and joking around. But we really want this serious topic to get really deeply embedded into our culture. And the fiber of technology needs to be built into the fiber of our culture as African-Americans. MARTIN: Mario, what about you? What do you hope will be revealed in this social media experiment? ARMSTRONG: I hope that we reveal tons of role models that people will discover and find out. I hope that we reveal the amount of intellectual capital that not only our culture, but cultures in general, will have to share in this - in these specific disciplines. And I hope that through this Twitter series - which I think is just phenomenal - that it spills into off-line action. That's what I really hope, is that we can actually see something from these conversations and from these discussions and insightful things you'll be doing, that they actually spill into off-line action. MARTIN: Professor Hrabowski - President Hrabowski. . . HRABOWSKI: Sure. MARTIN: . . . What are you hoping will be revealed in this? HRABOWSKI: You know, I think we need a much broader understanding of technology in our society. I have - I see English majors and philosophy majors on our campus who take some courses in technology. And they may be deciding to work in technology or not, but they are broad. And they are able to connect people who are the techies with those who are afraid of technology. What am I saying? That I don't want people to think, well, if you're not really good in computers, you shouldn't be involved with technology as you think about a major. I want people to be thinking about, broadly, the arts and humanities and social sciences as well as computer science or math or science because, quite frankly, they are more connected than you know. And so I'd like for some of the students to hear from my students and even from some of my CEOs. We have CEO on our campus. We have 100 companies - biotech and IT companies. And some of them have CEOs - men and women - who are African-Americans. I'd love for them to hear from some of these people who are entrepreneurs. We have students who started a company last year, a tech company with an app, and just sold it and gave me some money. I like them to hear that. People like knowing you can make money with these things, right? But I do want them to understand that there's a connection between reading and thinking and math, the humanities and the arts and technology. We should not separate science and technology from the arts, humanities and social sciences. MARTIN: Do you consider yourself a techie? HRABOWSKI: No. No, I am a mathematician. I get goosebumps doing math. I love using the technology to help me in many, many ways. And we use data analysis and warehousing in my job. I couldn't do it without all of the data-driven, decision-making using technology. But, quite frankly, I also love reading novels. And I enjoy doing - reciting poetry. And I think it's important. I want my students who are in computer science to also enjoy literature. MARTIN: Final question, you know, for you because I'm sure there are people who'll be listening to our conversation, and they hear these terms like STEM, which, once again, is science, technology, engineering and math. And they think, you know, I'm not good at - boy or girl, I mean, let's just leave the stereotypes alone. I'm not good at this. This really isn't for me. This is for somebody else. HRABOWSKI: Right. MARTIN: Is there one thing you could tell somebody who feels that way. . . HRABOWSKI: Yes. MARTIN: . . . Who's listening to our conversation. . . HRABOWSKI: Yes. MARTIN: . . . That they should be thinking about? HRABOWSKI: First of all, Common Core standards - we should be looking at the Common Core standards and ways in which all people will be taught - children, and as we move up the ladder, to read and think critically and to use technology because whether you're going to be a social scientist, for example, or you're working in the media, you're using technology more and more. So what I would say is we want people to be open-minded, to be willing to learn. To be educated across the board means a willingness to learn, to ask questions, to laugh about it all and most important, to find the life of the mind very important. That's what I want. MARTIN: Well, thank you all so much for joining us to jumpstart this important conversation. Freeman Hrabowski is president of the University of Maryland Baltimore County, with us from our studios in Washington. Digital lifestyle expert and tech commentator, Mario Armstrong, with us from our bureau in New York. Now Mario will be observing our hashtag . . . ARMSTRONG: Yes. MARTIN: NPR Blacks in Tech and reporting on it on his blog. HRABOWSKI: Mr. Hashtologist. MARTIN: Hashtagologist. HRABOWSKI: Couldn't even say it. MARTIN: And from San Francisco and member station KQED, we are joined by Ayori Selassie of Pitch Mixer. Thanks to all of you for joining us. Keep your eyes on Twitter. Beginning Monday, follow our hashtag, #NPRBlacksinTech, as African-American tech leaders and entrepreneurs tweet a day in their lives. And that's our program for today. I'm Michel Martin. You've been listening to TELL ME MORE from NPR News. Happy Thanksgiving. Let's talk more tomorrow. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  This is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. I'm Michel Martin. Finally today, this is the time of year when many students and parents are thinking about the future. Students are heading home for the holidays, they're finishing college applications or waiting for decisions. So we wanted to think about opportunity in the future. And for some time now, economists have been predicting that the STEM fields - science, technology, engineering and math - will provide a growing number of the jobs. At the same time, though, there is concern that people of color could be left behind. Today, we're going to drill down on one particular group. According to a study by the National Science Foundation, African-Americans were just 5 percent of scientists and engineers working in those fields in 2010, even though blacks represent 12 percent of the U. S. population. And yet there are African-Americans making their mark in the industry, and we thought you should meet some of them. In the coming days at TELL ME MORE, we'll turn to social media to hear from African-Americans in tech. Between Dec. 2nd and 20th, black tech thinkers from across the country will live tweet a day in their lives for us. They'll be using the hashtag #NPRblacksintech. And today, we're going to jump-start the conversation. Freeman Hrabowski is the president of the University of Maryland Baltimore County. That school is a leader in graduating students of color in the STEM fields. Once again, that's science, technology, engineering and math. He's here with us in our Washington, D. C. studios. Welcome back. Thanks for joining us once again. FREEMAN HRABOWSKI: Thank you, Michel. Delighted to be here. MARTIN: From New York, digital lifestyle expert and tech commentator Mario Armstrong. He'll be keeping an eye on social media channels around our Twitter series and reporting back with the highlights. Mario, welcome back to you. Thank you for joining us. MARIO ARMSTRONG: Thanks for having me. Thanks so much. Dr. Hrabowski, good to hear your voice. HRABOWSKI: Good to hear yours, Mario. MARTIN: And in San Francisco, we are joined by Ayori Selassie. She is the cofounder and executive director of Pitch Mixer Entrepreneur Forum. That's a group that helps aspiring tech entrepreneurs pitch their ideas. Ayori, welcome to you. Thank you for joining us. AYORI SELASSIE: Thank you. I'm very excited to be here with all these wonderful people. MARTIN: So President Hrabowski, let me start with you. Stanford University recently hosted a number of historically black college officials to encourage more black students to engage around technology and in entrepreneurship. Why put the spotlight on this issue? Why does this matter? HRABOWSKI: It matters because the population in our country is becoming increasingly diverse. We know that well before the midpoint of the century - something like 2040 quite frankly - we will no longer talk about minority and majority. We're talking about people of color representing at least 50 percent of the population. And there's so many jobs to be filled. And so we need ways of increasing the number of people from all races - men and women - who can succeed in these areas. MARTIN: What do you see as some of the challenges in doing that? Why hasn't that happened to this point? HRABOWSKI: Sure. Well, you know, I've spent the past 40 years teaching math and working in STEM areas. And I would say, number one, we need to increase the number of African-Americans and other students from all races who can succeed in school in general. I'm always surprised that people have not made the connection between reading and math and thinking and technology. And I would argue that the more we teach kids to read well and to want to be smart and the more we teach them how to solve math problems and give them experience and exposure to technology, the more kids will decide to go into STEM areas. MARTIN: Mario, you've been on tour speaking to students across the country. ARMSTRONG: Yes. MARTIN: Your tour is called Dream, Create, Go! - what do you see as the biggest challenge facing black students in particular? We're focusing on that today. ARMSTRONG: You know what's interesting? I see this huge appetite. Kids want to go into these fields. The problem that I see quite often is that there's a disconnect between connecting why they should pursue these fields and their passions. In other words, a lot of times, I see people wanting to push technology down kids throats and get them to try to fulfill these pipeline issues. Where I think if you take a different approach, which we do on our show, is we try to find out what are kids' passions? And how do we tie - I call it STEAM 'cause we do add arts into this - STEAM - how do we tie that to their passions? Thereby giving them relevancy to wanting to learn math. If you want to become a video game programmer, you cannot do that if you don't understand trigonometry, geometry and the basics of laws of physics. So if you can tap into a child's passion, then you peel back the layers and find out what the STEM or STEAM is in those passions. MARTIN: Ayori, what about you? As we mentioned, you're based in San Francisco and you help aspiring tech entrepreneurs pitch their ideas to experts. What do you see as - why aren't there more African-Americans in Silicon Valley? SELASSIE: I think it's all social. I think it's all about community and how people gain exposure and how people gain support in those communities. So particularly in the Africa-American community, we've had - we've suffered from the digital divide for a long time. Now we see that closing with mobile devices and things of that nature, but that divide has affected our communities and our society until this point. And so parents are particularly unprepared to handle their children and to support their children in STEAM and STEM - STEM especially. And so we really need to address that social issue and help in that area. MARTIN: Well, could you talk a little more about that, Ayori, because, you know, we were talking about swimming, for example, and we were talking to a famous, you know, Olympic swimmer who's African-American. And he was saying that because a lot of parents of color - black parents in particular - don't have exposure to swimming, they say they treat water like fire. Stay away from it. But that's not really the case with tech is it? I mean, these parents are not discouraging their kids from engaging with it. I mean - so where do you think the gap is? Is it just that they don't know - they don't know how to steer their kids? What do you think it is? SELASSIE: Yeah. So I think that the parents don't discourage the children from going into STEM, but other areas do. Right? So, for example, if you look at the image of technology, if you look at the sciences - do you see African-Americans reflected there in highly visible areas and highly visible positions in the media? No, you don't. So that's an automatic discouragement. But then on the other side, with regard to encouragement, our parents don't generally encourage us to study these areas and say, you know what, you're really going to be great in this area and, by the way, here is how I'm going to support you. So we really need to support the parents and the families and give them that extra support so they know how to encourage them and they really feel supported in encouraging those students. MARTIN: Professor Hrabowski? HRABOWSKI: Right. You might be surprised to know, Michel, that a third of the students who go to college of all races, including African-Americans, go to college with an interest in majoring in STEM. So there is more interest than we know, that's number one. The problem is that most of the students, of all races, who go to college with an interest in STEM don't graduate in STEM. So there are two things to be done. Number one, to encourage more kids to know more about the possibilities. Mario's right, we need to be showing the connection between their passions and the technology. When we bring kids on campus from the city - from Baltimore - to our campus and they see students from 150 countries, including African-Americans, working in technology, really focused on the work - the kids get excited. They want to know about it. They want to know what does it take to get to this point. So we can do that by exposing the children to the possibilities and by helping teachers. We have to give teachers more exposure so that they can know how you use geometry one day in engineering, for example. But secondly, we've got much more to do at the college level in supporting students of all races - including African-Americans - to ensure that those who come with an interest in those areas actually succeed in those areas. MARTIN: If you're just joining us, we are previewing our upcoming social media series - NPR blacks in tech. We are with Freeman Hrabowski, he's president of the University of Maryland Baltimore County, Ayori Selassie of Pitch Mixer and digital lifestyle expert Mario Armstrong. So let's - talking about supporting students - let's encourage the students who we know are already interested from Howard University Middle School. They've actually sent us some questions that they would like us to answer. Mario, you are our official hashtag-ologist. You know we made that up for the series. And you're going to observe conversations around the hashtag #NPRblacksintech on Twitter. ARMSTRONG: That's right. MARTIN: So let me just start with some of the questions. Here is one from a student named Miles. Here it is. MILES: As a minority in America, why do you think it is so imperative to give back to the community and why do you think it's important to cooperate with other African-Americans to help other people? MARTIN: Mario do you want to take that? ARMSTRONG: Yeah, I just think that this is exactly what we're talking about, when people want to write off, if you will, kids' interest in really wanting to be positive, impact makers in their lives. This is a seventh-grade kid that's asking a very thought-provoking question. And he's trying to interpret and understand and get the resources and the steps to take. We have to take a more active role of embracing, picking up someone else's child to help them see a role model that they may have not seen before and answer these questions because it's all about - and Dr. Hrabowski will totally support this, and this is what he's all about - it's about problem solving. HRABOWSKI: Yeah. ARMSTRONG: He's asking a question to solve a problem that he's dealing with. And if we can develop more problem solvers, we have more kids that we'll find into these disciplines. MARTIN: I have a different - I have a different question for Dr. Hrabowski. So, Mario, I'm going to ask you - ask you, though, to focus on his specific point, though. Do you think there is some special obligation? Some people don't think there is. I mean, some people feel that this kind of focusing on different ethnic groups is polarizing and destructive. ARMSTRONG: So look, I come from understanding that perspective as well as wanting to embrace a larger picture. So with that being said, you cannot leave behind - it is my obligation to make sure that I reach back - and in droves, not one or two. If I can impact one, that's great. If someone listening can impact one, that is phenomenal. But if we can impact many within our own culture, that is phenomenal. But I don't want to be exclusive to the broader impact and the broader culture. So, yes. MARTIN: I am going to ask you to answer that, Dr. Hrabowski. HRABOWSKI: I want to answer that. You know what I love about UMBC? Students of all races want to help children. And so I've got kids who are white, Asian-American and African-American working with Baltimore City kids. And what those children see is authenticity. I do want African-Americans to be interested in helping other students, including African-Americans, but I also want people to think about helping children. What happens is this - when those kids of any race see a student or any adult who cares, they connect to that person. And so I want to encourage us, in our country, to reach out to help these children - African-Americans, Hispanic, poor white kids and others. And it's amazing to me how children connect to authenticity. MARTIN: Ayori, I have a question for you. This is from Xavier, who's another student at Howard University Middle School. XAVIER: Do you have a portfolio in the stock market? And what made you want learn entrepreneurship? MARTIN: Drilling right down into your business, Ayori. HRABOWSKI: Love it. SELASSIE: Oh, my God. That's awesome. I do have a portfolio in the stock market. And I've wanted to pursue entrepreneurship because independence is important to me. I wanted to ensure that I was able to provide support for not only my daughter, but also my nieces, my nephews, my grandchildren. And it's really important for us to leave an inheritance for our next generations, and that is our social responsibility. And we really need to really charge forward in fulfilling that. And in order to do that, we have to work together. We have to share. We have to share knowledge. We have to - we can't have those behind us have to do the same struggles that we faced. And so it is our social responsibility to help each other. MARTIN: Well, yeah. In fact, people say, look, I don't mind that you struggle. I don't want you to struggle in the same way that I struggled. That's the whole kind of point, isn't it? And if you want to see more of these very incisive questions - and if you can even answer them, we'd appreciate it - from Howard University Middle School students, you can go to NPR. org. Go to NPR. org/TellMeMore. Ayori, you're going to be the first one tweeting a day in your life beginning on Monday for our NPR Blacks in Tech series. What do you - what are you hoping that this social media experiment will reveal? SELASSIE: I'm hoping that black Twitter really just rises up. And that this message of technology really penetrates through all areas from using technology - especially our teenagers in high school and our middle schoolers, but also to parents who are on Twitter. We have a lot of mothers. We have a lot of fathers who are on Twitter doing, you know, fun things and joking around. But we really want this serious topic to get really deeply embedded into our culture. And the fiber of technology needs to be built into the fiber of our culture as African-Americans. MARTIN: Mario, what about you? What do you hope will be revealed in this social media experiment? ARMSTRONG: I hope that we reveal tons of role models that people will discover and find out. I hope that we reveal the amount of intellectual capital that not only our culture, but cultures in general, will have to share in this - in these specific disciplines. And I hope that through this Twitter series - which I think is just phenomenal - that it spills into off-line action. That's what I really hope, is that we can actually see something from these conversations and from these discussions and insightful things you'll be doing, that they actually spill into off-line action. MARTIN: Professor Hrabowski - President Hrabowski. . . HRABOWSKI: Sure. MARTIN: . . . What are you hoping will be revealed in this? HRABOWSKI: You know, I think we need a much broader understanding of technology in our society. I have - I see English majors and philosophy majors on our campus who take some courses in technology. And they may be deciding to work in technology or not, but they are broad. And they are able to connect people who are the techies with those who are afraid of technology. What am I saying? That I don't want people to think, well, if you're not really good in computers, you shouldn't be involved with technology as you think about a major. I want people to be thinking about, broadly, the arts and humanities and social sciences as well as computer science or math or science because, quite frankly, they are more connected than you know. And so I'd like for some of the students to hear from my students and even from some of my CEOs. We have CEO on our campus. We have 100 companies - biotech and IT companies. And some of them have CEOs - men and women - who are African-Americans. I'd love for them to hear from some of these people who are entrepreneurs. We have students who started a company last year, a tech company with an app, and just sold it and gave me some money. I like them to hear that. People like knowing you can make money with these things, right? But I do want them to understand that there's a connection between reading and thinking and math, the humanities and the arts and technology. We should not separate science and technology from the arts, humanities and social sciences. MARTIN: Do you consider yourself a techie? HRABOWSKI: No. No, I am a mathematician. I get goosebumps doing math. I love using the technology to help me in many, many ways. And we use data analysis and warehousing in my job. I couldn't do it without all of the data-driven, decision-making using technology. But, quite frankly, I also love reading novels. And I enjoy doing - reciting poetry. And I think it's important. I want my students who are in computer science to also enjoy literature. MARTIN: Final question, you know, for you because I'm sure there are people who'll be listening to our conversation, and they hear these terms like STEM, which, once again, is science, technology, engineering and math. And they think, you know, I'm not good at - boy or girl, I mean, let's just leave the stereotypes alone. I'm not good at this. This really isn't for me. This is for somebody else. HRABOWSKI: Right. MARTIN: Is there one thing you could tell somebody who feels that way. . . HRABOWSKI: Yes. MARTIN: . . . Who's listening to our conversation. . . HRABOWSKI: Yes. MARTIN: . . . That they should be thinking about? HRABOWSKI: First of all, Common Core standards - we should be looking at the Common Core standards and ways in which all people will be taught - children, and as we move up the ladder, to read and think critically and to use technology because whether you're going to be a social scientist, for example, or you're working in the media, you're using technology more and more. So what I would say is we want people to be open-minded, to be willing to learn. To be educated across the board means a willingness to learn, to ask questions, to laugh about it all and most important, to find the life of the mind very important. That's what I want. MARTIN: Well, thank you all so much for joining us to jumpstart this important conversation. Freeman Hrabowski is president of the University of Maryland Baltimore County, with us from our studios in Washington. Digital lifestyle expert and tech commentator, Mario Armstrong, with us from our bureau in New York. Now Mario will be observing our hashtag . . . ARMSTRONG: Yes. MARTIN: NPR Blacks in Tech and reporting on it on his blog. HRABOWSKI: Mr. Hashtologist. MARTIN: Hashtagologist. HRABOWSKI: Couldn't even say it. MARTIN: And from San Francisco and member station KQED, we are joined by Ayori Selassie of Pitch Mixer. Thanks to all of you for joining us. Keep your eyes on Twitter. Beginning Monday, follow our hashtag, #NPRBlacksinTech, as African-American tech leaders and entrepreneurs tweet a day in their lives. And that's our program for today. I'm Michel Martin.

Katie Couric will join the company as its new global anchor. She joins a number of other high-profile journalists. Yahoo also earlier this year bought the popular micro-blogging site Tumblr. Now, what do all these purchases and appointments mean for a company that many people still think of as a search engine, an email service, or a home page? What is Yahoo? Jeff Jarvis is a media analyst and professor at the City University of New York, the Graduate School of Journalism there, and he joins us from our studios in New York. Thanks so much for being with us. JEFF JARVIS: Thanks, Scott. SIMON: So, what has Yahoo bought? What's it trying to become? JARVIS: We're not sure yet. Marissa Mayer, the head of Yahoo, is a brilliant strategic thinker about online, having being raised at Google. And I think we're beginning to see the bare, slight visions of what her strategy is. And she's also going to try to stay, as Yahoo has tried to be over a few generations, a media company. SIMON: Meaning what? They actually create content? JARVIS: Yeah. I'm not sure it's such a great business but, yes. In hiring Katie Couric, they've hired a name and tried to establish a bigger brand as online. The cynical interpretations are that Katie ran out of networks and that Yahoo, you know, tries to get - borrow on the equity of old media. But I prefer to think that if you put Katie Couric and Marissa Mayer together, my hope is that they can reinvent TV news, because it sure needs reinventing. SIMON: In what ways would you hope they would reinvent it? JARVIS: Well, I think Katie is really good at loving the camera and knowing how to talk to people as people online, and I think that Marissa Mayer understands technology very well. My hope is that they can get past all the stupid conventions of TV news, you know, somebody standing up in front of a fire where nothing has happened in 12 hours because we have to have somebody standing there. Online, you have the opportunities to connect witnesses and opinions from all around the world instantly. You can rethink the conventions of news for mobile, for long-term talk, for short little snippets. TV news can break out of its straightjacket. You know, print media has been trying to do that with the Web, trying to find new forms and new business models and new relationships with the public. Well, now it's time for TV news to rethink itself, and I have a lot of respect for Katie Couric and for Marissa Mayer. So, I'm hoping that they don't just try to bring old TV into this new medium, but instead show old TV how it could be done. But that's optimistic. SIMON: Does Yahoo suffer from AOL's problem, which, as I understand it, kind of translates to despite the fact that they're new technology, a lot of people consider them old media? JARVIS: Yahoo, I've been saying for years, is the last old media company. In its prior lives, it still tried to operate by the old media business model of let's get a lot of audience and let's slap a lot of ads in front of their eyeballs. Whereas Google understands that they need to treat us as individuals. What Google has taught us is that it can listen to our behavior with our permission and then give us relevance in return. And let's not forget that that's the heritage that Marissa Mayer comes from; understanding how to make search at Google ever more personal, ever more relevant. If she can do the same thing with news and make it more relevant to you, so that it's not a one-size-fits-all product anymore, that could be a big advance in the form. SIMON: So, let's say in a year or two the president of the United States has what - I don't know if it's a tradition - but often he will have lunch with the major network actors. Does Katie Couric have lunch at that same table? JARVIS: Well, there's two questions there. One, is whether that is the judgment of importance in news. I think that we have to get out of the access game. But I still understand your question, which is will Yahoo be a presence in news as much as the other networks? It might take a while, but there's no reason it couldn't be. You know, there's a great, great blog called SCOTUSblog that covers the Supreme Court like no one else and they are struggling right now to get a credential to the Supreme Court. They do great coverage, highly specialized. And we've got to get past this idea that only big, old institutions are journalistic institutions. We have to work collaboratively with all kinds of new players. SIMON: Jeff Jarvis, media analyst and professor of journalism joining us from New York. Thanks so much for being with us.

I'm Scott Simon. You know, there are several thousand people who are now testing Google Glass, that mini-computer for your face that's slated to go on sale sometime next year. Somehow, our dear friend A. J. Jacobs finagled a pair for himself and he immediately put them to work so he could cheat at poker, chat up women in a bar and generally annoy those people around him, I mean, even more than usual. His exploits are recounted in the current issue of Esquire magazine, where A. J. is an editor-at-large. A. J. Jacobs joins us from our studios in New York. A. J. , thanks so much for being with us. A. J. JACOBS: Glad to be here. SIMON: You did cheat at poker. I mean, explain how you did it, but isn't there some kind of code of conduct? JACOBS: Well, yes. I did cheat at poker. I'm a terrible poker player, so I needed all the help I could get. And my cousin is a professional poker player in Las Vegas. So, I used him to be my poker coach. And using the Google Glass, he could see my cards and tell me what to do - whether to raise or to fold or to laugh maniacally. And it worked. SIMON: He didn't whisper in your ear. He sent you a text message or something? JACOBS: He actually - I could see a tiny image of him in my little tiny computer screen and he would hold up cards. He would actually handwrite cards, like an old game show, and it worked. I won $200. But I did give it back to my friends - mostly, most of it. SIMON: You're a happily married man to one of the most wonderful, not to say understanding, women in the world, which didn't prevent you from joining some of your young colleagues to try and score points in a bar, right? JACOBS: That's right. I wanted to live vicariously through a single guy, so I used the Google Glass to become a high-tech Cyrano. So, I gave it to him and he went to the bar and I could see what he was seeing. So, I could tell him which woman to approach. And we went up to one woman and got her name. I Googled her and I found out some information about her and - that she had gone to a festival in Montauk. So, I messaged him to ask her about that. And she was simultaneously intrigued and creeped out. SIMON: Now, you have the glasses on right now, right? JACOBS: I do. I'm wearing them right now. SIMON: Well, can we try you out in a few questions? JACOBS: I would like that. SIMON: All right. I got to be careful with this one. What's the largest human organ? JACOBS: OK, Glass. Google what is the largest human organ? This says the liver, but I have only. . . SIMON: Google Glass is wrong. JACOBS: I'd always heard it was the skin. SIMON: Yes. Our information is too. And, you know, we have used human researchers here to come up with this. (LAUGHTER)SIMON: So, let's try this one, OK? JACOBS: OK.

JACOBS: Well, I did ask my Google Glass that very question and, you know, it's unclear even to Google Glass. But I will say it's a very polarizing device. You either love it or you hate it. It's like Hillary Clinton or cilantro. And I do believe that something like this will take off. I don't know whether it's this iteration, but I do believe you cannot stop technology. And we are on the long, slow march to becoming part android. SIMON: A. J. Jacobs. His article on Google Glass appears in the current issue of Esquire. A. J. , thanks so much. JACOBS: Thank you. SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. I'm Scott Simon. You know, there are several thousand people who are now testing Google Glass, that mini-computer for your face that's slated to go on sale sometime next year. Somehow, our dear friend A. J. Jacobs finagled a pair for himself and he immediately put them to work so he could cheat at poker, chat up women in a bar and generally annoy those people around him, I mean, even more than usual. His exploits are recounted in the current issue of Esquire magazine, where A. J. is an editor-at-large. A. J. Jacobs joins us from our studios in New York. A. J. , thanks so much for being with us. A. J. JACOBS: Glad to be here. SIMON: You did cheat at poker. I mean, explain how you did it, but isn't there some kind of code of conduct? JACOBS: Well, yes. I did cheat at poker. I'm a terrible poker player, so I needed all the help I could get. And my cousin is a professional poker player in Las Vegas. So, I used him to be my poker coach. And using the Google Glass, he could see my cards and tell me what to do - whether to raise or to fold or to laugh maniacally. And it worked. SIMON: He didn't whisper in your ear. He sent you a text message or something? JACOBS: He actually - I could see a tiny image of him in my little tiny computer screen and he would hold up cards. He would actually handwrite cards, like an old game show, and it worked. I won $200. But I did give it back to my friends - mostly, most of it. SIMON: You're a happily married man to one of the most wonderful, not to say understanding, women in the world, which didn't prevent you from joining some of your young colleagues to try and score points in a bar, right? JACOBS: That's right. I wanted to live vicariously through a single guy, so I used the Google Glass to become a high-tech Cyrano. So, I gave it to him and he went to the bar and I could see what he was seeing. So, I could tell him which woman to approach. And we went up to one woman and got her name. I Googled her and I found out some information about her and - that she had gone to a festival in Montauk. So, I messaged him to ask her about that. And she was simultaneously intrigued and creeped out. SIMON: Now, you have the glasses on right now, right? JACOBS: I do. I'm wearing them right now. SIMON: Well, can we try you out in a few questions? JACOBS: I would like that. SIMON: All right. I got to be careful with this one. What's the largest human organ? JACOBS: OK, Glass. Google what is the largest human organ? This says the liver, but I have only. . . SIMON: Google Glass is wrong. JACOBS: I'd always heard it was the skin. SIMON: Yes. Our information is too. And, you know, we have used human researchers here to come up with this. (LAUGHTER) SIMON: So, let's try this one, OK? JACOBS: OK. SIMON: This Saturday after Thanksgiving, how many turkeys that have pardoned by U. S. presidents are still alive?

At issue is the broad scientific consensus that to keep global warming in check, we need to try to phase out 80 percent of all oil, coal and natural gas by mid-century. But is that possible? NPR's Richard Harris talked to an economist and a technologist who takes different sides. RICHARD HARRIS, BYLINE: The University of California at Berkeley is home to hundreds of scientists, economists, engineers and students who live and breathe climate change. I talked to two of them, on opposite ends of the optimism spectrum, to see whether it's even possible to phase out most U. S. carbon emissions by the middle of this century. CATHERINE WOLFRAM: It's going to be very tough. HARRIS: That's Catherine Wolfram, an economics professor and co-director of the Energy Institute at Berkeley's Haas Business School. And she's skeptical in part because every roadmap to clean energy assumes that we will make huge improvements in how efficiently we use energy. Advocates have been arguing for decades that this is an enormous opportunity to save money and energy at the same time. It's as though there's cash lying on the sidewalk, just waiting to be picked up. WOLFRAM: Those opportunities have been around for a while and people aren't doing it, so there's a real question about why they aren't. And one of the fundamental questions that raises is whether there really are $20 bills lying on the sidewalk. HARRIS: She has academic research to back up that skepticism, but she also turns to her own life for an example. WOLFRAM: We had a company come to our house and make a bunch of recommendations to make our house more energy efficient. And one of them involved blowing insulation into our walls and drilling holes every three feet on our walls. HARRIS: Once Wolfram realized how much it would cost, not just for the insulation, but to patch and repaint all of her walls, she concluded that it wasn't worth it for the modest savings she'd see on her energy bills. No sale. Wolfram's also leery of the cost of switching to renewable sources of energy like wind and solar. Prices will have to rise substantially, if you make all the infrastructure changes that would be required to make these on-again-off-again energy sources the backbone of our energy system. WOLFRAM: Given the technologies we have today and given the economics of the current technologies, it is a really hard problem. I hate to say it, but may be an impossible problem. I think it's a problem that needs a technological breakthrough. HARRIS: Nobody can predict a breakthrough, so when an economist crunches the numbers, things look pretty grim. (SOUNDBITE OF DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING)HARRIS: But the world doesn't look so gloomy to her colleague, Daniel Kammen. He's a professor of energy and nuclear engineering, ensconced in a program that's dreaming of a low-carbon world. DANIEL KAMMEN: Well, I'm writing a book right now called \"Energizing the Optimist. \" So, I'd better be in the optimist category, and I think I am. In fact, maybe I'm so much in the category that a couple of my students say their goal is to rein in my optimism. HARRIS: Kammen thinks advances in technology on the horizon can push the United States rapidly away from fossil fuels. If we put a price on the environmental damage caused by carbon dioxide, he says clean energy like solar would become comparatively cheaper. And that would trigger a whole new relationship between people and energy. Homeowners become producers, not simply consumers, of power. People would have a powerful reason to install solar panels, store some of that energy in the batteries in their electric cars, and even send pulses of it back to the electric grid. KAMMEN: There will be an opportunity to sell that power back to the utility, making money on the deal. And people will think of their cars and their homes as not devices that simply suck up money in the form of energy, but generate it and put it back in the system and make money. HARRIS: The grid would have to be reconfigured to handle all those scattered energy sources, but Kammen says if there's money to be made, innovation will surely follow. KAMMEN: So, I don't think the 80 percent reduction goal by 2050, which sounds like radical surgery - it sounds like a new industrial revolution - is going to be that hard. I would even say we could do it in a decade or two if we were properly motivated. HARRIS: The real question in his mind is not whether we could achieve this in the United States but whether this could happen in the rest of the world, which is in fact where most of the future carbon emissions will originate. KAMMEN: Things do look grim. The growth rate in population, affluence and energy use in many developing countries - China, India, Brazil, Indonesia - looks really daunting. HARRIS: But if the United States can invent its way out of climate change, he's optimistic we can also invent ways to spread that solution around the world. Richard Harris, NPR News.

The disaster killed health workers, flattened clinics, and the already poor country quickly ran short of medical supplies. Despite massive amounts of aid, needs remain. Critical medical instruments, for example, are difficult to import. But what if they could be produced with the push of a button? Well, one American aid group has come up with an unlikely solution: using 3D printing technology. Ashley Dara is with iLab Haiti and she just returned from the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince. She joined us from her home in San Francisco. So first off, Ashley, if you don't mind explaining for those who don't know, how does 3-D printing work? ASHLEY DARA: 3D printing is very similar to 2-D printing that we have at home, in the sense that when we use inkjet printers at home, the inkjet leaves out one layer of ink onto our paper. Except with 3D printers, when we lay out a layer of ink or plastic - in this case - it's layer by layer and it's built up into a 3-D model. It's very similar to when we use a hot glue gun, except instead of the hot glue sticks, it's a spool of plastic filament that continuously is melted through the nozzle and builds up an object layer by layer. MARTIN: Who are you teaching to use this technology and what are they making? DARA: Right now, we're working in Port-au-Prince at a resource center called Haiti Communitere. It's an area where a lot of locals from Cite Soleil come into work to learn new life skills and job skills. And while I was in Haiti last year, a dear friend of mine was running a hospital all by herself with limited resources. One night she wound up having to deliver five babies and they had no umbilical cord clamps, so they were using their own rubber gloves, cutting them to tie off the umbilical cords, which meant that they went through their rubber gloves and had to then deliver babies barehanded with women that were HIV-positive. And all I could think was, wow, if we had a 3-D printer, I could've been printing on-demand umbilical cord clamps for you. So now our guys, or our students that we work with, are actually learning how to make very simple medical devices. MARTIN: So something like an umbrella cord clamp, have those devices been used? Are they working? What are the limitations? DARA: So right now they're working. But to be honest with you, we're on our fourth iteration. Currently we are using ABS plastic, which is the same plastic LEGOS are made out of. So if you've ever stepped on one you know how hard they are. MARTIN: Yeah. DARA: We want to make sure that they're safe on human skin. So I'm not - we haven't actually tried them on humans yet. I just want to make that clear. MARTIN: Yeah. DARA: But we are definitely - we tried them among a multitude of different like fibers and cloths and liquid bags and plastic bags. MARTIN: Have you articulated for yourself long-term goals for this project? DARA: We're still - actually we're still working on those. Of course, we have huge goals. Ideally, we'd like to take this iLab model and apply it to other countries. My personal dream is that we can have our guys from Cite Soleil teaching people in Kenya how to operate the machines. MARTIN: Ashley Dara is with iLab Haiti. She joined us on the line from her home in San Francisco. Ashley, thanks so much for talking with us. DARA: Thank you so much.

I'm Robert Siegel. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: And I'm Melissa Block. There are some 4,900 AM radio stations in this country. In fact, you may be listening to this program on one of them. That said, the AM radio audience has long been shrinking. That's because of new technologies that compete for audience or even interfere with the AM signal. As NPR's Brian Naylor reports, the FCC is now proposing changes it hopes will give AM a boost. BRIAN NAYLOR, BYLINE: AM radio once played a central role in American life. The family would gather around the Philco to hear the latest Western. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)NAYLOR: The transistor radio was where baby boomers first heard the Beatles and other top 40 hits. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)NAYLOR: And, of course, there's no better way to take in a ballgame. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)NAYLOR: But the AM band is not what it used to be. According to the Federal Communications Commission, in the mid-1980s, AM radio still claimed about 30 percent of the nation's radio listening hours. By 2010, that had dwindled to 17 percent. And among younger listeners, the number is just 4 percent. Part of the problem, says FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai, is that the AM signal is getting increasingly hard to hear. AJIT PAI: Whether you're outside and you're getting interference from a power line or you're inside and, you know, everything from the bulbs in your house to the cable box on top of your TV send out signals that conflict with the AM radio signal. And so for broadcasters who are trying to reach an audience, it's more and more difficult for them to do that. NAYLOR: Pai and other commissioners are proposing a number of fixes for the interference problem, including making it easier for AM stations to move their signal to the FM band. They've also proposed modifying the rules that require many AM stations to power down at night. Pai says AM radio is an important source of information, especially during an emergency such as a natural disaster. Keeping the medium thriving is also important for minority broadcasters, two-thirds of whom broadcast on AM. Pai also admits to some nostalgia of his own. PAI: I still remember, almost 25 years ago, listening to the KLKC 1540 AM broadcast of my high school basketball championship game in 1987 when my mom wouldn't allow me to go to the game in person. So I had to go into my room sulking a little bit and tuned it to 1540, and I listened to the broadcast that way. NAYLOR: That station, KLKC in Parsons, Kansas still broadcasts high school sports, says its general manager Brandon Nivens. He says his station is taking other steps to increase its listening audience, including streaming its signal on the Internet. BRANDON NIVENS: Getting into the online aspect of it really helps a lot. We actually stream our AM station online, so that kind of helps reach into the digital realm and kind of get a younger demographic that way. NAYLOR: The station, like many in rural America, is tied to its community through local news and providing services, including a swap show. (SOUNDBITE OF RADIO SHOW, \"TRADING POST\")NAYLOR: It's this kind of intimate connection AM broadcasters have with their listeners, says the FCC's Pai, that makes revitalizing the AM band important. PAI: Whether it's the long haul trucker who got used to listening to a station as he or she drove across the country to kids who listen to baseball games on warm summer nights, there's something about AM radio that I think is really embedded in our national culture. And so long as I have a perch here at the FCC, I hope to advocate for that to continue. NAYLOR: Not all of AM radio is struggling. In fact, five of the top 10 revenue-producing stations are on the AM dial. That's one reason Dennis Wharton of the National Association of Broadcasters is optimistic and supportive of the FCC's proposals. DENNIS WHARTON: There is a lot to be said for AM radio, and the challenges are purely related to interference. And if we can get those resolved, the industry is going to boom. NAYLOR: The FCC is gathering public comments on the proposed rule changes and may vote on them by next spring. Brian Naylor, NPR News, Washington.

AJIT PAI: Whether you're outside and you're getting interference from a power line or you're inside and, you know, everything from the bulbs in your house to the cable box on top of your TV send out signals that conflict with the AM radio signal. And so for broadcasters who are trying to reach an audience, it's more and more difficult for them to do that. NAYLOR: Pai and other commissioners are proposing a number of fixes for the interference problem, including making it easier for AM stations to move their signal to the FM band. They've also proposed modifying the rules that require many AM stations to power down at night. Pai says AM radio is an important source of information, especially during an emergency such as a natural disaster. Keeping the medium thriving is also important for minority broadcasters, two-thirds of whom broadcast on AM. Pai also admits to some nostalgia of his own. PAI: I still remember, almost 25 years ago, listening to the KLKC 1540 AM broadcast of my high school basketball championship game in 1987 when my mom wouldn't allow me to go to the game in person. So I had to go into my room sulking a little bit and tuned it to 1540, and I listened to the broadcast that way. NAYLOR: That station, KLKC in Parsons, Kansas still broadcasts high school sports, says its general manager Brandon Nivens. He says his station is taking other steps to increase its listening audience, including streaming its signal on the Internet. BRANDON NIVENS: Getting into the online aspect of it really helps a lot. We actually stream our AM station online, so that kind of helps reach into the digital realm and kind of get a younger demographic that way. NAYLOR: The station, like many in rural America, is tied to its community through local news and providing services, including a swap show. (SOUNDBITE OF RADIO SHOW, \"TRADING POST\") NAYLOR: It's this kind of intimate connection AM broadcasters have with their listeners, says the FCC's Pai, that makes revitalizing the AM band important. PAI: Whether it's the long haul trucker who got used to listening to a station as he or she drove across the country to kids who listen to baseball games on warm summer nights, there's something about AM radio that I think is really embedded in our national culture. And so long as I have a perch here at the FCC, I hope to advocate for that to continue. NAYLOR: Not all of AM radio is struggling. In fact, five of the top 10 revenue-producing stations are on the AM dial. That's one reason Dennis Wharton of the National Association of Broadcasters is optimistic and supportive of the FCC's proposals. DENNIS WHARTON: There is a lot to be said for AM radio, and the challenges are purely related to interference. And if we can get those resolved, the industry is going to boom. NAYLOR: The FCC is gathering public comments on the proposed rule changes and may vote on them by next spring.

But sharing personal photos raises technological and ethical questions. FRESH AIR tech contributor Alexis Madrigal recently became a father, and has some tips about how to navigate the world of online photo sharing. ALEXIS MADRIGAL, BYLINE: This summer, I hit one of life's great milestones: I became a person who posts baby pictures on the Internet - a lot of them. Our son was born in August, and I've already taken 15,000 pictures of him, hundreds that I want to share with our family and close friends, and a few dozen that I might want to show to colleagues and acquaintances. But how? In theory, we're in a golden age of photo sharing. There are literally dozens of ways to share photos with friends now. But with the new capabilities of the Internet come new and distinctly contemporary problems. For one, most parents don't want photographs of their children widely available. You want your people to see them, but not anyone else. The privacy issues that lurk in our daily lives cry out to be addressed when it comes to children. And second, not everyone uses the same social network. Grandma's on Facebook. Your nephew's on Instagram, and your colleagues are on Twitter and LinkedIn. So what do my wife and I do? We've chosen not to post pictures to our very public Twitter and Facebook accounts because we don't want photos of our son accessible to just anyone, and Facebook's intensive data mining and ever-changing privacy policies make us uneasy. So for close friends, we've been uploading photos to Instagram. We like how simple and easy it is to use. And the interface feels intimate, I think, like just the place to give someone a peek into our new life. It helps that before posting anything, we locked our accounts and pruned our connections. We know every single follower we have - no strangers allowed. I also love Google+'s photo tools. If you can only dimly recall, Plus is Google's would-be Facebook competitor. And while it stinks as a social network, its photo handling is excellent. It can back up all your phone photos to the cloud, and its default settings encourage privacy. One thing we love is that if you take a bunch of pictures with a similar background - say, your baby on the changing table - Google+ automatically turns that series into a cute little animation that can be easily shared with select groups of people. But for our son's true fans, his grandparents, we wanted something even more immediate and private. We share photos to our parents' iPhones with Apple's photostreams, and it works wonderfully. When you share a picture, an alert pops up on everyone's phones. It's almost like you're texting a photograph to a group, but you're also creating an archive that you can look back through. If you've got relatives who don't use the iPhone, though, you'll need another solution. Last, we created a photo set on Yahoo's Flickr to share with our wider circle of friends and colleagues, even though its mobile experience didn't match the other services. It's a lot of work. So why do we go to all this trouble in the first place? A friend told me, as I approached fatherhood, that it was easy to talk about the hard things in parenting. I mean, they're obvious: sleep deprivation, a foreclosing of social possibilities, diapers. But the beauty of it can't be captured in words. These photographs and the stories they tell are an attempt to make meaning out of the rewarding difficulties of rearing a child. The Internet companies know how prized these photographs are. Most people will never post anything that gets more likes and favorites than their baby photographs. And the companies translate that interest into advertising inventory. And just as retailers like Target try to become part of parents' new normal shopping habits, Web companies know that your digital habits are up for grabs, too. Where you post your baby photographs is the biggest endorsement of the social network that you can make. The family that Facebooks together might not stay together, but they will stay on Facebook, which reminds me of one last piece of advice: While it might seem like Google and Yahoo have been around forever, while it might seem like the cloud is firmly established, nothing on the Internet is on firm footing over the long haul, and due to the nature of competition these days, the world's technology titans have strategically broken the connections between their networks. So don't trust any Web company to act as the sole archive for your photos. Back up those kid pictures onto a hard drive, or make an old-fashioned album of prints. Long after the likes and favorites have faded away, you'll want to preserve the memories, and I wouldn't trust any Web company to keep things as they are until my child's graduation from kindergarten, let alone high school.

There is no automatic braking system related to exceeding speed limits that would slow the train down automatically either. None like the kind you can get in many cars on the road today. Why not? Do we have enough safety technology on our trains? Would something called positive train control technology have prevented these accidents? According to, you know - and why isn't it already in place on Metro North commuter trains? Why not install some simple off-the-shelf device that would keep the track - keep track of train speeds and alert the engineer driving the train, like that simple app or a little gadget? What do you think? Our number, 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Christopher Barkan is a professor in the department of civil and environmental engineering, executive director of the Rail Transportation and Engineering Center at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He joins us from Urbana, Illinois. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. CHRISTOPHER BARKAN: Hello, Ira. It's a pleasure to be here. FLATOW: Now, that Metro North train was going 82 miles an hour, 82, before the accident and the engineer pulled the brakes six seconds before the train crashed and it was going way too fast for that curve. Why did he not know that he was going too fast for that curve and why wasn't the train able to detect that in this modern age that we have of electronics? BARKAN: Well, there certain is technology that would allow both the train and the operator to know what the speed is, and I, you know, couldn't possible comment on what was happening in the cab of that locomotive today. I mean I - that day. But the simple fact is, that particular train, as I understand it, was not equipped with technology to perform the function that you just referred to. FLATOW: Let's talk about a little bit of the technology and the terminology that is being talked about here. The engineer said he dumped the brakes. What does that mean exactly? BARKAN: Yeah, that's kind of a colloquial term that's widely used in the railroad industry when you put the train into emergency, and what that means is that there are - every car on a train is - well, let me step back a moment. The energy to apply the brakes in a train comes from compressed air that is provided by an air compressor in the locomotive. And so, and each car has a tank, a reservoir, as we call them, in which that compressed air is stored. And in fact, each of those reservoirs has two compartments. One is what we call the auxiliary compartment, and the other is the emergency compartment, and it is that compressed air that provides the force against a cylinder that then is applied to the brake shoes that then are applied to the wheels themselves to decelerate or stop the train. And the braking system works. It actually was invented by George Westinghouse in the 19th century and the basic concept is still the same, where you compress the air in all of these cylinders or reservoirs in the train and then when you release - when you reduce the air pressure in the train line, the air pipe that connects all the cars in the train with the locomotive, that causes varying amounts of air pressure to be released from the reservoir and applied to the brake cylinder to apply pressure against the brake shoes against the wheels. And when you dump it, you're basically opening up that - you're turning a valve in the locomotive cab that causes all the air in that train line to be released and that causes all the compressed air pressure in those reservoirs on each of the cars and the locomotive to be applied quite rapidly against the wheels in the train, and therefore stopping it as quickly as possible. FLATOW: In this day and age of apps and automation of cars - cars can park themselves, drive themselves, they can now detect when there's an imminent crash happening and apply the brakes, they know when they're going off the road - could we not take some of the simple technology, put it on a train and say, you know, if the train is going too fast, it has GPS on the train? Shouldn't it be that hard? I mean, I think some high school kids could figure this out. BARKAN: I would like to meet those high school kids. FLATOW: They've been on our show. I mean it doesn't seem to be that difficult to figure out that there's a curve up ahead, slow the train down. BARKAN: Well, I would point out that that railroad, as we've learned in the media, these are the first four fatalities in 30 years of operation of Metro North. FLATOW: I ride this railroad almost every day and I've heard those whistles going off in the engineering cab and have asked the conductor what's going on, over the years, and he said they've exceeded the speed limit and he's getting a little notice of that. BARKAN: Right. So that equipment is - many of the cab cars are equipped with what's called an alerter. There's several different kinds of technology we're talking about, and the one that you're referring to is the so-called alerter, and I think it's equipment built after 2000 by federal regulation. All equipment must be equipped with the alerter that you're referring to. Earlier equipment also has to have it unless, and this is the sort of irony of this situation, equipment, according to federal regulation, equipment built earlier than that does not have to have an alerter if it has a cab signal system. FLATOW: I understand. What I'm asking, and I don't mean to interrupt, what I'm asking is how hard would it - I can look on my cell phone on the map on my iMap or whatever; it has a GPS system, it shows me the railroad track as I'm going around it. Why can't I build a simple little app into an iPhone or any other smartphone that says, hey, there's a curve coming up, put the brakes on if you don't do it. BARKAN: Let's extend your analogy. Would you put your life on the line, depending upon the proper functionality of your cell phone under every circumstance you possibly ever travel in? And I hope your answer is no. FLATOW: Well, people put their lives on the line for, you know, this train and didn't survive on it. BARKAN: Well yes, but. . . FLATOW: There are many trains that don't have people that run them. A lot of them, people go to airports, go in these trams all the time. BARKAN: Yeah. Well, let me again make the point, that in 30 years of Metro North operation, the systems that they've had in place have provided safe transportation to, you know, not millions but I think over a billion people in terms of rides. FLATOW: And I'm not arguing against that. I'm agreeing with you. I'm just saying how difficult would it be to back up a system of the people who are on the train with a simple little device that knows the train's going too fast around a curve? I can get a few high school students to write an app, I think, for that. BARKAN: Well, you know, if you'd like to understand the difficulty of this technology - why don't we make one other point that referred to something you spoke about earlier. You can develop these applications and they work very well for one person using one phone or one automobile, but you have to build this system so that it is extremely robust. It is completely basically what we call failsafe. It cannot fail and that means that requires a lot of extra elements of redundancy and very careful, complicated technical design to be built into the system. BARKAN: And furthermore, they're not operating in isolation. Every one of these systems has to operate in conjunction with other infrastructure and other equipment and what we call the back-office server, the thing that's actually controlling the whole railroad. This is a non-trivial technical undertaking and I'm not alone in considering it that way. I think if you were to speak to officials in the Federal Railroad Administration, the leaders of technology in both the U. S. railroads as well as overseas railroads, as well as the Railroad Supply Institute, the people who have been building and developing these kinds of technologies for decades, you would find that they would agree that this is not as simple a problem as (technical difficulties) talking about apps on phones and technology that you can apply to an automobile. FLATOW: Okay. I guess I'm being naive. I would think that, you know, if an engineer or the conductor can't notice that a train is going 80 miles an hour into a 30-mile curve, that a device could not back that person up and say uh-oh, you're going too fast into the curve. You ought to do something. BARKAN: Okay. Nobody is - we're confusing two different things here. FLATOW: I'm not, I don't think. BARKAN: Well, I think you are, actually. There's certainly technology available - let's talk about several different elements of what the train control system and the alerter system are supposed to do. The alerter is basically to do exactly what the name would imply. It's basically to ensure that the locomotive engineer is, you know, paying attention, sort of properly engaged, is doing things that show evidence to the technology that he or she is, you know, paying attention to what needs to be done. That's entirely separate from the traffic control system or the train control system. What Metro-North has in place is actually arguably one of the more sophisticated systems in United States right now which is automatic train control, including cab signals. So he or she will see on their console the status of the track several miles ahead, what we call blocks of traffic control blocks, and that will give him information as to whether he needs to slow down or stop the train in response to upcoming trains or other elements of the infrastructure such as switches that are thrown one way or the other. What it will not do is it will not take into account what we call civil infrastructure constraints like a curve such as at Spuyten Duyvil. And it's not that there's not technology that could do it. It's that that technology is not installed on that train. And again, this is the point I've been trying to make. In that situation we rely on human beings, you know, the careful attention of the locomotive engineer to do their job properly. And what, again, the point I'm trying to make, or was trying to make, is that in 30 years of operation of Metro-North, they have managed to be able to rely on their train engineers to properly obey the rules and operate in a satisfactory manner so that such a thing does not happen. But as we all. . . FLATOW: Let me go to the break. I'll come back. Take a break, I'll let you finish your thought when we get back. So stay with us. We'll talk more with Christopher Barkan after this break. Don't go away. I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)FLATOW: This is SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking with Christopher Barkan, professor in the department of civil and environmental engineering, executive director of the Rail Transportation and Engineering Center at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in Urbana, Illinois, and he's trying to tell me how difficult a problem it is to get these trains to - well, how would you describe it? BARKAN: Well, again, what I've been trying to say is that we have technologies to do these things. Some of them have been around for many decades; other ones are still in the process of development and implementation. And it's not as though it's impossible to perform the functions that you were alluding to earlier on. It's that in this particular case, the train was not equipped with the technology that you're - now, that's easy to criticize, you know, after the fact, but the fact is, is that North American railroads have an extremely safe record of operation, one of the safest in the world, in fact. And so you can always spend more money on more technology and make it safer, but the question is, is that necessarily the most rational investment of your resources. And we do have other safety issues that we need to invest in as well, so. . . FLATOW: Would you agree that there are going to be hundreds of millions of dollars of lawsuits here, that if you had sunk into the railroad years ago, this might not have happened? You're going to wind up paying one way or the other. BARKAN: Well, I couldn't comment on that. I'm not an attorney. I really am not privileged to those sort of things, but I agree that there probably will be litigation, but I don't know. FLATOW: All right. We'll find out and see what happens. I didn't mean to beat you over the head with this. I really didn't. It just seems like sometimes there are simpler answers to complex problems than they appear to be. BARKAN: Well, but I would argue the opposite. This case is actually a very complicated problem to solve in that general sense. Now, you're right. You can come in after the fact and say that Metro-North should have done this, that or the other thing, and I'm, you know - but that's kind of a post-hoc thing. A week ago we wouldn't have been having this conversation; a week ago they had 30-year record of operating safely without any fatalities and, you know, you wouldn't have been interested in talking to me about this question. FLATOW: All right. Thank you very much for putting up with me.

BARKAN: Well, I would point out that that railroad, as we've learned in the media, these are the first four fatalities in 30 years of operation of Metro North. FLATOW: I ride this railroad almost every day and I've heard those whistles going off in the engineering cab and have asked the conductor what's going on, over the years, and he said they've exceeded the speed limit and he's getting a little notice of that. BARKAN: Right. So that equipment is - many of the cab cars are equipped with what's called an alerter. There's several different kinds of technology we're talking about, and the one that you're referring to is the so-called alerter, and I think it's equipment built after 2000 by federal regulation. All equipment must be equipped with the alerter that you're referring to. Earlier equipment also has to have it unless, and this is the sort of irony of this situation, equipment, according to federal regulation, equipment built earlier than that does not have to have an alerter if it has a cab signal system. FLATOW: I understand. What I'm asking, and I don't mean to interrupt, what I'm asking is how hard would it - I can look on my cell phone on the map on my iMap or whatever; it has a GPS system, it shows me the railroad track as I'm going around it. Why can't I build a simple little app into an iPhone or any other smartphone that says, hey, there's a curve coming up, put the brakes on if you don't do it. BARKAN: Let's extend your analogy. Would you put your life on the line, depending upon the proper functionality of your cell phone under every circumstance you possibly ever travel in? And I hope your answer is no. FLATOW: Well, people put their lives on the line for, you know, this train and didn't survive on it. BARKAN: Well yes, but. . . FLATOW: There are many trains that don't have people that run them. A lot of them, people go to airports, go in these trams all the time. BARKAN: Yeah. Well, let me again make the point, that in 30 years of Metro North operation, the systems that they've had in place have provided safe transportation to, you know, not millions but I think over a billion people in terms of rides. FLATOW: And I'm not arguing against that. I'm agreeing with you. I'm just saying how difficult would it be to back up a system of the people who are on the train with a simple little device that knows the train's going too fast around a curve? I can get a few high school students to write an app, I think, for that. BARKAN: Well, you know, if you'd like to understand the difficulty of this technology - why don't we make one other point that referred to something you spoke about earlier. You can develop these applications and they work very well for one person using one phone or one automobile, but you have to build this system so that it is extremely robust. It is completely basically what we call failsafe. It cannot fail and that means that requires a lot of extra elements of redundancy and very careful, complicated technical design to be built into the system. BARKAN: And furthermore, they're not operating in isolation. Every one of these systems has to operate in conjunction with other infrastructure and other equipment and what we call the back-office server, the thing that's actually controlling the whole railroad. This is a non-trivial technical undertaking and I'm not alone in considering it that way. I think if you were to speak to officials in the Federal Railroad Administration, the leaders of technology in both the U. S. railroads as well as overseas railroads, as well as the Railroad Supply Institute, the people who have been building and developing these kinds of technologies for decades, you would find that they would agree that this is not as simple a problem as (technical difficulties) talking about apps on phones and technology that you can apply to an automobile. FLATOW: Okay. I guess I'm being naive. I would think that, you know, if an engineer or the conductor can't notice that a train is going 80 miles an hour into a 30-mile curve, that a device could not back that person up and say uh-oh, you're going too fast into the curve. You ought to do something. BARKAN: Okay. Nobody is - we're confusing two different things here. FLATOW: I'm not, I don't think. BARKAN: Well, I think you are, actually. There's certainly technology available - let's talk about several different elements of what the train control system and the alerter system are supposed to do. The alerter is basically to do exactly what the name would imply. It's basically to ensure that the locomotive engineer is, you know, paying attention, sort of properly engaged, is doing things that show evidence to the technology that he or she is, you know, paying attention to what needs to be done. That's entirely separate from the traffic control system or the train control system. What Metro-North has in place is actually arguably one of the more sophisticated systems in United States right now which is automatic train control, including cab signals. So he or she will see on their console the status of the track several miles ahead, what we call blocks of traffic control blocks, and that will give him information as to whether he needs to slow down or stop the train in response to upcoming trains or other elements of the infrastructure such as switches that are thrown one way or the other. What it will not do is it will not take into account what we call civil infrastructure constraints like a curve such as at Spuyten Duyvil. And it's not that there's not technology that could do it. It's that that technology is not installed on that train. And again, this is the point I've been trying to make. In that situation we rely on human beings, you know, the careful attention of the locomotive engineer to do their job properly. And what, again, the point I'm trying to make, or was trying to make, is that in 30 years of operation of Metro-North, they have managed to be able to rely on their train engineers to properly obey the rules and operate in a satisfactory manner so that such a thing does not happen. But as we all. . . FLATOW: Let me go to the break. I'll come back. Take a break, I'll let you finish your thought when we get back. So stay with us. We'll talk more with Christopher Barkan after this break. Don't go away. I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FLATOW: This is SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking with Christopher Barkan, professor in the department of civil and environmental engineering, executive director of the Rail Transportation and Engineering Center at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in Urbana, Illinois, and he's trying to tell me how difficult a problem it is to get these trains to - well, how would you describe it? BARKAN: Well, again, what I've been trying to say is that we have technologies to do these things. Some of them have been around for many decades; other ones are still in the process of development and implementation. And it's not as though it's impossible to perform the functions that you were alluding to earlier on. It's that in this particular case, the train was not equipped with the technology that you're - now, that's easy to criticize, you know, after the fact, but the fact is, is that North American railroads have an extremely safe record of operation, one of the safest in the world, in fact. And so you can always spend more money on more technology and make it safer, but the question is, is that necessarily the most rational investment of your resources. And we do have other safety issues that we need to invest in as well, so. . . FLATOW: Would you agree that there are going to be hundreds of millions of dollars of lawsuits here, that if you had sunk into the railroad years ago, this might not have happened? You're going to wind up paying one way or the other. BARKAN: Well, I couldn't comment on that. I'm not an attorney. I really am not privileged to those sort of things, but I agree that there probably will be litigation, but I don't know. FLATOW: All right. We'll find out and see what happens. I didn't mean to beat you over the head with this. I really didn't. It just seems like sometimes there are simpler answers to complex problems than they appear to be. BARKAN: Well, but I would argue the opposite. This case is actually a very complicated problem to solve in that general sense. Now, you're right. You can come in after the fact and say that Metro-North should have done this, that or the other thing, and I'm, you know - but that's kind of a post-hoc thing. A week ago we wouldn't have been having this conversation; a week ago they had 30-year record of operating safely without any fatalities and, you know, you wouldn't have been interested in talking to me about this question. FLATOW: All right. Thank you very much for putting up with me.

I'm Arun Rath. Zooming along at 82 miles an hour when it hit a curve with a speed limit of 30, the commuter train that derailed last Sunday in New York was going way too fast. There is a system that can automatically slow down a train that is going too fast if the driver doesn't act. But NPR's David Schaper reports the problem is most trains don't have it. DAVID SCHAPER, BYLINE: I'm standing along railroad tracks on Chicago's south side, right about at the spot where in September 2005, a Metra commuter train derailed, killing two passengers and injuring dozens more. That train was traveling 69 miles an hour as entered a crossover, a spot where the speed limit was just 10. The National Transportation Safety Board said the engineer was driving too fast and failed to heed warning signals, adding that positive train control, which can override human error and apply the brakes, could have prevented that crash. That safety system is coming up again in the investigation of this week's crash in New York. EARL WEENER: For more than 20 years, the NTSB has recommended the implementation of PTC technology. SCHAPER: National Transportation Safety Board member Earl Weener. WEENER: PTC is proven technology that can prevent train-to-train collisions, overspeed derailments and incursions into work zones. Since this is a derailment involving a high-speed train, it's possible that PTC could have prevented it. SCHAPER: Shortly after the 2008 crash of a Los Angeles Metrolink commuter train that killed 25 people, Congress mandated that all railroads install and implement Positive Train Control systems by the end of 2015. But rail industry experts say that's proving to be a very difficult task. CHRIS BARKAN: This is a massive systems integration problem. SCHAPER: Professor Chris Barkan is executive director of the Rail Transportation and Engineering Center at the University of Illinois. BARKAN: We're talking 60,000 miles of tracks that have to be fitted with complicated new hardware and software. There's something like 20,000 locomotives that will need the onboard equipment. SCHAPER: That includes Wi-Fi, GPS, radio and other technologies, and the railroads also need to install 20,000 new cell signaling towers along those 60,000 miles of track. Then there's what the experts call the interoperability of the railroads' Positive Train Control systems. Holly Arthur of the Association of American Railroads explains:HOLLY ARTHUR: All the railroads' PTC systems - passenger rail, freight rail, small and regional railroads - all of their PTC systems must be able to talk to each other. SCHAPER: And the cost of implementing PTC nationwide is estimated to be more than $13 billion. The commercial freight railroads can afford their share, but regional commuter rail agencies? MICHAEL GILLIS: This is an unfunded mandate. SCHAPER: Michael Gillis is a spokesman for the Chicago area's commuter rail agency, Metra. GILLIS: Part of the problem is we have to pay for this with our conventional capital funding sources. SCHAPER: That's the money that also goes to track improvements, bridge repairs and other safety needs. So the rail industry has been asking Congress to push back its PTC implementation deadline by three years to 2018. An August report by the Government Accountability Office says only a few passenger and freight railroads will be ready by 2015. But in the wake of Sunday's deadly crash, few in Congress may be willing to vote for a delay. David Schaper, NPR News, Chicago.

I'm Audie Cornish. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: And I'm Melissa Block. We begin today with All Tech Considered and the top tech news of the day. Eight major technology companies are calling on President Obama to reform government surveillance programs. Google, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft are among the authors of an open letter to the president. CORNISH: The letter does not mention Edward Snowden or the NSA by name, but it says, quote, \"This summer's revelations highlighted the urgent need to reform government surveillance practices worldwide. The balance in many countries has tipped too far in favor of the state and away from the rights of the individual. \"BLOCK: The companies laid out some major principles. Those include limits on government authority to collect user information, oversight and accountability of surveillance programs, and transparency about government demands for information. CORNISH: I spoke today with David Drummond, the chief legal officer for Google. I asked him exactly what kind of limits Google and its co-authors would like to see on government surveillance. DAVID DRUMMOND: The government, somewhat unbeknownst to the public, were taking the view that all communications were relevant to a particular investigation, and that sort of stands on its head what we normally think about with investigations, is that you have some kind of individualized suspicion and that you go after things more narrowly. So I think what we're talking about is this sort of bulk collection without narrowing it to what you're actually looking for. We believe that that should be curtailed. CORNISH: So in the letter you're essentially saying that if government wants a specific piece of data, you want a name. You want them to ask you about a specific person, not just ask for the whole data set. DRUMMOND: That's right. And that there be a process that everybody knows about, that's open. And in the private sector, we're actually - we're very transparent about what we do. We are limited by laws that everybody understands. When people challenge our practices, we go into court. It's an open court. Everybody knows what's going on. I think you've got a system, the structure in the government surveillance case is very different, where things are done in secret and no one really knows what the rules are. So we think it needs to swing, that pendulum, back to the middle. CORNISH: In the letter, you also talk about transparency. What do you mean by that? What exactly would that look like? DRUMMOND: Well, I think one of the biggest problems with all of this has been that the - sort of the interpretations of the rules, the applications of the rules, all of that has been done in secret. If we get requests from the government, I think users have a right to know what the companies are doing. And we try to do that as much as we possibly can. We're just limited by the current rules that say that we can't talk about some of these requests. CORNISH: Now, what's your response then to agencies who say, well, there are security concerns here. We don't want people to know when we're looking for them. DRUMMOND: Well, we understand that there has to be a balance here between security and the integrity of investigations and civil liberties. Our view is that the pendulum has swung too far towards secrecy. Some of the reports about bulk collection, a lot of those things were surprising to most people, and I think had there been more of an open debate, I think we could've avoided some of these problems. CORNISH: But there are privacy advocates who say that, you know, after years of cooperating with governments on surveillance, this is now mostly a concern because it's affecting your bottom line. DRUMMOND: Look, there's no question that this is about protecting our user's data and protecting our user's data is core to our businesses. So we're not going - no one is suggesting that this - that, you know, we don't care deeply about our businesses. But it's a broader question about trust in communications networks, about trust in the Internet, and that affects not just our companies, but all of society as we move deeper and deeper into this digital world. CORNISH: The other concern here by privacy advocates is that they've long called for tech firms to dial back how much data you're holding onto and they're saying that companies essentially put users at risk, made them vulnerable to things like this government surveillance because of the broad data collection that you do. DRUMMOND: You know, collecting the data, we do that. . . CORNISH: Entertaining it, I should say, right? DRUMMOND: Sure. And we do that - sure, we do that too. If you look at the case of email, you know, back in the early 2000s, you know, people really loved the convenience of Web mail. But it was - you couldn't store very much of it and so, you know, what we've done and the other Web firms have done is provide, you know, email that has lots and lots of storage because people actually want to keep those things. And as more things move into the cloud, people want the ability to store things for a long time. So I think the question is, you know, how we do that for users, how we make sure that it's transparent to them, how we make sure that they can delete things when they need to and so forth. CORNISH: What are your options if the U. S. doesn't take what you'd consider sufficient action? Does this mean you'd virtually start refusing more information requests or make more technical changes, encryption and such, to thwart government spying? DRUMMOND: Well, we're hopeful that the process will yield some reform. We have taken many, many steps, as I think we've been very public about, to encrypt our networks to make sure that we are protecting, doing everything we possibly can to protect our user data, and we'll continue to do all of those things. But we're very hopeful that we'll be able to have a set of reforms and that the U. S. will be able to lead the way with other governments. CORNISH: Well, what's your response to people who wonder if this is believable, given the history that, say, Google in particular has in terms of personal information? For instance, people looking at this multimillion dollar fine Google's had to pay to resolve legal trouble for scooping up private data. This was through the Google street view vehicles. But there is some lack of trust there in the public that doesn't have to do with the NSA. DRUMMOND: Well, we'd be the first to say that we've made this fix. I think, on balance, we've done a very, very, very good job in protecting our user data and we believe our users trust us. We're happy about that. We believe we continue to build great products for our users. I don't think the fact that we've made, you know, made mistakes - and, again, we've very transparent about what we do. You know, we tell users what we're up to and when we make a mistake, we say it and we own up to it. And I don't think that prevents us from taking a strong position here. And I think it's good for our - it's right for the companies to take a stand here and add our voices to the voices for reform. CORNISH: David Drummond, he's senior vice president for corporate development and chief legal officer at Google. Thank you for speaking with us. DRUMMOND: Well, thanks for having me. CORNISH: We were discussing the open letter from eight tech companies to President Obama demanding reforms to government surveillance programs, and we'll be taking a closer look at the issues around technology and privacy in the days and weeks to come.

It's still something we print and put on the wall or in an album. Researchers are working on technology that could change that. They're building supercameras that can record a scene in astonishing detail. Imagine every photo so rich it offers an entire virtual world to explore. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce got to see one of these cameras as it was being tested. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: It's almost sunset at Mason Neck State Park in Northern Virginia. From the visitor center, you can look out across a bay and see bald eagles flying. STEVE FELLER: Is there any way we can get over the fence or through the fence more than over the fence? GREENFIELDBOYCE: A team from Duke University is wheeling a metal cart towards the water. On the cart is a big black box about the size of a mini fridge. This is a prototype camera. It's about 25 times more powerful than a top-notch digital camera you could buy in a store. It takes gigapixel images. FELLER: So to give you an idea of the scale of these images, if you were to print out a photograph-quality print of this image, it's going to be about 20 feet long and probably 10 to 12 feet tall. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Steve Feller is a manager for this camera project. He says in the past, people have made gigapixel images of places like Paris or Mount Everest. But these typically are composites of hundreds of photos taken one after another and then stitched together. The problem is that approach can't capture an instant in time. This camera can. Feller points to a crystal ball at the front. That's the main lens. Behind it are many tiny cameras. FELLER: Basically it's an aggregate of 158 smaller cameras that work together to make one really big image. GREENFIELDBOYCE: They set up the camera so that it's looking out at the bay. There's no need to point it at anything specific. It can see pretty much everything we can see, only better. A researcher named Zach Phillips looks at a laptop computer set up on top of the black box. On the screen is a small version of the scene we're looking at, broken up into little circles that represent the view of each microcamera. Phillips zooms in to show the grain in the wood of a nearby fence post, then we click on another circle and zoom in to see a house across the bay. Phillips opens another program and gets ready to take the photo. ZACHARY PHILLIPS: 3, 2, 1. There it goes. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He hits the keyboard and all the microcameras snap at once, capturing everything happening in front of us at that moment. This gigapixel camera is the brainchild of David Brady. He's a professor at Duke who wants to push photography as far as the physics will allow. DAVID BRADY: This camera is kind of a culmination of many years of work where our challenge has always been, what is the maximum amount of information we can measure with light? GREENFIELDBOYCE: He has plans for versions of this camera that can capture 50 gigapixels. This work was funded by the military, which has an obvious interest in looking in high detail in all directions at once. But Brady thinks it could transform all kinds of photography. Take sports. His team has photographed Duke University football games. You can see the ball in the air, plus the faces of all the players and all the fans. BRADY: I can't imagine, you know, how people are going to use these things, and, of course, since I'm an instrument builder, that's the real interest. Because I'm sure photographers will use it in ways that I haven't even thought of. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The work has impressed other experts on gigapixel images, like Illah Nourbakhsh of Carnegie Mellon University. ILLAH NOURBAKHSH: In any case where you have a fast-moving world, like a sporting game, that idea of massively imaging everything simultaneously is very important. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says people won't be taking gigapixel images as often as everyday snapshots. They'll use it for special occasions, like, say, the Academy Awards. A normal camera would be fine for photographing the winner on stage, but a gigapixel camera could capture the reaction of every star in the audience. NOURBAKHSH: These pictures are not really like a picture. They're kind of like an entire website. They're like an image-based reference into things that you care about. And that image, or spatial way of referring to things, is powerful, because our body is designed to understand things visually. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says people have gotten used to the idea of exploring detailed virtual worlds in video games. This technology could let them have the same kind of experience with images from the real world. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News.

I'm Celeste Headlee. Michel Martin is away. Maybe at some point, you've gotten upset about a political issue, and you decided to write your congressman or congresswoman. That used to mean you grabbed your pen, paper, an envelope, a stamp. And then, of course, came the Internet and email. You don't have to write it on paper anymore. But as you just heard, the process of civic engagement is actually changing in a lot more ways than just how we send messages. Civic tech is an emerging field that connects people with their elected officials, government agencies, like trash collection, and each other. We're joined now by Roxann Stafford. She's been conversing on Twitter using our #NPRBlacksinTech and she's also a design strategist at Second Muse. That's an agency that's worked on a number of civic tech projects. Roxann, welcome. ROXANN STAFFORD: Thank you for having me, Celeste. HEADLEE: Can you help us understand a little better what exactly it means when I say, civic tech? STAFFORD: Absolutely. So civic tech or the civic innovation space is a movement. It is a movement of people and active dialogue with their governments and each other to solve complex social and environmental problems. So one way that I like to think about it is it's public, private and people partnerships that have been accelerated through the ease of connection that we have of technology. So we have these cycles of being able to rapidly design, create and then share ideas. And that's what's really unique about this time period. And that's what civic tech is really all about. HEADLEE: So we're not just talking about the city government putting its office hours online. You're talking about actually creating a conversation to solve problems. STAFFORD: Absolutely. The conversation and collaboration aspect is the most important. So when you're talking about issues as complex as helping veterans find future employment or issues around making sure that kids have access to STEM education initiatives, we need everybody that's a part of this. We need everyone to be able to not only have access to data and information, but to really reflect upon what that means in terms of creating solutions based on needs in their community. HEADLEE: So. . . STAFFORD: So, yeah, it's more than office hours. HEADLEE: I wonder - you listened to the conversation I just had with the middle school students, and, for example, the one kid's idea about collecting trash and having people interact with their trash collection. Is that an example of civic technology? STAFFORD: I would say absolutely. You know, these ideas don't have to come from the top officials. They can come from throughout, and so the ability to recognize - let's say in this situation that there was a need around trash collection and more people to be aware of that, that's a part of that type of dialogue. And it can result in lots of different things. So in this instance, we heard about it coming about from a standpoint of an app or a technology that can be used. But other examples of civic tech actually can be the creation of physical spaces where people come together. HEADLEE: Give me an example of that. STAFFORD: Sure. So in San Francisco, through National Day of Civic Hacking, which was one of the largest hacking events that took place over the summer, there was a group - very diverse, including government officials, community members, corporations that came together in downtown San Francisco and literally took over a building. It was called free space. And in free space, it gave people the opportunity to tell stories about their neighborhood. It gave people the opportunity to have a forum to identify some needs around making sure that we're eliminating food deserts. So literally, Celeste, they were able to take this building and use it as a conduit to have these creative conversations. And that's an example of hacking, which is a way of creating solutions that are part of the civic tech movement. HEADLEE: I would imagine this is great, especially for younger people because they use technology. And this would encourage them to perhaps get involved in their own governments, their local governments, even state and federal governments. But the other half of that is convincing government officials and sometimes, pretty opaque bureaucracies, to accept a cutting-edge technology. That can be difficult. How do you do it? STAFFORD: It is a challenge. But I think one of the things that we're seeing that's helping to overcome this is that we're having these groups, both young and old, talk about it from a value. What is the value being created in the community? And whether you're a government official involved in this or a part of a company, you're searching and looking for value. And with the civic tech movement, what we're doing is we are expanding that type of definition. So when you come through the door and start speaking about it from the value that can be created, everybody wants to participate in that. And you don't have to be the most senior person in the room, as we heard earlier from our young innovators, to be able to bring about what that value can look like. HEADLEE: And do you, however, have to be really well-versed in coding language and in working with computers and have advanced technology at your disposal? STAFFORD: You know, although we talk a lot about civic tech from the standpoint of coding, what we really need in terms of making these ideas sustainable is an ecosystem of players. So that includes people who really understand and know a community, someone that has a marketing or design background, someone that's able to speak clearly and articulately to communities. So you don't necessarily need to have all the hardcore tech or STEM types of skills at your fingertips. But what you do need to be able to do is have a collaborative mindset to understand how to bring those skills to bear when you're trying to help your community. HEADLEE: That's really fascinating. Roxann Stafford, design strategist at Second Muse, kind enough to join us from San Francisco talking about civic tech. Roxann, thank you so much. STAFFORD: Thank you.

I'm Celeste Headlee. Michel Martin is away. Let's talk now about our social storytelling series that's happening online this month using the hash tag @NPRBlacksInTech. Since December 2nd, black tech innovators from all over the country have been tweeting a day in their lives. We've had a physicist from New Jersey tweet about his research in nanotechnology. We had an entrepreneur in Wisconsin talking about the challenges of building a startup. And some of them are actually answering questions that come from seventh- and eighth-graders at Howard University Middle School of Mathematics and Science. So now we have, today, two of those middle-school students with us. Xavier Manning and Ciara Chase join us in studio not only to talk about this conversation happening around social media, but also to talk about the mobile apps they've been creating in their own classroom. We're also joined by their guidance counselor, Carletta Hurt. Welcome to all of you. Xavier, Ciara, Ms. Carletta Hurt - thanks. XAVIER MANNING: Thanks for having us. CIARA CHASE: Hi. CARLETTA HURT: Thank you. HEADLEE: Xavier and Ciara, you have been a big hit. I mean, you've probably noticed the reaction to your questions and your comments using that hash tag, NPRBlacksInTech. So first of all, thank you for that, and for engaging with some of the other innovators. CHASE: Thank you. HEADLEE: Tell us first about your app that you're designing in class. First of all, are these functional? Do these work, or they're just a class project? MANNING: We're going to try to make them real but for now, they're just an idea. My app is Trash Tracker. So basically, you know how like, usually on Monday morning - how the trash man goes to every house in the area to get the trash. HEADLEE: Yeah. MANNING: And sometimes your trash is not even there, so it just wastes a lot of time for the trash man. So with the app, you basically get to pick a button that says if I need my trash taken out. And if you need your trash taken out, it goes to your address. And if you pick, I don't need my trash taken out, it just skips it, which saves time. And takes the worry off your shoulders to make sure you get your trash taken out 'cause you can press that any day. And then next time it's time to take out the trash, he takes out the trash. HEADLEE: That's a pretty basic interface. I guess I'm kind of surprised that no one's thought of that before. What made you think of it? MANNING: What made me think of it is when I lived in New York. . . HEADLEE: Wait, do you have to take out the trash? Is that what. . . MANNING: Exactly. HEADLEE: OK. MANNING: On Monday mornings, I had to wake up early. So I'd rather have it me - like an app, you know, if I wanted to play basketball, just take out the trash then. And then push the button so I can just relax for an extra 30 minutes on Monday morning. HEADLEE: OK, it's all coming clear to me now, Xavier. Ciara, let's talk about your app. What was your idea? CHASE: The name of our app was Minority Matters. And recently, we saw an article published by Jet Magazine and it stated that every hour, 17 minority children are kidnapped. So for our app, it's basically so a parent can post their child's kidnapping because without the app, you have to go through like, a lot of police reports, or post signs and stuff, to find your child. But for the app, if you find that your child is missing, you're able to post it. And anyone that has information about the child is able to comment under the post, so they can help you in a faster way because usually after three hours, a lot of damage is already done to the child. It's a faster way to help them. HEADLEE: Obviously, this is not functional yet. So thinking ahead, how do you prevent overuse of it? Someone who's kid went next door, and they just don't know where their kid is? CHASE: It's usually, like, a time limit that you would consider your child from being kidnapped. Like, you would know when your child has been away for a long time. And also, if the next-door neighbor sees that your child has been kidnapped, they can easily comment under the post saying, oh, your child is over my house. HEADLEE: They're in my house having cookies, right? CHASE: Yeah. HEADLEE: So, Carletta, talk to me about why we use apps. Is it because so many kids have smart phones today? Is this just a way to engage kids? HURT: It is. And one of the biggest parts of this project was, how can you make a change in your community using technology? That was kind of the question posed to the students - using technology and helping your community in some way shape or form. And that's how these apps came about. There were other apps, as well. So, the idea. . . HEADLEE: What were some of the other good ideas that you. . . HURT: There was a news connection app where it talks about how to get young people engaged in news worthy information because a lot of them get news from, like, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram. And it's not always reliable. So there was an app that - it's called News Connection. HEADLEE: You're kidding me? Sometimes tweets about news are not accurate? That shocks me to the core. HURT: I know. It's amazing to think that, but yes. It does happen. And another one was - oh, my God - come on, Xavier and Ciara. What were some other apps in class? CHASE: Another idea was a workout app. So the app would basically tell you - it would help you plan your workouts better. And a problem was the obesity that's happening. So the app would, like, help you plan your workouts and let you know when you need to work out. HEADLEE: You know, one of the things that I found coming up a lot - that we've had in using this hash tag NPRBlacksInTech was how you engage - and you've probably seen these - how do we engage middle schoolers in STEM sciences, and especially blacks and Latinos, which is a real problem, and they're incredibly underrepresented in the STEM sciences. So what are your ideas? I mean, how does somebody engage you to study science and mathematics? MANNING: What I would suggest is that you do something that we like and put it in there. So in our community we're more connected to hip-hop. So if they put something with hip-hop in it, they might be like, this sounds pretty good. Let me listen to it. If they listen to a lyric or something and they're like, wait, that has something to do with science? They'll remember it because it's in hip-hop form. So. . . HEADLEE: You mean real hip-hop. You don't want to see your science teacher actually trying to rap right? MANNING: No. No. HEADLEE: Ciara, what do you think? CHASE: Basically, that's what I was saying - something that relates to the child because if it relates to you, you have a better connection and you can express yourself more with it. HEADLEE: So what do you think is the problem in getting black and Latino young kids especially into the STEM scientists, where's the disconnect here? CHASE: They don't find the interest in it, and they don't think that it can actually help anybody. So, yeah. MANNING: I agree with her about the connection to our kids in that community. So I think that might be an issue, the fact that they're like, here's a book about it, read it. And just like a lot of kids in all races, we really don't like to read that much. So if you put it in, like, songs or something. HEADLEE: Your guidance counselor is waiting to jump in here. Your response to that - kids don't like to read? HURT: Reading is fundamental. But no, I was going to say, another thing that I've noticed as a guidance counselor in talking to students and parents and even reading literature and talking to other professionals, is that engagement factor and understanding that you can do science and science isn't as difficult as it may sound. And I think sometimes some students, especially minority students, because of exposure and opportunities they shy away and think, well, I'm not smart enough, I'm not good enough. HEADLEE: Yeah. HURT: But one recent article said that most girls said that they never knew they could. It was just saying, hey, you can do that, you are able. And what we do at our school is tell them you could do this. Like, yes, you can create an app. HEADLEE: You're kind of preaching to the choir, right? I mean, this is the school of mathematics and science. HURT: But we service everybody in D. C. , so we have no - we don't screen students. It's a lottery so we get everybody. HEADLEE: Oh, I see. HURT: So there's no way to say, OK, this is the cream of the crop from these elementary schools, we see everybody. It's a public lottery. HEADLEE: If you're just joining us, we're talking about middle schools especially, and their engagement with technology as part of our social media conversation that we're having all this month using the hashtag #NPRBlacksInTech. We have two middle school students with us. Xavier Manning and Ciara Chase from the Howard University Middle School of Mathematics and Science. And also their guidance counselor, Carletta Hurt. I wonder if you guys think there's a social component that sometimes discourages blacks and Latinos from joining STEM sciences. And what I mean is - is there sometimes a stereotype about kids who like science? Is it not cool? Is it considered to be not authentic for people who are - either come from the African-American tradition or come from a Hispanic tradition? Ciara, what do you think? CHASE: I think that is a good aspect of it because a lot of people doubt you when you say that and they don't believe you can do it. But with my school they, like, push us so we don't have a choice. So I think people need to push children a lot more so they can believe in themselves because a lot of others doubt them. HEADLEE: What do you think, Xavier? MANNING: Well, I think that turns it more to a bullying asset. Like, say you come into a school and you like math and science so much and you see that the kids at your school, like your peers, they don't like it and they might bully. Like, you're a nerd, you're a geek, like some kind of robot or something 'cause you do math so well. That might make you want to be like, you know what, forget math and science, I just want to not be bullied. HEADLEE: Yeah. MANNING: So that might turn you away from it. HEADLEE: Have you had experience with that kind of thing? MANNING: Yes. I just kept doing what I did and I just kept getting good grades and just kept doing what I did. HEADLEE: The innovators who've engaged in conversations have talked about some of the bigotry in STEM sciences. It can be a problem. There are problems not just with accepting people of all races but, Ciara, I wanted to address this to you because there's obviously still lingering problems in accepting women in some of these fields of engineering and computer science. How do you see that going forward? Do you hope to get a job in the STEM fields? CHASE: Honestly, I want to be a lawyer, but I do like the idea that I have now, I do want to get that out there. Even if it's not me, I want to just get it out there. HEADLEE: Your app idea to find missing kids. CHASE: Yes. I just want to get that out there because it's not about me, it's about a lot of children that get kidnapped. So. . . HEADLEE: And we're using this word STEM a lot. Of course for those who are not familiar with it, it means science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Not law, Ciara. (LAUGHTER)HEADLEE: Carletta, what do you think - how does the school handle preparing kids who might want to go into the STEM field - science, technology, engineering, mathematics - and do you address at all issues that they may have to deal with in terms of prejudice or especially gender bias? CHASE: Well, one thing at our school, every student is exposed to STEM. So in that aspect, the bullying piece isn't really a big deal 'cause you all have to do it. Now some may excel more than others. And, of course, we do have accelerated classes, which these two students are participating in. But the other piece that we also see - we show a diversity of people in STEM. We make sure there are female teachers as well as male teachers, and all different kinds of teachers. So those speakers come in. We have a really strong partnership with Howard University where they bring in professionals to these classrooms to talk to students 'cause our idea is exposure. And also making them do something. They may only do it one or two years of the three years there, but at least they get the opportunity and they figure out, OK, science isn't as boring as I thought or engineering is about creating computer games and playing PlayStation versus what I thought it was. So it's also about showing them those nuances that don't really look like STEM but really are STEM. HEADLEE: Xavier, did you think science was boring before you got to Howard? MANNING: No, because when I was in pre-K, my aunt made me read a whole bunch of. . . HEADLEE: You remember what happened to you in pre-K? MANNING: Yes. HEADLEE: Wow. MANNING: My aunt made me read a bunch of astronomy books. Like, this one - Pluto was counted as a planet. HEADLEE: Still a planet and not a dwarf planet. MANNING: Yeah, so when we did this I really got interested. So I got more books on it from Barnes & Noble and basically I kept reading up on that. Like, once I hit, like, biology, I was like - like I just saw cartoons of biology and stuff like that, I was like, I don't want to do it. HEADLEE: Biology? MANNING: Yeah. Biology, I didn't really want to do it. HEADLEE: No interest in biology, but computer science - do you plan to pursue a job in the STEM fields? MANNING: Yes, astrophysics. HEADLEE: Astrophysics, you're going to be a new Neil deGrasse Tyson? MANNING: Yes, I'm assuming. . . HEADLEE: Only one of the greatest astrophysicists working today and one of the greatest black scientists of all time. Xavier, you need to do your homework. All right, so let's - I wanted to ask you what are you prepared for in terms of - or do you think you need to be prepared for anything in terms of prejudice or lack of opportunities for somebody who's black or Latino? MANNING: What I'm looking forward to doing is the PSAT - the PSAT. I'm looking to, like. . . HEADLEE: The standardized test you have to take to get placement in college. MANNING: Yeah I'm, like, I'm trying to become a merit scholar, so I can go to school I want to go to, like Harvard or some of that prestige. So they can't, like, turn me down for that. HEADLEE: Ciara, what do you think about it? Do you have a plan like Xavier has for preparing yourself to make yourself successful? CHASE: I do because a lot of people push me hard and also because this school that I'm at, they don't sugarcoat anything. They told me that I'm going have to - there are people that are going to doubt me. So I am already prepared for that, and so, yeah. HEADLEE: I wanted to read you a couple tweets from some of the people - innovators that have been engaging with you two and others during this month through the hashtag we've been using #NPRBlacksInTech. For example, Monique (ph) wrote that one of the ways to interest young kids is that students should know it's not about being technical, that STEM and tech are about creating things. Xavier, you're nodding your head. Your response is, yes, that's accurate? MANNING: Yes. Science, it is all about creativity. Like, it's innovative, you know. So it's - an innovation needs creativity. It's like 80 percent creativity right there and only, like, 20 percent logic. So I agree with her thought about that, about creativity being a big factor in science. HEADLEE: Well Dr. - somebody under @DrFayOnline writes, tech skills may open doors, but soft skills and business acumen drive the process. Ms. Hurt, what are soft skills? HURT: They're people skills. They're being able to be charismatic. A person buys you, not your product most times. So if you sell it well, you give a good presentation, then they're going to go, you know what, I like him, I like her. And that's how a lot of people get things done because talent is only a part of it. It's really the other piece that sells and gets you where you got to go. HEADLEE: So, Ciara, how do you learn soft skills? Are you learning that your classes? CHASE: Yes, because we have to do a lot of presentations in our class and talk to a lot of people. And a lot of people talk to us. So I think a big aspect of that would have to be talking, and so we do a lot of that and also presenting ourselves well. HEADLEE: OK, so let me read you one more tweet. This is from Christine Celease (ph) - I hope I'm pronouncing that correct - who says, I wasn't a straight A student but was an overachiever in other ways. I was a student government wonk and creative. So, Xavier, I mean, obviously, if you want to get into Harvard, you need to keep your grades up. MANNING: Yes. HEADLEE: But what are the other things you need to get involved in, do you think, in order to set yourself up to succeed in technology? MANNING: You have to try to get yourself into some other programs, like some summer programs, like Junior NYLC. It's basically a junior national leadership conference that's actually here in D. C. Like, it happens every summer, or it also happens during the year, like, a week long. And basically what it does, it gets you for, like, for young leaders basically to get you to lead yourself and lead others by looking at other leaders in history. NSBY, NSBY is another one that actually works in STEM and engineering, so stuff like that. If you have that on your sheet to apply to a college, it's going to be really - they're going to be interested in you, and they'll interview you. HEADLEE: All right, I want to read one more tweet. This is from B. Lawrence Clark (ph) and this person says - when they were asked how do you get new people involved in tech - they say, just start. So, Ciara, I wonder if I can get both of you to kind of - if there's any young people your age out there listening who is like, look, that's not - that's going to ruin my rep if I start, you know, learning about science and mathematics - what's the message you would give for somebody out there who might think about pursuing technology, and is kind of on the fence? What would you say to them? CHASE: I would say follow your heart. And, like, f you have a good idea, don't be scared to hold back. Just, like, get it out there and let people know. HEADLEE: And, Xavier, what would you say? MANNING: I would regret something that I didn't do as opposed to something I did do. So if you're thinking about doing it, just do it. Try it, at least try it. So if you don't like it, fine don't like it, but try something else that might work and help you. So, like, if you don't try it then how do you know if you'll - if it'll work for you or if it doesn't. HEADLEE: It's good advice, even coming from some of you guys' age. Good luck. Thanks to both of you. Follow our social storytelling series. You can follow the hashtag NPRBlacksInTech or you can go to NPR. org/TELLMEMORE. I've been joined by Xavier Manning, Ciara Chase, both students at Howard University Middle School of Mathematics and Science, here in Washington, D. C. And their guidance counselor, Carletta Hurt also joined us in our studios in Washington. Thanks to all of you. HURT: Thank you. CHASE: Thanks for having us. MANNING: Thanks for having us. CELESTE HEADLEE, HOST:  This is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. I'm Celeste Headlee. Michel Martin is away. Let's talk now about our social storytelling series that's happening online this month using the hash tag @NPRBlacksInTech. Since December 2nd, black tech innovators from all over the country have been tweeting a day in their lives. We've had a physicist from New Jersey tweet about his research in nanotechnology. We had an entrepreneur in Wisconsin talking about the challenges of building a startup. And some of them are actually answering questions that come from seventh- and eighth-graders at Howard University Middle School of Mathematics and Science. So now we have, today, two of those middle-school students with us. Xavier Manning and Ciara Chase join us in studio not only to talk about this conversation happening around social media, but also to talk about the mobile apps they've been creating in their own classroom. We're also joined by their guidance counselor, Carletta Hurt. Welcome to all of you. Xavier, Ciara, Ms. Carletta Hurt - thanks. XAVIER MANNING: Thanks for having us. CIARA CHASE: Hi. CARLETTA HURT: Thank you. HEADLEE: Xavier and Ciara, you have been a big hit. I mean, you've probably noticed the reaction to your questions and your comments using that hash tag, NPRBlacksInTech. So first of all, thank you for that, and for engaging with some of the other innovators. CHASE: Thank you. HEADLEE: Tell us first about your app that you're designing in class. First of all, are these functional? Do these work, or they're just a class project? MANNING: We're going to try to make them real but for now, they're just an idea. My app is Trash Tracker. So basically, you know how like, usually on Monday morning - how the trash man goes to every house in the area to get the trash. HEADLEE: Yeah. MANNING: And sometimes your trash is not even there, so it just wastes a lot of time for the trash man. So with the app, you basically get to pick a button that says if I need my trash taken out. And if you need your trash taken out, it goes to your address. And if you pick, I don't need my trash taken out, it just skips it, which saves time. And takes the worry off your shoulders to make sure you get your trash taken out 'cause you can press that any day. And then next time it's time to take out the trash, he takes out the trash. HEADLEE: That's a pretty basic interface. I guess I'm kind of surprised that no one's thought of that before. What made you think of it? MANNING: What made me think of it is when I lived in New York. . . HEADLEE: Wait, do you have to take out the trash? Is that what. . . MANNING: Exactly. HEADLEE: OK. MANNING: On Monday mornings, I had to wake up early. So I'd rather have it me - like an app, you know, if I wanted to play basketball, just take out the trash then. And then push the button so I can just relax for an extra 30 minutes on Monday morning. HEADLEE: OK, it's all coming clear to me now, Xavier. Ciara, let's talk about your app. What was your idea? CHASE: The name of our app was Minority Matters. And recently, we saw an article published by Jet Magazine and it stated that every hour, 17 minority children are kidnapped. So for our app, it's basically so a parent can post their child's kidnapping because without the app, you have to go through like, a lot of police reports, or post signs and stuff, to find your child. But for the app, if you find that your child is missing, you're able to post it. And anyone that has information about the child is able to comment under the post, so they can help you in a faster way because usually after three hours, a lot of damage is already done to the child. It's a faster way to help them. HEADLEE: Obviously, this is not functional yet. So thinking ahead, how do you prevent overuse of it? Someone who's kid went next door, and they just don't know where their kid is? CHASE: It's usually, like, a time limit that you would consider your child from being kidnapped. Like, you would know when your child has been away for a long time. And also, if the next-door neighbor sees that your child has been kidnapped, they can easily comment under the post saying, oh, your child is over my house. HEADLEE: They're in my house having cookies, right? CHASE: Yeah. HEADLEE: So, Carletta, talk to me about why we use apps. Is it because so many kids have smart phones today? Is this just a way to engage kids? HURT: It is. And one of the biggest parts of this project was, how can you make a change in your community using technology? That was kind of the question posed to the students - using technology and helping your community in some way shape or form. And that's how these apps came about. There were other apps, as well. So, the idea. . . HEADLEE: What were some of the other good ideas that you. . . HURT: There was a news connection app where it talks about how to get young people engaged in news worthy information because a lot of them get news from, like, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram. And it's not always reliable. So there was an app that - it's called News Connection. HEADLEE: You're kidding me? Sometimes tweets about news are not accurate? That shocks me to the core. HURT: I know. It's amazing to think that, but yes. It does happen. And another one was - oh, my God - come on, Xavier and Ciara. What were some other apps in class? CHASE: Another idea was a workout app. So the app would basically tell you - it would help you plan your workouts better. And a problem was the obesity that's happening. So the app would, like, help you plan your workouts and let you know when you need to work out. HEADLEE: You know, one of the things that I found coming up a lot - that we've had in using this hash tag NPRBlacksInTech was how you engage - and you've probably seen these - how do we engage middle schoolers in STEM sciences, and especially blacks and Latinos, which is a real problem, and they're incredibly underrepresented in the STEM sciences. So what are your ideas? I mean, how does somebody engage you to study science and mathematics? MANNING: What I would suggest is that you do something that we like and put it in there. So in our community we're more connected to hip-hop. So if they put something with hip-hop in it, they might be like, this sounds pretty good. Let me listen to it. If they listen to a lyric or something and they're like, wait, that has something to do with science? They'll remember it because it's in hip-hop form. So. . . HEADLEE: You mean real hip-hop. You don't want to see your science teacher actually trying to rap right? MANNING: No. No. HEADLEE: Ciara, what do you think? CHASE: Basically, that's what I was saying - something that relates to the child because if it relates to you, you have a better connection and you can express yourself more with it. HEADLEE: So what do you think is the problem in getting black and Latino young kids especially into the STEM scientists, where's the disconnect here? CHASE: They don't find the interest in it, and they don't think that it can actually help anybody. So, yeah. MANNING: I agree with her about the connection to our kids in that community. So I think that might be an issue, the fact that they're like, here's a book about it, read it. And just like a lot of kids in all races, we really don't like to read that much. So if you put it in, like, songs or something. HEADLEE: Your guidance counselor is waiting to jump in here. Your response to that - kids don't like to read? HURT: Reading is fundamental. But no, I was going to say, another thing that I've noticed as a guidance counselor in talking to students and parents and even reading literature and talking to other professionals, is that engagement factor and understanding that you can do science and science isn't as difficult as it may sound. And I think sometimes some students, especially minority students, because of exposure and opportunities they shy away and think, well, I'm not smart enough, I'm not good enough. HEADLEE: Yeah. HURT: But one recent article said that most girls said that they never knew they could. It was just saying, hey, you can do that, you are able. And what we do at our school is tell them you could do this. Like, yes, you can create an app. HEADLEE: You're kind of preaching to the choir, right? I mean, this is the school of mathematics and science. HURT: But we service everybody in D. C. , so we have no - we don't screen students. It's a lottery so we get everybody. HEADLEE: Oh, I see. HURT: So there's no way to say, OK, this is the cream of the crop from these elementary schools, we see everybody. It's a public lottery. HEADLEE: If you're just joining us, we're talking about middle schools especially, and their engagement with technology as part of our social media conversation that we're having all this month using the hashtag #NPRBlacksInTech. We have two middle school students with us. Xavier Manning and Ciara Chase from the Howard University Middle School of Mathematics and Science. And also their guidance counselor, Carletta Hurt.

Is it considered to be not authentic for people who are - either come from the African-American tradition or come from a Hispanic tradition? Ciara, what do you think? CHASE: I think that is a good aspect of it because a lot of people doubt you when you say that and they don't believe you can do it. But with my school they, like, push us so we don't have a choice. So I think people need to push children a lot more so they can believe in themselves because a lot of others doubt them. HEADLEE: What do you think, Xavier? MANNING: Well, I think that turns it more to a bullying asset. Like, say you come into a school and you like math and science so much and you see that the kids at your school, like your peers, they don't like it and they might bully. Like, you're a nerd, you're a geek, like some kind of robot or something 'cause you do math so well. That might make you want to be like, you know what, forget math and science, I just want to not be bullied. HEADLEE: Yeah. MANNING: So that might turn you away from it. HEADLEE: Have you had experience with that kind of thing? MANNING: Yes. I just kept doing what I did and I just kept getting good grades and just kept doing what I did. HEADLEE: The innovators who've engaged in conversations have talked about some of the bigotry in STEM sciences. It can be a problem.

Even if it's not me, I want to just get it out there. HEADLEE: Your app idea to find missing kids. CHASE: Yes. I just want to get that out there because it's not about me, it's about a lot of children that get kidnapped. So. . . HEADLEE: And we're using this word STEM a lot. Of course for those who are not familiar with it, it means science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Not law, Ciara. (LAUGHTER) HEADLEE: Carletta, what do you think - how does the school handle preparing kids who might want to go into the STEM field - science, technology, engineering, mathematics - and do you address at all issues that they may have to deal with in terms of prejudice or especially gender bias? CHASE: Well, one thing at our school, every student is exposed to STEM. So in that aspect, the bullying piece isn't really a big deal 'cause you all have to do it. Now some may excel more than others. And, of course, we do have accelerated classes, which these two students are participating in. But the other piece that we also see - we show a diversity of people in STEM. We make sure there are female teachers as well as male teachers, and all different kinds of teachers. So those speakers come in. We have a really strong partnership with Howard University where they bring in professionals to these classrooms to talk to students 'cause our idea is exposure. And also making them do something. They may only do it one or two years of the three years there, but at least they get the opportunity and they figure out, OK, science isn't as boring as I thought or engineering is about creating computer games and playing PlayStation versus what I thought it was. So it's also about showing them those nuances that don't really look like STEM but really are STEM. HEADLEE: Xavier, did you think science was boring before you got to Howard? MANNING: No, because when I was in pre-K, my aunt made me read a whole bunch of. . . HEADLEE: You remember what happened to you in pre-K? MANNING: Yes. HEADLEE: Wow. MANNING: My aunt made me read a bunch of astronomy books. Like, this one - Pluto was counted as a planet. HEADLEE: Still a planet and not a dwarf planet. MANNING: Yeah, so when we did this I really got interested. So I got more books on it from Barnes & Noble and basically I kept reading up on that. Like, once I hit, like, biology, I was like - like I just saw cartoons of biology and stuff like that, I was like, I don't want to do it. HEADLEE: Biology? MANNING: Yeah. Biology, I didn't really want to do it. HEADLEE: No interest in biology, but computer science - do you plan to pursue a job in the STEM fields? MANNING: Yes, astrophysics. HEADLEE: Astrophysics, you're going to be a new Neil deGrasse Tyson? MANNING: Yes, I'm assuming. . . HEADLEE: Only one of the greatest astrophysicists working today and one of the greatest black scientists of all time. Xavier, you need to do your homework. All right, so let's - I wanted to ask you what are you prepared for in terms of - or do you think you need to be prepared for anything in terms of prejudice or lack of opportunities for somebody who's black or Latino? MANNING: What I'm looking forward to doing is the PSAT - the PSAT. I'm looking to, like. . . HEADLEE: The standardized test you have to take to get placement in college. MANNING: Yeah I'm, like, I'm trying to become a merit scholar, so I can go to school I want to go to, like Harvard or some of that prestige. So they can't, like, turn me down for that. HEADLEE: Ciara, what do you think about it? Do you have a plan like Xavier has for preparing yourself to make yourself successful? CHASE: I do because a lot of people push me hard and also because this school that I'm at, they don't sugarcoat anything. They told me that I'm going have to - there are people that are going to doubt me. So I am already prepared for that, and so, yeah. HEADLEE: I wanted to read you a couple tweets from some of the people - innovators that have been engaging with you two and others during this month through the hashtag we've been using #NPRBlacksInTech. For example, Monique (ph) wrote that one of the ways to interest young kids is that students should know it's not about being technical, that STEM and tech are about creating things.

It's like 80 percent creativity right there and only, like, 20 percent logic. So I agree with her thought about that, about creativity being a big factor in science. HEADLEE: Well Dr. - somebody under @DrFayOnline writes, tech skills may open doors, but soft skills and business acumen drive the process. Ms. Hurt, what are soft skills? HURT: They're people skills. They're being able to be charismatic. A person buys you, not your product most times. So if you sell it well, you give a good presentation, then they're going to go, you know what, I like him, I like her. And that's how a lot of people get things done because talent is only a part of it. It's really the other piece that sells and gets you where you got to go. HEADLEE: So, Ciara, how do you learn soft skills? Are you learning that your classes? CHASE: Yes, because we have to do a lot of presentations in our class and talk to a lot of people. And a lot of people talk to us. So I think a big aspect of that would have to be talking, and so we do a lot of that and also presenting ourselves well. HEADLEE: OK, so let me read you one more tweet. This is from Christine Celease (ph) - I hope I'm pronouncing that correct - who says, I wasn't a straight A student but was an overachiever in other ways. I was a student government wonk and creative. So, Xavier, I mean, obviously, if you want to get into Harvard, you need to keep your grades up. MANNING: Yes.

And basically what it does, it gets you for, like, for young leaders basically to get you to lead yourself and lead others by looking at other leaders in history. NSBY, NSBY is another one that actually works in STEM and engineering, so stuff like that. If you have that on your sheet to apply to a college, it's going to be really - they're going to be interested in you, and they'll interview you. HEADLEE: All right, I want to read one more tweet. This is from B. Lawrence Clark (ph) and this person says - when they were asked how do you get new people involved in tech - they say, just start. So, Ciara, I wonder if I can get both of you to kind of - if there's any young people your age out there listening who is like, look, that's not - that's going to ruin my rep if I start, you know, learning about science and mathematics - what's the message you would give for somebody out there who might think about pursuing technology, and is kind of on the fence? What would you say to them? CHASE: I would say follow your heart. And, like, f you have a good idea, don't be scared to hold back. Just, like, get it out there and let people know. HEADLEE: And, Xavier, what would you say? MANNING: I would regret something that I didn't do as opposed to something I did do. So if you're thinking about doing it, just do it. Try it, at least try it. So if you don't like it, fine don't like it, but try something else that might work and help you. So, like, if you don't try it then how do you know if you'll - if it'll work for you or if it doesn't. HEADLEE: It's good advice, even coming from some of you guys' age. Good luck.

MCWHORTER: You know, even though this is basically speaking with the fingers, nobody ever said that it was as fast. RAZ: OK, so he snuck it in there, but that is, basically, John McWhorter's big idea idea, that texting is more like speaking than writing. and that makes it almost like a new form of language, which brings us to today's show - language, spoken and unspoken. How it started, how it's changing and how words might not be the most important part of it. But first, what could texting mean for the future of human communication? Here's John McWhorter's TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MCWHORTER: Basically, if we think about language, language has existed for, perhaps, 150,000, at least 80,000 years. And what it arose as is speech. People talked. That's what we're probably genetically specified for, that's how we use language most. Writing is something that came along much later. If humanity had existed for 24 hours, then writing only came along at about 11:07 p. m. , that's how much of a latterly thing writing is. Now of course, as history has gone by, it's been natural for there to be a certain amount of bleed between speech and writing. In a distant era now, it was common when one gave a speech, to basically talk like writing. So, for example, the Gettysburg Address was not the main meal of that event. For two hours before that, Edward Everett spoke on a topic that, frankly, cannot engage us today and barely did then. The point of it was to listen to him speaking like writing. Ordinary people stood and listened to that for two hours. It was perfectly natural. That's what people did then - speaking like writing. Well, if you can speak like writing, then logically it follows that you might want to also sometimes write like you speak. The problem was just that in the material-mechanical sense, that was harder back in the day. It's almost impossible to do that with your hand, except in shorthand and then communication is limited. On a manual typewriter, it was very difficult. And even when we had electric typewriters or then computer keyboards, the fact is that even if you can type easily enough to keep up with the pace of speech, more or less, you have to have somebody who can receive your message quickly. Once you have things in your pocket that can receive that message, then you have the conditions that allow that we can write like we speak. And it's a very interesting thing, but nevertheless easy to think that still it represents some sort of decline, that something has gone wrong. But the fact of the matter is that what is going on is a kind of emergent complexity. RAZ: OK. Texting, is this like a serious thing for academics to be studying? Like, the great linguists of the world, are they saying, yeah, OK, let's sit down and, like, do a symposium on this thing 'cause this is the real deal? MCWHORTER: Yes. RAZ: Wow. MCWHORTER: I mean, I'm not aware of a particular great symposium where people with three names and muttonchops are sitting down and talking about these things, but definitely it has become a thing - to use a current locution - to do papers on texting. I would say that anybody who teaches linguistics these days is expecting to see papers from students on texting. And it's because language changes, generally, slowly and below the radar. Whereas this, if I, in 1993, saw some of the text messages that we just traded at the beginning of this interview, I wouldn't have know what to make of it at all. I wouldn't have had anywhere to grab onto. And that's something that happened so very quickly. Linguists don't usually get to see language changing right now and this quickly. So yeah, it's a feast. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MCWHORTER: And so for example, LOL. If you text now or if you are someone who's aware of the substrate of texting the way it's become, you'll notice that LOL does not mean laughing out loud anymore. It's evolved into something that is much subtler. This is an actual text that was done by a non-male person of about 20 years old, not too long ago. I love the font you're using, btw. Julie - LOL. . . JULIE: LOL. Thanks Gmail is being slow right now. MCWHORTER: If you think about it, that's not funny. No one's laughing. (LAUGHTER)MCWHORTER: And yet, there it is. So you assume there's been some kind of hiccup. Then Susan says, LOL, I know. SUSAN: LOL, I know. MCWHORTER: Again, more guffawing then we're used to when you're talking about these inconveniences. So Julie says, I just sent you an e-mail. Susan, LOL. SUSAN: LOL, I see it. MCWHORTER: Very funny people if that's what LOL means. Julie says. . . JULIE: So, what's up? MCWHORTER: Susan - LOL, I have to write a 10-page paper. She's not amused. Let's think about it. LOL is being used in a very particular way. It's a marker of empathy. It's a marker of accommodation. We linguists call things like that pragmatic particles. Any spoken language that's used by real people has them. If you happen to speak Japanese, think about that little word \"ne\" that you use at the end of a lot of sentences. If you listen to the way black youth today speak, think about the use of the word \"yo. \" Whole dissertations could be written about it and probably are being written about it. A pragmatic particle, that's what LOL has gradually become. It's a way of using the language between actual people. And what's really important about a lot of these conventions is that they're actually quite sophisticated. To figure out what LOL actually means in the way that a linguist can figure out what even means in a sentence like, he didn't even come. Imagine explaining to a foreigner what that even means. To do it in linguist-style is every bit as challenging as figuring out an even or figuring out what like means in - he was, like, tired. As slangy and sweat-sock as that sounds to us, it really is a very really subtle little item. But like took years and years and years and years and years to happen. Whereas these are coming in in an instant. RAZ: And here's the thing John McWhorter is noticing. The language we use in texting, it's looping back into our daily speech as in O-M-G or slash to change a subject quickly, or when people say, out loud, hashtag. MCWHORTER: And so there are two possibilities. It could be that we're living in a time where it's considered cute to use things that you get from texting and from Twitter in speech as a gentle way to show how hip you are and to be part of the conversation. Or maybe we're seeing the beginning of a constant kind of interaction between texting conventions and speech that will never end. And so we've got this brand-new layer of language that'll keep feeding in. RAZ: So it's interesting, right, because we hear a lot about how, like, young people - they're texting and they're not really communicating and they're not going to develop communication skills. Do you think that's, like - there's something to that? MCWHORTER: You know, having watched a fair number of people go through their teen years texting an awful lot, I can't say that I've seen evidence that texting a lot is going to interfere with people's ability to carry on a conversation, to enter into a relationship, etc. You might worry that it might, but I'm not sure that it does. I think that the social effect of texting that we most have to worry about is the fact that with the distance that's always there, even with the illusion of intimacy, it's easier to be mean. I think we're seeing a lot of this with the bullying episodes that sometimes even lead people to suicide. Texting, as well as equivalent sorts of communications on the screen through Facebook and Gchat, make those sorts of things easier than they used to be when bullying was a matter of walking up to somebody and saying something. That something that's worrisome. RAZ: OK. How long before texting is a language taught at universities and, you know, fancy private schools? MCWHORTER: You know something? I would make a prediction - I'm going to make a nervy prediction just for the heck of it. RAZ: All right. OK. MCWHORTER: That within 2014 we will hear a report of texting lessons of some kind. Maybe for foreigners or maybe there will be some enterprising, young 20-something or Zuckerberg-y person who will present something like that as something 12-year-olds. . . RAZ: Berlitz for texters. Yeah. MCWHORTER: Yeah. I mean. . . RAZ: Yeah. Yes. MCWHORTER: . . . \"Texting for Dummies\". . . RAZ: Right. MCWHORTER: . . . Certainly, 2014. RAZ: And there will be outrage. MCWHORTER: Oh, yeah. RAZ: There will be media outrage. MCWHORTER: How dare - it'll be like the Ebonics controversy. How dare you treat this as something. . . RAZ: Right. MCWHORTER: . . . Respectable. But that will only make it more interesting to more people. I kind of wish I could write \"Texting for Dummies. \"RAZ: Maybe, maybe that should. . . MCWHORTER: It would be a fun book to write. RAZ: Maybe you should do it. MCWHORTER: You know, I'm going to ask those dummies people - whoever they are. RAZ: OK. Can I get a cut? MCWHORTER: You will. You get 10 percent of the. . . (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MCWHORTER: And so the way I'm thinking of texting these days is that what we're seeing is a whole new way of writing that young people are developing, which they're using alongside their ordinary writing skills. And that means that they're able to do two things. Increasing evidence is that being bilingual is cognitively beneficial. That's also true of being bidialectal. That's certainly true of being bidialectal in terms of your writing. And so texting actually is evidence of a balancing act that young people are using today, not consciously of course, but it's an expansion of their linguistic repertoire. So in closing, if I could go into the future - if I could go into 2033, the first thing I would ask is whether David Simon had done a sequel to \"The Wire. \" I would want to know. (APPLAUSE)MCWHORTER: And I really would ask that. And then I'd want to know, actually, what was going on on \"Downton Abbey. \" That'd be the second thing. And then the third thing would be, please show me a sheaf of texts written by 16-year-old girls because I would want to know where this language had developed since our times. And ideally, I would then send them back to you and me now so we could examine this linguistic miracle happening right under our noses. Thank you very much.

Such convenience, such great deals. Still, there is a downside. (SOUNDBITE OF NEWS REPORTS)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Federal officials trying to stop a major hacking attack from happening. . . UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: The prying eyes of a hacker are to blame for. . . UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: . . . some names, emails, addresses and passwords have been compromised. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Twenty-four million people at risk for identity theft. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: . . . how to keep your data safe and secure in 60 seconds. RATH: Of course, there are laws to make sure companies protect your sensitive data. Well, actually, no. WOODROW HARTZOG: There is no one law in the United States that mandates that websites and phone applications have good data security. RATH: That's our cover story today: Who is the sheriff of cybertown? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RATH: There is no one law to make sure your data are protected in the cyberspace. Even the question of who should be protecting the consumer's up for debate. The Federal Trade Commission, under its authority to protect consumers, has stepped in to fill the void and police data security. Since the early 2000s, the FTC has brought close to 50 cases against companies with lax data security practices that they say have put consumers at risk. But now, one of those companies, Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, is fighting back, basically telling the FTC, sorry, you're not the boss of us. Jessica Rich is the director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. JESSICA RICH: We allege that Wyndham's unreasonable data security practices permitted hackers to access its network on three separate occasions over the course of two years. RATH: Wyndham Worldwide Corporation is challenging the FTC's authority to bring complaints against companies in the first place. Here's what happened. Computer servers at the hotel chain were hacked. The hackers exported credit card information from hundreds of thousands of consumers to a Russian domain. The result? Close to $11 million in fraudulent charges. Rich claims there were simple steps that could've been taken to prevent the damage. RICH: Just some examples: Wyndham didn't require complex passwords for systems that managed consumers' payment card information; Wyndham stored credit card numbers in clear readable texts, making it much more available to hackers. RATH: Wyndham declined to provide a comment on the air because the case is still in active litigation. In a statement, the company said that Congress has not provided the FTC with the broad authority to pursue such cases against American businesses. The FTC's Jessica Rich disagrees. RICH: We have authority to bring action against companies that engage in either deceptive or unfair practices. Deceptive practices means that companies have made misstatements about the level of security they provide, or unfairness basically means putting consumers at unreasonable risk of injury. RATH: To protect the consumer, the FTC wants companies to take strong measures to prevent personal data from falling into the wrong hands. RICH: There have been so many breeches of data in recent years. Identity theft has really been on the rise. It's a high priority at the Federal Trade Commission to promote better data security, including by bringing action against companies that fail to do so. RATH: When the FTC finds a company has failed to sufficiently protect consumers, it levies penalties. Companies are required to implement a data security program, often for up to 20 years. Companies must report to the FTC, and there are third-party audit requirements. In some cases, civil penalties also apply. Again, Jessica Rich. RICH: And that's a very powerful tool to make sure that the company implements data security in the future. RATH: For their part, Wyndham Worldwide says they did have substantial security measures in place. Their statement to NPR goes on to say, quote, \"To our knowledge, the cybercriminals responsible for the attacks have never been apprehended by law enforcement officials. \"Woodrow Hartzog is a professor focusing on privacy issues at the Samford University Law School. HARTZOG: A popular argument is that the FTC is punishing the victim here. They are punishing the person who was victimized by a burglar in their own house. RATH: Hartzog doesn't buy that argument. HARTZOG: I think the much better analogy is that the FTC is punishing companies like Wyndham for leaving their door unlocked, but it was someone else's stuff that was inside the house. RATH: Jessica Rich says the FTC does acknowledge the wrongdoing of the hackers. RICH: But any company that collects sensitive information from consumers and fails to protect it is also at fault. And so to stop these types of breeches, we believe it's also appropriate to hold the company accountable. RATH: But who should hold the companies accountable is not clear. Congress has never officially passed a broad data security policy. Without the FTC in a de facto role, it starts to look a little like there's no sheriff in town. Again, Professor Hartzog. HARTZOG: If you have health information and if you have financial information, then you have to provide a certain amount of data security. But for the most part, this is largely an unregulated area. We've made the decision years ago to try to approach privacy in a fragmented kind of way. Inevitably, what that means is that things fall through the cracks. RATH: When the Internet was first adopted, people realized that personal information would be out there, but there was no clear way to regulate it. So companies started coming up with those wonderful disclaimers you have to click on. Here's a dramatic reading.

Ilana Westerman says it's a new world for everyone. WESTERMAN: For designers, for developers, for companies, for consumers. And so, I think as people who are creating these types of products and services for consumers, it's just our job to, as much as possible, try to create that transparency for them. RATH: But as to whose job it is to police that transparency, until the Wyndham case, the FTC had been doing that unchallenged. All cases before this one have ended in settlements. It's usually less expensive to just settle and follow the FTC guidelines. So I asked Professor Hartzog: For all of us out there going through the motions and ignoring privacy policies, are we being dumb? HARTZOG: No. One thing that almost everybody knows about privacy policies is that nobody reads them. In fact, these things are very rarely enforced as contracts. So I think the FTC has come to recognize that it's relatively insane to ask consumers to read and understand all of these agreements, and so they're going to act accordingly. RATH: Meanwhile, Wyndham Hotel's case against the Federal Trade Commission drags on in a New Jersey federal court. Oral arguments concluded in early November. In recent years, several data security bills have been proposed in Congress, but all have languished thus far. If the Federal Trade Commission loses to Wyndham, the question of who protects the Internet consumer will be getting a lot more attention. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ARUN RATH, HOST:  As a country, we love to shop online. Such convenience, such great deals. Still, there is a downside. (SOUNDBITE OF NEWS REPORTS) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Federal officials trying to stop a major hacking attack from happening. . . UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: The prying eyes of a hacker are to blame for. . . UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: . . . some names, emails, addresses and passwords have been compromised. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Twenty-four million people at risk for identity theft. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: . . . how to keep your data safe and secure in 60 seconds. RATH: Of course, there are laws to make sure companies protect your sensitive data. Well, actually, no. WOODROW HARTZOG: There is no one law in the United States that mandates that websites and phone applications have good data security. RATH: That's our cover story today: Who is the sheriff of cybertown? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RATH: There is no one law to make sure your data are protected in the cyberspace. Even the question of who should be protecting the consumer's up for debate. The Federal Trade Commission, under its authority to protect consumers, has stepped in to fill the void and police data security. Since the early 2000s, the FTC has brought close to 50 cases against companies with lax data security practices that they say have put consumers at risk. But now, one of those companies, Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, is fighting back, basically telling the FTC, sorry, you're not the boss of us. Jessica Rich is the director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. JESSICA RICH: We allege that Wyndham's unreasonable data security practices permitted hackers to access its network on three separate occasions over the course of two years. RATH: Wyndham Worldwide Corporation is challenging the FTC's authority to bring complaints against companies in the first place. Here's what happened. Computer servers at the hotel chain were hacked. The hackers exported credit card information from hundreds of thousands of consumers to a Russian domain. The result? Close to $11 million in fraudulent charges. Rich claims there were simple steps that could've been taken to prevent the damage. RICH: Just some examples: Wyndham didn't require complex passwords for systems that managed consumers' payment card information; Wyndham stored credit card numbers in clear readable texts, making it much more available to hackers. RATH: Wyndham declined to provide a comment on the air because the case is still in active litigation. In a statement, the company said that Congress has not provided the FTC with the broad authority to pursue such cases against American businesses. The FTC's Jessica Rich disagrees. RICH: We have authority to bring action against companies that engage in either deceptive or unfair practices. Deceptive practices means that companies have made misstatements about the level of security they provide, or unfairness basically means putting consumers at unreasonable risk of injury. RATH: To protect the consumer, the FTC wants companies to take strong measures to prevent personal data from falling into the wrong hands. RICH: There have been so many breeches of data in recent years. Identity theft has really been on the rise. It's a high priority at the Federal Trade Commission to promote better data security, including by bringing action against companies that fail to do so. RATH: When the FTC finds a company has failed to sufficiently protect consumers, it levies penalties. Companies are required to implement a data security program, often for up to 20 years. Companies must report to the FTC, and there are third-party audit requirements. In some cases, civil penalties also apply. Again, Jessica Rich. RICH: And that's a very powerful tool to make sure that the company implements data security in the future. RATH: For their part, Wyndham Worldwide says they did have substantial security measures in place.

Now we go behind closed doors. Now this is the part of the program where we talk about issues that people usually keep private. Today, though, we want to talk about something that kind of straddles the border between public and private. And that is the increasingly open debate about how the sexuality of girls and women is both being displayed and being discussed. And this is probably a good place to say that you might consider this a sensitive issue because of the subject matter and the language that we plan to use. And this is on our radar in part because \"Parks and Recreation\" actress Rashida Jones recently got social media going with her Twitter takedown of a number of female pop stars for their hypersexual performances. On Twitter, she called on these stars to, in the words of her hashtag, quote, stop acting like whores. And that in turn set off a brouhaha over when, and indeed whether, it's ever OK to call out other women or girls for their sexuality or their perceived sexuality because of their dress or behavior. It turns out that even very young girls have been targeted by comments on the Twitter #FastTailedGirls. We wanted to talk about all this - the controversy on Twitter and beyond - so we've called Mikki Kendall. She helped start the #FastTailedGirls. Mikki, thanks so much for joining us once again. MIKKI KENDALL: Thank you for having me. MARTIN: Also with us is Prachi Gupta of Salon. com. She's written about Rashida Jones' comments and the feminist debate over so-called slut shaming. Prachi, welcome to you. Thank you so much for joining us. PRACHI GUPTA: Thanks for having me. MARTIN: And back with us, Keli Goff, correspondent for TheRoot. com and columnist for The Daily Beast. She often writes about these issues. Keli, welcome back to you. KELI GOFF: Good to be back. MARTIN: So, Mikki, let me start with you because you started the #FastTailedGirls. And why did you start it, and what are some of the striking conversations that you've had through the hashtag? KENDALL: I started the hashtag because I was one of the fast tailed girls. And it didn't really matter what we were doing - if we were hanging around boys, if we were wearing skirts, if we were just tomboys - you got a lot of that growing up. MARTIN: What is a fast-tail girl? KENDALL: And we've had a lot of conversations. . . MARTIN: Can I start with you? What is a fast-tail girl? Maybe everybody hasn't heard that expression. KENDALL: OK. Fast-tailed girl, at least in the African-American community, is often used to refer to a girl who is theoretically sexually promiscuous in some way or may be sexually promiscuous. Girls are called - especially like with the R. Kelly case - girls were called fast. They're supposed to fast-tailed. And what it really means is that they are asking for it. They are seeking sex in an inappropriate way. MARTIN: And what are you trying to accomplish with the hashtag, to sort of - to blow that up or to sort of get people to stop using that expression or what? KENDALL: I wanted to blow up the idea that - we say boys will be boys, but women, young girls and young women, are suddenly supposed to be so demure, so pure. And we send the message that boys can do whatever they want, but girls are dirty if they explore their sexuality. MARTIN: Now, Keli. . . KENDALL: And there's something really intrinsically wrong with that. MARTIN: OK, double standard. KENDALL: Yes. MARTIN: OK. Keli, now you wrote about the fact that - you know, you said that you liked what Rashida Jones had to say. And for people who aren't familiar with what she had to say - I mean, one of the things that you pointed out is that it's actually a fairly nuanced message that she is offering. You're saying - for example, she wrote, you know, she started with her Twitter comment, that got a kind of a response. And then she offered a lengthier explanation in an op-ed in Glamour magazine. And she says that she would never point a finger at a woman for her actual sexual behavior. She thinks that all women have the right to express their desires. She argues this isn't showing female sexuality. This is showing what it looks like when women sell sex. And she argues that her problem is that this is becoming the norm. If you're not - the norm - particularly in pop culture, if you're not showing skin it's almost like you're not even allowed to be there. Keli, take it from there. GOFF: Yeah, it sort of like, a bit, reminded me of the analogy, Michel, of all of those so-called gangster rappers who were talking about, like, living hard and shooting up people and slinging rock. And then it turned out that a lot of them went to prep schools. And that's kind of the argument I felt that she was making here, which is it's one thing if you're saying I'm a sexual being, I own being a sexual being and that's my right. It's another when you're sort of perpetrating this farcical image to the little girls who look up to you simply to make a buck and simply because a man is essentially asking you to do that at a record label. The other thing, though, I want to say - 'cause I think it's a hugely important distinction in this whole conversation - is girls are completely off limits. A child is not someone who can ask for it, who is a sexual being, who is promoting her sexuality. There are women who can say I'm a sexual being who's promoting my sexuality, and I am trying to get attention from a man. But no 13-year-old girl does that. I just want to make sure that that was on the record - that we really are talking about two separate groups because the whole Roman Polanski thing is something I've written about a lot. And it really enrages me that there are still people to this day who say that that girl was very, you know, sexual and promiscuous and flirtatious. No, a 13-year-old doesn't get to be that. There are 27-year-old women who can be that, but a 13-year-old girl is never that and should never be called a fast tailed girl. MARTIN: Just for clarity, for people who don't know what you're talking about - 'cause this is before some people's time - Roman Polanski is this very, obviously, famous film director who left the country because he was about to be prosecuted for having sex with a 13-year-old girl. And what you're saying is to this day, there are people who defend him saying that, you know, she was old before her time or, you know, a woman in a girl's body. And you're saying no, no to that. GOFF: Absolutely, no. MARTIN: OK. So, Prachi, what about you, though? You also wrote kind of a response to Rashida Jones. You are not a fan. GUPTA: I am a fan of Rashida Jones, but I would say that I think that female sexuality has traditionally only been seen through the male perspective and sexiness has largely been defined by men. But I think that for women to reclaim our own sexuality, we have to have a full range of choice and - without feeling shame for those choices. And I think it goes back to - I agree with Keli and the distinction of fast tailed girls and that we're not talking about girls right now. We're talking about women. But I do think that putting a judgment on it, saying, stop acting like whores, is saying that they're - we're treating them as lesser people. MARTIN: So you're saying. . . (CROSSTALK)MARTIN: Hold on, let me just get Prachi's point here. So are you arguing that there is no instance in which anybody should criticize a woman for her - the way she presents herself, there is no - that is inherently wrong, inherently misogynistic and - is that what you're saying? Is that what you're arguing? GUPTA: I think that we can have intelligent discussion about sexuality and the way that women present themselves. But I think that the term - the specific term whore has a lot of moral judgment, and Rashida Jones' piece had a lot of moral judgment that went along with it. MARTIN: But what I'm asking you, though, is there - are you saying that there is no instance in which moral judgment should be made? When it comes to adults - let's take kids off the table - when it comes to adults, you don't think there is any instance in which moral judgment should be made? GUPTA: I don't think that - I think it's ultimately a woman's choice to make that decision if she really wants to, and I don't think that that should be - she should be shamed for doing that. GOFF: Michel. . . MARTIN: . . . Keli? Keli, go ahead. GOFF: But this is actually is why I loved Rashida's piece so much is because I thought she made a very nuanced but important point, which is that privately you have the right to be whoever you want to be, to do what you want to do. But when there are cultural, larger societal implications for what you do, that's when we get to judge it. So for me, for instance, one of the reasons I'm critical of - you know, I've written about this and I always get in trouble, of high profile celebrities who becomes basketball wives and baby mamas - is because that sends a message to a young poor girl that it's really easy to be a single mom when it's not. And the same kind of goes for this sexuality argument, which is there's nothing wrong with if you want to, you know, get your groove on in private. But when Miley Cyrus is sending that message publicly, there are 15-year-old girls who aren't learning about contraceptive, who aren't learning about STDs. They're simply saying this is the way to get ahead, and props to Miley. And that's why I love that Rashida called out and said it is dangerous and, FYI, you know what, Michel? Some behavior should be judged. MARTIN: Hold on. GOFF: Shame is actually not a bad thing, you know, for certain behaviors. And so I'm kind of getting sick of the fact that we live in a society where we say there is absolutely - you want to do as many drugs as you want to do, you want to sleep with as many people unprotected as you want - no judgment. No blame. No shame. It's like, some - it's OK to shame behaviors. What I do have a problem with, though, is the double standard. If you're going to call a girl a whore, then why aren't we calling Lil' Wayne a whore? Because I never hear that, and he's like the world's biggest you-know-what. MARTIN: I think some people do. But anyway. . . (CROSSTALK)KENDALL: Can I. . . MARTIN: Mikki. . . KENDALL: Can I just leap in here? MARTIN: Yes, I want to get Mikki back in here. Go ahead. KENDALL: OK, so a couple things because we seem to be conflating a lot of issues into one big muddle. First of all, when a grown woman chooses to have sex and then we say she's a whore, we are absolutely making a negative value judgment that harms women. We are absolutely harming girls for telling them that when they decide to have sex, however they decide to have sex, whether it be public or private, they're a whore. Not to mention, we are harming actual sex workers with that language. Whoreaphobia, is a term that we are - should all be familiar with. And if we're not, we can certainly dig into that. Second of all, when we talk about what young girls are seeing in terms of celebrities, I'm sorry. I'm a parent. I have a a 14-year-old son. My 14-year-old son is being raised by me, not by a music video. So it doesn't matter what the TV is saying. It matters what you're saying at home to your children. . . MARTIN: Are you sure about that? KENDALL: . . . Whether your children are poor or middle-class or whatever. GOFF: But you're a good parent. MARTIN: Wait. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. But if that's the case, then why are we so interested in kind of racial imagery as well? I mean, we're so interested in racial imagery and whether, you know, popular culture, you know, buffoonizes or turns everybody into, you know, kind of a coon show, I mean, if I could use that. KENDALL: Well, with racial imagery. . . MARTIN: Why - why is it OK to call out racial imagery when we think that's stereotypical and leads people to have certain impressions of people, but it's not OK to call out gender imagery, even if it's being perpetuated by people who are of that group, which is the same thing with racial imagery. Don't we say to people like - there are so many. I mean, we just - we don't like the way you're representing the people, right? KENDALL: Well, and. . . MARTIN: That's not OK? KENDALL: . . . You know, that takes us back to a question of, why are we trying to equate race and gender? We're on two separate topics that sometimes intersect but are not the same thing. So when we call out. . . MARTIN: But I am asking you the question. So. . . KENDALL: Yeah, I know. Yeah. MARTIN: Yeah. KENDALL: So what I'm saying is that when we say, well, that image is racist, and we know that racism can actually kill. We know that the racist imagery ties into hate groups and that kind of thing. That's a different conversation from saying that a woman who is having sexual behavior in public, we're not saying - unless we've suddenly decided this - that women being sexy or being sexual leads to murder. It's not the same. It's not the same equation. MARTIN: What about the health question? The healthy question of whether there's sort of healthy behavior that you would hope people would emulate, and there's unhealthy behavior, which you wish they would not. KENDALL: I think that that. . . MARTIN: That doesn't. . . KENDALL: . . . That takes us into making sure we teach our kids how to have safer sex. That makes that - you know, because healthy behavior, well, sex is, you know, complicated, and sometimes it's unhealthy and sometimes it's healthy. But can we really go around policing other people's relationship choices? MARTIN: But can we not talk about it? You're saying there is no instance in which public behavior should be called out or discussed if it speaks to gender. Is that what you're saying? KENDALL: No. I'm saying that we just have somehow turned our focus onto women and what women are doing. We decide that everything women are doing is for the male gaze, whether it's for the male gaze or not, and instead of talking about what men are doing. MARTIN: And, Keli, what about. . . KENDALL: If we're going to talk about what people are - if we're going to talk about gender, then let's talk about it across the board. You know, we have Nelly with the credit card. And we say, oh, Nelly's so bad - wrist slap, wrist slap, wrist slap - but how dare those girls react to him that way at Spelman. MARTIN: OK. KENDALL: Not, hey, you have a problem with women. MARTIN: Now, Keli, how about that? What about. . . GOFF: Well, I totally agree. I mean, that was the point I was trying to make about Lil Wayne. And I 100 percent agree. But I don't think the answer is stop judging everyone. I think it's having a more fair and equitable judgment across the board. And that, to me, is what's missing. I mean, the fact that, like I said, Roman Polanski just won an Oscar. What was it? Three years ago he won an Oscar after raping a girl. And yet, he does not get the same critical analysis that, you know, Miley Cyrus has even gotten. I'm not even saying that to be funny. But if you did the Google searches, you would see that Miley Cyrus got more criticism for her VMA performance than Roman Polanski has gotten in the last few years for raping a girl. That is problematic. It is unfair. It is not right. To me, that doesn't say we stop talking about Miley Cyrus. It says to me, we have to have a bigger, larger, fairer conversation across the board about what these people and images are doing. I mean, Mikki's a great parent. She's an involved parent. My concern is for the kids who don't have that and are being raised by the Miley Cyrus's of the worldMARTIN: Prachi, what about that? GUPTA: I mean, I think I pretty much agree with what Keli's saying. But I do think that those are two separate conversations. One, it is revealing that, for example, we can have a Robin Thicke song where his lyrics are strongly suggesting date rape be just as popular a news story as Miley Cyrus flashing her tongue and gyrating her hips. But I. . . MARTIN: But that was a news story. I mean, that was discussed. That was very much discussed. It was certainly discussed on, you know, Keli's site, on The Daily Beast, and one of the outlets that she writes for. A number of places - there was a lot of discussion on social media about that. And that was part of their argument - part of their argument in defending it. Part of Robin Thicke's argument in defending it, the song and also the video that went with it - is that women should be able to express their sexuality. These are adults. They're doing this freely. What's your problem? So what's your take on that? GUPTA: Well, I think, ultimately, I mean, he was the one singing the song, and his lyrics were very suggestive of date rape. There weren't women in his song saying that. I think that. . . MARTIN: But, I mean, I guess what I'm saying, in terms of double standard, so you're saying that you don't think women should ever be discussed - their sexual kind of expressions should not be judged, but men's sexual expression should be. I mean, let's just - you see what I'm saying? Is that what you're saying? GUPTA: No, that's not what I'm saying. I do think that women's sexuality should be discussed and talked about. I don't think, though, that women should be shamed. I do think that there are double standards when we talk about male sexuality and female sexuality. For example, when we talk about the pornification of pop stars, as Rashida Jones mentioned, in society, male porn stars are considered gods among men. Female porn stars are still shamed. That goes along with that. There's still a stigma. There's still a stigma for women watching porn, for example. MARTIN: Wait, wait, Prachi. Excuse me. This is one of those issues where the facts, I think, do matter, which is that female porn starts earn a very great deal more than male porn stars do. I mean, this is something that Susan Faludi, you know, conclusively demonstrated in her reporting on this matter. So, I mean, is that really true? I mean, can you even name a male porn star? Can you name one? I mean. . . GUPTA: Yeah, I mean, James Deen. . . MARTIN: OK, well. All right. GUPTA: . . . Is a pretty famous one. MARTIN: Well, thank you, but - thank you for that for kind of clarification. OK, we only have about two minutes left, and I'd sort of love to hear from each of you. And, Mikki, where would you like to take this conversation? You kind of - you started this thing with - or you didn't start it. . . KENDALL: I want this conversation. . . MARTIN: . . . Let's say the history started it, but where do you want to take it? KENDALL: I want to take this conversation to a place where healthy sexual expression includes not shaming adult women for their choices or making them responsible for children that have nothing to do with it. MARTIN: Keli, where do you want to take this conversation? GOFF: Shame is an important and powerful tool in society. And I actually don't have a problem with it. What I do have a problem with it is that we're not using it on the right people most of the time. Why the hell is R. Kelly - excuse my language - still a major star? For anyone who saw the videotape of what he did - and I have to throw in an allegedly to keep from getting sued - to those little girls. KENDALL: I can say without an allegedly, R. Kelly hit on me when I was 14 years old, so. GOFF: Oh, OK, great. So no more allegedly then, so - but on that. MARTIN: OK, Prachi, where would you like to take this conversation? GUPTA: I would like to move the conversation to a place where we don't have to frame or prove that women are not inherently sex objects, that women can express themselves without having to start with that assumption to prove or disprove. MARTIN: Keli, you know, what would it look like if the conversation were to be as evenhanded as you would like it to be? What would there be a #FastTailedBoys? GOFF: First of all, half of our members of Congress would not be in office if we treated sexuality as fairly and equal handed - evenhandedly in terms of gender because what male-elected officials and people in the public eye get away with, the women never do, Michel, could fill volumes of books. MARTIN: Mikki, what about you? What would it look like? Should there be a #FastTailedBoys, too? Or what would it look like if the world started moving in the direction you'd like it to be in? What would it look like? KENDALL: We don't call boys fast-tailed. It would be a #BoysWillBeBoys calling out the things we teach young men about how to treat women. MARTIN: Now, Prachi, what about you 'cause you straddle that line between activist and journalist yourself? So what do you think it would look like to advance the conversation in the direction you'd prefer? GUPTA: I agree. I think making conscious decisions about the words that we choose, the connotations that they have and how we talk about women and their sexuality and being more aware about the double standard that exists. I think, ultimately, it would be great to get to a place where, you know, a female pop star is doing something sexually provocative and it's not a shock to us. It's not shocking. It's not something that we have to talk about because when a man does that it's, you know, it's commonplace. We accept it. It's the norm. MARTIN: Prachi Gupta is assistant news editor for Salon. com. Keli Goff is a correspondent TheRoot. com and a columnist for The Daily Beast. They were both with us from New York. Mikki Kendall is a pop-culture critic. She was with us from member station WBEZ in Chicago. Thank you all so much for speaking with us, a spirited conversation. We appreciate it. KENDALL: Thanks, Michel. GUPTA: Thank you. GOFF: Thanks. MARTIN: And that's our program for today. I'm Michel Martin and this is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. Let's talk more tomorrow. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  I'm Michel Martin and this is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. Now we go behind closed doors. Now this is the part of the program where we talk about issues that people usually keep private. Today, though, we want to talk about something that kind of straddles the border between public and private. And that is the increasingly open debate about how the sexuality of girls and women is both being displayed and being discussed. And this is probably a good place to say that you might consider this a sensitive issue because of the subject matter and the language that we plan to use. And this is on our radar in part because \"Parks and Recreation\" actress Rashida Jones recently got social media going with her Twitter takedown of a number of female pop stars for their hypersexual performances. On Twitter, she called on these stars to, in the words of her hashtag, quote, stop acting like whores. And that in turn set off a brouhaha over when, and indeed whether, it's ever OK to call out other women or girls for their sexuality or their perceived sexuality because of their dress or behavior. It turns out that even very young girls have been targeted by comments on the Twitter #FastTailedGirls. We wanted to talk about all this - the controversy on Twitter and beyond - so we've called Mikki Kendall. She helped start the #FastTailedGirls. Mikki, thanks so much for joining us once again. MIKKI KENDALL: Thank you for having me. MARTIN: Also with us is Prachi Gupta of Salon. com. She's written about Rashida Jones' comments and the feminist debate over so-called slut shaming. Prachi, welcome to you. Thank you so much for joining us. PRACHI GUPTA: Thanks for having me. MARTIN: And back with us, Keli Goff, correspondent for TheRoot. com and columnist for The Daily Beast. She often writes about these issues. Keli, welcome back to you. KELI GOFF: Good to be back. MARTIN: So, Mikki, let me start with you because you started the #FastTailedGirls. And why did you start it, and what are some of the striking conversations that you've had through the hashtag? KENDALL: I started the hashtag because I was one of the fast tailed girls. And it didn't really matter what we were doing - if we were hanging around boys, if we were wearing skirts, if we were just tomboys - you got a lot of that growing up. MARTIN: What is a fast-tail girl? KENDALL: And we've had a lot of conversations. . . MARTIN: Can I start with you? What is a fast-tail girl? Maybe everybody hasn't heard that expression. KENDALL: OK. Fast-tailed girl, at least in the African-American community, is often used to refer to a girl who is theoretically sexually promiscuous in some way or may be sexually promiscuous. Girls are called - especially like with the R. Kelly case - girls were called fast. They're supposed to fast-tailed. And what it really means is that they are asking for it. They are seeking sex in an inappropriate way. MARTIN: And what are you trying to accomplish with the hashtag, to sort of - to blow that up or to sort of get people to stop using that expression or what? KENDALL: I wanted to blow up the idea that - we say boys will be boys, but women, young girls and young women, are suddenly supposed to be so demure, so pure. And we send the message that boys can do whatever they want, but girls are dirty if they explore their sexuality. MARTIN: Now, Keli. . . KENDALL: And there's something really intrinsically wrong with that. MARTIN: OK, double standard. KENDALL: Yes. MARTIN: OK. Keli, now you wrote about the fact that - you know, you said that you liked what Rashida Jones had to say. And for people who aren't familiar with what she had to say - I mean, one of the things that you pointed out is that it's actually a fairly nuanced message that she is offering. You're saying - for example, she wrote, you know, she started with her Twitter comment, that got a kind of a response. And then she offered a lengthier explanation in an op-ed in Glamour magazine. And she says that she would never point a finger at a woman for her actual sexual behavior. She thinks that all women have the right to express their desires. She argues this isn't showing female sexuality. This is showing what it looks like when women sell sex. And she argues that her problem is that this is becoming the norm. If you're not - the norm - particularly in pop culture, if you're not showing skin it's almost like you're not even allowed to be there. Keli, take it from there. GOFF: Yeah, it sort of like, a bit, reminded me of the analogy, Michel, of all of those so-called gangster rappers who were talking about, like, living hard and shooting up people and slinging rock. And then it turned out that a lot of them went to prep schools. And that's kind of the argument I felt that she was making here, which is it's one thing if you're saying I'm a sexual being, I own being a sexual being and that's my right. It's another when you're sort of perpetrating this farcical image to the little girls who look up to you simply to make a buck and simply because a man is essentially asking you to do that at a record label. The other thing, though, I want to say - 'cause I think it's a hugely important distinction in this whole conversation - is girls are completely off limits. A child is not someone who can ask for it, who is a sexual being, who is promoting her sexuality. There are women who can say I'm a sexual being who's promoting my sexuality, and I am trying to get attention from a man. But no 13-year-old girl does that. I just want to make sure that that was on the record - that we really are talking about two separate groups because the whole Roman Polanski thing is something I've written about a lot. And it really enrages me that there are still people to this day who say that that girl was very, you know, sexual and promiscuous and flirtatious. No, a 13-year-old doesn't get to be that. There are 27-year-old women who can be that, but a 13-year-old girl is never that and should never be called a fast tailed girl. MARTIN: Just for clarity, for people who don't know what you're talking about - 'cause this is before some people's time - Roman Polanski is this very, obviously, famous film director who left the country because he was about to be prosecuted for having sex with a 13-year-old girl. And what you're saying is to this day, there are people who defend him saying that, you know, she was old before her time or, you know, a woman in a girl's body. And you're saying no, no to that. GOFF: Absolutely, no. MARTIN: OK. So, Prachi, what about you, though? You also wrote kind of a response to Rashida Jones. You are not a fan. GUPTA: I am a fan of Rashida Jones, but I would say that I think that female sexuality has traditionally only been seen through the male perspective and sexiness has largely been defined by men. But I think that for women to reclaim our own sexuality, we have to have a full range of choice and - without feeling shame for those choices. And I think it goes back to - I agree with Keli and the distinction of fast tailed girls and that we're not talking about girls right now. We're talking about women. But I do think that putting a judgment on it, saying, stop acting like whores, is saying that they're - we're treating them as lesser people. MARTIN: So you're saying. . . (CROSSTALK) MARTIN: Hold on, let me just get Prachi's point here. So are you arguing that there is no instance in which anybody should criticize a woman for her - the way she presents herself, there is no - that is inherently wrong, inherently misogynistic and - is that what you're saying? Is that what you're arguing? GUPTA: I think that we can have intelligent discussion about sexuality and the way that women present themselves. But I think that the term - the specific term whore has a lot of moral judgment, and Rashida Jones' piece had a lot of moral judgment that went along with it. MARTIN: But what I'm asking you, though, is there - are you saying that there is no instance in which moral judgment should be made? When it comes to adults - let's take kids off the table - when it comes to adults, you don't think there is any instance in which moral judgment should be made? GUPTA: I don't think that - I think it's ultimately a woman's choice to make that decision if she really wants to, and I don't think that that should be - she should be shamed for doing that. GOFF: Michel. . . MARTIN: . . . Keli? Keli, go ahead. GOFF: But this is actually is why I loved Rashida's piece so much is because I thought she made a very nuanced but important point, which is that privately you have the right to be whoever you want to be, to do what you want to do. But when there are cultural, larger societal implications for what you do, that's when we get to judge it. So for me, for instance, one of the reasons I'm critical of - you know, I've written about this and I always get in trouble, of high profile celebrities who becomes basketball wives and baby mamas - is because that sends a message to a young poor girl that it's really easy to be a single mom when it's not. And the same kind of goes for this sexuality argument, which is there's nothing wrong with if you want to, you know, get your groove on in private. But when Miley Cyrus is sending that message publicly, there are 15-year-old girls who aren't learning about contraceptive, who aren't learning about STDs. They're simply saying this is the way to get ahead, and props to Miley. And that's why I love that Rashida called out and said it is dangerous and, FYI, you know what, Michel? Some behavior should be judged. MARTIN: Hold on. GOFF: Shame is actually not a bad thing, you know, for certain behaviors. And so I'm kind of getting sick of the fact that we live in a society where we say there is absolutely - you want to do as many drugs as you want to do, you want to sleep with as many people unprotected as you want - no judgment. No blame. No shame. It's like, some - it's OK to shame behaviors. What I do have a problem with, though, is the double standard. If you're going to call a girl a whore, then why aren't we calling Lil' Wayne a whore? Because I never hear that, and he's like the world's biggest you-know-what. MARTIN: I think some people do. But anyway. . . (CROSSTALK) KENDALL: Can I. . . MARTIN: Mikki. . . KENDALL: Can I just leap in here? MARTIN: Yes, I want to get Mikki back in here. Go ahead. KENDALL: OK, so a couple things because we seem to be conflating a lot of issues into one big muddle. First of all, when a grown woman chooses to have sex and then we say she's a whore, we are absolutely making a negative value judgment that harms women. We are absolutely harming girls for telling them that when they decide to have sex, however they decide to have sex, whether it be public or private, they're a whore. Not to mention, we are harming actual sex workers with that language. Whoreaphobia, is a term that we are - should all be familiar with. And if we're not, we can certainly dig into that. Second of all, when we talk about what young girls are seeing in terms of celebrities, I'm sorry. I'm a parent. I have a a 14-year-old son. My 14-year-old son is being raised by me, not by a music video. So it doesn't matter what the TV is saying. It matters what you're saying at home to your children. . . MARTIN: Are you sure about that? KENDALL: . . . Whether your children are poor or middle-class or whatever. GOFF: But you're a good parent. MARTIN: Wait. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. But if that's the case, then why are we so interested in kind of racial imagery as well? I mean, we're so interested in racial imagery and whether, you know, popular culture, you know, buffoonizes or turns everybody into, you know, kind of a coon show, I mean, if I could use that. KENDALL: Well, with racial imagery. . . MARTIN: Why - why is it OK to call out racial imagery when we think that's stereotypical and leads people to have certain impressions of people, but it's not OK to call out gender imagery, even if it's being perpetuated by people who are of that group, which is the same thing with racial imagery. Don't we say to people like - there are so many. I mean, we just - we don't like the way you're representing the people, right? KENDALL: Well, and. . . MARTIN: That's not OK? KENDALL: . . . You know, that takes us back to a question of, why are we trying to equate race and gender? We're on two separate topics that sometimes intersect but are not the same thing. So when we call out. . . MARTIN: But I am asking you the question. So. . . KENDALL: Yeah, I know. Yeah. MARTIN: Yeah. KENDALL: So what I'm saying is that when we say, well, that image is racist, and we know that racism can actually kill. We know that the racist imagery ties into hate groups and that kind of thing. That's a different conversation from saying that a woman who is having sexual behavior in public, we're not saying - unless we've suddenly decided this - that women being sexy or being sexual leads to murder. It's not the same. It's not the same equation. MARTIN: What about the health question? The healthy question of whether there's sort of healthy behavior that you would hope people would emulate, and there's unhealthy behavior, which you wish they would not. KENDALL: I think that that. . . MARTIN: That doesn't. . . KENDALL: . . . That takes us into making sure we teach our kids how to have safer sex. That makes that - you know, because healthy behavior, well, sex is, you know, complicated, and sometimes it's unhealthy and sometimes it's healthy. But can we really go around policing other people's relationship choices? MARTIN: But can we not talk about it? You're saying there is no instance in which public behavior should be called out or discussed if it speaks to gender. Is that what you're saying? KENDALL: No. I'm saying that we just have somehow turned our focus onto women and what women are doing. We decide that everything women are doing is for the male gaze, whether it's for the male gaze or not, and instead of talking about what men are doing. MARTIN: And, Keli, what about. . . KENDALL: If we're going to talk about what people are - if we're going to talk about gender, then let's talk about it across the board. You know, we have Nelly with the credit card. And we say, oh, Nelly's so bad - wrist slap, wrist slap, wrist slap - but how dare those girls react to him that way at Spelman. MARTIN: OK. KENDALL: Not, hey, you have a problem with women. MARTIN: Now, Keli, how about that? What about. . . GOFF: Well, I totally agree. I mean, that was the point I was trying to make about Lil Wayne. And I 100 percent agree. But I don't think the answer is stop judging everyone. I think it's having a more fair and equitable judgment across the board. And that, to me, is what's missing. I mean, the fact that, like I said, Roman Polanski just won an Oscar. What was it? Three years ago he won an Oscar after raping a girl. And yet, he does not get the same critical analysis that, you know, Miley Cyrus has even gotten. I'm not even saying that to be funny. But if you did the Google searches, you would see that Miley Cyrus got more criticism for her VMA performance than Roman Polanski has gotten in the last few years for raping a girl. That is problematic. It is unfair. It is not right. To me, that doesn't say we stop talking about Miley Cyrus. It says to me, we have to have a bigger, larger, fairer conversation across the board about what these people and images are doing. I mean, Mikki's a great parent. She's an involved parent. My concern is for the kids who don't have that and are being raised by the Miley Cyrus's of the world MARTIN: Prachi, what about that? GUPTA: I mean, I think I pretty much agree with what Keli's saying. But I do think that those are two separate conversations. One, it is revealing that, for example, we can have a Robin Thicke song where his lyrics are strongly suggesting date rape be just as popular a news story as Miley Cyrus flashing her tongue and gyrating her hips.

Part of Robin Thicke's argument in defending it, the song and also the video that went with it - is that women should be able to express their sexuality. These are adults. They're doing this freely. What's your problem? So what's your take on that? GUPTA: Well, I think, ultimately, I mean, he was the one singing the song, and his lyrics were very suggestive of date rape. There weren't women in his song saying that. I think that. . . MARTIN: But, I mean, I guess what I'm saying, in terms of double standard, so you're saying that you don't think women should ever be discussed - their sexual kind of expressions should not be judged, but men's sexual expression should be.

It began with the number five. Why five? Well, it turns out that only five percent of America's scientists and engineers are African-American - that according to a study by the National Science Foundation. We wondered why that is and whether that matters and what might fix it so we decided to reach out to a few of the five percent, including educators, and entrepreneurs and social media types. We did this on Twitter using the #NPRBlacksinTech. And what started as kind of a simple question became a community that spanned the country. And a very diverse and committed group of people agreed to share their thoughts with us and their lives with us. They tweeted us throughout the day for a series we call \"A Day in the Life. \" Now that series ends today but the foundation for future involvement has been built. The participants have been networking with each other, sharing stories and working together to recruit the next generation of African Americans into tech fields. So to tie a bow on this series for now, we've decided to call on three people who were involved in this series just to review what we learned and what we should be thinking about next. Here in our studios in Washington D. C. , seventh grader Miles Peterson of Howard University Middle School of Mathematics and Science. With us from Portland, Oregon, entrepreneur Deena Pierott of iUrban Teen Tech. And we hope we'll have with, us joining us at some point from Newark, New Jersey, the physicist and research professor, Reginald Farrow. So welcome to everybody. Thank you so much for joining us. MILES PETERSON: Thank you for having me. DEENA PIEROTT: Yeah, thank you for having me. MARTIN: All right, so Deena let me start with you. We've been asking people throughout the series, you know, why this number? This five percent number, and you know, why they think that is and why does it matter? So I wanted to ask you that question. PIEROTT: Well, it does matter and I feel that we can do a whole lot better for one thing. I feel that for me, one of the reasons why I created the program that I have, was to expose more use of color - primarily African-American, Latino males, into STEM-related careers.  A lot of times, they're just not exposed to the opportunities. Their parents weren't exposed to the opportunities. And so to me, it's all about exposure and to show them that everything around us has a science and technology base to it. So for me, it's exposure. MARTIN: Miles, what do you have to say about that? You clearly are exposed to these issues at the Howard University Middle School of Mathematics and Science, but what do you think about that? Why do you think to this point - and I don't want to emphasize the negative, I just want to be clear on that, but why do you think to this point we haven't seen people of color in these fields? PETERSON: I don't think that - they're not putting it out there that there are jobs in there. We're not getting enough opportunities. They're not teaching us about it. So we really don't know about it. Yes, we use an iPhone and a Galaxy every single day, but we don't know how that works, and I think that how something works is very intriguing to us. And we just need to be exposed like Ms. Pierott was saying. MARTIN: Pierott was saying. Now Deena, additionally Danielle Lee, who's a biologist and she's taught at the university level, mentioned in a Google+ Hangout, the need to recognize that there still isn't the kind mentoring and networking that other groups get. And I just want to play that clip from our conversation with her. Thanks. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVAL RECORDING)DANIELLE LEE: Recognizing so much that politics do play a part, even at the undergraduate level, who gets an opportunity to intern, who gets to work in a lab and how that translates into career opportunities in science and engineering, particularly at the graduate level and above. And so helping my colleagues to comprehend some of the unintentional bias that they perpetuate and how they interact with students in the classroom at the undergraduate level is important. MARTIN: Deena, what about that? Has that been your - what's your take on it? PIEROTT: Oh, that is so true. That is so true. And the other thing too, is recognizing and understanding those unconscious biases that they instill on our youth. And our youth can see that, but it's so, so, so very key to one, have them understand it, but it's also very key to have our professionals of color - our engineers, our technologists, have them understand the importance for them to reach back and mentor and open that pathway, you know, for our younger generation. MARTIN: If you're just joining us, I'm Michel Martin of NPR's TELL ME MORE. We're wrapping up our series that we've been running throughout December. We've been having, kind of, two conversations - one on Twitter and one on the air with the #NPRBlacksinTech. We talked a lot about education on this program, and something that came up a lot during this series was the need to kind of bring more people along to, kind of, create more of a pipeline. And one thing we saw over and over again in tweets from participants was the need to get people excited, not just about consuming tech, but about making tech. Miles, so this is a perfect place to come to you. You're in seventh grade and you take classes about creating apps and things like that. What are some of the things that keep you interested? PETERSON: I think, actually, trying stuff on. Like, if you go into the Apple Store and you try the new 5S or you try the Galaxy Gear, recently, actually Wednesday, people came to our school and we got to try on the Google Glass, and that was very, very cool. So I mean, being able to try it on and then, like I said again, how it works and then that makes you not want to become a consumer, but make more. And you come up with ideas, how to make it better and you work with other people, software developers, to find out how to put your idea to work. MARTIN: But, you know, but to that point, though, I mean, one of the interesting facts that has emerged, I mean, is that African-Americans and Latinos are already - I'm going to use a social science word here - over-indexed, which means that they're more likely to use social media things like Twitter and Facebook than other groups are. So they're already, kind of, already very excited about using the technology, but to this point it isn't translating and to people being part of a push to make the technology. You know what I mean, Miles? So what do you think bridges that gap? Is it having the chance to get your hands on it? What do you think? PETERSON: I think it definitely has to do with getting your hands on it, but finding out how it works - a gif went out and it showed how a key works, and everybody was fascinated to see how the key goes in the lock and the key turns. So find out how it works. And then, like you said, over-indexed, it's more blacks and Latinos - have more - the study show that blacks and Latinos have more smartphones and use more technology than other people. So already having it and using it, we just have to find out a way to show us how it works and how we can make it even better. MARTIN: Well, we're happy to have with us now from Newark, New Jersey, physicist and research professor, Reginald Farrow. Welcome to you. Thank you so much for joining us. REGINALD FARROW: Well, thank you very much for having me. MARTIN: So sometimes the technology doesn't serve us as well as we would like but then, you know - but then sometimes it does. So, Reginald, welcome. Thanks so much for joining us. We've been talking about how to bridge some of the gaps that we have talked about a lot over the series. What is it that would bridge the gap from having people of color, particularly African-Americans and Latino's move from just being consumers of technology to creators and producers of technology? What are your thoughts about this? FARROW: Well, actually I have a lot of thoughts and, you know, I think that what you're doing here is you're creating a community, and I think that's very important. A community of people who are, you know, trying to pursue technology and trying to pursue careers in technology. And I'm particularly heartened that, you know, you have someone from middle school who's already excited about this, because it's a real challenge with the way funding for education is, you know, being reduced right now. MARTIN: We had talked earlier with Deena about - Deena Pierott, who's of iUrban Teen Tech, and we were talking a lot about, just kind of, some of the informal mentoring, you know, relationships that people have or even, kind of, classroom dynamics that sometimes are invisible to the people having them, but sometimes work to exclude people in ways that they might not even be aware of. Do you feel that that's true?  Is there something there that we should talk about? FARROW: Yeah. I think what you're talking - what you're really saying is that even if it's unintentional that there is a pathway to get forward. And if you're part of a particular culture, you know, they tend to bring their own culture along with them. But we can do the same thing. And this is something that, you know, is done every day in institutions like mine at NJIT, which has a very diverse population of students. But you're definitely right. I think, if I look back at all of the - all of the advances that I was able to make, all the times I was able to make a positive move forward, there was generally somebody there who was, you know, really made that happen, and just by, you know, saying a few words or making a phone call or even, you know, in one case, you know, taking an application and walking it to a person and putting it on their desk - this is the type of thing that goes on for, not just me, for everybody. And I think, you know, people know that, that they just don't talk about it so much. And it's not necessarily an exclusionary type of activity. It is inclusive but, you know, if you're not part of a network, then I think you need to become part of a network such that you can take advantage of this type of mentoring. MARTIN: Deena, can we talk a little bit more with you about this? Deena Pierott of iUrban Teen Tech.  You know, there's even this phrase now, black Twitter that comes from the fact that African-Americans use social media and mobile devices more than any other group, 28 percent of online African-Americans use Twitter, compared to 12 percent for whites and 14 percent of Hispanics. Although, and that's interesting, 'cause as I understand, the Latinos are over-indexed on the use of Facebook compared to other groups. So, again, this idea of transitioning from just being a user of the technology, clearly there's a fascination with using it, to being a consumer and producer. What other thoughts do you have about that? PIEROTT: Well, you know, I feel that we can use this medium. We can use this medium for the good. Not saying that it's not being used for the good already. You know, when people are building relationships and meeting people, you know, online, but such as the series that you had that I participated in. That was such heavy and fantastic networking and collaborative, you know, process that occurred during that time that we were online. You know, we were working out issues where we're talking about collaborations, you know, for bringing more youth into STEM. So I like to use social media - Twitter - for that reason. Not just to say how my day is going, but I like to use it to reach out and say how can we create this community that we talk about, you know, and thrive for different outcomes. But I want to just kind of reiterate on the mentoring piece for you. One of the things that we tell our folks that are involved in our program - we have several technologists involved on our board and on our ISAAC counsel. It's one thing to be a mentor, 'cause we do need to mentor these youths, but at some point, you need to transition that over to sponsoring them as well. MARTIN: And what's the difference? What's the difference between sponsoring and mentoring? PIEROTT: Mentoring is helping to groove, not - mentoring is helping to shape, sharing information, guiding them along the way, supporting them. Sponsoring is, just like how he mentioned, making that phone call. I know somebody that'd be great for this. Handing someone an application that trusts you. That's the difference between the sponsoring and the mentoring. MARTIN: Really actually more proactive. Being more proactive, actually jumping in. Miles, speaking of jumping in, he wanted to say something. PETERSON: Oh I was going to say that I believe that being - wanting to create a software, it comes from passion. Something that you're passionate about. The guy who came for Google Glass day, he said he was passionate about fitness so he created an app called Linksfit to help fitness. So you're looking and you're doing squats. You're looking through the glass and you're doing squats. So I think wanting to create something comes from passion. So if I love music, I create something that helps further music, but then it's groundbreaking. It's something totally new in the industry. It all comes from what you're passionate for and then a great idea. MARTIN: Has anybody ever, Miles, at this point, kind of - you've had some positive experience just, kind of, making you feel that you can do this and that you do have the tools - is there something you would tell grown-ups, adults in your life, to avoid doing that think is kind of a turnoff for kids that they may not really understand is? PETERSON: I think that some grown-ups still put in your head that you're - 'cause you're African-American, your chances are low and I do think that helps. And if you read any books - \"Autobiography of Malcolm X\" - all kinds of books that kind of puts that in your head that who you are and the color of your skin kind of changes your chances. So that does help and that makes you want to work harder, but for some people it kind of discourages them, that I can't do it because of who I am. But I think it kind of helps to say that, OK, I understand that I'm going to have to work 10 times harder than the next person so I can do better. MARTIN: But lose the negativity, is what you're saying? PETERSON: Yes. MARTIN: I appreciate that. I appreciate your insights here, so thanks. Reginald, what about you? What are some important insights going forward? We only have a couple of minutes left and we are glad you were able to join us. So some of the important things we can do to get young people, particularly African-Americans, but not just, involved in science and technology - science, technology, engineering and math, the STEM fields. FARROW: Well, you know, in just a few seconds I, you know, I'm hearing what. . . MARTIN: Miles. FARROW: . . . The student is saying about the passion that's needed in order to be creative. And I think I'm going to go back to creating a community, but also something which people don't talk about a lot is when we talk about diversity, there's a diversity in knowledge that we need. And I think if we don't necessarily try to, you know, channel people so easily or so forcefully into a specific set of topics - if people just have a general thirst for knowledge and also like technology, then I think they will do well. And so, you know, mixing in art and music with science is important. And it's kind of my pet thing because I'm finding that the students that get to me at the college level are the most creative when they are diverse. You know, when they play music, when they do art, when they're involved in politics, when they're involved in a lot of different things, they tend to be creative. And it also means that the tools that they're trying - as he was saying - trying to create have a purpose that, you know, connects with humanity. And I think that's very, very important. MARTIN: Let me give Deena the final word. Deena, you have a final thought from you if we can? PIEROTT: Oh God. I'm just listening to him and smiling because they are so spot on. I think engaging them and letting them help co-create, you know, help them co-create the journey. You know, and letting them show us what they're passionate about, what they're interested in. I think that's part of the key thing too. In the arts you have to interweave the arts in. Creativity drives innovation. MARTIN: In Portland, Oregon, entrepreneur, Deena Pierott of iUrban Teen tech. With us from Newark, New Jersey, physicist Reginald Farrow and here in our studios in Washington D. C. seventh grader Miles Peterson of Howard University Middle School of Mathematics and Science. Listen to that  name, you'll be hearing that name again, I guarantee it. In fact, I'm going to be really nice to him 'cause I think we'll working for him someday. Thank you all so much for joining us and happy holidays to you all. PETERSON: Thank you. Happy holidays. FARROW: Thank you for having me. PIEROTT: Happy holidays to you too.

You know, when they play music, when they do art, when they're involved in politics, when they're involved in a lot of different things, they tend to be creative. And it also means that the tools that they're trying - as he was saying - trying to create have a purpose that, you know, connects with humanity. And I think that's very, very important. MARTIN: Let me give Deena the final word. Deena, you have a final thought from you if we can? PIEROTT: Oh God. I'm just listening to him and smiling because they are so spot on. I think engaging them and letting them help co-create, you know, help them co-create the journey. You know, and letting them show us what they're passionate about, what they're interested in. I think that's part of the key thing too. In the arts you have to interweave the arts in. Creativity drives innovation. MARTIN: In Portland, Oregon, entrepreneur, Deena Pierott of iUrban Teen tech. With us from Newark, New Jersey, physicist Reginald Farrow and here in our studios in Washington D. C. seventh grader Miles Peterson of Howard University Middle School of Mathematics and Science. Listen to that  name, you'll be hearing that name again, I guarantee it. In fact, I'm going to be really nice to him 'cause I think we'll working for him someday.

He joins us from the BBC in London. Mr. Karaian, thanks so much for being with us. JASON KARAIAN: Thanks for having me. SIMON: We heard the theme music to a game I believe is called \"Economia. \"KARAIAN: That's right. SIMON: What's that game like? KARAIAN: Sure. Well, this I think is actually the most sophisticated one. It's by the ECB, the European Central Bank. It's basically to teach you about you are the president of a central bank, you need to look at how growth is going, how unemployment is going and adjust interest rates accordingly. And so this game really tries to teach you how you do that and what it's like to be Mario Draghi, who's the current president of the ECB. SIMON: What about a game called \"Inflation Island\"? KARAIAN: \"Inflation Island\" is perhaps at the other spectrum. It's like one of these open worlds. Like you mentioned \"Grand Theft Auto\" before - there's a lot less violence in this. But you are on this island. You can set a dial of inflation anywhere from stable prices to deflation to high inflation. And then you just kind of wander around and talk to the islanders about how their lives are, given the movement in prices. SIMON: Whatever the achievements of American technology at every level, is there a central bank game gap between the U. S. and other nations? KARAIAN: The Federal Reserve in the U.

I'm Arun Rath. Now to the world of pinball. Okay, it's not a very big world. In fact, today, there's really only one company that still makes pinball tables. But one man is trying to smash the pinball monopoly. NPR's Francesca Fenzi has the story. FRANCESCA FENZI, BYLINE: Meet Jack Guarnieri. He runs an unusual business. JACK GUARNIERI: We have a company that builds pinball machines in New Jersey, and it's called Jersey Jack Pinball. FENZI: Jersey Jack is the first pinball manufacturer to emerge in almost 30 years. For the past decade, if you wanted to own one of the tabletop arcade games, you had to buy it from one company, Stern Pinball. GUARNIERI: You know, it would be a boring world, I guess, if there was only one company making shoes or handbags or anything. So I think more competition and more product in the marketplace raises the awareness of pinball. FENZI: Something else to know about pinball: between 1955 and 1970, the games made more money than the entire American movie industry. They were big bucks. And 30 years ago, there were nearly a dozen pinball makers in the U. S. Now, there's only Stern. Tim Arnold owns the Pinball Hall of Fame in Las Vegas, and he explains that Jersey Jack's real challenge won't be breaking Stern's monopoly, but squeezing into the market at all. TIM ARNOLD: Back in the day, they used to sell five to 10,000 of each pinball machine. Now they're lucky if they hit a 1,000 to 1,500. So it's exactly like the movies. If you get a hit movie, everything's great. But if you have one or two dud movies in a row, you're in deep trouble financially. FENZI: According to Arnold, Jersey Jack needs to do two things to succeed: Create an incredible product and bring it to the masses. In other words, Jersey Jack needs a magic slingshot or maybe just a wizard. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WE'RE OFF TO SEE THE WIZARD\")JUDY GARLAND: (Singing) We're off to see the Wizard, the wonderful Wizard of Oz. FENZI: The company's debut game, based on \"The Wizard of Oz\" movie, certainly qualifies as incredible. Arnold compares it to going from black and white to color TV. (SOUNDBITE OF MOVIE, \"THE WIZARD OF OZ\")GARLAND: (as Dorothy) Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore. FENZI: It has a multicolor LED screen that plays animations and movie clips during the game, plus special flipper settings and lights that transform the board according to each new mission. ARNOLD: If you're going for the Emerald City, all the lights turn green. If you're battling flying monkeys, it all turns red. It's really a spectacular visual presentation. FENZI: There's only one problem - the \"Wizard of Oz\" is hard to find. Even two years after its initial release, you're not likely to see the game in a local arcade. Many of the units have gone to homes of private collectors. Molly Atkinson is one of the few who has played it. And she had to go to a collector's home to do so. That's because she's a collector herself. She runs a public access arcade called Pins and Needles in Los Angeles. MOLLY ATKINSON: It's a real fancy game, Wizard of Oz. It has a lot of neat features on it. And, I don't know, for some reason, it's really grown on me. FENZI: But Atkinson doubts it will join her collection anytime soon. The machine cost about $8,000. She only charges 25 cents per play. But even if she charged double, it would take 16,000 games for her to recoup that cost. ATKINSON: No new games are affordable. When it was a public plaything, games never cost this much. And then the arcade thing kind of died out, and there was only the one manufacturer remaining. So they were kind of controlling all the costs, and they went up and up and up. So we finally do have someone else who's entered the market, but their games are maybe even more expensive. So it's just very unattainable for someone like me to get one. FENZI: Still, Atkinson says the arrival of a new game maker is a good thing. She hopes that competition between the two companies will generate more exciting games and breathe fresh life into the industry. For Jack Guarnieri, renewed excitement in pinball is the whole point. That's really what you want to hear. That's success. He plans to release Jersey Jack's second game, \"The Hobbit,\" this spring and says that a third machine with an all-original design and story is already in production. Stern didn't respond to press inquiries for this story, but a banner on the company's website declares it the only maker of real pinball games on the planet. Guarnieri says they probably just haven't updated the site yet. Francesca Fenzi, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"PINBALL WIZARD\")THE WHO: (Singing) Ever since I was a young boy I played the silver ball. From SoHo down to Brighton I must have played them all.

We're going to hear about one of the most successful networks on YouTube. Machinima is aimed at people who play videogames. Its backers want it to be a new media empire and it already gets about two and a half billion views a month. Most of those viewers are young men. But NPR's Neda Ulaby says Machinima is pushing for an even larger audience. And they're doing it as more and more people are watching video on their phones, and the likes of ChromeCast or Xbox. NEDA ULABY, BYLINE: Let's start just with that word Machinima, coined by a Scottish fan of video games and movies. SANJAY SHARMA: Which was machine and cinema portmanteau'd together. (SOUNDBITE OF A VIDEOGAME)ULABY: Back in the late 1990s, Hugh Hancock was part of a group of hardcore gamers who commandeered their game software to make their own animated movies. So, suddenly a big muscley fighter character could the star of a story a gamer made up. (SOUNDBITE OF A VIDEOGAME)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Try it. HUGH HANCOCK: The early ones were made inside games like \"Quake\" and \"Doom. \"ULABY: Sanjay Sharma would have an important role in Machinima's future. SHARMA: The notion that: Wait a second, this is a videogame and these characters are inside of a videogame but they're being manipulated and puppeteered and voice over-ed to enact an entirely new story. ULABY: A story that could stand on its own. Hugh Hancock, the Scottish guy, started a website for Machinima's fan community. But soon he was overwhelmed by submissions and hundreds of thousands of views. So he sold Machinima. com to a couple of Hollywood entrepreneurs. They hired Sanjay Sharma. SHARMA: We were not unlike a lot of startups in kind of, you know, trying to find our way. ULABY: Right at the beginning, Sharma says the company decided to do something that felt risky. SHARMA: We made a bet on YouTube. And the bet was this was the platform that is going to win the lion's share of video viewing. ULABY: Now that seems obvious, but back in 2006 nobody knew what YouTube was going to be. Machinima pioneered a YouTube channel back when that was a novelty. (SOUNDBITE OF A VIDEOGAME)ULABY: The company gathered hundreds of mostly young men to make amateur animated movies about, for example, giant aliens facing down two futuristic cops in gas masks. (SOUNDBITE OF A VIDEOGAME)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Hey, I dare you to shoot it. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: No, I'm not going to shoot it. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Chicken. ULABY: That's from a science fiction comedy series created by Ross Scott. Starting five years ago, he says he made about 60 videos for Machinima. But he says he never intends to work with them ever again. ROSS SCOTT: My personal experience is that it's been unethical and predatory. ULABY: Scott ended up in a lawsuit. He settled, so he can't really talk about details. But plenty of other people started complaining about Machinima; about how much it tried to control copyrights and paid less and less while scooping up more and more advertising and investors, including Google. Now, scaling up is a struggle for all kinds of online media companies. When Machinima hired Neneah Reeves as chief operating officer, she set to work to address its reputation. NENEAH REEVES: I think it's one of the things I'm most proud of is how we have turned the corner on providing better support and more opportunity for our partners. ULABY: A lot of what they're posting on Machinima these days are videos of themselves playing video games. (SOUNDBITE OF A VIDEOGAME)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: OK. You go down and you go hit the ground. ULABY: This British kid, who calls himself the Syndicate, has made enough money from his how-to videos on Machinima to buy his mom a house, says Neneah Reeves. REEVES: Some of these kids make a lot of money. There are many who make over a thousand dollars a month. ULABY: But Machinima, like a lot of YouTube channels, is getting slicker. It's partnering with major studios to make the videos it's putting online. Videos it hopes will attract the same nerdily inclined audience who watch some of TV's most popular shows, \"The Big Bang Theory,\" \"Game of Thrones,\" \"The Walking Dead. \"(SOUNDBITE OF A VIDEOGAME)ULABY: So Machinima developed its own \"The Walking Dead\" series online with AMC. Jay Sampson runs Machinima's advertising. He says the ambition is to be something bigger than a cable channel. JAY SAMPSON: We want to be on a billion devices. ULABY: Your phone, your game player, maybe even your TV. But even as Machinima expands into science fiction and sports and comedy and professionally-made content, it needs to hang on to that homegrown fan feel it started with. Sampson says all those homemade videos communicate a sense of authenticity; perhaps most importantly, to marketers. SAMPSON: Marketers are always searching for quote-unquote, \"the lost boys,\" right? So males, you know, 13 to 34, 18 to 24, hard to find in a lot of different medias. ULABY: But even though Machinima is the top video network for young men and one of the biggest successes on YouTube, it's still struggling with what comes next. Just this year alone, the company has gone through two rounds of layoffs. And the entrepreneurs who first bought Machinima are stepping down from their current jobs. For Machinima to be the new media empire they dreamed of, they say it needs more professional management. Neda Ulaby, NPR News.

REEVES: Some of these kids make a lot of money. There are many who make over a thousand dollars a month. ULABY: But Machinima, like a lot of YouTube channels, is getting slicker. It's partnering with major studios to make the videos it's putting online. Videos it hopes will attract the same nerdily inclined audience who watch some of TV's most popular shows, \"The Big Bang Theory,\" \"Game of Thrones,\" \"The Walking Dead. \" (SOUNDBITE OF A VIDEOGAME) ULABY: So Machinima developed its own \"The Walking Dead\" series online with AMC. Jay Sampson runs Machinima's advertising. He says the ambition is to be something bigger than a cable channel. JAY SAMPSON: We want to be on a billion devices. ULABY: Your phone, your game player, maybe even your TV. But even as Machinima expands into science fiction and sports and comedy and professionally-made content, it needs to hang on to that homegrown fan feel it started with. Sampson says all those homemade videos communicate a sense of authenticity; perhaps most importantly, to marketers. SAMPSON: Marketers are always searching for quote-unquote, \"the lost boys,\" right? So males, you know, 13 to 34, 18 to 24, hard to find in a lot of different medias. ULABY: But even though Machinima is the top video network for young men and one of the biggest successes on YouTube, it's still struggling with what comes next. Just this year alone, the company has gone through two rounds of layoffs. And the entrepreneurs who first bought Machinima are stepping down from their current jobs. For Machinima to be the new media empire they dreamed of, they say it needs more professional management. Neda Ulaby, NPR News.", "section": "Technology", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2013 NPR.

Target made three to four percent fewer transactions over the past weekend than it did at this time last year. That's according to the research firm Customer Growth Partners. The drop in business follows last week's revelation that hackers stole 40 million credit and debit card numbers from Target. Well, if your credit card is among those 40 million, what should you do about it? We're joined now by Mark Rasch, who is a security expert and former Department of Justice Cyber Crime prosecutor, to answer that question. Welcome to the program. MARK RASCH: Thank you. SIEGEL: And tell us, if someone shopped at Target during the days in question - that's between November 27 and December 15th, and we should say this applies to in-store shoppers, not online purchasers - the first step would seem to be obvious, check your bank statement, but what do you do after that? RASCH: Well, not just your bank statement, but also your credit card statement and your bank balance, particularly if you used a debit card. The next thing you should do is you should call the 800 number that Target has set up to find out whether they consider you to be a victim. And then, you have to be vigilant because if your card number was stolen last week or two weeks ago, it doesn't mean that the bad guys are going to use them this week or next week. They can wait weeks or months or sometimes even years before they actually turn them into cash and start using them. If you're really worried, of course, one of the things you can do is just call your bank and have them issue you a new credit card. SIEGEL: Well, should people do that since, as you say, you can't prove a negative. Just 'cause no one's used your number doesn't mean they're not going to pretty soon. RASCH: It's probably overkill and inconvenient to do that if your number has not been compromised, but if Target says that your number was actually compromised, then it's probably a good idea to get your credit card number changed. But remember now, all those things that are linked to your credit card, all the automatic payments and your PayPal account and all that that's linked to your credit card are all going to have to be updated and changed as well. SIEGEL: Well, when somebody steals your credit card information, does that mean that all of those other things that you're connected to are open to the hacker as well? RASCH: No. If they've stolen your credit card number, it just means that they can start making charges just like they had stolen your credit card itself. It doesn't mean they have access to your PayPal account or to your Amazon account, it just means that they can now start and open their own PayPal and Amazon account in your name. SIEGEL: There are now reports that stolen credit card information is flooding the black market. Is there a second wave of concern for consumers coming? RASCH: Sure. What's happening now is once having stolen the credit card numbers, now I want to make money off of that. So what these carders do, and they're called carders, people who make fake credit cards or use stolen credit card numbers, what they do is they sell them on the black market through these carder websites. A lot of them are in Russia and Eastern Europe. And they can sell them by bank, they can sell them by location, they can sell them by expiration date or credit limit and so there is a whole market out there to sell them for $100, $200 per card. SIEGEL: Now, just in terms of security and protecting oneself, when you're given that choice, is this credit or debit, is one especially more safe or less safe than the other? RASCH: Well, the problem with a debit card is, if somebody takes money out of your bank account, it may take three, four, five, six days to get that money back into the account. And during that period of time, it's very difficult for you to draw on the funds that you think are still in your bank. In either case, your actual liability is zero. You're going to get the money back. It's just more inconvenient when there's a debit card. SIEGEL: Is there any reason to avoid Target to be more safe? RASCH: Not particularly. You know, first of all, I would estimate that in the next couple of weeks, Target's going to be probably one of the safest places to buy things because they're going to be doing everything they can to get the customer's confidence back. But any large merchant is going to be a target, pardon the pun, of hackers 'cause there's lots of credit card numbers there, and the smaller merchants are targets because they have less robust security. So these are all costs of doing business with the modern credit card. SIEGEL: Mark Rasch's field is security. He's a former Department of Justice cybercrime prosecutor. Thanks for talking with us.

I'm Robert Siegel and it's time now for All Tech Considered. (SOUNDBITE OF THEME MUSIC)SIEGEL: Today, we check in on the evolution of television in the online era. Video is a highly fragmented business these days. Amazon, iTunes, YouTube, Hulu, there are plenty of Internet venues where you can find TV show and movies to watch. And every company in the business wants to be your one source. Well, for consumers, the question is how to get those sources of content onto your big screen in the living room as easily as you do your cable or broadcast TV. That is a bit more complicated and a bit more frustrating. Farhad Manjoo is a technology columnist for The Wall Street Journal. He joins us now. Welcome to the program, Farhad. FARHAD MANJOO: Hi, good to be here. SIEGEL: And there are a lot different devices on the market to bring Internet video onto your television. You find this market still very frustrating? MANJOO: Yeah, I mean, there's sort of a best of both worlds. It's never been easier to get stuff on your TV but it's ever been more complicated to figure out which is the best way for a certain show you want to watch. So there's lots of different devices but, depending on which one you buy, you'll be able to get some kind of content and not other kinds of content. SIEGEL: Well, what's your rule of thumb for picking a device, if you have one? MANJOO: You're running Apple content, stuff from the iTunes store, then you most likely want an Apple TV device to sync with your iPad other Apple stuff - that's $100 device. Google is very cheap, $35 Chromecast is pretty good 'cause it gets you Netflix and YouTube, and then it kind of goes out from there. You know, Microsoft's new gaming system, the Xbox One, does a whole lot of things but it's, you know, in the $500 price range, so it's very expensive. And there's very many other kinds of smaller devices that help in this market, too. SIEGEL: I gather this doesn't seem like a radical idea that the higher end flat screen TVs actually have this function built into them these days. MANJOO: Yeah, I mean, depending on what television you have - I mean I have one that's, you know, four years old and he gets Netflix on it. So you don't even have to have a very new TV and you might not need any of these devices. SIEGEL: Farhad, what's the point of this whole business? Is it to get a cheap device in your hands so that you can then rack up a bill purchasing content? Or is it to make money off the devices? How does this work? MANJOO: Yeah, I mean, the different companies have different sort of strategies here. So Microsoft, for example, has this new Xbox that's a gaming device and it's also a home entertainment device. And they really kind of want to be the control of your living room. And they see this as the, you know, the next major part of their business. Other companies have smaller aims. You know, Google has this Chromecast device. And I think what they really want you to do is kind of plug into the Google universe. They get more info on you. They might at some point serve advertising to you on this device. Apple's Apple TV, they don't make very much money from it, but it really is a good way to get you to kind of plug into the Apple universe. And then, you know, you might buy more iPhones and iPads. And that's really where they make their money from. SIEGEL: Well, you've described a variety of choices. And you're right, it is frustrating. This hasn't simplified matters very much. (LAUGHTER)MANJOO: Yeah, I mean, I think we're going to be in this space where it's going to be complicated for a few years. You know, what would really be great in the living room is to have one device get you access to all the services. But no company has incentive to do that. They all want to be the one in control. So I think that's going to kind of be the point of pain for consumers for while. SIEGEL: That's Farhad Manjoo, technology columnist for The Wall Street Journal. Thanks for talking with us.

More than 80,000 residents of New York City's Harlem neighborhood may get free public Wi-Fi service by the middle of 2014. The project will extend for 95 blocks. That'll make it the largest, continuous, free, outdoor, public wireless network in the nation, if it succeeds. Some of that Wi-Fi will be delivered by digital vans. The vehicles will park at different locations during the week so residents who don't have Internet access at home can get online. Joining us today from our New York bureau is Dupe Ajayi who's the digital communications manager at New York City Housing Authority. And she was also recently a part of our NPR Blacks in Tech series. Dupe, thank you so much for joining us. DUPE AJAYI: Thank you for having me. HEADLEE: So this is expected to provide digital access for 13,000 public housing residents, but there's more than 400,000 in public housing in New York City. So this is a drop in the bucket. What kind of impact do you expect it to have? AJAYI: These digital vans have already served over 4,000 individuals in five boroughs in the areas that need it most. And so now we're figuring out this targeted area of Harlem where Wi-Fi access is being offered to those individuals in public housing and then also, too, those outside of public housing as well. HEADLEE: But this kind of thing has been tried before, right? We've had similar initiatives in Cleveland. And then in California in 2006, Google offered no-cost Wi-Fi. But what ended up happening was the network got so overloaded that the Wi-Fi became so slow, laggy, it would drop out, that it wasn't usable anymore. How do know that's not going to happen in Harlem? AJAYI: We don't. But one of the things that we're working on is this is going to be rolled out in three phases, right. You're going to have, first, one community being tested, and then we'll move to another. And then as you've said, in the middle of 2014, then we'll have a full rollout. Thanks to the office of - it's called DoITT, which focuses on all of the city's technology. This project is part of providing access, overall, to New Yorkers who don't have access to wireless services. Our digital bands have kind of been leading the way in doing that work. You see them go from each development. Over the course of two weeks, there's a rotation where you have individuals who can not only receive Wi-Fi, but they can actually come into these vans and learn everything from how to create a Twitter account, to how to produce a resume and use basic Microsoft Outlook. HEADLEE: Often, elderly residents won't even know the first thing about how to use Wi-Fi. Who is your targeted audience? Describe to me somebody that you think would get the best use out of this. AJAYI: So far, the vans have served individuals - everyone from ages 7 to 70. There is no typical audience. We have offered everything from, like I said, being able to come in and learn the very basics of computer literacy, all the way to how to protect your computer with services provided directly from Semantic themselves. In between that, our vans have not only offered these literacy programs, but then also, too, they've really done a great job of fortifying and bolstering our other departments as well. So for example, there's our Department of Resident Economic Engagement and Sustainability. And that team is specific to providing job opportunities for those who are in low-income areas who are NYCHA residents. During hurricane Sandy, our vans were present, and then post, one year later, our vans were on the scene actually helping individuals sign up for something called NYCHA alerts. And that's where residents can come in, they can sign up to find out about the latest outages, and if there's anything that's happening in their specific development. They provide so many different services that the audience is now very, very vast. HEADLEE: Help me understand exactly how this works. I'm a person that's in a public housing project in Harlem. I need to go online, maybe to update my resume on Google Drive or something. I have to go - do I go out to the van and actually get in this van? Or how do I do it? AJAYI: Great question. Yeah you can. So these vans are equipped with six laptops a piece. You can come in. There's also a printer. And that's where the Wi-Fi hub actually lives. So if you wanted, you can come in and hang out in the vans. They're out there during the entire day from around 10 a. m. to 4 p. m. if weather is permitting. And they operate most of the weekday. They're there almost five days a week. HEADLEE: Obviously, you're the digital communications manager at New York City Housing Authority. But very often when we talk about the digital divide, it's between rural and urban. To a certain extent, New York City is low hanging fruit. If you're working mostly on your mobile device and you can't get it at your home, you go to a nearby Starbucks and they have free Wi-Fi there. But if you're in a rural area, there's no place to go, right? AJAYI: This is true. But one of the things, again, pointing to the digital roadmap, what we found is that if you're a young person and you need to get, say for example, a report done, you may not have the option of going to a Starbucks and paying $6 for a drink in order to, you know, have access to their Internet. You may not have that option. And we have found and we've seen studies of people who actually have become, you know, desperate, and that's the means of, you know, maybe posting up in a McDonald's or what have you. A young person who has work to do, you know, it is, you know, a hindrance to them. And so this NYC-Connected Communities, which includes these digital vans, they provide something that nobody else would probably have access to otherwise. So you're right, a lot of people do have access to connectivity, but it comes at costs, right? And so the idea is that, you know, we want to provide something where no matter how much money you have, you're still able to have the same type of access as somebody who can afford to get a $6 drink every day. That is the idea. HEADLEE: Dupe Ajayi is the digital communications manager at New York City Housing Authority. And she joined us from our New York bureau. Dupe, thank you so much. AJAYI: Thank you so much, Celeste. Happy holidays. HEADLEE: You too. CELESTE HEADLEE, HOST:  Next, a community in Harlem is getting a makeover of its technology.

They provide so many different services that the audience is now very, very vast. HEADLEE: Help me understand exactly how this works. I'm a person that's in a public housing project in Harlem. I need to go online, maybe to update my resume on Google Drive or something. I have to go - do I go out to the van and actually get in this van? Or how do I do it? AJAYI: Great question. Yeah you can. So these vans are equipped with six laptops a piece. You can come in. There's also a printer. And that's where the Wi-Fi hub actually lives. So if you wanted, you can come in and hang out in the vans. They're out there during the entire day from around 10 a. m. to 4 p. m. if weather is permitting. And they operate most of the weekday. They're there almost five days a week. HEADLEE: Obviously, you're the digital communications manager at New York City Housing Authority. But very often when we talk about the digital divide, it's between rural and urban. To a certain extent, New York City is low hanging fruit. If you're working mostly on your mobile device and you can't get it at your home, you go to a nearby Starbucks and they have free Wi-Fi there. But if you're in a rural area, there's no place to go, right? AJAYI: This is true. But one of the things, again, pointing to the digital roadmap, what we found is that if you're a young person and you need to get, say for example, a report done, you may not have the option of going to a Starbucks and paying $6 for a drink in order to, you know, have access to their Internet. You may not have that option. And we have found and we've seen studies of people who actually have become, you know, desperate, and that's the means of, you know, maybe posting up in a McDonald's or what have you. A young person who has work to do, you know, it is, you know, a hindrance to them. And so this NYC-Connected Communities, which includes these digital vans, they provide something that nobody else would probably have access to otherwise. So you're right, a lot of people do have access to connectivity, but it comes at costs, right? And so the idea is that, you know, we want to provide something where no matter how much money you have, you're still able to have the same type of access as somebody who can afford to get a $6 drink every day. That is the idea. HEADLEE: Dupe Ajayi is the digital communications manager at New York City Housing Authority. And she joined us from our New York bureau. Dupe, thank you so much. AJAYI: Thank you so much, Celeste. Happy holidays. HEADLEE: You too.", "section": "Technology", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2013 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Good morning I'm David Greene. Well, not a whole lot of traffic on the roads this holiday or suburban trains on the move, and that's a relief for many Americans who spend so many mornings trying to get from point A to point B. on this program recently, we've been exploring how Americans commute. Seventy-five percent of commuters now drive to work alone. In a minute, we'll look ahead to the future of commuting by car. But first, let's go back over 40 years to hear how some elementary school students imagined today's commute. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: Cars of tomorrow may be self-driven and self-cleaned. GREENE: The car of tomorrow as envisioned by a fifth grader at Meadows School in Baldwin, New York in 1967. That recording was made during a school assembly, buried in a time capsule, then pulled out in the year 2000. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: A chauffeured-driven limousine for busing. Who knows? Maybe our sidewalks will move so no walking will be necessary. GREENE: From chauffeured limousines for buses to moving sidewalks. And, of course, any young person who watched the futuristic cartoon \"The Jetsons\" - I did - might have predicted this:UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #2: In the year 2000, it will cars that run on fuel and oxygen. The cars won't have any wheels. They will look like flying saucers. The oxygen and fuel will make it fly like a rocket. GREENE: Lofty predictions then for now but what's possible for the car of tomorrow? To find out, NPR's Sonari Glinton spent some time with graduate school students who are helping to create the future of transportation. SONARI GLINTON, BYLINE: If you want to look into the future, you need only go to Pasadena, California. GEOFF WARDLE: Yeah this is our graduate transportation studio. We've got also a conference teaching room there, and there's a class. . . GLINTON: That's Geoff Wardle. He runs the Graduate Transportation program at Art Center College of Design in Pasadena. Art Center has long been known for car design because, well, car companies hire people. Wardle started this new program because recently he's come to believe that we are coming toward a tipping point when it come to transportation. WARDLE: Where all aspects of transportation - whether it's people or goods - is going to go through some fundamental changes. And we've seen the early signs of that, even with the convolutions that the automobile industry has been through recently. GLINTON: So in their studio, you can see almost every pie-in-the-sky idea about transportation. Some are as out there as flying cars - yup, there's still hope for that one - to hovercraft. RUSSELL SINGER: Most are. . . GLINTON: Down to Earth. Russell Singer is working on a project to crowdsource car design. So instead of going to a big car company you could build your own car that fits the needs of you and your exact location. SINGER: But we want to do is get it almost to this level of simplicity, like a Lego car, where you can just kind of plug things together. And you can experiment with the function and the form factor of the vehicle without needing to be an engineer or highly trained transportation designer. GLINTON: The idea that open-source designing could potentially make it easier to come up with breakthroughs on things like fuel efficiency. Meanwhile David Pablano says one of the most important things he's hoping to see in the future is the connection between social networking and travel. DAVID PABLANO: The transportations systems and networks that we look at, they have a certain amount of demand and they kind of track how people get on to the trains at certain times. But they don't necessarily know all the information about how you get from your home to the bus to the subway station and to a taxi. GLINTON: So right now, Pablano says we're all connected but our transit systems aren't. Think about it, if Facebook knows that you like golf it'll show you ads for Big Bertha drivers. But your transportation system, if it knew what percentage of people were going to work on any given day and what direction they were going in, it could change the number signals to divert traffic through less congested streets, add more train cars or buses. WARDLE: I would say, the one big topic which is not been mentioned. . . GLINTON: Geoff Wardle, the professor, interrupts our big ideas discussion. WARDLE: . . . is the fact that what we're doing at the moment, whether we like it or not, is totally unsustainable. So as well as making life much better for people who commute, making it a much more seamless part of their everyday lives, we have to figure out how to do that in a way that this planet can support,GLINTON: See, that's something that car designers and transportation designers might not have thought of in the past. David Day Lee says the biggest problem in transportation isn't really design, or infrastructure - it's the way we think. Think about how much the phone has changed, for instance. DAVID DAY LEE: This has become the device through which people do business, device through which people can capture precious moments. And so, in the same way, mobility could be re-imagined as a platform around which we can bring about changes. GLINTON: For these changes to happen, all the students assume that to some degree or another our cars will be driving themselves. And every step toward driverless cars opens a new realm of possibility for what your commute could be like. It changes everything. Calvin Ku, one of the grad students, essentially turned the microphone on me then. CALVIN KU: Do you feel there's hope for transportation? GLINTON: I don't. (LAUGHTER)GLINTON: Well, I drive in Los Angeles. I have no hope. KU: I can, you know, sometimes feel the same way. I see it from my point of view as almost fighting a disease. We can't stand in the corner and hope it goes away. And you can see the range of ways of tackling transportation problems in this very room with these people here. If we can collectively work together, I think we can solve these problems. And Los Angeles is not without hope. GLINTON: That is the message from these students of transportation; your commute will definitely get better. It has to. Sonari Glinton, NPR News, Culver City.

I'm Robert Siegel. When a big earthquake strikes, it takes time for the seismic waves to spread. That means there's also a time to warn people who aren't at the epicenter to get ready for the jolt. As NPR's Richard Harris reports, scientists on the West Coast are now trying to set up a system to do just that. RICHARD HARRIS, BYLINE: Japan already has an early warning system for earthquakes, says Richard Allen who runs the seismology lab at UC, Berkeley. RICHARD ALLEN: So they have a network of seismometers, about a thousand of them across the country, that detects earthquakes as they are happening. They locate the earthquake and they estimate the amount of shaking that you might expect. And then, they push that alert out to people. People get it on their cell phones, they get it on TV, through a whole variety of communication channels. HARRIS: The high-speed trains put on their brakes. Delicate industrial processes shut down. Eye surgeons step away from their patients. And people take cover. Allen, along with colleagues at Caltech, the U. S. Geological Survey, and the University of Washington, figured, why not establish a system like that on the West Coast? Allen shows me a prototype on his computer, simulating what would have happened if that system had been in place in 1989, when the deadly Loma Prieta quake struck California. (SOUNDBITE OF ALARM BLARING)ALLEN: So the first alert comes up and you can see there's more than 20 seconds of warning. HARRIS: Loma Prieta's epicenter was in the Santa Cruz Mountains, 60 plus miles from Berkeley. This system would have given people good warning that they were about to be hit with a substantial quake. ALLEN: We're counting down 10 seconds at this point until the shaking would start here in Berkeley. HARRIS: Of course, the system wouldn't help if the Hayward fault ruptured directly beneath the campus, but there are plenty of other times when it would. ALLEN: The best-case scenario in California is about a minute worth of warning. In the Pacific Northwest you can get up to five minutes of warning. The really big earthquakes can give you a significant amount of warning and that's when you would most want it. HARRIS: This test system already has a few users who are trying it out, including Bay Area Rapid Transit. Kevin Copley at BART says when they test the system or simply get a false alarm, the subway's trains all slow down to 26 mph to reduce the risk of a derailment. KEVIN COPLEY: We do that system-wide, and then we also institute a hold. Any train that happens to be at a platform at the time would cause it to hold there so it won't close its doors and depart. HARRIS: And he says it works. COPLEY: I ride the system as a passenger every day, and it makes me feel a lot better about it. It's not a solution for every earthquake that's going to happen, but it will give us good warning for a lot of them. HARRIS: But Richard Allen at Berkeley says the current seismic monitoring network isn't complete. ALLEN: The network is very dense in San Francisco and Los Angeles, but there are gaps in between. And to be able to provide the most warning, you need to be able to rapidly detect the earthquake when it starts outside of the city so you can see it coming towards the city. HARRIS: The California Legislature overwhelmingly voted to expand the network and provide the quake-proof infrastructure that would be required to send out the warnings. ALLEN: The catch is they didn't allocate any funding to do it. HARRIS: Allen figures it would cost $80 million to set up the network in California and run it for five years, or $120 million for a system that would cover the Pacific Northwest as well, which someday will experience the same kind of mega-thrust quake that struck Japan in 2011. ALLEN: If we have an earthquake this afternoon, the legislature would find the money next week and we would build this system next week. So the question becomes, why don't we just do it now? HARRIS: He's asked state and federal officials that question and is still waiting for an answer. Richard Harris, NPR News. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.

I'm Robert Siegel. Car companies have already begun to design cars that can drive themselves. But to make these smart cars really useful, they'll also need smart roads. As part of his series, \"Joe's Big Idea,\" NPR science correspondent Joe Palca has this story about some computer scientists who were designing a smart traffic intersection. How smart? Well, it can keep traffic flowing at least 10 times faster than old-fashioned intersections. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: I've done my share of late night driving, so I can sympathize with what happened to Kurt Dresner one night about a decade ago. At the time, Dresner was a computer science grad student at the University of Texas at Austin. He was working in the lab late one night - did I just make you think of a song? - and didn't head home till nearly 2 in the morning. KURT DRESNER: I was driving home, and I was at a stoplight. And the stoplight was red but there was nobody around. And I was just thinking to myself, there's got to be a better way to do this. PALCA: The better way Dresner came up with requires autonomous cars - cars that know exactly where they are, precisely how fast they're going, and can drive themselves without any help from a human. It also requires smart intersections. In his system, Dresner says, as a car approaches the intersection, it would request a reservation to enter the intersection by sending ahead detailed information. DRESNER: This is how big my vehicle is, this is when I'm going to enter the intersection, this is how fast I'm going to be going, this is how I am going to exit the intersection and when I'm going to exit the intersection. PALCA: A computer at the smart intersection looks at this information and information it's getting from other cars wanting to enter the intersection, then makes a decision. DRESNER: All the intersection ever says is yes or no. Either it says, yes, that works and I've confirmed your reservation or it says, no, that doesn't work and you need to come up with something else. PALCA: So the car can propose speeding up or slowing down or stopping for a while until it finds a plan the intersection will accept. DRESNER: It's up to the car to change the plans. PALCA: I've seen a simulation of how this would work. On the screen, there's a four-way intersection with each road carrying five lanes of traffic. With light traffic, cars just zoom through. But with heavier traffic, even though some cars are turning and some are going straight, in the simulation at least, the cars don't slow down all that much, although they frequently come terrifyingly close to each. And this is why you need autonomous cars. Dresner says a human driver just couldn't make the necessary adjustments fast enough or remain on course reliably enough to make the system work. DRESNER: You have to trust the vehicle at that point, and the vehicle can do it a lot better than you can. I mean, I don't - I can't count the number of times I'm driving around and I think to myself, this would be so much better if there were a computer driving these cars around me because the people around me are not driving very well. PALCA: Dresner knows right now most people wouldn't be comfortable putting themselves or their families into the hands of a car that drives itself. DRESNER: My personal feeling is when you're neighbor buys that autonomous vehicle and you're seeing them not have to worry about driving when they're tired or getting a designated driver for a party or having the car drive their kid to soccer practice without them having to wake up, you know, early on Saturday morning or whatever, personally, I think you'll be sold. PALCA: He may be right, but we're probably not going to find out for a while. Joe Palca, NPR News. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Robert Siegel.

It's ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR West. I'm Arun Rath. A lot of people and some news organizations were fooled by Internet hoaxes this year. From that twerking girl who caught on fire to the TV producer going to war with the rude lady in seat 7A to the not-very-poor blogger who so eloquently wrote about living in poverty. So many of these stories have taken hold, 2013 has been called the year of the Internet hoax. If you've been taken in, take heart. Grantland writer Tess Lynch says you are not alone. TESS LYNCH: Well, I think what it says is that we still haven't figured out how to navigate consuming news online because everyone really contributes to the stream of news online. It's not just reporters and bloggers. RATH: Right. LYNCH: So I think what it says is that everyone is really susceptible to this. And sometimes it's harmless and fun, but then other times, especially when, you know, crowd-funding comes into play, it gets a little icky. RATH: And that was one of the icky ones particularly. That was - I'm thinking of the waitress who posted a picture of a receipt in which she had been basically stiffed on a tip. LYNCH: Mm-hmm. Yes. I think when she got the receipt, I don't exactly recall what was in the margins, but they did explicitly write that they disagreed with her lifestyle. And because of that, they refused to tip her. And when she posted this on the Have A Gay Day Facebook page, people were outraged and ended up donating thousands of dollars to her. But when the couple came forward, they had their own copy - the customer copy of the receipt, and that indicated a 20 percent tip and no mean note. RATH: There's - I feel like there's kind of an interesting new adjustment happening here where when the Internet first was becoming an important source of news, maybe 15-odd years ago, I remember when the Drudge Report was hitting the scene and a lot of people in the news business were wondering, well, how do we report on stuff that's coming up on Drudge. And over time, news organizations have kind of figured it out. But it feels like all of a sudden, it's fresh again. People are getting taken in all over again. LYNCH: Yes. Well, I think there is an adrenaline rush from that. I'm thinking now of the one that kind of drew me in the most was a man named Elan Gale who's a producer for \"The Bachelor. \"RATH: Right. LYNCH: Yes. This one was the one that totally got me. It kind of got to the point where everyone was watching it like a reality show, which, obviously, Gale knows very well. And it seemed so intricate that it really didn't occur to many people that he could just be making it up. And why would he? And I think it was maybe Monday morning - this happened over Thanksgiving - he revealed it to be a hoax. And there was this strange feeling of emptiness. RATH: Right. And, you know, what's funny is I myself have experienced a kind of overcorrection to my responses to these things so that when - remember Batkid. . . LYNCH: Oh, yeah. RATH: . . . when that was happening, you know, the Make-a-Wish Foundation let this boy with an illness become Batkid for a day. And I assumed that was a hoax. I assumed we were going to find out that, no, it was, like, some awful, you know, story. But, no, it was actually a nice, lovely story about Batkid. LYNCH: I mean, all of the, you know, meme kind of cats, the Grumpy Cat and Lil' Bub - all of those cats and how strange looking they are became this sort of thing of like, look at the funny animals. And then this year, there was a cat walking on its two hind legs. It was called the Half Cat. RATH: The Half Cat, right. LYNCH: Yes. And it was - it seemed obvious to me that that was fake, but at the same time, there are so many strange-looking cats. RATH: And then somebody put up a video of an actual real half-cat. I mean, not quite as strange as that, but it was a cat that just had two front legs, and it was real. LYNCH: A subpar half -at but a half-cat technically, yes. RATH: Yeah. Well, and do you think, though, with the proliferation of these things that it's just going to turn everyone into cynics? We'll all get desensitized? LYNCH: I don't think so. I think what it's really about is tempering that emotional response and adding a little bit of the rational response that we kind of have in our normal lives, where you take a person and you consider that person's motivations as being very layered.

I'm Audie Cornish. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: And I'm Robert Siegel. We've got a report card now on a big trend in higher education - MOOCs. That's short for massive open online courses. The idea really took off last year when the New York Times famously dubbed 2012 the year of the MOOC. Well, with 2013 came a reality check. Faculty at several institutions rebelled against full-throttled expansion of online learning. And the largest MOOC providers have announced changes in how they plan to deliver online education in 2014. NPR's Eric Westervelt has our story. ERIC WESTERVELT, BYLINE: Many saw the rapid expansion of MOOCs over the last two years as a higher education revolution that would help address two long-vexing problems: cost and access for underserved students. In theory, students saddled by rising debt and unable to tap into the best schools could take classes for free from rock star professors at elite schools via Udacity, edX, Coursera and other massive open online course platforms. GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN: We've got to invest in learning, in teaching, in education. WESTERVELT: Earlier this year, California's San Jose State University partnered with Udacity to offer several types of MOOC classes for credit at low cost, including a remedial math course. It was announced in January with lots of enthusiastic publicity, including a plug from California's technophilic governor, Jerry Brown. He said MOOC experiments are central to democratizing education. BROWN: We do that not by just the way we did it 100 years ago. We keep changing. WESTERVELT: But the San Jose experiment, by all accounts, was a bust. Completion rates and grades were worse than for those who took traditional campus-style classes. And the students who did best were not the underserved students San Jose most wanted to reach. And it wasn't really proving to be cheaper, says Professor Peter Hadreas, who chairs San Jose's philosophy department. PETER HADREAS: The people that do well in these kind of courses are people who are already studious. Or they are people who are taking courses for their own enrichment after they've graduated. But you see that wasn't what was being talked about a year and a half ago when people thought this was going to solve the problems with higher education because people would be able to be educated for less money. That's not the way it's worked out. WESTERVELT: Now, San Jose State is scaling back its relationship with Udacity. The university taking more direct control of the courses it offers through the company and the school is rethinking its commitment to MOOCs. Other schools are hitting the pause button as well. Revolution interrupted. A recent University of Pennsylvania study confirmed a massive problem: MOOCs have painfully few active users. About half who registered for a class ever viewed a lecture, and completion rates averaged just 4 percent across all courses. Udacity co-founder, Sebastian Thrun, a prime mover in MOOCs, recently told Fast Company magazine - quote - \"We were on the front pages of newspapers and magazines, and at the same time, I was realizing, we don't educate people as others wished, or as I wished. We have a lousy product\" - end quote. Do you regret that quote? SEBASTIAN THRUN: Not at all. I think that's just honest, and I think we should have an honest discourse about what we do. WESTERVELT: Udacity CEO Sebastian Thrun. THRUN: Online education that leaves almost everybody behind except for highly motivated students, to me, can't be a viable path to education. We look back at our early work and realize it wasn't quite as good as it should have been. We had so many moments for improvement. WESTERVELT: That the former Stanford professor and inventor, whose online artificial intelligence course helped kick off the MOOC frenzy, was fundamentally rethinking its viability shook the higher-ed world. What was missing, many students complained, was a human connection beyond the streamed lecture. That's what Tracy Wheeler found lacking. This year she immersed herself in five MOOCs from two providers, from a course on statistics to one on global poverty. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: It's about both understanding why the poor make the choices they make, what are the consequence that they face in their everyday life and what. . . WESTERVELT: Wheeler completed three of the classes, including the one on global poverty. She'd read the professor's book and was excited and upbeat. I had that back-to-school feeling, she says. TRACY WHEELER: I thought I'd go in deeper, you know, and come out wanting to move to India and help her with one of her experiments. WESTERVELT: Instead, the 52-year-old education consultant says she hated being chained to the computer screen, and she found the entire MOOC experience mechanistic, dreary and ineffectual. WHEELER: I'm a very social person. There was nothing to grasp on to. You know, there were no people, there was no professor. In a sense you're just learning in this void. I think I kept saying it was like soul sucking. I would come away from my computer just kind of despondent and feeling really reduced somehow. WESTERVELT: For Wheeler anyway, the courses' online forums - the key support structure for many MOOCs - were isolating and largely absent of meaningful back-and-forth - or joy. WHEELER: It was like going up and scrawling your name on a graffiti wall. You know, there was no sense of community. WESTERVELT: In class, you can make a comment, you can flirt, you can. . . WHEELER: Yeah, you can pass a note. WESTERVELT: . . . roll your eyes, you can pass a note, so. WHEELER: You can have fun. WESTERVELT: This is just one anecdote out of hundreds of thousands of MOOC takers. Many others praise the online courses as brilliant, time-saving and cost efficient. But the providers are responding to criticisms like Wheeler's. Enter MOOC 2. 0. Udacity and other leading MOOC providers now realize that a more expansive, human-centered support structure is key to helping students retain information, stick with the course and finish the class. Udacity's Sebastian Thrun. THRUN: Yeah, and the human mentors. We have people almost 24/7 that help you when you get stuck. We also added a lot of projects that require human feedback and human grading. And that human element, surprise, surprise, makes a huge difference in the student experience and the learning outcomes. WESTERVELT: Like Udacity, MOOC pioneer Coursera is also changing. The company's creating learning hubs at U. S. consulates around the world that will include a weekly in-person instructor to foster discussion. Some critics believe the changes underway amount to a full-scale MOOC retreat and lay bare online education's flaws. But Thrun says those critics simply don't get the nature of tech innovation: You closely evaluate failures, think forward, adjust and use the word iterate. A lot. THRUN: It's certainly an iteration. And the truth is, look, this is Silicon Valley. We try things out, we look at the data, and we learn from it. SAM: Hi, I'm Sam. ANDY: And I'm Andy. SAM: And we literally just got done filming this class. ANDY: And the way we. . . WESTERVELT: Udacity is now refocusing - or iterating - on its product. In 2014, the company will put more emphasis on employee job training classes for corporations, including Google, Facebook and others. Classes will include Intro to Big Data Analysis and Mobile App Development. ANDY: And after working for really only a few hours, I feel like I can actually build apps now. I am totally hooked, and you might be too. So, does this sound like interesting to you? You should take the class. SAM: Let's build an app. WESTERVELT: Eric Westervelt, NPR News, San Francisco.

As 2013 comes to a close, we've been taking a look back at some of this year's biggest news events. One history-making announcement came from NASA's Voyager One mission. Scientists said the space probe had become the first explorer from Earth to enter the mysterious realm of interstellar space. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports that this was a big moment for humanity and for the researchers who have worked with Voyager since the beginning. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: Voyager 1 and its twin, Voyager 2, both blasted off in 1977, over 35 years ago. Voyager 1 flew by Jupiter, then Saturn, then on towards interstellar space, the unknown region that lies between stars.  Tom Krimigis works at Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Lab. He was the youngest principal investigator for Voyager when it started. Now he's 75. TOM KRIMIGIS: We knew that we had a long-lived spacecraft in our hands and the principle question was whether, for example, for me, whether I would expire before Voyager does, before we got into the galaxy, that is. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The telltale signs they'd been waiting for came last year. Voyager's data showed that something unusual had happened on or about August 25, 2012. KRIMIGIS: We were absolutely certain that a big boundary was crossed. GREENFIELDBOYCE: They saw a sharp decrease in lower-energy particles that come from inside our solar system and a big increase in the higher-energy particles that come from outside our solar system. Did this mean Voyager had crossed into interstellar space? KRIMIGIS: Most of us felt, I would say, 90 percent sure. GREENFIELDBOYCE: This spring, they were able to get the proof they needed when Voyager registered the effects of a solar eruption that had happened months before. The chief scientist for Voyager is Ed Stone. He's now a professor at Caltech. Back in 1972, when he and his team were designing the mission, he was 36 years old. He says even though the original goal was to visit the outer planets, his team had always hoped that Voyager would still be working when it finally left the bubble of charged particles created by our sun. ED STONE: Like circumnavigating the globe - I don't know how many ships started out, but I think only one made it. This has the same kind of element of risk. It was an obvious thing to try to do, but it was not obvious that it could be done. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says for the first time we really have left home, even though the scenery may look like just more dark space. STONE: The spacecraft itself is unaware that any of this is happening and if you were an astronaut, you'd be unaware of it as well. GREENFIELDBOYCE: But he and other longtime Voyager scientists are very aware that Voyager is somewhere new and unexplored. NORMAN NESS: It's quite a romantic idea, of course. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Norman Ness is a physicist with the University of Delaware. He's now 80 years old, but still remembers how happy he was on that day back in the 1960s when he got a telegram saying he'd been picked for the Voyager program. NESS: When I was a kid growing up, science fiction was a great fascination for me. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He never thought interstellar exploration would be a part of his future. Voyager is now around 12 billion miles away from Earth. Its transmissions take over 17 hours to reach our planet. Voyager veteran Don Gurnett, of the University of Iowa, says the distance the spacecraft has traveled over his lifetime is mind-boggling. DON GURNETT: But on the other hand, compared to the vast distances between stars and in the universe, it's just puny. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The scientists should get another shot at seeing this strange boundary region when Voyager 2 gets there. And they'll keep listening to Voyager 1 until its power runs out in about a decade. After that, the spacecraft will keep moving outwards, finally getting close to another star in about 40,000 years.

NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: Voyager 1 and its twin, Voyager 2, both blasted off in 1977, over 35 years ago. Voyager 1 flew by Jupiter, then Saturn, then on towards interstellar space, the unknown region that lies between stars.  Tom Krimigis works at Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Lab. He was the youngest principal investigator for Voyager when it started. Now he's 75. TOM KRIMIGIS: We knew that we had a long-lived spacecraft in our hands and the principle question was whether, for example, for me, whether I would expire before Voyager does, before we got into the galaxy, that is. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The telltale signs they'd been waiting for came last year. Voyager's data showed that something unusual had happened on or about August 25, 2012. KRIMIGIS: We were absolutely certain that a big boundary was crossed. GREENFIELDBOYCE: They saw a sharp decrease in lower-energy particles that come from inside our solar system and a big increase in the higher-energy particles that come from outside our solar system. Did this mean Voyager had crossed into interstellar space? KRIMIGIS: Most of us felt, I would say, 90 percent sure. GREENFIELDBOYCE: This spring, they were able to get the proof they needed when Voyager registered the effects of a solar eruption that had happened months before. The chief scientist for Voyager is Ed Stone. He's now a professor at Caltech. Back in 1972, when he and his team were designing the mission, he was 36 years old. He says even though the original goal was to visit the outer planets, his team had always hoped that Voyager would still be working when it finally left the bubble of charged particles created by our sun. ED STONE: Like circumnavigating the globe - I don't know how many ships started out, but I think only one made it. This has the same kind of element of risk. It was an obvious thing to try to do, but it was not obvious that it could be done. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says for the first time we really have left home, even though the scenery may look like just more dark space. STONE: The spacecraft itself is unaware that any of this is happening and if you were an astronaut, you'd be unaware of it as well. GREENFIELDBOYCE: But he and other longtime Voyager scientists are very aware that Voyager is somewhere new and unexplored. NORMAN NESS: It's quite a romantic idea, of course. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Norman Ness is a physicist with the University of Delaware. He's now 80 years old, but still remembers how happy he was on that day back in the 1960s when he got a telegram saying he'd been picked for the Voyager program. NESS: When I was a kid growing up, science fiction was a great fascination for me. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He never thought interstellar exploration would be a part of his future. Voyager is now around 12 billion miles away from Earth. Its transmissions take over 17 hours to reach our planet. Voyager veteran Don Gurnett, of the University of Iowa, says the distance the spacecraft has traveled over his lifetime is mind-boggling. DON GURNETT: But on the other hand, compared to the vast distances between stars and in the universe, it's just puny. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The scientists should get another shot at seeing this strange boundary region when Voyager 2 gets there. And they'll keep listening to Voyager 1 until its power runs out in about a decade. After that, the spacecraft will keep moving outwards, finally getting close to another star in about 40,000 years.
