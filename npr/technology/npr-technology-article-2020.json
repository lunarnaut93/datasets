You took a photo of that amazing sunset or beach vacation or that perfect dessert you baked. But now you can't find it. Did you save it on your computer, your phone, in the cloud? Was it just an Instagram story? And didn't you save a better, edited version somewhere? How many photos do you have anyway? For a New Year's cleanup of your or your family's photo collection, we called tech guru and radio host Kim Komando for some guidance. Welcome. KIM KOMANDO: Hi. Thank you. FADEL: So I think I must have thousands - several thousands of photos I've collected over the past five or six years. Can I - help me with some shortcuts. How do I store? How do I find? How do I organize? KOMANDO: It's a big mess, isn't it? FADEL: Right. KOMANDO: What you want to do is actually start at the beginning. And it's not a fun process. You want to grab your phone, your camera, your tablet, your memory cards, your computer. And if you have any old phones sitting in a drawer, pull them out, too, because odds are there's photos on there. FADEL: Oh, wow. KOMANDO: And then what you do is you pull them into your computer. You want to pull them all into one central location. And don't forget; you might even have undeveloped rolls of film. Yes, you've been hiding those for years. So you might as well get them into the digital age, too. And then you want to look at, you know, what do I really want to do with these? If you're a professional, a serious hobbyist, that's when you want to probably use Adobe's Creative Cloud. It gives you the ability to edit, organize, store, share your photos. And the Lightroom plan gives you one terabyte of cloud storage, and it's not bad. It's, like, $9. 99 a month. But if you want free - and we all love free, right? FADEL: I definitely like free, yeah. KOMANDO: Then Google Photos is the way to go. It gives you free unlimited storage. But there is a caveat. The photos have to be 16 megabytes of - videos up to 1080p storage. FADEL: So if you put everything in Google, what type of privacy issues might you be dealing with? KOMANDO: That's an excellent question because anytime you mention Google, privacy comes up - right? - because. . . FADEL: Right. KOMANDO: . . . They track every single thing that we do. You know, of course, you're going to see some targeted ads. So if you put up that beautiful Maui sunset, you may start seeing some ads for - I don't know - maybe an Airbnb or some other location that is similar to Maui. But with Google, you know, if you're looking for a photo, well, Google gives you a great way to sort by people, places and things. FADEL: Oh. Well, actually, on that note, what's the best way to organize things so you can find them? When you go through, when you're organizing them, what should we be doing? KOMANDO: People have different ways to organize even their lives and their selves, right? FADEL: Yeah. KOMANDO: We also all have that junk drawer in the kitchen. And so you want to set up individual folders. Maybe it is family reunions. Maybe it's by a person. And then what you want to do is start looking for the duplicates because we all take two or three photos of the same thing. And it's. . . FADEL: Or 20. KOMANDO: Yes, you're right - maybe 30 in some cases. And so that's where you want to start using things like duplicate photo remover apps. And for Mac users, there's Photo Duplicates Cleaner (ph), which is a free download. And if you're on Windows, Duplicate Cleaner is a similar program. FADEL: So is the age of printing out photos, saving physical pictures over? Do we still do that? KOMANDO: You know, that's an excellent question because I have a tendency - if it's really a great photo, then I'm going to print it, or I'm going to send it to Shutterfly or someplace else. I think if you have an excellent photo collection and if you're looking to preserve memories, that's where you want to look at photo books. If your son or daughter is just turning 18 and they're graduating high school, then you create a photo book of all their memories and you give it to them. Because, you know, while we have all these cameras in the digital age and we have all these photos that are creating all these precious memories, there's nothing like an actual book for somebody to pick up and look at.

That is Las Vegas this week. About 200,000 people are meeting there for the annual extravaganza known as the Consumer Electronics Show, or CES. One of those people is NPR technology correspondent Shannon Bond. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: The first robot I meet at CES does just one thing, but it might come in handy. GREGG WEAVER: So you're on the commode. You look over. Oh, no. Somebody didn't change a roll. Hello? Nobody home. BOND: That's Gregg Weaver of Procter & Gamble describing the Charmin Roll Bot, as in roll of toilet paper. WEAVER: You take out your smartphone. It's Bluetooth-activated. It finds you in your home, delivers a fresh roll of Charmin, saves the day. BOND: Saves the day? That might sound a bit dramatic, but it could save you a few uncomfortable steps to retrieve a spare roll. You can't buy P&G's robot or a lot of the stuff here, but that's what much of CES is about - glimpsing the future of technology. Things like touch screens and voice assistants showed up here years before they became mainstream. The show is a dizzying display of tech in every form imaginable spread over almost 3 million square feet of exhibition space. I dodge rolling robots and people stumbling around, their eyes covered by virtual reality headsets. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Are you ready to be awestruck, to try experiences enhanced in ways you never imagined? Are you ready to build on what's next? BOND: This year in Las Vegas, a lot of the buzz is about 5G. That's the next generation of much faster cellular networks. 5G is still in the early stages, but that's not dampening the excitement. Kevin Westcott is a vice chairman at consulting firm Deloitte. He says 5G is about more than downloading a movie really quickly. KEVIN WESTCOTT: That's not going to change my life. What's going to change it is when people start envisioning new applications that use absolutely real-time data. BOND: Think self-driving cars talking to each other and to the roads they're driving on. One company here at CES working on this is Valerann. The British-Israeli startup put sensors in roads. They detect traffic and weather and can light up in the road to direct the flow of cars around a vehicle that's had to pull over onto the shoulder. Shahar Bahiri is co-founder of Valerann. He says the company is already using 5G connections in some places. SHAHAR BAHIRI: When you know that you have this stopped vehicle, when you know that you have black ice on the road, when you know when you will have a congestion and you can switch the traffic lights accordingly, your life is easier using data. BOND: Many of the startups at this year's show are making health care apps and devices that bring the tools of the doctor's office to your smartphone. At another booth, a company called Binah uses an iPad's camera to read your vital signs by scanning your face. It looks for a tiny movement in the skin under the eye each time the heart beats. Mona Popilian, Binah's director of marketing, explains. MONA POPILIAN: There's a change in the reflection of the light on your skin, and we say, OK, now there's been a heartbeat. And then there's another and another, and so we have the heart rate. And based on this, we continue to calculate the rest of the measurements, like oxygen, respiration rate, mental stress. And blood pressure we're going to have very soon. BOND: Popilian says Binah's app can be used by doctors to remotely examine patients. A big Japanese insurance company is using it to monitor stress levels of drivers. POPILIAN: So stand here, please, in front. I will just click here.

The company announced that they will no longer allow the high-tech manipulated videos to appear on their platform due to the potential to mislead users. This announcement comes the same week that Facebook is scheduled to appear before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The story was first reported by Tony Romm for The Washington Post. Welcome to the program. TONY ROMM: Hey. Thanks for having me. CORNISH: So we said deepfakes are manipulated videos. What else can you tell us? What are some examples we may have seen? ROMM: These are highly manipulated videos. It's not just somebody taking video editing software and slowing something down or speeding it up. We're talking about the use of artificial intelligence and very high-powered computers that can be used to make it seem like someone is saying something that they actually aren't. So imagine a video of President Trump speaking on the campaign trail and some malicious actor took that and altered what he was saying entirely, maybe to threaten an attack on a country that Trump wasn't actually threatening. These are the kinds of serious forms of manipulation and misinformation that are made possible because of deepfake technology. CORNISH: So how is Facebook going about its ban? What's the distinction it's making? ROMM: So Facebook has said that these sorts of deepfakes that are highly manipulated and aren't evident to an average user are no longer allowed on the platform. So you can't post those kinds of videos where someone is saying something that they aren't actually saying. Now, there are some exceptions here, and they've given a lot of researchers and lawmakers some great pause. For example, you're allowed to post deepfakes if they're done under the guise of satire or parody, which is a pretty open-ended thought on the part of Facebook. And Facebook has also said here that lesser forms of manipulation will be allowed. And so that's created a whole sort of controversy here about whether there are some loopholes that malicious actors could exploit to still spread misinformation online. CORNISH: What's their reasoning for these - I guess you're calling them loopholes. ROMM: Right. It all comes back to Facebook's idea that it is not the arbiter of speech. Facebook really doesn't want to be in the place where it's telling people what's true and what's false. And then you add into the fact the difficulty of determining what's manipulated or determining what qualifies as parody and satire. And Facebook typically wants to err on the side of allowing people to express themselves rather than shutting down that speech. It would rather some of that bad stuff go out and then, after the fact, police it rather than ban it outright. Now, that's not sat well with lawmakers and experts and others who remember all too well that in 2016 during the presidential election, there were malicious actors from Russia that sought to spread misinformation and exploit loopholes at companies like Facebook to weaponize those social media platforms. So the concern here is that the same thing could happen under Facebook's new deepfake policy. CORNISH: And yet they make this announcement just before they are supposed to offer testimony before House lawmakers. What are the politics that they're walking into? ROMM: Yeah, it's funny how that works. Typically, Facebook does these things in time for congressional hearings. And the politics they're walking into - it's really two issues here. The first is that there are a lot of Democrats who think that Facebook and its tech industry peers still haven't done enough in the aftermath of the 2016 election to ensure that the 2020 election isn't riddled with disinformation that could affect how people think about the candidates or how they vote at the end of the day. And the second issue is that there's still widespread concern that this deepfake policy isn't going to prevent the kinds of abuse that we've seen in the past. So you may remember about a year ago, there was a video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that had made the rounds on Facebook. It was doctored to make her look like she was drunk. Essentially, it was sped down. So she appeared to be inebriated. Now, if you talk to experts, they don't call that a deepfake. They call that a cheap fake because it was made using less expensive technology. It wasn't artificial intelligence. And that kind of video would still be allowed under Facebook's policy. Facebook says it would fact-check it, but it wouldn't outright ban it. And so there are a lot of concerns that that kind of thing could plague the 2020 election and the candidates running. CORNISH: That's Tony Romm, senior tech policy reporter for The Washington Post. Thank you for your time. ROMM: Thanks for having me.

What's the distinction it's making? ROMM: So Facebook has said that these sorts of deepfakes that are highly manipulated and aren't evident to an average user are no longer allowed on the platform. So you can't post those kinds of videos where someone is saying something that they aren't actually saying. Now, there are some exceptions here, and they've given a lot of researchers and lawmakers some great pause. For example, you're allowed to post deepfakes if they're done under the guise of satire or parody, which is a pretty open-ended thought on the part of Facebook. And Facebook has also said here that lesser forms of manipulation will be allowed. And so that's created a whole sort of controversy here about whether there are some loopholes that malicious actors could exploit to still spread misinformation online. CORNISH: What's their reasoning for these - I guess you're calling them loopholes. ROMM: Right. It all comes back to Facebook's idea that it is not the arbiter of speech. Facebook really doesn't want to be in the place where it's telling people what's true and what's false. And then you add into the fact the difficulty of determining what's manipulated or determining what qualifies as parody and satire. And Facebook typically wants to err on the side of allowing people to express themselves rather than shutting down that speech. It would rather some of that bad stuff go out and then, after the fact, police it rather than ban it outright. Now, that's not sat well with lawmakers and experts and others who remember all too well that in 2016 during the presidential election, there were malicious actors from Russia that sought to spread misinformation and exploit loopholes at companies like Facebook to weaponize those social media platforms. So the concern here is that the same thing could happen under Facebook's new deepfake policy. CORNISH: And yet they make this announcement just before they are supposed to offer testimony before House lawmakers. What are the politics that they're walking into? ROMM: Yeah, it's funny how that works. Typically, Facebook does these things in time for congressional hearings. And the politics they're walking into - it's really two issues here. The first is that there are a lot of Democrats who think that Facebook and its tech industry peers still haven't done enough in the aftermath of the 2016 election to ensure that the 2020 election isn't riddled with disinformation that could affect how people think about the candidates or how they vote at the end of the day. And the second issue is that there's still widespread concern that this deepfake policy isn't going to prevent the kinds of abuse that we've seen in the past. So you may remember about a year ago, there was a video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that had made the rounds on Facebook. It was doctored to make her look like she was drunk. Essentially, it was sped down. So she appeared to be inebriated. Now, if you talk to experts, they don't call that a deepfake. They call that a cheap fake because it was made using less expensive technology. It wasn't artificial intelligence. And that kind of video would still be allowed under Facebook's policy. Facebook says it would fact-check it, but it wouldn't outright ban it. And so there are a lot of concerns that that kind of thing could plague the 2020 election and the candidates running. CORNISH: That's Tony Romm, senior tech policy reporter for The Washington Post. Thank you for your time. ROMM: Thanks for having me.

UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #3: Can he get another? UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: Can he hit it? UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #3: He's going to end up picking up three kills. Oh, my God, what is that? SHAPIRO: According to the analytics company Newzoo, 2019 was the first year global revenue surpassed a billion dollars. For more on esports, we turn to Remer Rietkerk of Newzoo. Welcome. REMER RIETKERK: Hi, Ari. SHAPIRO: Start by just painting a picture for us. What is one of these big matches like? Paint a picture. RIETKERK: Absolutely. So I mean, I think when you enter a stadium where there's a big esports event, it honestly feels like any major traditional sporting event. You have loud fans, people banging, making noise. It's a - massive screens in the center. And then there's usually a small stage underneath where the players are sitting with their computers. And the stadium will be, depending on if it's done in the round or from one side out, will be half or entirely filled with fans. SHAPIRO: How much money can they win? RIETKERK: That depends a lot on the sport. You hear these great headlines about Fortnite, where, I think, one player won something in the neighborhood of $3 million. But a lot of these sports are also structured like a traditional league, where, rather than in the vein of boxing, it's about winning in the tournament and getting the big cash prize. Instead, these guys are employed as full-time athletes, playing week in, week out in a league basis. And in those cases, you see some players in the top leagues earning over seven figures. SHAPIRO: And who are the big stars of esports? I mean, they don't necessarily look like traditional athletes, right? RIETKERK: That's true, but I think what you're starting to see is also a change there. I think that when you look at a lot of the really professional organizations, they've come to realize that even in esports, fitness is actually important. So while they may not have the huge muscles you might see in traditional sports, a lot of these guys are starting to get into really good shape because they're aware that being physically fit is also important for their reaction times in the game. SHAPIRO: What are the skills that it takes to be great at one of those games? RIETKERK: There is a lot (laughter). SHAPIRO: (Laughter) I mean, to me, it seems like you've got to have quick reflexes. That's sort of, like, No. 1, right? RIETKERK: I think there's a lot of depth in understanding the way the game plays. And so you will have map states. I think if you listen to a professional analyst talk about Counter-Strike or League Of Legends, it'll sound like Greek to you, right? It'll sound like a completely different language because there's. . . SHAPIRO: (Laughter) I've watched some YouTube videos, and yeah, indeed. I couldn't follow what was going on. RIETKERK: (Laughter) Exactly. And so there is a depth in understanding the game, almost in a way like chess, where you really have to understand the different map states, the circumstances that which you're playing in, understanding your opponent, how they might play. There's also - communication is a really big part of it because you're playing in a team game. And at the end of the day, being able to effectively communicate, to effectively operate as a team - a lot of these skills that you would need in a traditional sport as well carry over completely into esports. SHAPIRO: It's no surprise that a lot of the best esports players come from countries that have really fast Internet speeds and really advanced technology. How does the U. S. compare? RIETKERK: The U. S. is an interesting market. I think that the U. S. - if you look at a lot of esports, I would not say that the U. S. is necessarily the strongest country, but they do field competitive teams in all of the major games, whether that's League Of Legends, Counter-Strike, Dota or Overwatch. SHAPIRO: When you look to the future, do you see esports reaching the size and scope that traditional sports have reached? RIETKERK: I would say one day, asterisk. SHAPIRO: (Laughter). RIETKERK: So I would not say this is something we should expect to see in the next 20 years. I think traditional sports has had a good 100-, 120-year head start (laughter). SHAPIRO: Sure. RIETKERK: But I'm very bullish on the future of esports, though, because you start to see young people more and more are watching esports and playing video games, which means that every year, more young people are aging into the market, and a larger percentage of them are watching esports. When you consider the fact that esports has only kind of begun to permeate the mainstream in the last five to 10 years, I think you could very reasonably say that you could see 20 years of year-over-year growth in the esports audience from now.

The plane crashed just after takeoff early this morning. Iranian officials say all 167 passengers and nine crew members were killed. There's no indication so far that this had anything to do with the conflict between the U. S. and Iran. Of course, Boeing is already dealing with a crisis over a different model of aircraft, the 737 Max. Julie Johnsson covers the aviation industry for Bloomberg News. Hi there. JULIE JOHNSSON: Hi. SHAPIRO: So to ask you the question I began with, what could have brought down this plane? What does the evidence show right now? JOHNSSON: Well, it's anybody's guess at this point. It's very early on. But there are some puzzling aspects to this crash. First of all, it was just a few minutes after takeoff. The plane was past the riskiest and most stressful point of its climb. And it's usually the point where, you know, pilots start to relax a little bit. The other interesting thing here is that Iranian state media got out within minutes of the crash and proclaimed that the plane came down due to mechanical difficulties. That may be the case at some point, but the pilots never communicated an emergency with the ground crews. And so it was just very, very odd to see state media jumping to that conclusion. SHAPIRO: Yeah. Usually, international and American investigators would collaborate with local officials to figure out what happens in a crash like this. If Iran doesn't give over the black box, if Iran doesn't fully cooperate with international investigators, is there any way to get a conclusive answer and figure out what actually happened here? JOHNSSON: Yes. Every aspect of this is just very unusual, kind of off the charts, screwy, whatever you want to say. And what happens to the black boxes is one of the questions. It seems highly unlikely that Boeing and U. S. investigators with the NTSB and FAA will be allowed to the crash site. And that is usually the protocol for an accident like this. Ukraine, which is the airline whose plane crashed, has also asked for the black boxes. And I think the U. S. is working with Ukraine. SHAPIRO: And just to be clear, this is a different type of aircraft from the 737 Max, which was involved in those two fatal crashes we've heard so much about. JOHNSSON: Yes, that's absolutely right. This was the previous version of the 737. And it's one of the most, you know, commonly flown aircraft around the world. There are more than 7,000 of them out there. If you fly between large cities in the U. S. , chances are you're on a 737 800. It's extremely - you know, has an extremely good safety record. I think they've only been nine fatal crashes. It's a terrible, terrible tragedy. And, you know, for Boeing, the people I've talked to are just stunned. I mean, this is one more crisis for a company that's had more than its share over the past year. SHAPIRO: Julie Johnsson of Bloomberg News, thank you very much. JOHNSSON: Thank you.

What does it mean when your stuff seems to know what you want before you do? NPR's technology correspondent Shannon Bond went to the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas to find out. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: CES is filled with some of the most familiar names in technology; Google, Amazon, Samsung - Weber grills? CHRIS SCHERZINGER: The Weber Connect platform can turn any grill into a smart grill, and so it gives you a step-by-step grilling experience to make sure that you get the very best food on the back end. BOND: Chris Scherzinger is CEO of Weber. For the company's CES debut, he's come prepared to talk the technology talk - platform, smart grill. He shows me what he means at Weber's outdoor barbecue here in Las Vegas. There's hardware - a big black grill with a small display on one side. SCHERZINGER: That screen will tell you the temperature of the grill itself. It'll tell you the temperature of each probe that you're using. So in this case there's a probe going into this brisket, and you'd read that on the screen. BOND: It's lunchtime, and the air is filled with the smoky smells of brisket and chicken being grilled for tacos. The smart grill syncs up to Weber's new smartphone app, Weber Connect. You open the app and pick the meat you want to cook. The app tells you the right seasoning, when to flip it, when it's done. A lot of the companies that showed up at CES this year make products that are hardly known for technology - grills, toilets, mattresses. So why does every product today need to be smart or connected? Some people here at CES tell me it's about using technology to free ourselves from technology. JONATHAN BRADLEY: Eighty percent of consumers bring a phone into the bathroom. We're trying to reverse that a little. BOND: Jonathan Bradley is a product manager at Kohler, which makes bathroom fixtures. BRADLEY: We want the bathroom to stay a place of rest, relaxation, calm and recharging and only have technology when you actually need it. BOND: At CES the company is showing off its new showerhead, Moxie. It has a removable, waterproof speaker right in the middle where the water comes out. You operate it through Amazon's Alexa voice assistant or your phone's Bluetooth connection. Moxie joins other tech-ified (ph) fixtures in Kohler's Konnect line. There's a mirror you can ask to brighten or lower the light or play your favorite radio station. The mirror can even tell the shower to turn on and off, at least when the Wi-Fi at CES cooperates. BRADLEY: Alexa, ask Konnect to start my shower. ALEXA: Sorry, something went wrong. Please try again. BRADLEY: Oh, here we go. BOND: Can I try turning it off? BRADLEY: Yeah. BOND: Alexa, ask Konnect to stop my shower. ALEXA: Turning off shower. BOND: Kohler is not the only company I run into that thinks technology can save us from our bad tech habits. At another booth, there's a line to try out Muse. It's a headband that gives voice-guided meditations. The sounds you hear change depending on your brain activity, heart rate and breathing. Co-founder Ariel Garten says using her product to meditate has given her some distance from her smartphone. ARIEL GARTEN: I can sit with a little bit of discomfort of wanting to check my phone and say, nope, it's OK. Move my mind away, onto something that matters to me. So it's a little bit ironic that we're using technology to disconnect from technology, but it really works. BOND: It sounds tempting, but the line is long and other gadgets beckon.

That is how one Boeing employee described the development of the company's troubled 737 Max aircraft. It's just one of a number of remarkable comments made in internal documents and emails that have now been made public. NPR's David Schaper has been reading these documents and joins us. Hi, David. DAVID SCHAPER, BYLINE: Hi, David. GREENE: So we should say these documents you've been looking at date before the grounding of this kind of plane, you know, after the two deadly crashes. But I mean, as you go through it, what stands out? SCHAPER: Well, you know, one thing that strikes me is the level of effort made by some Boeing officials and employees to deceive regulators and Boeing's customers. These would be the airlines who would fly the 737 Max in order to keep pilot training on what was essentially a new plane to a minimum and keep regulators from requiring what would be expensive and time-consuming simulator training for pilots. One says, quote, \"I just Jedi mind-tricked these fools. \" This is the chief technical pilot in one exchange. I should be given $1,000 every time I take one of these calls. I save this company a sick amount of money. And he talks about he'll make them feel stupid if they try to require any additional training for pilots. Another message by that same chief technical pilot seems somewhat remorseful. I still haven't been forgiven by God for the covering-up I did last year, referring to how they misled the FAA. And they're just dismissive, at times, of regulators and even ridicule them and, sometimes, ridicule their own colleagues. One of the other things that kind of stands out to me is how - that there are some employees who are trying to do the right thing, complaining about safety problems, complaining about the culture that prioritizes cost savings and the schedule over safety, yet they seem to be in the minority. One says the company has created a culture of good enough, which is an incredibly low bar. In one message - another message, these employees are concerned about the safety of the 737 Max. This is before the plane was even approved to fly passengers. He says, would you put your family on a Max simulator-trained aircraft? I wouldn't. And then the other employee responds, no. GREENE: Wow. I mean, an employee saying they would not put their own family on an aircraft totally undermines any confidence in this aircraft. What is Boeing saying? I mean, they had to know it was in here, obviously, because they released this stuff. SCHAPER: Well, you know, a Boeing official said that these communications were written by a small number of employees, primarily Boeing technical pilots and other personnel who were involved in the development and certification of the 737 Max, and also those who participated in simulator sessions. Now, some of these are the same employees who were sending other damaging emails and internal messages that had already been disclosed last year. But the company official is saying that the language that they use, the sentiments expressed in these communications are completely inconsistent with Boeing values, and the company is taking appropriate action, and they're just - the messages, though, speak to a broader culture and a broader problem that doesn't seem like the company responded in the right way. GREENE: And, of course, all this happening as a new CEO comes in and takes over. A lot to deal with. SCHAPER: Right. A new CEO's coming in on Monday and will have to tackle all of these problems head-on. GREENE: NPR's David Schaper covering that story from Chicago this morning. Thanks, as always, David.

This week, the Trump administration outlined its AI policy in a draft memo which encouraged federal agencies to, quote, \"avoid regulatory or non-regulatory actions that needlessly hamper AI innovation and growth,\" unquote. And at the Consumer Electronics Show, the annual technology showcase, U. S. Chief Technology Officer Michael Kratsios elaborated on the administration's approach, warning that overregulation could stifle industries. But this stance comes as companies are announcing some boundary pushing uses for AI, including to create composite images of fake people and to conduct background checks. And those uses are raising ethical issues. So to hear more about this, we've called Drew Harwell. He covers artificial intelligence for The Washington Post. He's with us now. Drew, welcome. Thanks so much for joining us. DREW HARWELL: Thanks for having me. MARTIN: So let's start with these recent developments in AI that you wrote about. You wrote about a new technology that generates photos of fake people. What is this, and how does it work? HARWELL: So, pretty much, you can put in a lot of images of real people into the machine, and out it spits lots of computer-generated portraits that look really deceptively like the real thing. What this company is doing is selling those fake images to advertisers. The sales pitch they're making to companies is, hey, you want to check the diversity box. So come to us. Click a little checkbox, and you can say, I want all faces of older Asian people or young white people or middle-aged black people, and out it spits whatever you want. But that's not real diversity, right? And so maybe they have good intentions, but this is sort of checkbox inclusion. It's not real. And what we found, too, is, you know, these creations are modeled after a certain sort of limited number of faces. It's just kind of mimicking what it's seen before. MARTIN: The other concern that some of the critics raised, which is that this makes it even easier for these - somebody to create false scenarios which people can't distinguish from real ones. This has been something that people have been very concerned, that this is the kind of technology that's going to be used to create false scenarios that then real people will be grafted into, people won't be able to tell the difference. When you talk to the company about this, what do they say? HARWELL: The companies kind of recognize that that's an issue. They understand that that's potentially corrosive to truth online and how we understand reality. But from their standpoint, it's not their problem. They feel like the real regulation from this should come from the government, somebody bigger than them to actually impose some law on the whole industry, not just one company at a time. But maybe there is something they could do. I mean, I've talked to a lot of AI researchers who say, what's to stop a company from this - putting like a watermark or a timestamp, some sort of signature so that people could understand that what they're looking at is not totally real? But right now, it's still the Wild West. And these companies can, without any real regulation, do whatever they want. MARTIN: Speaking of Wild West scenarios, I mean, Airbnb maybe has a patent for a new tool which uses AI to assess potential guests based on social media posts and criminal record and other sort of information that is available or may be available on social media. Can you tell us a little bit more about that, and what are the ethical concerns that this is raising? HARWELL: Yeah. So it's important for Airbnb to know that the customers who are renting homes from people are not a danger. And so their big idea was we can create an AI that processes everything we can find about a person that's online. And we can design the system that can figure, out in the patent's words, how Machiavellian is this person? Is this person a potential psychopath? You know, the dream being that they could create this psychographic profile of a person that could then sort of separate the good people from the bad. Think about what's online about any one of us right now. It's a really incomplete portrait. And to think that a computer would start making these judgments about the complicated inner lives that we all lead, it's just kind of a scary proposition. MARTIN: So let's talk a little bit about this whole question of regulation. As we mentioned, the Trump administration released a draft memo on this issue. In it, they wrote that, quote, where AI entails risk, agencies should consider the potential benefits and cost of employing AI when compared to the systems that AI has been designed to complement or replace. So that doesn't sound as though they're trying to impose any sort of external rules on this. I mean, given that you cover this field, what - you know, what do you say about that? HARWELL: There's a few competing dynamics. One is that the U. S. doesn't want to be, quote-unquote, \"beat\" in the AI arms race by China. China is an extremely sophisticated force in developing artificial intelligence around the world. And there's a fear among American industry that they could get left behind. But, you know, from others in civil society, the fear is that if you don't actually impose laws on these things before they become more widespread, that's a real danger. And these are not sort of fantastical sci-fi systems that aren't in people's lives right now. I mean, AI is in the facial recognition that's used to arrest people that the police and the FBI are using right now. It's creating fake videos. Whenever we search or get a recommendation on Spotify or Netflix, all of that is AI. So to think about, you know, a government saying, we're going to sort of stand back and let the industry figure this one out, it's a little alarming. MARTIN: Before we let you go, is there any discussion within the industry about surfacing these ethical issues beyond the company itself? HARWELL: Yeah. You're starting to hear that. The big giants like Amazon and Microsoft are starting to say - around facial recognition specifically - this is a powerful technology, and we don't want to be the ones to decide the rules of the road. It's just too important. So you are seeing sort of a bigger kind of push to establish a framework for AI ethics and AI laws. But every company is different, right? And every company has their own sort of incentives to go for the laws that would benefit them and potentially undermine their competition. So without a general consensus, it's just sort of, you know, every man for himself. MARTIN: That was Drew Harwell. He's a reporter covering AI for The Washington Post. Drew Harwell, thanks so much for talking to us. HARWELL: Thank you. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  We're going to spend the next few minutes talking about developments in artificial intelligence or AI.

Apple is resisting this. And now the attorney general is complaining that Apple is not doing enough to help law enforcement in its investigation. This is just the latest in an ongoing fight between the U. S. government and tech companies over how to balance privacy with public safety. We have NPR's technology correspondent Shannon Bond with us. Hi, Shannon. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Hey, David. GREENE: What exactly is the government asking Apple to do here? BOND: Well, the FBI has two iPhones that belonged to the gunman in Pensacola, who was a Saudi air force cadet. And law enforcement has a court order to see who he was communicating with before the attack. But the phones are locked, and their contents are encrypted. So the government's asking Apple for help. But Apple has said for a long time, it won't unlock devices and break encryption. And that's frustrated the attorney general. Here's what William Barr said on Monday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)WILLIAM BARR: So far, Apple has not given any substantive assistance. This situation perfectly illustrates why it is critical that the public be able to get access to digital evidence once it has obtained a court order based on probable cause. GREENE: So what exactly is Apple's argument for not helping here? BOND: Well, Apple, first of all, is rejecting Barr's characterization. In a statement it put out on Monday, it said it's already turned over gigabytes of information to the government - things like iCloud backups and transactional data. GREENE: Oh, so they're saying they are helping (laughter). BOND: Right. But the FBI wants the communications on the phones. And Apple says to do that would require building a backdoor that would compromise the security of all iPhones. I spoke with Susan Landau, a professor of cybersecurity and policy at Tufts. And she says that kind of backdoor would make it easier for criminals to access personal, financial and health information. SUSAN LANDAU: The risks are that it becomes easier to open anybody else's phone. The whole reason Apple went to the model of making the data on the phone more secure is that hackers were taking data off the phone and then using it for identity theft. BOND: And that's pretty much what Apple said on Monday. It said, quote, \"there's no such thing as a backdoor just for the good guys. \"GREENE: This, I have to say, sounds familiar. I mean, aren't these the very issues that came up back in 2015 after that terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif. ? BOND: That's right. That was - this is pretty much a very similar conflict in play. In the San Bernardino case, the people might remember, the government actually sued Apple to force it to unlock the phone. Apple resisted, and there was a really tense standoff with the Obama administration. But the government wound up working with a third-party contractor to get into the phone. And since then, Apple has reportedly improved encryption and software to make its devices even more secure and harder to get into to now than they used to be then. GREENE: So how do these larger questions get resolved, if they do? BOND: Well, right. So first of all, experts say that, really, we need Congress to weigh in on the law. I spoke with Jim Baker. He was general counsel at the FBI during the San Bernardino case. And he says there's no easy solution to balance these questions. JIM BAKER: So what you have then is a situation where the country, through its elected representatives in Congress, needs to make a choice. Does it want to give law enforcement more access and create more cybersecurity risk, or does it want to do something different? BOND: The other place this could end up is back in court. And if the government gets a court order, then the question becomes, will Apple comply with it? GREENE: That's NPR's Shannon Bond, who covers technology for us. Thanks so much, Shannon.

And if the government gets a court order, then the question becomes, will Apple comply with it? GREENE: That's NPR's Shannon Bond, who covers technology for us. Thanks so much, Shannon.

A team from Stanford University has gotten one big step closer. NPR's Merrit Kennedy has the story.

The team that created it says it's the most advanced bird-inspired robot ever. It's a huge design challenge to mimic birds in flight. The way their wings move is far superior to airplane wings, says Stanford mechanical engineering professor David Lentink. DAVID LENTINK: It actually enables birds to fly further, longer, maneuver much better. KENNEDY: Lentink led a team that studied the unique mechanics of birds' wings so they could incorporate these features into a robot. Their research was published this week in Science and Science Robotics. They used pigeon cadavers to try to figure out how birds control the motion of their feathers during flight. The researchers discovered that when they moved to the bird's wrist and finger. . . LENTINK: All the feathers moved, too, and they do this automatically. And that's really cool. KENNEDY: They replicated this on the PigeonBot using pigeon feathers, springs and rubber bands connected to a wrist-and-finger structure. The design was put to the test in a wind tunnel. (SOUNDBITE OF WIND BLOWING)KENNEDY: And it turned out to be extremely robust. The team also found that most birds' feathers can act sort of like Velcro. At certain moments during flight, such as when a bird is extending its wings, tiny hooks on the feathers lock them together to prevent gaps from forming. LENTINK: It requires a gigantic force to separate them. KENNEDY: And when the feathers unlock, it sounds like this. (SOUNDBITE OF VELCRO RIPPING)ALIREZA RAMEZANI: The work is very impressive.

This past week, an election security expert said he found evidence the server was tampered with in 2014. The allegation was contained in an affidavit filed as part of a lawsuit brought by election integrity activists seeking to bar Georgia from using its paperless voting machines. Marilyn Marks is the executive director of the Coalition for Good Governance, one of the nonprofit groups behind the lawsuit. We talked about the implications of a breach of the election server. MARILYN MARKS: The reason this is so concerning is because while it appears that the malicious attacker got in in 2014, they could have clearly stayed in quite a long time. This server was not shut down until the end of 2017. But the records that were on that server - and these would be millions of records. This would have been the hub for all of Georgia's elections. Those millions of records could have been, certainly, infiltrated. And then as copies of those records were removed from the server to put on new applications, they could have carried with them malicious code. There is still quite a lot we don't know. But there is no reason to believe that anything that an attacker did in 2014 and beyond is not still present in the system. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Could these malicious actors have actually changed people's votes? MARKS: Unfortunately, yes. The reason is that on this central server, it was the mothership. It was the hub of all things elections in Georgia. And every single one of the 30,000 voting machines that are used in Georgia was programmed from that central server. So yes, they could've changed votes. Do we have any evidence of that? Not at this point. We will certainly be wanting to find out. GARCIA-NAVARRO: This sounds like an enormously problematic breach. Who was responsible for the server's security? MARKS: The secretary of state's office has run that particular operation. It's called Center for Election Systems. At the time of the breach, it was located at Kennesaw State University. It was operated as a little satellite organization that was really under the control of the secretary of state's office. After the breach and then after an explosive event when we sued them and then they deleted all of their files, then there was such a public outcry that that contract was canceled, and all of the work was moved back to the secretary of state's office but under the direction of the same managers. GARCIA-NAVARRO: What does this mean for the 2020 presidential election? How can Georgia audit its vote if it needs to? MARKS: Lulu, it cannot. And it's not just the presidential election that's at risk because Georgia programs every single machine centrally. It is the U. S. senatorial elections - and as you know, Georgia has two senators up in the election this year - mayors, county commissioners and then all the way up to the presidential office. None of those elections will be able to be audited. The secretary of state has chosen a new system. They've spent over a hundred million dollars on it. It is absolutely as vulnerable, if not more vulnerable, according to many experts, than the old system that we're talking about. So not only could the old malware have been transferred into the new system in various places, but the fact that it cannot be audited is really troublesome. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So you're saying, bottom line is that Georgians can't be confident about their vote in 2020 unless some things change. What are those things? MARKS: What needs to change is really simple, Lulu. What needs to change is that paper ballots marked by hand by all those who are able have them counted using a optical scanner and then have audits done. The state should not be putting an electronic screen between the voter and the ballot. And then with an audit, they could be virtually 100% sure that the vote was what reflected the will of the people. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's Marilyn Marks, executive director of the Coalition for Good Governance. Thank you so much. MARKS: Thank you, Lulu.

A company in New Mexico is taking that seriously. It's setting up teenagers with older folks to teach them, and it turns out they are all learning something from each other. Megan Kamerick is a reporter with member station KUNM in Albuquerque. MEGAN KAMERICK, BYLINE: Seventy-six-year-old Camilla Dorcey is calling a friend on her smartphone - something that not long ago was beyond her. CAMILLA DORCEY: People would be ringing me and I didn't know how to answer it. I'd be crying and frustrated and feeling totally useless and old. KAMERICK: A retired teacher from Lesotho, Africa, Dorcey lived all over the world before moving to Albuquerque with her second husband. When he died suddenly, she was left alone and isolated, too ashamed to admit she didn't know how to answer her new phone. DORCEY: That's how I felt - stupid and dumb, and wishing I wasn't here, feeling I had lived far too long. KAMERICK: That kind of social isolation leaves seniors vulnerable to poor health and earlier death. It's also expensive. A study by AARP found isolation is associated with nearly $7 billion in additional spending by Medicare annually. Dorcey tried to get help at stores and failed. DORCEY: I hate that phrase - a child could do this, but they never gave me a child. KAMERICK: Dorcey is among the 4 in 10 seniors who own smartphones, according to a study by the Pew Research Center which also found seniors often lack confidence in learning and using them. Dorcey didn't find a child, but she did turn to a teenager who helped her download WhatsApp. Now she talks to family and friends regularly in Africa and Europe for free. DORCEY: Hey, Peter (ph). PETER: Hello, Camilla. DORCEY: Happy New Year to you. PETER: Happy New Year to you. DORCEY: Oh, it's amazing. I can see them. I can talk to them. It's really been great. I feel free again. KAMERICK: The teenager who helped Dorcey was Tess Reynolds, who's 17. She works for a small business called Teeniors that matches tech-savvy teens like her with seniors like Dorcey. Reynolds says she can relate to seniors because she has a learning disability, and people used to rush her when she was trying to do schoolwork. TESS REYNOLDS: So I know how it feels to be rushed, so I want to make sure that that doesn't happen. KAMERICK: It also convinced her she wants to become a senior home health aide. That mutual learning and support is what makes Teeniors successful, says founder Trish Lopez. TRISH LOPEZ: And that's why I always say the main service we provide is not tech support, it is human connection. KAMERICK: Her inspiration to launch the company in 2015 was her mom. Lopez always wished she could send someone to help when her mom called with technology problems. Teeniors has served more than 3,000 seniors around New Mexico, mostly in community centers like this one south of Albuquerque. KENDRA GONZALES: So then you would hit save. Right. LINDA HAVERTY: So now - oh, wonderful. Oh, there you are. KAMERICK: Kendra Gonzales, who's 21, joined Teeniors four years ago. It helped her land jobs and decide on a career in public service. She's working toward a criminal justice degree. Through Teeniors, she learned skills like public speaking and coaching. GONZALES: Things that I don't think the school system helped me with. This has helped me more in a great way. KAMERICK: Teeniors founder Trish Lopez says participants gain tech skills, but also emotional intelligence, problem solving and communication abilities. Generations United, a Washington, D. C. -based organization, says variations of this model exist around the country. Executive director Donna Butts says, since America's older generation is disproportionately white compared to the younger population, there are real risks to age-based segregation. DONNA BUTTS: And that can be really, really harmful when we have generations that don't look like each other. They don't know each other, and they don't understand why they need to invest in each other. KAMERICK: She says intergenerational programs can overcome those barriers. That was certainly true for Camilla Dorcey. DORCEY: I think maybe Teeniors are seeing old people as not totally ready to be put in the grave. And for me, it's making me think teenagers should not all be in jail. We're beginning to see a connection between humans of a different age. KAMERICK: For NPR News, I'm Megan Kamerick in Albuquerque.

It also relies on proxy groups and hackers aligned with its goals. In the weeks since a U. S. airstrike killed the Iranian general Qassem Soleimani, nationalist hacktivists are suspected of defacing a U. S. government website with pro-Iran messages.

He's also the owner of The Washington Post. He is the world's richest person. And yet his phone is still got hacked. A new report accuses Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of being behind that hack. NPR tech correspondent Shannon Bond has the story. And we should note, Amazon is among NPR's financial supporters. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: In 2018, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman sent a WhatsApp message to Jeff Bezos. That message unleashed spyware into the Amazon CEO's phone. That's according to a forensic investigation of the phone, commissioned by Bezos. David Kaye reviewed the report. He's the United Nations special rapporteur on freedom of expression. DAVID KAYE: They had medium to high confidence that malware compromised the account of Jeff Bezos and that that malware was sent from a WhatsApp account that belonged to the crown prince of Saudi Arabia. BOND: Kaye and another U. N. human rights expert link the phone hacking to the Saudi regime's efforts to stifle critical reporting about Saudi Arabia by The Washington Post, which Bezos owns. In April 2018, Bezos met the crown prince at a dinner in Los Angeles and exchanged phone numbers. A month later, the CEO received an encrypted video in a WhatsApp message from the prince's account. Hours after receiving the video, Bezos' phone started sending out large amounts of data, according to the forensic report. In a tweet on Wednesday, Saudi Arabia called the report absurd and denied it was responsible for hacking Bezos' phone. But the U. N. 's Kaye says the report raises grave concerns. KAYE: The nature of the allegations and everything put together is, you know, certainly enough to raise these kinds of concerns and demand a response, you know, by the Saudis and independent investigation. BOND: Five months after Bezos' phone was hacked, Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, a fierce critic of the Saudi regime, was murdered. His death has been linked to the crown prince. Saudi Arabia has been accused of using digital spyware to go after critics. MIKE CHAPPLE: So the attack against Jeff Bezos is consistent with a pattern of high-tech surveillance efforts that were waged in support of Saudi interests. BOND: Mike Chapple is a former computer scientist at the National Security Agency who now teaches at the University of Notre Dame. In November, two former Twitter employees were charged by U. S. prosecutors with spying on dissidents' accounts for the Saudi government. Chapple and other security experts caution that the public needs more information to understand exactly what happened to Jeff Bezos. Meanwhile, Bezos himself has not commented on the latest twist in the hacking saga. On Wednesday, he tweeted a picture of himself at a memorial for Jamal Khashoggi with the hashtag Jamal.

This is about 1. 2 million voters we're talking about. And although there have been a few experiments like this here and there, this is going to be the first time in a U. S. election where all eligible voters are going to be able to vote on their smartphones. This is not only important for its own sake; this is taking place, of course, in the context of this intense national attention on the issue of election security. NPR's Miles Parks covers voting and is with me now. Good morning, Miles. MILES PARKS, BYLINE: Good morning. GREENE: So tell us about the decision to do this in King County, Wash. , using a smartphone. PARKS: So the decision is really based on increasing turnout. That's the bottom line here. And I should be clear - this is not going to be used in the presidential primary or the presidential election this year. This is a pilot program that is focused around a board of supervisors election for the King Conservation District. Now, if you have not heard of this, this is an environmental - small environmental agency in Washington that a lot of voters in King County also have not heard of. There were less than 4,000 votes cast in a similar election last year in a 1. 2 million person district. That's less than half of 1% of the eligible population voted in the similar election last year. So officials there looked around one, wanted to find a way to increase turnout and, you know, decided to go this smartphone option. GREENE: Oh, interesting. So, really, a central question of our democracy. Like, if voting becomes much easier, much more convenient, will many, many more people turn out? But I guess my question is if you don't want to use your smartphone, could you still go to a normal polling place if you want to in King County? PARKS: You can. You will still be able to vote through all the traditional means. This is just kind of added on top of that. How this is going to work for the voters who do want to use it, though, is they'll be able to basically use a Web portal through the Internet browser on their smartphone or tablet, and they'll log in using their full name and their date of birth. Once they're logged in, they'll get a ballot. They'll fill it out, then be taken to a signature page. They'll sign their name using the touch screen, send it off to the board of elections. The King County Elections Office will then verify the signature. If the signature matches the signature they have on file, then they'll then print out the ballot, and it'll be counted on paper alongside the other paper ballots people have mailed in or turned in. GREENE: I mean, Miles, you've covered this stuff. I'm sure you've spent hours talking to cybersecurity, election security experts and specialists. I just think about the Russian attack on the 2016 election. I mean, are they freaked out by this idea? PARKS: Yeah, it's actually really hard to find cybersecurity experts, who are not in some way tied to this plan, who are super supportive. The Senate Intelligence Committee just last year, in their Russian interference report, said explicitly that states should resist the push for mobile voting. On a whole, there's sort of a spectrum. Some cybersecurity experts say at some point, mobile voting may be OK; the technology just isn't there yet. And then there's this whole other portion of experts who say, no, never; democracy should never be this tied to the Internet. I talked to Duncan Buell, who's a computer scientist at the University of South Carolina. He's pretty pessimistic overall about the security, but he still says that he expects mobile voting options to expand in the coming years. DUNCAN BUELL: Until we have a total collapse of some election, I think this sort of thing is going to continue because people want to believe that, you know, they can do everything on their phones. PARKS: Buell said the companies developing this sort of mobile technology are, quote, \"trying to make sure that all the votes from Tehran, Moscow and Beijing get counted properly,\" if that gives you an idea of how he feels about the security. GREENE: Yeah, it sure does. Well, I mean, we should say again - this is not a first-first, what's happening in King County, Wash. I mean, there have been other tries at mobile voting. What else is happening around the country? PARKS: Right. So previously, these pilots - which have all been funded by a single organization that's kind of aimed at expanding this sort of voting in the U. S. - they've focused on populations that have traditionally had trouble getting access to the polls. In the 2018 midterms, West Virginia allowed its military and overseas voters to vote using a mobile app, and a county in Utah is doing the same thing for disabled voters. So the organization that's leading this is Tusk Philanthropies. They say they want to fund 35 to 50 more pilots over the coming five years and then, basically, use the data from those pilots to continue to push for more expansion. We'll see if that happens.

Yesterday, I asked Shelby Pierson. She is the first ever intelligence community election threats executive. She was appointed by then-Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats in July of 2019. Her job is to work with intelligence agencies like the CIA, the FBI, the NSA and the Department of Homeland Security to identify and fight actors that are trying to interfere with our voting process. SHELBY PIERSON: The Russians, for example, are already engaging in influence operations relative to candidates going into 2020. But we do not have evidence at this time that our adversaries are directly looking at interfering with vote counts or the vote tallies. KING: Is it fair to say we don't know what Russia is going to do yet? PIERSON: I think that is a fair characterization. And I would also say that this isn't a Russia-only problem. We're still also concerned about China, Iran, non-state actors, hacktivists and frankly - certainly for DHS and FBI - even Americans that might be looking to undermine confidence in the elections. KING: After Russia interfered in the 2016 election, there was this push for transparency about attempts to influence our elections. Pierson told me she's walking a line between not wanting to frighten people, but also wanting to keep them informed. PIERSON: Transparency enables resilience. And sunlight is the best disinfectant. So the more that we talk about the threat, potentially more we empower voters to understand this as merely a reality of today's landscape - and that despite all of those challenges, we're managing them or countering them. And they should vote. KING: You are constantly doing the calculus on this. . . PIERSON: Absolutely. KING: . . . You are constantly trying to figure out, is it worth saying it now? Is it worth waiting and seeing how much of a threat it is? PIERSON: Absolutely. KING: Would you say that's a daily occurrence? PIERSON: The challenge for us is that for anyone who has any tenure in the intelligence community, we're in the business of threats. . . KING: Sure. Sure. PIERSON: . . . So we're seeing information day in and day out. And I think the challenge is, to your point, when does that mature enough to the point where it's either actionable, where the target can take meaningful countermeasures so that it is stopped in its tracks, so to speak - all the way to are we going to reveal this because it'll help raise awareness and sensitize people? KING: This sounds like a very difficult balancing act. The U. S. intelligence community agrees that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to benefit President Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton. President Trump has openly joked about Russia interfering in the 2016 election. In fact, he appeared to joke with Vladimir Putin about it. At times, he doesn't appear to take this threat seriously. That has to make your job harder. PIERSON: We are looking at the spectrum of information that comes into us day in and day out to enable all the missions. And that can continue, frankly, unencumbered by any of the comments or political discourse that you hear globally about this topic. I will say that the intelligence community has the authorities it needs. It has the resources it needs. And when we have needed the president to relay warnings - for example, most recently to Mr. Lavrov in Russia - he has done so. KING: Sergey Lavrov? PIERSON: Yes. KING: Would you just explain what you mean there, if you would? PIERSON: Sure. I think the interagency process, not just the intelligence community, has strongly encouraged leaders - whether that includes President Trump or Secretary of State Pompeo or Secretary of Defense Mr. Esper - to relay information to our international colleagues that interfering in the U. S. elections is unacceptable to the United States. And that type of messaging is very important in terms of ensuring the global cognizance that this is activity that will not be tolerated in any way, shape or form. KING: You don't feel yourself having to work around President Trump? PIERSON: Not at all. KING: Here are some things that we're learning now. Last week, a private American company, Area 1 Security, reported that it had discovered that Russia had successfully compromised a Ukrainian energy conglomerate, which includes Burisma, the company at the center of the impeachment. This is a private company saying it detected interference in Ukraine, which could indicate interference in the U. S. election. The method by which Russia interfered with this conglomerate was the same thing that they did in 2016 to us. Why was it not the U. S. government that told us about what happened, about Russia hacking Burisma? PIERSON: I think this is a really important point, because frankly there is a whole consortium of players in this landscape, which include private security firms and, in fact, not just international infrastructure organizations like Burisma, but frankly even some of our state and local elections. Their cybersecurity comes from private security firms. So those organizations will actually have deeper and technical insight into those networks before the intelligence community will. KING: These private companies, do they share information with the U. S. intelligence community? PIERSON: Well, I think many of these firms, particularly larger ones, will sell reports based upon the information that they have access to. And some of that's very important to complement the holdings that we have in the intelligence community. KING: Are you saying those private security companies are also selling intelligence to the United States government? PIERSON: Yes. They can sell their services. And some of the most common firms - FireEye and CrowdStrike. And, in fact, I think those two firms, for example, have done really good work where, based upon the analysis and expertise and information analysis that they do resident within those firms, those are products and services that they can sell to the U. S. government. KING: I am surprised to hear that private companies are selling information to the U. S. intelligence community, information that the U. S. intelligence community itself does not have. Am I being naive? PIERSON: Well, it's not necessarily naivete. I think it really needs to be an open discussion about, why is the landscape the way it is? And frankly, I think many Americans might have concerns about the U. S. federal government or Big Brother having technical access to a full spectrum of networks. I think there really needs to be an open debate about that before people presume that the intelligence community should have a presence on everyone's network. KING: Do you see that debate happening? PIERSON: I think it's one that's burgeoning, certainly, because sometimes, Noel, I feel that the intelligence community is held accountable for a lot of information that it's not necessarily - doesn't have access to or isn't part of its mission and purview. KING: We know that Americans are spreading misinformation. Sometimes they're doing it deliberately, sometimes they're not at all doing it deliberately. It can be a post on social media that we don't know is fake. Is that a bigger threat to the election than foreign interference? PIERSON: Well, I think there's two aspects of that. You know, let's be very clear that of course the federal government encourages and wants as broad and free speech as possible. That is a principle of our country, and it's probably one of the most valuable cornerstones of our society. So we want people to engage in public exchange, political exchange and to have that freedom unfettered from foreign interference. But at the same time, I think we also want to make sure that if we or the firms involved are aware that this information is foreign-sponsored and is covert in terms of its sponsorship to the user, we want to do everything we can to manage that information. KING: You say that the American public needs to be cognizant that misinformation is out there. We also know that Americans increasingly live in very partisan spaces, that much of the media that they are looking at takes one position or another. Is there anything at all that you can do to deal with the fact that, more than ever, we are a bifurcated nation, we are people who believe different things? PIERSON: I would ask that all press outlets be introspective about their role, frankly, in civil society in terms of journalistic ethics and where they fit into providing nonpartisan information, factually-based information. And I think that's part of this issue that the intelligence community doesn't necessarily have a direct role in this, but I think we're trying to raise cognizance and awareness across all of these constituencies that we all, frankly, have a role, in a variety of capacities, in countering this threat. KING: What about the president of the United States making false or misleading statements? PIERSON: Well, I think the challenge is whether or not that's being promulgated or deliberately fomented by a foreign intelligence service or a foreign government. And I think that's the type of information that if we have holdings within the intelligence community, we're going to certainly look to share that information as broadly as needed to stop it. KING: It sounds like what you're saying is if the president says something false, other countries can use that to their advantage. PIERSON: I think the challenge for us is not necessarily the accuracy of an individual statement, but as I mentioned, this issue of whether or not an intelligence service, a foreign government is using it for manipulative purposes, particularly purposes that are covert, here in the United States. And that's where we want to step in. KING: Shelby Pierson, intelligence community election threats executive. Ms. Pierson, thank you so much for coming in. PIERSON: Thank you for having me.

And frankly, I think many Americans might have concerns about the U. S. federal government or Big Brother having technical access to a full spectrum of networks. I think there really needs to be an open debate about that before people presume that the intelligence community should have a presence on everyone's network. KING: Do you see that debate happening? PIERSON: I think it's one that's burgeoning, certainly, because sometimes, Noel, I feel that the intelligence community is held accountable for a lot of information that it's not necessarily - doesn't have access to or isn't part of its mission and purview. KING: We know that Americans are spreading misinformation. Sometimes they're doing it deliberately, sometimes they're not at all doing it deliberately. It can be a post on social media that we don't know is fake. Is that a bigger threat to the election than foreign interference? PIERSON: Well, I think there's two aspects of that. You know, let's be very clear that of course the federal government encourages and wants as broad and free speech as possible. That is a principle of our country, and it's probably one of the most valuable cornerstones of our society. So we want people to engage in public exchange, political exchange and to have that freedom unfettered from foreign interference. But at the same time, I think we also want to make sure that if we or the firms involved are aware that this information is foreign-sponsored and is covert in terms of its sponsorship to the user, we want to do everything we can to manage that information. KING: You say that the American public needs to be cognizant that misinformation is out there. We also know that Americans increasingly live in very partisan spaces, that much of the media that they are looking at takes one position or another. Is there anything at all that you can do to deal with the fact that, more than ever, we are a bifurcated nation, we are people who believe different things? PIERSON: I would ask that all press outlets be introspective about their role, frankly, in civil society in terms of journalistic ethics and where they fit into providing nonpartisan information, factually-based information. And I think that's part of this issue that the intelligence community doesn't necessarily have a direct role in this, but I think we're trying to raise cognizance and awareness across all of these constituencies that we all, frankly, have a role, in a variety of capacities, in countering this threat. KING: What about the president of the United States making false or misleading statements? PIERSON: Well, I think the challenge is whether or not that's being promulgated or deliberately fomented by a foreign intelligence service or a foreign government. And I think that's the type of information that if we have holdings within the intelligence community, we're going to certainly look to share that information as broadly as needed to stop it. KING: It sounds like what you're saying is if the president says something false, other countries can use that to their advantage. PIERSON: I think the challenge for us is not necessarily the accuracy of an individual statement, but as I mentioned, this issue of whether or not an intelligence service, a foreign government is using it for manipulative purposes, particularly purposes that are covert, here in the United States. And that's where we want to step in. KING: Shelby Pierson, intelligence community election threats executive. Ms. Pierson, thank you so much for coming in.

Private cybersecurity firms are sounding the alarm. These firms, in some cases, are selling their work to the U. S. Intelligence Community. NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre has our story. GREG MYRE, BYLINE: Russia still gets most of the attention, but cybersecurity firms say they're also monitoring Iran's online shenanigans. Sandra Joyce is the head of global intelligence at FireEye. SANDRA JOYCE: We've seen Iran doing this, where they have been impersonating political candidates. MYRE: And there's more. JOYCE: They've even fabricated letters that look like they're coming from concerned citizens. They get themselves published in newspapers, well-known newspapers. But they're influence operators from Iran. They're not concerned citizens from Texas. MYRE: In many recent cases, cybersecurity companies and research groups are providing the details on these foreign actors and not the U. S. government. Graham Brookie runs a digital research lab at the Atlantic Council in Washington. GRAHAM BROOKIE: The government doesn't have a monopoly on tracking, identifying, exposing some of these vulnerabilities because of the way that the threat is evolving. The threat's becoming more diffuse, more complex and, in some ways, more open. MYRE: The U. S. government says it welcomes help from tech companies. Shelby Pierson works for the acting director of national intelligence. She's in charge of coordinating election security across the intelligence community.

That's the Ukrainian gas company where Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden used to be on the board. This raised suspicions that the Russians are looking for dirt on the Bidens. Area 1 has received a lot of media attention for this report, which is good for the company. However, the tight-lipped U. S. Intelligence Community hasn't offered its own assessment. So does the government agree, disagree or just prefer to remain silent? BROOKIE: Of course, these topics are news and newsworthy. MYRE: Graham Brookie at the Atlantic Council says we're going to see a wide range of opinions on how much public attention a potential threat should receive.

Malicious code was supposedly hidden inside a message sent to Bezos from the prince's WhatsApp account. Now, we should say we don't yet know for sure how Bezos' phone got hacked. And Saudi Arabia denies it. But all of this got us thinking, if Jeff Bezos can't keep his phone safe, can the rest of us? We're joined now by NPR's Chris Arnold to answer that question. Hi. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: Hey, Lulu. GARCIA-NAVARRO: All right. You and I presumably don't have security as good as Jeff Bezos. What can we do? ARNOLD: Right. There are good things, I'm sure, about being Jeff Bezos. GARCIA-NAVARRO: (Laughter). ARNOLD: A bad thing about being Jeff Bezos, though, is that people with a lot of money and resources are trying to hack his phone. But the good news is the rest of us - we probably do not have to worry about a super sophisticated, expensive, targeted hack. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Something tells me there's some not-so-good news for us who are not Jeff Bezos world. ARNOLD: Yeah. The hackers are using more generic, low-cost malware against us. The good thing about that, though, is that, even if some of that gets into your phone, phone security is getting better. And it's very unlikely that that's going to let the hackers, like, open up all your apps and, like - ooh. Here, I'll open the banking app and get the account number - all this stuff. And here's why. I talked to Matthew Green, a computer science professor at Johns Hopkins. MATTHEW GREEN: Every single app you have runs in what's called a sandbox. Basically, it's isolated from all the other apps on the phone. So even if there's a bug in one app - yes, it's possible that that could lead to something bad, some malware being installed that affects that app. But generally speaking, it won't spread throughout your phone. And so that's kind of the protection that phones have added to make these hacks much more difficult. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So that sandbox sounds good, right? But don't hackers always find some new vulnerability that they're going to exploit? ARNOLD: Yeah. That's always possible. And here's also a big and important safety tip from Green, so you don't make that too easy for them. He says some people do what's called jailbreaking their phones. And you could do that to, like, install games that you can't get at the regular App Store. And if you jailbreak your phone, a lot of these good protections disappear. And so it's, like, you're taking off your digital armor and leaving yourself wide open to attack. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So do not jailbreak your phone is what you're saying here. ARNOLD: Don't do it. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Don't do it. ARNOLD: Don't jailbreak your phone. GARCIA-NAVARRO: (Laughter). All right. Let's talk about this thing called SIM swapping. It sounds scary. What is that? ARNOLD: All right. The short version of that is the bad guys trick the phone company to transfer your phone number from your phone to a phone that they have. And then once they get that, they can get your passwords reset by getting that little six-digit thing - gets zapped to their phone. And then they're like, oh, here we go. Reset the password. And pretty soon, they're in all your bank accounts and everything. They steal a lot of money. We spoke to Samy Tarazi. He's an investigator with the Santa Clara County District Attorney's Office. Here's what he said. GREEN: So we highly recommend that people not use their cellphone number as a form of verification of identity. And then there's alternative two-factor authentication methods that are free. ARNOLD: Or you can use the security questions. But this is interesting. He says make up fictional answers that you'll remember so that people can't research the answers to those questions. Well, the bottom line in all this is, you know, whether it's a phone hack or something else, our personal data can get stolen in all kinds of ways. We have to be vigilant. And Tarazi says, look. You put a credit freeze to block anybody from opening new credit cards, new accounts in your name. That's always a good idea. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Indeed. All right. That's NPR's Chris Arnold breaking it down. Thank you so much. ARNOLD: You're welcome.

Which North American city saw the biggest growth in technology jobs over the past five years? Wasn't San Francisco. Wasn't Seattle. Not even New York. The correct answer is Toronto - North American city. The tech industry across Canada is booming, and one of the biggest reasons is immigration policy in the United States. NPR's Joel Rose reports. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: Hundreds of tech workers pack an auditorium for a networking event in downtown Toronto recently as the evening's emcee glides around the room on a hoverboard. JASON GOLDLIST: All right, ladies and gentlemen, welcome, welcome, welcome. ROSE: Jason Goldlist is equal parts tech bro and game show host. He's a co-founder of TechToronto, an organization that helps newcomers navigate the city's fast-growing tech scene. GOLDLIST: Who here is new to Canada? Can we have a show of hands? ROSE: Dozens of hands shoot up in the air. GOLDLIST: Unbelievable. ROSE: Goldlist slides his hoverboard over to one of them. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: I'm a newcomer in Canada. GOLDLIST: Where are you joining us from? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Brazil. GOLDLIST: Hey, I love it. When did you arrive here in Canada? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Three months ago. GOLDLIST: Three months ago. Here at TechTO, kicking it off. ROSE: If there is a war for global tech talent, right now, Canada is winning, and the U. S. may be losing its edge. The Trump administration has made it harder for high-skilled workers to get visas and blocked entrepreneurs from some majority-Muslim countries altogether. Canada, meanwhile, has been making it easier for tech workers to immigrate there. ALEX NORMAN: While the States has gone, let's make it difficult to get the employees here on a visa, Canada's gone the exact opposite, and it's beneficial to Canada. ROSE: Alex Norman is the other, more reserved co-founder of TechToronto. He says the Trump administration's policies are pushing tech workers away. NORMAN: There's a lot of people that New York or San Francisco or the States would've been the first call. Now, just because of uncertainty, has made places like Toronto more attractive and their first choice. ROSE: Meanwhile, U. S. tech companies say they can't get enough foreign workers and there aren't enough qualified candidates in the U. S. to fill all the open jobs. President Trump says he understands the problem. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE INGRAHAM ANGLE\")PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We have to allow smart people to stay in our country. ROSE: Here's Trump talking to \u200eLaura Ingraham on Fox News earlier this month. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE INGRAHAM ANGLE\")TRUMP: We don't have enough of them, and we have to be competitive with the rest of the world, too. ROSE: But global tech workers say the Trump administration's policies make the U. S. less welcoming - people like Ozge Yoluk, who started a new job in Toronto this month. Yoluk, who was born in Turkey, just finished a postdoc at the University of Maryland in Baltimore in computational biology. What's that? OZGE YOLUK: So what I describe it - it's like playing video games. ROSE: Except in these video games, the characters are proteins and experimental drugs. The company she joined is called ProteinQure, which is using tech to design new treatments. Pharmaceutical companies in the U. S. are doing similar work, but Yoluk says she didn't even bother applying for those jobs. YOLUK: Getting a visa in U. S. is not easy, and it's really costly not just for the companies, but also for the person itself. ROSE: High-skilled workers are getting rejected at a higher rate under the Trump administration. In 2015, 92% of new H-1B visa applications were approved. But in the last two years, the approval rate dipped to only 75%. This has made U. S. companies more reluctant to sponsor foreign workers and foreign workers more reluctant to go through the process, says Yoluk. YOLUK: I said, I will not waste my time applying for positions in the States. Whereas in Canada, the process was easy, and I had all the help I could get. ROSE: Yoluk says she got her Canadian visa approved in about two weeks. She didn't even need a lawyer to navigate the process. A few blocks away, I met Milad Zabihi at a coffee shop in downtown Toronto. MILAD ZABIHI: We are a bunch of, like, you know, friends from, like, you know, university time. We were thinking of, like, you know, starting something new. ROSE: Zabihi is the CEO of a startup called Peekage, which helps companies target customers. He immigrated to Canada from Iran. Several of the company's other co-founders are also Iranian. Zabihi says they wanted to locate in the U. S. , but then Trump's travel ban blocked most immigrants and visitors from Iran and several other Muslim-majority countries. ZABIHI: Everyone was like, OK, the U. S. is not an option, especially with, like, you know, what is happening right now with the new administration and Islam. So we were basically thinking of, like, what would be the best next option. ROSE: For a growing number of tech workers around the globe, that best next option is Canada. Joel Rose, NPR News, Toronto.

Yoluk, who was born in Turkey, just finished a postdoc at the University of Maryland in Baltimore in computational biology. What's that? OZGE YOLUK: So what I describe it - it's like playing video games. ROSE: Except in these video games, the characters are proteins and experimental drugs. The company she joined is called ProteinQure, which is using tech to design new treatments. Pharmaceutical companies in the U. S. are doing similar work, but Yoluk says she didn't even bother applying for those jobs. YOLUK: Getting a visa in U. S. is not easy, and it's really costly not just for the companies, but also for the person itself. ROSE: High-skilled workers are getting rejected at a higher rate under the Trump administration. In 2015, 92% of new H-1B visa applications were approved. But in the last two years, the approval rate dipped to only 75%. This has made U. S. companies more reluctant to sponsor foreign workers and foreign workers more reluctant to go through the process, says Yoluk. YOLUK: I said, I will not waste my time applying for positions in the States. Whereas in Canada, the process was easy, and I had all the help I could get. ROSE: Yoluk says she got her Canadian visa approved in about two weeks. She didn't even need a lawyer to navigate the process. A few blocks away, I met Milad Zabihi at a coffee shop in downtown Toronto. MILAD ZABIHI: We are a bunch of, like, you know, friends from, like, you know, university time. We were thinking of, like, you know, starting something new. ROSE: Zabihi is the CEO of a startup called Peekage, which helps companies target customers. He immigrated to Canada from Iran. Several of the company's other co-founders are also Iranian. Zabihi says they wanted to locate in the U. S. , but then Trump's travel ban blocked most immigrants and visitors from Iran and several other Muslim-majority countries. ZABIHI: Everyone was like, OK, the U. S. is not an option, especially with, like, you know, what is happening right now with the new administration and Islam. So we were basically thinking of, like, what would be the best next option. ROSE: For a growing number of tech workers around the globe, that best next option is Canada. Joel Rose, NPR News, Toronto.

So in 2020, campaigns are on the defense to prevent that kind of thing from happening again. Here's NPR technology correspondent Shannon Bond. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: During Senator Angus King's reelection campaign in 2018, the suspicious emails were coming from inside the building. LISA KAPLAN: We would send out these fake phishing emails and see who would click on them. BOND: Lisa Kaplan was digital director for the Maine senator. The emails she sent looked real, but they were not. KAPLAN: We would leave all of these little clues so that people should have picked up that it was not a real email. And we would try to get them to do things, like change their password for their email or change their password for the database we were using. BOND: It was a strategy to keep staff on their toes so they wouldn't fall for emails from real hackers intent on damaging the campaign. That's the kind of paranoia that election campaigns need these days. Many of them are already in full swing, from the Democratic presidential primaries to congressional races to local contests for mayor and city council. Security experts and political veterans say they are vulnerable. Communication, which is the lifeblood of any political campaign, can also be the thing that sinks it if messages get hacked or manipulated. Email and social media accounts can be taken over, sensitive or embarrassing documents leaked. The campaign trail in particular presents unique challenges to digital security. Mark Risher works on account security at Google. MARK RISHER: Campaigns are effectively startups, but their risk profile is more like established large businesses. BOND: Campaigns are created from the ground up. People move in and out of jobs quickly and bring in new phones and laptops. Mary Dickinson is co-founder of US CyberDome, a nonprofit offering campaigns free cybersecurity services. She says this rapid, often chaotic growth creates openings for hackers. MARY DICKINSON: You have almost every worst-case scenario. You can't really do effective training because you've got people coming on board all the time. You've got bring your own device as the norm. You've got used devices that are not scrubbed being brought into the food chain here. BOND: The most infamous hack of a campaign happened in 2016. Russians broke into the Gmail account of Hillary Clinton's campaign chair, John Podesta. Some of the emails that came out were embarrassing, like Clinton's speeches to Wall Street banks. The Russians got into Podesta's email through a phishing attack. That's when hackers send emails disguised to look like they're from someone you know or your bank. They try to trick you into handing over your passwords. Google's Risher explains. RISHER: The reality is that phishing, which is effectively just deceiving the target, the victim, into passing over information, is very, very cheap to perpetrate. And the target only has to make a mistake once. BOND: Nearly four years after the Clinton email hack, Risher says phishing attacks haven't changed much. RISHER: They haven't evolved because they haven't needed to. BOND: So what should campaigns do to get serious about security? First on the list is taking basic precautions. MICHAEL KAISER: Turning on multifactor authentication. BOND: Michael Kaiser is president of Defending Digital Campaigns, another nonprofit that connects campaigns with free and discounted cybersecurity services and training. KAISER: It's making sure that you're using, you know, better password practices like a password manager. It's using some form of encrypted communications. BOND: And Kaiser says it's not just candidates and staff who should be tightening up their online security. KAISER: So you have a spouse that could be vulnerable. You have children. You have the candidate's, you know, best friend who's also the finance chair. BOND: Those people have access to private information. And if they get hacked, their accounts can be used to target the candidate. Experts say the focus in 2020 is not just on reducing risk but on planning how to respond if a cyberattack happens. Otherwise candidates will be battling adversaries not only at the ballot box but in their inboxes, too. Shannon Bond, NPR News, San Francisco.

S. national security, one foreign company sets off alarm bells like no other - Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant. So Huawei scored a key victory, and the U. S. suffered a significant setback when the company received the green light to work on Britain's 5G cellular phone network. Here's NPR's Greg Myre. GREG MYRE, BYLINE: There was a time when choosing a company to build a phone network was a pretty routine bureaucratic decision - not anymore. PETER SINGER: This is a major loss for American national security foreign policy and technology policy. MYRE: That's Peter Singer of the New America think tank. He's talking about Britain's decision to allow Huawei to build up to 35% of the country's 5G phone network. Why a major loss? Let's start with national security. David Adelman was on the National Security Council under President Obama. He now runs an Internet research project at MIT. DAVID ADELMAN: The administration's case goes like this. They say, first, that Huawei equipment is generally less secure than its competitors'; second, that Chinese security services might find it irresistible to try to steal secrets and, third - and maybe most dramatically - that if there were ever a major conflict, that Beijing might use that access to remotely shut down critical systems. MYRE: Britain says it's worked with Huawei for years on its existing cellular system. It believes it can manage the risk by limiting Huawei to the periphery of the new network - things like base stations and antennas that mostly just pass on data - and keeping the company away from the more sensitive network core. This 5G network hasn't yet been built, and the U. S. hasn't yet given up. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is in Britain today and says he'll stress U. S. security concerns - again, David Adelman. ADELMAN: The real question here is whether we've crossed a particular Rubicon - whether by having this Chinese content in the underlying 5G network that, effectively, it's a decision that can't be reversed. MYRE: Which brings us to the second big issue - the global technology competition. For many in the West, China is viewed as a giant factory that puts together iPhones, yet now it's been cleared to help build a 5G network in Western Europe. 5G is being billed as revolutionary. Data will move at lightning speed. Driverless cars will communicate with each other. Doctors will perform surgery remotely. And China is at the forefront. BEAU WOODS: China is, today, a major player in the technology market. MYRE: Beau Woods is at the Atlantic Council. WOODS: It's a big win for China's prestige and also kind of puts other nations, other companies on notice that China is not just the packaging and assembly hub of the world anymore. MYRE: China's stated goal is to be a world leader in the most important technologies of the 21st century. To this end, the government supports Huawei and other tech companies in ways that Western countries don't. Dean Cheng is with the Heritage Foundation. When it comes to 5G, he says Huawei offers the complete package. DEAN CHENG: They offer, essentially, soup to nuts. MYRE: That's something Western firms can't match at this point. CHENG: That has a huge advantage in terms of the whole system is integrated. It, presumably, works well with each other. Also, it is significantly cheaper than any of the partial competitors out there. MYRE: All this makes it harder on the third big issue - U. S. foreign policy. The Trump administration has pressed U. S. allies to keep Chinese hardware out of their sensitive networks. The results have been mixed at best - again, Peter Singer. SINGER: You're not getting your closest intelligence partners on board. How can you expect to get the rest of Europe or Latin America or Africa? The thing to watch for is just the dominoes falling if all the other states that have been holding back saying, OK, if the Brits are going this way, now we can too. MYRE: Part of the answer came today. The European Union recommended limiting but not banning what it referred to as high-risk companies. Huawei said it welcomed the decision and hopes to be part of a fast, secure 5G network in Europe. Greg Myre, NPR News, Washington. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:  When it comes to U.

As early as this November, some voters will be casting ballots over the Internet. Proponents of online elections say technology can make it easier for more people to vote, while civil liberties advocates are warning that Puerto Rico's plan threatens election security and voting rights. NPR tech correspondent Shannon Bond has more. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Puerto Rico is overhauling the way it holds elections, and one big item is modernizing the way people vote. A bill that's expected to pass this week is pushing Internet voting. That's got some people on the island worried. MAYTE BAYOLO: Our main concern is that online voting is not secure. BOND: Mayte Bayolo is legislative attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union of Puerto Rico. BAYOLO: The right to vote isn't just the right to cast a ballot but also to have your vote count. BOND: Her concern is that the plan raises too many risks. BAYOLO: Online voting or even collecting electronic voting machines to a server or any sort of software online runs the risk of hacking and tampering of the vote. BOND: The Puerto Rico and national ACLUs are urging the territory's governor, Wanda Vazquez, to veto the bill. The proposed plan starts with giving absentee and early voters the option to vote online this year. That would extend to all voters in 2024. Puerto Rico had more than 2. 8 million registered voters in the last general election in 2016. In 2028, the electoral commission will decide whether the Internet will be the only way Puerto Ricans can vote. Cities, counties and states across the U. S. are experimenting with letting some people vote on smartphone apps, but none are as sweeping as Puerto Rico's proposal. BAYOLO: If this bill is approved, it will make Puerto Rico a true outlier. No state or territory trusts an entire electoral infrastructure to vulnerable technology like this one. BOND: It's unclear why Puerto Rico is ground zero for such a big change in voting. What we know is the bill is backed by the powerful president of Puerto Rico Senate, Thomas Rivera Schatz. He didn't respond to NPR's interview request. The text of the bill says the Internet would make voting easier and more accessible. Advocates of online voting say it means more people will vote because it's easier to cast a ballot on a smartphone or computer instead of going to the polls. BRADLEY TUSK: It's all about turnout. BOND: Bradley Tusk is founder of Tusk Philanthropies, which has funded a lot of the recent online voting pilot programs. He's not involved in Puerto Rico's plan. Tusk says that in the eight elections so far that have tested technology he's funded, turnout has doubled. TUSK: It's just basic in the same way that every other technology that removes friction tends do pretty well. BOND: On the other side of the debate, cybersecurity experts are largely skeptical of online voting, especially after the 2016 presidential election, when Russian hackers tried to get into state election systems. ALEX HALDERMAN: It should be just common sense that we want to keep ballots as far away from the Internet as we can. BOND: Alex Halderman is a computer science professor at the University of Michigan who studies election security. He says the technology just doesn't exist to make sure online votes won't be tampered with. HALDERMAN: We'd have to figure out how to protect server systems from extremely powerful attackers like hostile nation-states. We'd have to protect voters' own devices, their smartphones or PCs. BOND: The bill's critics also note that voter turnout is already high in Puerto Rico, where election day is a public holiday. Shannon Bond, NPR News. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:   In Puerto Rico, there is a push to shift voting entirely online in the next eight years. As early as this November, some voters will be casting ballots over the Internet. Proponents of online elections say technology can make it easier for more people to vote, while civil liberties advocates are warning that Puerto Rico's plan threatens election security and voting rights. NPR tech correspondent Shannon Bond has more. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Puerto Rico is overhauling the way it holds elections, and one big item is modernizing the way people vote. A bill that's expected to pass this week is pushing Internet voting. That's got some people on the island worried. MAYTE BAYOLO: Our main concern is that online voting is not secure. BOND: Mayte Bayolo is legislative attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union of Puerto Rico. BAYOLO: The right to vote isn't just the right to cast a ballot but also to have your vote count. BOND: Her concern is that the plan raises too many risks. BAYOLO: Online voting or even collecting electronic voting machines to a server or any sort of software online runs the risk of hacking and tampering of the vote.

Shadow is behind the smartphone app that caused reporting problems for Iowa Democratic Party caucuses.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)HOLLY CHRISTINE BROWN: I got access to the app on Friday evening. And we were just given access to the app and told, you know, play around in there a little bit. And that was about as much training as we got. CORNISH: Joining me via Skype to talk about cybersecurity and elections is Betsy Cooper with the Aspen Institute. Welcome to the program. BETSY COOPER: Thank you so much for having me. CORNISH: So what were the questions people had going in for the makers of this app, which - at first, I gather, people didn't even know who it was? COOPER: Right. So we were actually trying to investigate this in January, and we couldn't get any information whatsoever about who was making the app or how it had been tested. I think some of the questions were, will the app work? - clearly, not as expected. Do people know how to use it? Did they get adequate training in advance? Does it do the numerical calculations correctly? And then, of course, is it secure? Will it be susceptible to cyberattacks? CORNISH: We know that the Iowa state party has said, look. This isn't a hack. Is it too soon for them to say something like that? I mean, as someone who works in cybersecurity, what do you make of the explanation so far? COOPER: I mean, I would be quite skeptical of knowing for sure that there was no hack. I'm sure that they are investigating that deeply, and, you know, they may be able to identify the cause. We don't have that full information yet, but I do believe that there are lots of different reasons someone could try to access the app. It could be to collect information. It could be for intelligence-gathering. So it would be very hard to know at this early stage whether there was any unauthorized access on the back end. CORNISH: And we said for now, they're saying, look. We just had problems with how it was working. I don't know if you know anything about Shadow, but is there a scenario where this could have worked? COOPER: So I think that there's definitely the possibility of using online tools to enable and facilitate elections, but in this case, the testing wasn't sufficient. They clearly had not done sufficient testing to determine even that the numbers would be calculated correctly. And so the only thing that saves the situation is that they had paper backups ready in order to be able to actually verify the votes. This could have been an even bigger disaster if those paper backups were not available. CORNISH: Nevada says they are not going to use it for their caucuses. Does that make sense, I mean, for people to back away from this kind of technology altogether? COOPER: I don't think we should say never, but I do think in this particular case, Nevada is making a smart decision. Clearly, the app is not ready for prime time. And so let's only go through this once in this election cycle. CORNISH: In their apology, they also apologize for the uncertainty, quote, \"it's caused to candidates, their campaigns and Democratic caucus-goers. \" What else is on your mind regarding the 2020 elections? COOPER: Well, obviously, there are a number of states that don't have paper backups, and so that is deeply disconcerting, especially now that we've seen that it may not be just due to hacks that we should be concerned but just due to user error and not having the app set up correctly. I think we also need to be aware of sort of the cybersecurity ramifications more broadly in our elections. Clearly, there are lots of people who care deeply about influencing the way that our elections are working, and this is just a very early sign that it's not going to necessarily be smooth throughout the entire process.

There may be updates from this version not reflected here. ]JACOB GOLDSTEIN (HOST): Here is a thing you hear - I don't know - every single day. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: The world is changing faster than ever before. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: How about this? Boston researchers have developed a new supercomputer. They claim it can predict if a patient is about to die. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: The high-tech bridge will be equipped with nano-articulated technology. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: This week it's not cowboys versus aliens. It's humans versus robots. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: The world is changing faster than ever. What used to take decades is now taking years or even months. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: What you see right now is the illusion. . . SALLY HELM (HOST): And it is not only cheesy TV news. It is also cheesy podcasts. Here's one from 2015. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)GOLDSTEIN: When you add up all the jobs he thinks are going to be left, there will not be nearly enough to make up for the vast number of jobs that machines are going to take over. HELM: That was you, Jacob Goldstein? GOLDSTEIN: It was me on PLANET MONEY. And, you know, this is - I'm just stating the spirit of the times. You know, everybody says this. The world is changing faster than ever. HELM: And yet - and yet, there is one guy who does not say that - Robert Gordon. He is an economist. He knows an absurd amount about the history of technology. And last year, he came out with this big influential book. Paul Krugman, New York Times, called Gordon's predictions about the future shocking, said he makes a powerful case. GOLDSTEIN: Gordon's case - the world is not changing faster than ever. In fact, he says our problem isn't too much change. It's too little. Hello and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Jacob Goldstein. HELM: And I'm Sally Helm. If Robert Gordon is right, then a lot of really smart people are wrong. GOLDSTEIN: Today on the show, Robert Gordon's argument and its implications for everything from how the next generation of Americans will live to whether robots really will take all our jobs. (SOUNDBITE OF NICHOLAS MICHAEL HILL, VON HEMINGWAY AND WILLIAM RIDDIMS' \"BURNING IN ME\")HELM: When you talk to Robert Gordon, you quickly find out that he has stored in his brain every single technological innovation in American history. GOLDSTEIN: Arranged by date. ROBERT GORDON (NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY): There were no window screens. They were invented in the 1880s. By 1929, the ratio of motor vehicles. . . The automatic washing machine had been invented by 1920. . . Amazon was founded in 1994. HELM: Last year, Gordon took all of those facts and many more. . . GOLDSTEIN: So many more. HELM: . . . And put them altogether in that book. It's called \"The Rise And Fall Of American Growth. \" It is about 700 pages long, and it is actually fascinating. GOLDSTEIN: We both read it. It's a good book, a good read. And we called Robert Gordon to talk about it. HELM: All right, can you hear us? GORDON: Yes I can. HELM: Excellent. Hello. . . GOLDSTEIN: Gordon tells the story about technological change not just for the sake of technology, but for how it really affects our lives. And he says, OK, to understand this in like the big long view way do a thought experiment. Say it's the year 1570. . . HELM: Or 1670. GOLDSTEIN: Whatever doesn't matter. And you've got some person living back then. HELM: Delivery Man. GOLDSTEIN: Was that even a thing? HELM: Yeah. GOLDSTEIN: Let's say it was. Delivering. . . HELM: Totally. He's delivering fruit. GOLDSTEIN: Did they even have fruit in 1570? HELM: They totally had fruit, just apples. GOLDSTEIN: So he's delivering apples. He's got - maybe he's got a horse. If he's lucky, he's got a cart. And, you know, think of his world. If he needs to cook something, he cooks over a fire. HELM: Right. He's probably walking a long way bringing the apples from one town to another town. GOLDSTEIN: When he has to go to the bathroom. . . HELM: Just poops in a hole. GOLDSTEIN: Poops in a hole in the ground. There's no, you know, running water. There's no flush toilets. This is his world. HELM: OK. GOLDSTEIN: OK, so we have our delivery man. He's in your head. His world is in your head. Now it's time for that thought experiment. Bob Gordon says imagine that delivery man lays down under a tree, falls asleep for hundreds of years. He wakes up. He's in the United States. It's the 1800s. He gets up. He looks around. And he sees a world that looks, like, not that different from the world he fell asleep in. HELM: Yeah. There's still horses and carts. He's still walking a long way, cooking over a fire, pooping in a hole in the ground. So, you know, hundreds of years have passed and not that much has changed because up until about 1800 or so, things did not change that much from year to year or even from century to century. GOLDSTEIN: Now thought experiment part two. Same delivery guy gets tired again in 1870, takes a nap for 70 years - short by his standards - wakes up in 1940. Gordon says he wakes up in a world that is completely transformed. GORDON: They would not believe that you could pick up an instrument and talk to somebody a hundred or a thousand miles away on the telephone. They wouldn't know that to illuminate a room you could turn a switch. They would be flabbergasted to look up at the sky and see objects flying in the sky, some of which had. . . GOLDSTEIN: No more pooping in holes in the ground, right? Now there are flush toilets. HELM: There are cars driving around everywhere. Our guy even has a truck. GOLDSTEIN: After hundreds of years of a horse and cart, now he's got a truck. HELM: With just a cart. Now he's zooming around in a truck. GOLDSTEIN: Now he's got a truck. Yeah, a kitchen now - a kitchen is like a thing, right? Now there's a refrigerator, which has never. . . HELM: A stove. No more fire. GOLDSTEIN: A stove. No more fire. You know, and if you go to a city, you look up and there are just, like, these ridiculous, impossibly tall buildings. GORDON: The person who went to sleep in 1870 would have been completely astonished to go to New York City, ride a subway, come out of the subway and gaze up at buildings that were already 75 or even 100 stories tall in the case of the Empire State Building, which was built in 1931. HELM: The man knows every single date for every single thing. GOLDSTEIN: When was the Chrysler Building made? HELM: And - but he - it's for a point, right? He has a point. And the point of this whole thought experiment, the going to sleep, waking up, going to sleep, waking up, the point is this - for hundreds of years, hardly any change at all. And then in this one lifetime, just this one single span, everything changes. There is just this complete transformation. GOLDSTEIN: It really is just extraordinary how much changes how fast at this moment. HELM: And most of those changes grow out of these two key things - number one, electricity and number two, the internal combustion engine. So, like, what today is just a regular old engine. GOLDSTEIN: Economists call things like this - electricity, the internal combustion engine - they call them general purpose technologies. And the basic idea is there are these technologies that do all kinds of different things all across the economy. So you see that in this 1870 to 1940 period. You see them transforming sort of daily life. But they are not done yet. Electricity and the internal combustion engine, they still got more to give. Bob Gordon says, you know, in the next period, in the middle of the 20th century, they transform the way we work. They make work much more efficient. They let workers do a lot more. And he says you really see this starting right around World War II. GORDON: The famous Willow Run plant that was built by Henry Ford, they were producing one bomber an hour by 1944 and '45. That was a gigantic. . . GOLDSTEIN: Wait, they were making a bomber airplane in one hour? GORDON: They were, of course, making a number of them at - all at one time. GOLDSTEIN: Well, sure, but. . . GORDON: But they were - but coming out the end of the factory door was one bomber an hour. GOLDSTEIN: That's extraordinary. HELM: After the war, American workers keep getting more and more productive. The government builds interstate highways. . . GOLDSTEIN: Yeah, so that makes truck drivers more efficient. But it also means lots of other kinds of industries get more efficient 'cause they can, you know, move all their stuff around from one place to another. HELM: Gordon says around the same time, electricity gives us another big productivity breakthrough. This one's more surprising. GORDON: Air conditioning. Air conditioning created an - again, an enormous improvement in productivity, particularly for office workers trapped inside in the summer. GOLDSTEIN: And do you see, like, when air conditioning gets to a sector or an office or a town that workers actually do do more? GORDON: Yes. There are studies that show a distinct improvement. HELM: All across the economy, year after year, productivity is going up. And not just anecdotally - the government actually tracks productivity. It tracks how much value an average worker is creating in an hour of work. GOLDSTEIN: And this number - productivity, productivity growth - it doesn't get, you know, reported much in the press. People don't talk about it much. But economists are obsessed with it because in the long run, productivity growth is the way society as a whole gets better off. You know, productivity growth is the reason that people in the '50s and '60s are doing so much better than their grandparents. Tractors with internal combustion engines replaced horses. Food got more abundant. Builders started using electric power tools instead of hand tools and ordinary people could afford bigger, more comfortable houses. Same amount of work, more and better stuff. HELM: Productivity growth is trucking along in the '50s and '60s. It slows down in the '70s and '80s and then gets another huge boost in the '90s from computers. GOLDSTEIN: Computers. HELM: Computers. . . GOLDSTEIN: The Internet. HELM: Exactly. And computers, they are a new general purpose technology. GOLDSTEIN: Yeah, they're this new thing, this new technology that does all kinds of different things in all these different facets of life. And so in the '90s, of course, businesses are going online. They're replacing paper with computers. Workers are getting much more productive even after the dot-com bust into the early years of the 21st century. Productivity is growing really fast. HELM: But then in 2004, something goes wrong. Productivity growth comes crashing down. GOLDSTEIN: Did not play, you know, in the popular press as a disaster, but economists noticed. You know, it's like that moment in the movies where the - there's that one dog that just starts barking out of nowhere. HELM: He's trying tell us something. GOLDSTEIN: What is it, boy, productivity growth? MARTIN BAILY (BROOKINGS INSTITUTION): So I kind of thought it was maybe a temporary thing, and then we had the Great Recession. And I expected that as the recovery proceeded that we would begin to get productivity picking up again. GOLDSTEIN: This is Martin Baily. He was the chairman of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers. And he has been studying productivity for a long time. BAILY: So the - when I looked at, you know, 2010, '11, '12, '13, '14, '15, '16 and it still wasn't picking up, that's when I began to get really nervous. GOLDSTEIN: So you're nervous now - if it goes through '16 that means you're nervous right now. BAILY: I'm nervous right now, yes. HELM: In the last few years, we've heard a lot about the rise of inequality, the idea that the economic pie is not being divided fairly. And, of course, that is important. GOLDSTEIN: But Baily and other economists say we also need to figure out this other thing. We also need to figure out - why is the pie barely growing at all? Why is productivity growth so slow? They've come up with a name for this problem. They call it the productivity paradox. HELM: And this is what the productivity paradox is. We have all of this amazing technology - robots, artificial intelligence, the cloud - and it should be making us more productive. That's what technology does. But when you look at the numbers for the economy as a whole, all that technology does not seem to be making a difference. It does not seem to be making us more productive. GOLDSTEIN: And you hear this and you say there is no way that can possibly be true, right? It seems so impossible, which is why they call it a paradox. HELM: Exactly. That's the paradox. GOLDSTEIN: And there are a few different answers to this. Part of it - part of it could be maybe we are getting more productive, but we're just not measuring it right. You know, it's easier to measure productivity - output per worker per hour - when people are, say, making cars. But today there's lots more people working in hospitals, and how do you measure the productivity of a hospital worker? HELM: Sure. But even if you account for that, economists say, it really looks like productivity is still growing much more slowly than it used to. GOLDSTEIN: They say, listen, it doesn't feel true, but trust us. When we do the numbers that's what we find. HELM: Robert Gordon thinks he knows what's going on. And his explanation, it goes back to the delivery guy who fell asleep in 1870 and woke up in 1940 and the world had totally changed. GOLDSTEIN: Gordon says do another thought experiment. Compare that person to somebody who fell asleep in 1950 and woke up today. For the person who woke up today. . . GORDON: What would have seemed new to the 1950 person would be everything to do with computers. GOLDSTEIN: Of course, the computer is a huge deal. Laptops, iPhones are everywhere, all the magic that comes with that. HELM: But then, Gordon says, think about everything else. Think about just, like, a normal house. Remember, that person who went to sleep in 1870 and woke up in 1940, they were shocked to see houses that had running water and refrigeration. GORDON: The person going to sleep in 1950 and waking up today would only find one element of the kitchen which is new, and that is the microwave oven. GOLDSTEIN: (Laughter) Not so great. GORDON: The person from 1950 visiting us today would find our cars entirely familiar. HELM: Yeah, our delivery guy went to sleep with the truck, wakes up with another truck. Maybe it's a safer truck. Maybe it has GPS now. But remember, last time that truck replaced his horse-drawn cart. GOLDSTEIN: The last time when he went to sleep, New York City had streets full of horses. The tallest building was a church. He woke up to subways and skyscrapers. This time. . . GORDON: Just the same subway system as existed then, same Empire State Building rising above everything else. HELM: And, yes, he says, sure, the new World Trade Center is a little taller than the Empire State Building. But it's like with the car. It's just an incremental change. It's not some big revolution. GORDON: More of the same rather than something new. HELM: Gordon says the world just has not changed as much in the past 70 years as it did in the 70 years before that. Those big 20th century changes driven by electricity, the internal combustion engine, those were just a much bigger deal than the changes that have been driven by computers. GOLDSTEIN: Gordon says computers and the Internet, they did give us that amazing decade in the late '90s and early aughts. That was when, you know, most people got the Internet. It was when Google came along. It was when smartphones came along. We had all that already, you know, 10, 12 years ago. HELM: Since then, Gordon says, not that much has changed. GOLDSTEIN: But the iPhone. GORDON: Yes, one of the peculiar aspects of the last 10 years is that so much innovation has gone into the iPhone and all the associated apps. In fact, the record for productivity growth in the last six years is about as low as it's been in U. S. recorded history. So we have. . . GOLDSTEIN: It's as low now as it's ever been as far as we know? Like, coming at this from the outside I really do find it shocking. GORDON: That's because the main ways in which computers raise business productivity had already happened by 10 years ago. And the nature of the iPhone with most of its uses is in your personal space. HELM: So sure, iPhones are a huge deal in our personal lives. But they haven't really fundamentally changed the way that most of us do our work. And other technologies - robots, artificial intelligence - he says they haven't changed work that much either. GORDON: I play a game called Find the Robot everywhere in my life - when I travel, I get in an airplane, I go into a hotel. I see human beings do the same thing that they did 10 or 15 years ago. In office situations - going to the doctor, the dentist, the veterinarian - going into retail stores, going into restaurants. I see a large part of the economy that's operating in the same way as it did last year and the year before. GOLDSTEIN: Gordon says this isn't just his little game of Spot the Robot. He says the numbers for the economy as a whole back him up. If, in fact, robots and computers were replacing humans in vast numbers, all those machines would lead to lots more output. And there would be fewer hours of human labor, so productivity would be going up really fast. But it's not. Productivity is barely going up at all. HELM: Also, if robots and computers were taking all our jobs overnight, the number of jobs would be declining. But that's not what's happening. The economy has been adding millions of jobs per year, year after year. GORDON: I tend to look at myself as a jobs optimist. . . GOLDSTEIN: (Laughter). GORDON: . . . Even if I may be a techno pessimist. (SOUNDBITE OF SACHA JAMES COLLISSON'S \"FEELS SO GOOD\")HELM: OK. So that's Robert Gordon's story of the last 150 years, also the last 10 years. Obvious question - what's next? GOLDSTEIN: We'll have that in a minute. Don't touch that dial. And by dial, I mean the globally connected supercomputer in your pocket. (SOUNDBITE OF SACHA JAMES COLLISSON'S \"FEELS SO GOOD\")HELM: When Robert Gordon thinks about the future, he thinks that the next 10 years - they're going to look a lot like the last 10 years, sort of incremental changes, things get better slowly but no big revolution. GOLDSTEIN: When Gordon's book came out last year, this part, his claims about the future - that was what I think the most people sort of quarreled with. We asked Martin Baily about this. He's the economist who is nervous about the productivity slowdown. BAILY: Robert Gordon has been fairly consistently pessimistic about productivity growth. And so far, he's been proven right. Is he going to be right in the future? It doesn't look like it because it looks as if - that technology really is moving ahead. GOLDSTEIN: And I mean, you know, we're at the end of the show here. I'll - like, I'll weigh in. I have to say, I love, love Gordon's thought experiment about the guy falling asleep. It really - I think it really is a lovely way to think about technological change and to think - oh, we're not so special right now. But when it comes to the future, I mean, it feels to me - and to Baily and to many of the people who I talked to - like, Gordon probably is not right. It feels like things really are about to change in these big ways. HELM: I don't know. I hear people talk about things being about to change in these hugely profound ways. But that all just kind of sounds like a vague dream to me. And then I think about Robert Gordon, who is just, like, down there in the dirt with all the details and every single date. And what. . . GOLDSTEIN: He does know a lot of dates. HELM: Yeah, every date. And what he's saying is, if you take the long view, you will see that slow, incremental change is normal. We had a thousand years of just horses and cooking fires. And then we had this really strange time, past couple hundred years or so, when things changed very quickly. And now? Maybe we're back to the way things have always been - to another era where change is slow, not a horse to a car, just an iPhone to a better iPhone.

(SOUNDBITE OF AARON KELLEY, DUSTY HENDRIX, JEFFREY W. WADE AND RUBEN AYALA'S \"NERD DISCO\") [NOTE: This transcript reflects the original episode. There may be updates from this version not reflected here. ] JACOB GOLDSTEIN (HOST): Here is a thing you hear - I don't know - every single day. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: The world is changing faster than ever before. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: How about this? Boston researchers have developed a new supercomputer. They claim it can predict if a patient is about to die. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: The high-tech bridge will be equipped with nano-articulated technology. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: This week it's not cowboys versus aliens. It's humans versus robots. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: The world is changing faster than ever. What used to take decades is now taking years or even months. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: What you see right now is the illusion. . . SALLY HELM (HOST): And it is not only cheesy TV news. It is also cheesy podcasts. Here's one from 2015. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) GOLDSTEIN: When you add up all the jobs he thinks are going to be left, there will not be nearly enough to make up for the vast number of jobs that machines are going to take over. HELM: That was you, Jacob Goldstein? GOLDSTEIN: It was me on PLANET MONEY. And, you know, this is - I'm just stating the spirit of the times. You know, everybody says this. The world is changing faster than ever. HELM: And yet - and yet, there is one guy who does not say that - Robert Gordon. He is an economist. He knows an absurd amount about the history of technology. And last year, he came out with this big influential book. Paul Krugman, New York Times, called Gordon's predictions about the future shocking, said he makes a powerful case. GOLDSTEIN: Gordon's case - the world is not changing faster than ever. In fact, he says our problem isn't too much change. It's too little. Hello and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Jacob Goldstein. HELM: And I'm Sally Helm. If Robert Gordon is right, then a lot of really smart people are wrong. GOLDSTEIN: Today on the show, Robert Gordon's argument and its implications for everything from how the next generation of Americans will live to whether robots really will take all our jobs. (SOUNDBITE OF NICHOLAS MICHAEL HILL, VON HEMINGWAY AND WILLIAM RIDDIMS' \"BURNING IN ME\") HELM: When you talk to Robert Gordon, you quickly find out that he has stored in his brain every single technological innovation in American history. GOLDSTEIN: Arranged by date. ROBERT GORDON (NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY): There were no window screens. They were invented in the 1880s. By 1929, the ratio of motor vehicles. . . The automatic washing machine had been invented by 1920. . . Amazon was founded in 1994. HELM: Last year, Gordon took all of those facts and many more. . . GOLDSTEIN: So many more. HELM: . . . And put them altogether in that book. It's called \"The Rise And Fall Of American Growth. \" It is about 700 pages long, and it is actually fascinating. GOLDSTEIN: We both read it. It's a good book, a good read. And we called Robert Gordon to talk about it. HELM: All right, can you hear us? GORDON: Yes I can. HELM: Excellent. Hello. . . GOLDSTEIN: Gordon tells the story about technological change not just for the sake of technology, but for how it really affects our lives. And he says, OK, to understand this in like the big long view way do a thought experiment. Say it's the year 1570. . . HELM: Or 1670. GOLDSTEIN: Whatever doesn't matter. And you've got some person living back then. HELM: Delivery Man. GOLDSTEIN: Was that even a thing? HELM: Yeah. GOLDSTEIN: Let's say it was. Delivering. . . HELM: Totally. He's delivering fruit. GOLDSTEIN: Did they even have fruit in 1570? HELM: They totally had fruit, just apples. GOLDSTEIN: So he's delivering apples. He's got - maybe he's got a horse. If he's lucky, he's got a cart. And, you know, think of his world. If he needs to cook something, he cooks over a fire. HELM: Right. He's probably walking a long way bringing the apples from one town to another town. GOLDSTEIN: When he has to go to the bathroom. . . HELM: Just poops in a hole. GOLDSTEIN: Poops in a hole in the ground. There's no, you know, running water. There's no flush toilets. This is his world. HELM: OK. GOLDSTEIN: OK, so we have our delivery man. He's in your head. His world is in your head. Now it's time for that thought experiment. Bob Gordon says imagine that delivery man lays down under a tree, falls asleep for hundreds of years. He wakes up. He's in the United States. It's the 1800s. He gets up. He looks around. And he sees a world that looks, like, not that different from the world he fell asleep in. HELM: Yeah. There's still horses and carts. He's still walking a long way, cooking over a fire, pooping in a hole in the ground. So, you know, hundreds of years have passed and not that much has changed because up until about 1800 or so, things did not change that much from year to year or even from century to century. GOLDSTEIN: Now thought experiment part two. Same delivery guy gets tired again in 1870, takes a nap for 70 years - short by his standards - wakes up in 1940. Gordon says he wakes up in a world that is completely transformed. GORDON: They would not believe that you could pick up an instrument and talk to somebody a hundred or a thousand miles away on the telephone. They wouldn't know that to illuminate a room you could turn a switch. They would be flabbergasted to look up at the sky and see objects flying in the sky, some of which had. . . GOLDSTEIN: No more pooping in holes in the ground, right? Now there are flush toilets. HELM: There are cars driving around everywhere. Our guy even has a truck. GOLDSTEIN: After hundreds of years of a horse and cart, now he's got a truck. HELM: With just a cart. Now he's zooming around in a truck. GOLDSTEIN: Now he's got a truck. Yeah, a kitchen now - a kitchen is like a thing, right? Now there's a refrigerator, which has never. . . HELM: A stove. No more fire. GOLDSTEIN: A stove. No more fire. You know, and if you go to a city, you look up and there are just, like, these ridiculous, impossibly tall buildings. GORDON: The person who went to sleep in 1870 would have been completely astonished to go to New York City, ride a subway, come out of the subway and gaze up at buildings that were already 75 or even 100 stories tall in the case of the Empire State Building, which was built in 1931. HELM: The man knows every single date for every single thing. GOLDSTEIN: When was the Chrysler Building made? HELM: And - but he - it's for a point, right? He has a point. And the point of this whole thought experiment, the going to sleep, waking up, going to sleep, waking up, the point is this - for hundreds of years, hardly any change at all. And then in this one lifetime, just this one single span, everything changes. There is just this complete transformation. GOLDSTEIN: It really is just extraordinary how much changes how fast at this moment. HELM: And most of those changes grow out of these two key things - number one, electricity and number two, the internal combustion engine. So, like, what today is just a regular old engine. GOLDSTEIN: Economists call things like this - electricity, the internal combustion engine - they call them general purpose technologies. And the basic idea is there are these technologies that do all kinds of different things all across the economy. So you see that in this 1870 to 1940 period. You see them transforming sort of daily life. But they are not done yet. Electricity and the internal combustion engine, they still got more to give. Bob Gordon says, you know, in the next period, in the middle of the 20th century, they transform the way we work. They make work much more efficient. They let workers do a lot more. And he says you really see this starting right around World War II. GORDON: The famous Willow Run plant that was built by Henry Ford, they were producing one bomber an hour by 1944 and '45. That was a gigantic. . . GOLDSTEIN: Wait, they were making a bomber airplane in one hour? GORDON: They were, of course, making a number of them at - all at one time. GOLDSTEIN: Well, sure, but. . . GORDON: But they were - but coming out the end of the factory door was one bomber an hour. GOLDSTEIN: That's extraordinary. HELM: After the war, American workers keep getting more and more productive. The government builds interstate highways. . . GOLDSTEIN: Yeah, so that makes truck drivers more efficient. But it also means lots of other kinds of industries get more efficient 'cause they can, you know, move all their stuff around from one place to another. HELM: Gordon says around the same time, electricity gives us another big productivity breakthrough. This one's more surprising. GORDON: Air conditioning. Air conditioning created an - again, an enormous improvement in productivity, particularly for office workers trapped inside in the summer. GOLDSTEIN: And do you see, like, when air conditioning gets to a sector or an office or a town that workers actually do do more? GORDON: Yes. There are studies that show a distinct improvement. HELM: All across the economy, year after year, productivity is going up. And not just anecdotally - the government actually tracks productivity. It tracks how much value an average worker is creating in an hour of work. GOLDSTEIN: And this number - productivity, productivity growth - it doesn't get, you know, reported much in the press. People don't talk about it much. But economists are obsessed with it because in the long run, productivity growth is the way society as a whole gets better off. You know, productivity growth is the reason that people in the '50s and '60s are doing so much better than their grandparents. Tractors with internal combustion engines replaced horses. Food got more abundant. Builders started using electric power tools instead of hand tools and ordinary people could afford bigger, more comfortable houses. Same amount of work, more and better stuff. HELM: Productivity growth is trucking along in the '50s and '60s. It slows down in the '70s and '80s and then gets another huge boost in the '90s from computers. GOLDSTEIN: Computers. HELM: Computers. . . GOLDSTEIN: The Internet. HELM: Exactly. And computers, they are a new general purpose technology. GOLDSTEIN: Yeah, they're this new thing, this new technology that does all kinds of different things in all these different facets of life. And so in the '90s, of course, businesses are going online. They're replacing paper with computers. Workers are getting much more productive even after the dot-com bust into the early years of the 21st century. Productivity is growing really fast. HELM: But then in 2004, something goes wrong. Productivity growth comes crashing down. GOLDSTEIN: Did not play, you know, in the popular press as a disaster, but economists noticed. You know, it's like that moment in the movies where the - there's that one dog that just starts barking out of nowhere. HELM: He's trying tell us something. GOLDSTEIN: What is it, boy, productivity growth? MARTIN BAILY (BROOKINGS INSTITUTION): So I kind of thought it was maybe a temporary thing, and then we had the Great Recession. And I expected that as the recovery proceeded that we would begin to get productivity picking up again. GOLDSTEIN: This is Martin Baily. He was the chairman of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers. And he has been studying productivity for a long time. BAILY: So the - when I looked at, you know, 2010, '11, '12, '13, '14, '15, '16 and it still wasn't picking up, that's when I began to get really nervous. GOLDSTEIN: So you're nervous now - if it goes through '16 that means you're nervous right now. BAILY: I'm nervous right now, yes. HELM: In the last few years, we've heard a lot about the rise of inequality, the idea that the economic pie is not being divided fairly. And, of course, that is important. GOLDSTEIN: But Baily and other economists say we also need to figure out this other thing. We also need to figure out - why is the pie barely growing at all? Why is productivity growth so slow? They've come up with a name for this problem. They call it the productivity paradox. HELM: And this is what the productivity paradox is. We have all of this amazing technology - robots, artificial intelligence, the cloud - and it should be making us more productive. That's what technology does. But when you look at the numbers for the economy as a whole, all that technology does not seem to be making a difference. It does not seem to be making us more productive. GOLDSTEIN: And you hear this and you say there is no way that can possibly be true, right? It seems so impossible, which is why they call it a paradox. HELM: Exactly. That's the paradox. GOLDSTEIN: And there are a few different answers to this. Part of it - part of it could be maybe we are getting more productive, but we're just not measuring it right. You know, it's easier to measure productivity - output per worker per hour - when people are, say, making cars. But today there's lots more people working in hospitals, and how do you measure the productivity of a hospital worker? HELM: Sure. But even if you account for that, economists say, it really looks like productivity is still growing much more slowly than it used to. GOLDSTEIN: They say, listen, it doesn't feel true, but trust us. When we do the numbers that's what we find. HELM: Robert Gordon thinks he knows what's going on. And his explanation, it goes back to the delivery guy who fell asleep in 1870 and woke up in 1940 and the world had totally changed. GOLDSTEIN: Gordon says do another thought experiment. Compare that person to somebody who fell asleep in 1950 and woke up today. For the person who woke up today. . . GORDON: What would have seemed new to the 1950 person would be everything to do with computers. GOLDSTEIN: Of course, the computer is a huge deal. Laptops, iPhones are everywhere, all the magic that comes with that. HELM: But then, Gordon says, think about everything else. Think about just, like, a normal house. Remember, that person who went to sleep in 1870 and woke up in 1940, they were shocked to see houses that had running water and refrigeration. GORDON: The person going to sleep in 1950 and waking up today would only find one element of the kitchen which is new, and that is the microwave oven. GOLDSTEIN: (Laughter) Not so great. GORDON: The person from 1950 visiting us today would find our cars entirely familiar. HELM: Yeah, our delivery guy went to sleep with the truck, wakes up with another truck. Maybe it's a safer truck. Maybe it has GPS now. But remember, last time that truck replaced his horse-drawn cart. GOLDSTEIN: The last time when he went to sleep, New York City had streets full of horses. The tallest building was a church. He woke up to subways and skyscrapers. This time. . . GORDON: Just the same subway system as existed then, same Empire State Building rising above everything else. HELM: And, yes, he says, sure, the new World Trade Center is a little taller than the Empire State Building. But it's like with the car. It's just an incremental change. It's not some big revolution. GORDON: More of the same rather than something new. HELM: Gordon says the world just has not changed as much in the past 70 years as it did in the 70 years before that. Those big 20th century changes driven by electricity, the internal combustion engine, those were just a much bigger deal than the changes that have been driven by computers. GOLDSTEIN: Gordon says computers and the Internet, they did give us that amazing decade in the late '90s and early aughts. That was when, you know, most people got the Internet. It was when Google came along. It was when smartphones came along. We had all that already, you know, 10, 12 years ago. HELM: Since then, Gordon says, not that much has changed. GOLDSTEIN: But the iPhone. GORDON: Yes, one of the peculiar aspects of the last 10 years is that so much innovation has gone into the iPhone and all the associated apps. In fact, the record for productivity growth in the last six years is about as low as it's been in U. S. recorded history. So we have. . . GOLDSTEIN: It's as low now as it's ever been as far as we know? Like, coming at this from the outside I really do find it shocking. GORDON: That's because the main ways in which computers raise business productivity had already happened by 10 years ago. And the nature of the iPhone with most of its uses is in your personal space.

The state Democratic Party expected to use that app to report results of the Iowa caucuses. And America woke yesterday to learn it hadn't worked. NPR tech correspondent Shannon Bond joins us to discuss who made that app and how it all went so wrong. Good morning. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: What was this app supposed to do as people met across Iowa in gymnasiums and other places and cast their votes? BOND: Right. So all of the caucus leaders, the precinct leaders at these sites across the state, had the option - they could use this app to enter the number of votes that each candidate was getting in the different rounds. The app was helping to do the math about whether the candidates were viable to move on to the next round and then figure out how many delegates they should get and then report that information up to the state party. It wasn't being used to cast any ballots by voters. INSKEEP: Right. OK. BOND: And the Iowa Democratic Party, you know, they told our colleague, Miles Parks, just last month that the idea - this was going to make it easier and it was also going to mean the public would learn the results of the caucuses more quickly. But, of course, as we saw on Monday, that's not what happened. INSKEEP: Yeah. I gather there were some precinct captains who just didn't trust this thing and tried to use a phone system that was overwhelmed, and then the people who did use it, it didn't quite work. BOND: That's right. I mean, they had the option of calling in on the phone and it - which didn't seem to be adequately staffed. But also they just weren't - not everyone was able to download it. There were just a lot of problems accessing the app. INSKEEP: A lot of problems accessing the app. So who was responsible for this app, for making it? BOND: It was made by a company called Shadow Inc. that not many people probably have heard of before this week. INSKEEP: If you want to have a little-known company, by the way, Shadow Inc. is a good name to go with. BOND: Exactly, exactly. It was started by veterans of Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign. We do know that. And it was funded by a group called ACRONYM, which is this nonprofit started recently by Democrats. They're trying to take on President Trump online. David Plouffe, Barack Obama's 2008 campaign manager, is on the board. Now, they didn't respond to interview requests and ACRONYM has put out a statement distancing itself from Shadow. But the idea is Shadow is supposed to build these digital political tools - apps for volunteering or voter mobilization. It reportedly built software for the Buttigieg campaign. And the Iowa Democratic Party paid Shadow about $63,000 for its work. Nevada's Democratic Party also paid Shadow for an app similar, but now officials there say they're going to use a different app from a different company. INSKEEP: OK. So they're going to go a different way. They don't want to have a repetition of what happened in Iowa. Is it entirely clear, like, what actually went wrong within the app itself? BOND: Well, the party says there was a coding error, but they haven't given much detail on that. It looks like the app - the people who were able to use the app, only some of those results were getting reported to this party officials. And Shadow apologized on Tuesday for technical problems. It says the issue wasn't with collecting the data. It was transmitting that data to the party. INSKEEP: This triggered so many concerns and even conspiracy theories about the results being tampered with or contaminated in some way. Should people be worried after an incident like this? BOND: Well, in this case, you know, this app wasn't hacked as far as we can tell. It really does seem maybe it was a combination of technical errors, user errors and then, you know, the backup system just not working. But this is a reminder that technology introduces unpredictable risks. And cybersecurity experts have warned for a long time that apps don't belong in elections. There are too many risks like hacking. You know, what we know is this is a bad scenario in Iowa. This wasn't the worst case. There was a paper trail. No votes were affected. But, you know, this was a failure. INSKEEP: Shannon, thanks so much for the update. BOND: Thank you. INSKEEP: That's NPR Shannon Bond. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  What went wrong with an app in Iowa? The state Democratic Party expected to use that app to report results of the Iowa caucuses. And America woke yesterday to learn it hadn't worked. NPR tech correspondent Shannon Bond joins us to discuss who made that app and how it all went so wrong. Good morning. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: What was this app supposed to do as people met across Iowa in gymnasiums and other places and cast their votes? BOND: Right. So all of the caucus leaders, the precinct leaders at these sites across the state, had the option - they could use this app to enter the number of votes that each candidate was getting in the different rounds. The app was helping to do the math about whether the candidates were viable to move on to the next round and then figure out how many delegates they should get and then report that information up to the state party. It wasn't being used to cast any ballots by voters. INSKEEP: Right. OK. BOND: And the Iowa Democratic Party, you know, they told our colleague, Miles Parks, just last month that the idea - this was going to make it easier and it was also going to mean the public would learn the results of the caucuses more quickly. But, of course, as we saw on Monday, that's not what happened. INSKEEP: Yeah. I gather there were some precinct captains who just didn't trust this thing and tried to use a phone system that was overwhelmed, and then the people who did use it, it didn't quite work. BOND: That's right. I mean, they had the option of calling in on the phone and it - which didn't seem to be adequately staffed. But also they just weren't - not everyone was able to download it. There were just a lot of problems accessing the app. INSKEEP: A lot of problems accessing the app. So who was responsible for this app, for making it? BOND: It was made by a company called Shadow Inc. that not many people probably have heard of before this week. INSKEEP: If you want to have a little-known company, by the way, Shadow Inc. is a good name to go with. BOND: Exactly, exactly. It was started by veterans of Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign. We do know that. And it was funded by a group called ACRONYM, which is this nonprofit started recently by Democrats. They're trying to take on President Trump online. David Plouffe, Barack Obama's 2008 campaign manager, is on the board. Now, they didn't respond to interview requests and ACRONYM has put out a statement distancing itself from Shadow. But the idea is Shadow is supposed to build these digital political tools - apps for volunteering or voter mobilization. It reportedly built software for the Buttigieg campaign. And the Iowa Democratic Party paid Shadow about $63,000 for its work. Nevada's Democratic Party also paid Shadow for an app similar, but now officials there say they're going to use a different app from a different company. INSKEEP: OK. So they're going to go a different way. They don't want to have a repetition of what happened in Iowa. Is it entirely clear, like, what actually went wrong within the app itself? BOND: Well, the party says there was a coding error, but they haven't given much detail on that. It looks like the app - the people who were able to use the app, only some of those results were getting reported to this party officials. And Shadow apologized on Tuesday for technical problems. It says the issue wasn't with collecting the data. It was transmitting that data to the party.

This time, a group that favors Trump is trying to ensure a repeat victory. And it's using something called geofencing to find churchgoing Catholics. For All Tech Considered, I spoke with Heidi Schlumpf of the National Catholic Reporter about what's going on. HEIDI SCHLUMPF: Geofencing is a way of data mining that targets people based on their location. So when you agree to those apps that want to share your location data, geofencers are able to capture that when you enter or leave a geographically prescribed area - in this case, a church. CORNISH: How does it happen? I mean, what is the trigger? I guess, as you're going to and from Mass? SCHLUMPF: If your phone is on and you have an app open in which you've allowed the sharing of location data, the geofencers can capture your IP address and other data from your phone. And then they can target ads directly to that device. But they can also cross-reference that data that they've acquired with other data sets, so in this case, probably voter rolls. And already we have this conservative Catholic organization that's doing exactly that to try to target Catholic voters. CORNISH: Who's the organization, and what have you learned about what they're up to? SCHLUMPF: The organization is called CatholicVote. And on their website, it lists a number of issues that are important to them. But in the end, they narrow it down to three really culture war issues. And that's abortion, gay marriage and what they call religious liberty. CORNISH: Now, you report that, using geofencing, CatholicVote has already identified some 200,000 Catholics in Wisconsin, which of course is a key state heading into 2020. They're able to discover that half of those Mass-goers are not registered to vote. Help us understand, from there, how does this give them the advantage, so to speak? SCHLUMPF: Yeah. CatholicVote, the organization, is planning what they're calling the largest Catholic voter mobilization program ever, based on this geofenced information that they've mined. It's basically a get-out-the-vote effort. They've identified these people who are regular Mass-goers. They want to get them registered to vote and get them to the polls because they have data that shows that 60% to 70% percent of regular Catholic churchgoers - again, especially in these geographic areas of white suburban churches that they're targeting - are going to vote for the Republican Party, and in this case, Donald Trump. CORNISH: Now, as far as I know, geofencing is not illegal. But I understand that there are some Catholics in particular who are aware this is happening and are upset about it. SCHLUMPF: You're right to say that it's not illegal, but the idea of mining data of people while they're at worship in a church was causing outrage to some of our readers. And the fact then that that data is going to be used for political purposes added to their problems with this. CORNISH: What are some of the specific criticisms that people had about this? SCHLUMPF: Some people are upset about the general lack of privacy. A number of people have already accepted that that's going to happen, but again, found it problematic that it's being used in churches. Now, it's important to note that the churches themselves were not aware and had not consented in any way that the data of their worship attendees was being collected. CORNISH: What has CatholicVote said about this when you reached out to them? SCHLUMPF: CatholicVote did not respond to our requests for an interview, but they seem quite proud of this plan and have been talking about it on their website and their blog. CORNISH: It sounds weird. It's a little bit like someone sitting outside your house and using your Wi-Fi. SCHLUMPF: Well, I think it's important to note that geofencing happens all the time. So it happens when you go to the store. It happens when you go to the mall. And it's been used by political campaigns and political groups for at least the last two presidential campaigns, I've been told. Democrats use geofencing as well, just not, to my knowledge, in churches, since that's not where their base is. CORNISH: That's Heidi Schlumpf of the National Catholic Reporter. Thank you for sharing your journalism with us. SCHLUMPF: Thanks so much for having me. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  In 2016, Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton in Wisconsin by fewer than 23,000 votes.

Washington, D. C. , thinks maybe not. The city is considering a ban on cashless businesses. Similar bans have already been passed in several parts of the country. NPR's Alina Selyukh reports it's a rare case of governments getting ahead of a tech trend before it spreads. ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE: After almost 10 minutes of standing in line at a coffee shop, Ritchie Torres realized something. RITCHIE TORRES: I only had cash in my pocket. SELYUKH: And this coffee shop no longer accepted cash, only cards or mobile payments, which he didn't have on him. TORRES: It was a humiliating experience. And I remember wondering aloud, how could a business refuse to accept cash, which is legal tender? When you open a dollar bill, it reads, this note is legal tender. SELYUKH: Torres is a city council member in New York. He says his constituents have also complained about a spurt of cashless stores, especially seniors. He wrote a bill to ban businesses from rejecting cash. Last month, the New York City Council passed it almost unanimously, joining Philadelphia, San Francisco and the state of New Jersey. A similar ban is up for a hearing in Washington, D. C. , next week. Here's Tazra Mitchell with the research and advocacy group DC Fiscal Policy Institute. TAZRA MITCHELL: A cashless economy is not an inclusive economy because whenever you exclude people from being able to use cash at businesses, you're essentially discriminating against people who are low-income, people who are homeless, also undocumented. SELYUKH: Getting a credit or debit card is not easy for everyone. You have to have an ID, often a utility or another bill and money to deposit, a financial history. Mitchell says in D. C. , nearly a third of residents rely on cash every day because they don't have a card or even a bank account. The Federal Reserve has found the use of cash is declining. Two years ago, for the first time, it found cash had stopped being the No. 1 payment choice. But it's still the most common way that people pay smaller amounts under 10- or $25. That's particularly true for people over 55 and under 25. TORRES: Whatever your reasons, you as the consumer should have the power to choose your favored method of payment. SELYUKH: The biggest names to try going cashless have been Amazon, with its automated convenience stores, and the salad chain Sweetgreen. They and other businesses argued cash is inefficient. It slows down the line, requires armored cars, attracts break-ins or skimming by the workers. More and more people are now paying with their phones, and credit card companies are rewarding the trend. They get a cut every time a card is swiped. Visa paid a $10,000 award to 50 businesses that stopped accepting cash. STEPHANIE MARTZ: We don't think that in five years, laws that ban stores from going cashless are going to look smart. SELYUKH: Stephanie Martz is the general counsel of the National Retail Federation, which has actually been fighting with credit card companies over their fees. Martz argues the cashless trend is not really that big. Not many stores have gone cashless. And some of the loudest proponents have now reversed their policies. That includes Sweetgreen and the cashier-less Amazon Go shops, which now both accept cash. MARTZ: Some stores have gone cashless. Others have gone cashless and have gone back to accepting cash. And I think that's a real indication that the market is working, and retailers and restaurants are being responsive to what their customers want and need. SELYUKH: Of course, this also happens to coincide with new laws starting to ban the cashless practice. Either way, Martz envisions a near future where everyone has access to digital payments, thanks to new technology. And in that future, banning stores from going cashless could hamstring them from becoming more efficient. But Torres and Mitchell argue cashless laws are there to balance technological progress with an economy that's fair and inclusive. Alina Selyukh, NPR News.

You see these little battery-powered vehicles - very visible on the sidewalks waiting for the next rider. Well, the scooter company Lime is going even more electric in a way that may be hard to notice. But NPR's Camila Domonoske did. CAMILA DOMONOSKE, BYLINE: Scooter companies like to emphasize that they're good for the environment because a scooter doesn't have a tailpipe. Andrew Savage is the head of sustainability at Lime, the biggest scooter company. ANDREW SAVAGE: All of our scooters and e-bikes are already electric, already powered by renewables. DOMONOSKE: But behind the scenes, there is some gas guzzling. Lime has a fleet of vans that move scooters around to put them at popular pickup locations. Now, Savage says. . . SAVAGE: We're going to take the vans and the vehicles used to manage those programs and transition those to zero emissions as well. DOMONOSKE: For now, he's talking about a few hundred vehicles. But Lime is not the only company planning to get more eco-friendly behind the scenes. IKEA, Unilever, DHL and Amazon are all interested in electrifying their fleets. And fleet vehicles are everywhere. Think delivery trucks and maintenance vans, police cars, school buses. And a major shift may be coming. One research firm predicts 2 million electric fleet vehicles today will rise to 70 million in a decade - 12% of all fleet vehicles. Ted Walker is with Guidehouse. TED WALKER: Given the life span of vehicles, you know, 12% population will require a significant portion of new vehicles sold being plug-in electric vehicles. DOMONOSKE: Companies are interested in becoming more sustainable, like Lime is, but there are other reasons that selling electric vehicles to companies can be easier than selling it to individuals. You can sell a lot of them at once. Then, there's the price. WALKER: Electric vehicles are going to have a higher purchase price. But there's a lower maintenance, lower fuel costs. DOMONOSKE: Most of us focus on that sticker shock, but fleet operators calculate the lifetime cost of a vehicle. Or consider range anxiety. Batteries take time to recharge, so some people worry about running out of juice if they take a long trip, even if they usually just drive their commute. Fleet operators know how far their cars go. Steve Burns is the CEO of Lordstown Motors, which is making a pickup truck specifically to sell to fleets. STEVE BURNS: We are catering mostly to people that stay local, whether that's a florist, a landscaper or a police officer. We can go 250 miles on a charge. Most of these type of folks go 60 or 70 miles a day. DOMONOSKE: There are some logistical challenges. Fleet operators have to set up charging infrastructure, for instance. But there's another problem. That Lordstown Motors truck isn't available yet. And Andrew Savage from Lime says for electric vans, too, the U. S. doesn't have many options. SAVAGE: It's only a small handful. And it - the supply is actually quite constrained. DOMONOSKE: So companies are waiting on automakers to catch up with demand. Camila Domonoske, NPR News.

I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross. Amazon started as an online bookseller, but now it not only sells nearly everything. It owns a wide range of companies, including Whole Foods. It's created streaming services, developed facial recognition and surveillance technologies and sold cloud computing services to the CIA. Bezos, the richest man in the world, owns The Washington Post and is developing technology for space travel. A new documentary titled \"Amazon Empire: The Rise And Reign Of Jeff Bezos\" will premiere on PBS next Tuesday as part of \"Frontline,\" the investigative documentary series. Our guest is the film's director and correspondent, James Jacoby, who worked with producers Anya Bourg and Megan Robertson. The documentary investigates how Amazon has disrupted and transformed nearly every aspect of our lives and has come under scrutiny for its tactics and expanding power. Terry spoke with James Jacoby yesterday, and as you'll hear, she has a cold. Here's her interview. TERRY GROSS, BYLINE: James Jacoby, welcome to FRESH AIR. JAMES JACOBY: Thank you so much. GROSS: So let's start with - how big is Amazon? JACOBY: It's very big. It's a trillion-dollar company, and it's a company that really extends in a lot of different directions. And so it's not just the online e-commerce company that a lot of us interact with on a very regular basis. It's also the largest cloud computing company in the world. It has a - does about a third of the cloud computing, which means the sort of digital infrastructure of the Internet and storing and managing the data of millions of companies out there and governments and academic institutions. It's a streaming service. It's a big Hollywood producer. It owns Whole Foods. The reach of Amazon in many different directions is tremendous. And it's certainly - by, you know, the market standards, it's one of the largest companies in the world. GROSS: So Jeff Bezos started his career at a hedge fund. Why did he look to the Web? JACOBY: Well, he started his career at D. E. Shaw, which was a hedge fund in New York, a rather secretive hedge fund started by a computer scientist named David Shaw. And Shaw was one of the first traders on Wall Street that used data and algorithmic trading. And Jeff Bezos was recently - rather recently out of Princeton, had studied computer science and engineering. And he - Shaw had taken on a lot of people like Bezos, who were real QuantMinds, and applying that type of scientific mind to Wall Street trading. And he had tasked Bezos at the time with looking into new major business opportunities, including - this is the mid-'90s - including looking at the World Wide Web, the Internet, which was in its nascent stages at that point, at least for commercial purposes. And Bezos recognized this startling statistic, which is - essentially, it was growing at 2,300% a year. And as he puts it in his own words, he says, you know, that things only grow at that rate in Petri dishes. It's really something you rarely see. And he saw an opportunity there that this was going to be the next big thing and that he needed to figure out a way in. And his way in was selling books online. GROSS: Yeah, why was it books? Bezos never intended Amazon to be just a bookstore, so why did he start with books? JACOBY: There's a number of reasons why he started with books. First of all, books are easy to ship. They don't really get hurt in shipping. And he also realized that in the online world, there would be an advantage that no single bookstore could hold all of the books in print. But if you had an online bookstore, you could basically get any book to a customer. You'd have to just source it, find it and get it to a customer. He also, I think, saw an opportunity to learn about customers through what they read. He recognized very early on the power of data kind of to predict what people would want. So in many ways, you are what you read. And you could glean a lot about a customer from what he or she reads. GROSS: Amazon lost money for a really long time. Was it 20 years? JACOBY: Yeah, it was about 20 years. I don't have the exact number, but it was - for roughly 20 years, Amazon was losing money. It was unprofitable. Yeah. GROSS: But that didn't stop people from investing in it, and it didn't stop Jeff Bezos from building his empire. What was his strategy, realizing that he was going to give up making profits in order to gain market share? JACOBY: Yeah, he had - Jeff Bezos really came at Wall Street and investors with a big idea pitch at the time. And he spelled it out, actually, in 1997 with the company's first shareholder letter, where he basically lays out a vision that he still cites to this day, which is that we're not going to really pay attention to the vicissitudes of the market. We're not going to pay attention too much to our share price or to Wall Street reactions. What - really, what we want is to play a very long game, which, as we know, is not necessarily the Wall Street game. Wall Street's interested in quarterly earnings, and Wall Street investors can be rather fickle if you have a bad quarter. He wasn't going to play that game. He was going to say, come along with me. I have a plan to basically gain market share in this burgeoning economy online. Part of that means I'm going to have to reinvest every single dollar back into building infrastructure, digital infrastructure, keeping prices low. And that - if I stick to that strategy, the nature of this new marketplace is that I will win, and you should come along with me. And Wall Street - it wasn't always an easy ride with Wall Street. But investors really did stick with him and obviously have been very handsomely rewarded over the years. GROSS: One of the reasons why Bezos was able to undersell his competitors was that, you know, on the Web, you didn't have to pay sales tax. So how much of an edge did that give him, and how did he use it? JACOBY: Well, Bezos was using an advantage that any new online business had at that point. He just did so very skillfully, which was that online businesses were not subjected to sales tax in the states. And they had a sort of exemption, which was in order to sort of grow this nascent industry online. They had this advantage. So in any given state, it could be that you go and buy a book or you go and buy a kayak, and it's six or seven percent cheaper than it would be in a physical store. And at the time, there were a lot of mom and pop retailers on Main Street or even retailers like Wal-Mart that had a physical presence that were - that had a disadvantage when it came to what Amazon was doing. They had a six or seven percent advantage over physical stores, and they - that was a very important part of an early strategy to what they called get big fast. There was this very early idea that Bezos had, which was that the Internet economy was going to be a land grab, and they had to get big fast. And one of their advantages that they needed to really exploit from early on was the sales tax advantage and be very careful about not opening up in states or having a physical presence in states that charge sales tax. So they strategically set up their warehouses in places - states that didn't charge it but would be across the border from a state that did charge it. So they were really strategic about keeping that advantage for as long as they could. GROSS: So books was the first area Bezos expanded into, and he demanded concessions from publishers whose books he was selling through Amazon. So part of what the publishers were up against is that Amazon basically said, if you don't comply - that Amazon was going to lead customers to cheaper price vendors. And also that - publishers were concerned that Amazon was not only selling their books. Amazon was competing with them. So describe both of those predicaments. JACOBY: One of Bezos' genius moves was to make Amazon into a platform or a marketplace. So there's Amazon the store, which sells you anything from books to electronics, but then he realized - he always had this vision of creating the everything store or the place where people could buy everything. But he couldn't stock all that himself in his store, so he said, all right, well, I'm going to create a platform or a marketplace for other businesses to come sell on amazon. com who had all sorts of goods that he himself didn't stock. So essentially, he owns the platform but also has a store that exists on the platform, that is competing against all the other stores, which is now really the focus of what regulators and anti-trust enforcers are looking at, which is - is it really fair to both own the platform and have all the data that comes with it and the knowledge and be competing with all the other businesses on the platform that you own? And that's really the rub when it comes to Amazon's online business. GROSS: Amazon has always been about, in part, collecting data. And is the data collection so as to better sell to customers, or does Bezos want to use the data for other things, too? JACOBY: The company says that all of the data that it collects is in order to serve customers, and I think the jury's still out on that. And there's certainly businesses that will tell you that Amazon has used the data that they gather on their business and how they're doing business on Amazon to then undercut them in certain ways. If you make a widget that you're selling on Amazon and it's doing really well, the widget-maker will often say, well, Amazon then went straight to our manufacturer in China and started manufacturing our widget itself, and then there goes our business. GROSS: Let's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is James Jacoby. He's the director and the correspondent for Frontline's two-hour documentary \"Amazon Empire: The Rise And Reign Of Jeff Bezos. \" It premieres Tuesday, February 18 on public television. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF NOAM WIESENBERG'S \"DAVKA\")GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is James Jacoby. He's the director of and correspondent for a new Frontline documentary called \"Amazon Empire: The Rise And Reign Of Jeff Bezos. \" It premieres Tuesday on public television. So one of the biggest drivers of Amazon's growth was Amazon Prime. You pay Amazon an annual fee, and you get free two-day shipping for many, but not all goods that you could order on Amazon. So how did Prime become such a big driver of Amazon's growth? JACOBY: Well, it's the idea of a membership program, which isn't new. But what Bezos was promising in those early days was pretty outrageous. A lot of people internally thought it was kind of a crazy idea to - you know, shipping is expensive, and it takes a huge logistical, complicated logistical operation to pull off the idea of two-day, three-day shipping in those days. I mean, this wasn't that long ago, but now we expect things same day. But a few years ago, you know, the idea of two-day shipping was almost ludicrous and that it would be free. So Bezos came up with this idea that as long as you could get something quickly - this is what customers want - then they'd be willing to pay this fee for it. And the idea was to keep them loyal to Amazon, to get them into the Amazon ecosystem, that this would truly be the place where you would buy everything. And so you offer the customer a great incentive to stay there and to make it your go-to shopping destination online, as they put it. And so it was kind of this ingenious move, but it was also wildly expensive for the company because the logistical operations they had to build out were enormous and would take sort of military grade precision in order to deliver on this promise. And part of the reason why Amazon is such a trusted brand in the United States is because they actually do deliver on promises and are incredibly competent in what they do. But it was - it set into motion this huge internal build out, and it's been, you know, wildly popular. I should mention, there's now 150 million Prime numbers, which is just a mind-boggling number. GROSS: Once Bezos developed Amazon Prime, he had to open fulfillment centers, warehouses around the country in order to fulfill the two-day delivery promise. So that created a lot of jobs, but there were complaints from a lot of employees - and you go into this in the documentary - complaints about the working conditions and the speed at which they were expected to work and the constant monitoring of employees to make sure that they were working and working to capacity all the time. So tell us about some of the complaints you heard from employees. JACOBY: Yeah, well, we spoke to dozens of current and former employees in the reporting process. And the nature of the work has changed a bit over the years. When Bezos was first building out these fulfillment centers all over the country in order to deliver on the promise of delivering packages quickly, it was almost ad hoc. It was - they were growing so quickly. And there were a lot of complaints at the time about things like heat stress. I mean, there wouldn't be the proper air conditioning in these warehouses, and people would be working like crazy to try to meet these quotas to get the packages out. People would be fainting in these warehouses. There would be injuries. Over time, the warehouses become much more systematized and in part because of the automation of the warehouses and buying a robot company that helped to automate things. But one thing that hasn't changed in talking to workers, both current and former, is the pace of work is incredibly grueling. You have to make rates. And something we heard from, I'd say, almost every single worker we spoke to was about the rates, that, you know, the rates were really high. They have a way of kind of setting the rates for the whole warehouse that, you know, if you don't make that rate, then you can get a write-up, and if you get three write-ups, then you can be fired. There's a lot of anxiety in these warehouses about making rates. And essentially. . . GROSS: And what is the rate measuring? JACOBY: The rate essentially measures how quickly you pick and pack items. So there's a conveyor belt, and you're picking an item off the conveyor belts or off of kind of a shelf, a very high-tech shelf, and then you're packing it in a box. And so you're measured on that rate and keeping up with that rate. And those rates fluctuate. And the company will say that the rates are reasonable, but a lot of the workers we spoke to say that they're not. GROSS: So, you know, we're talking about the difficult working conditions at a lot of the Amazon fulfillment centers. What Amazon says is, like, look - we raised the pay scale for workers. Workers are getting paid $15 an hour now, which is twice minimum wage or just about twice minimum wage. And Amazon says that's going to - you know, that's going to raise the rates for workers at other places, too. What do workers have to say about that? JACOBY: Workers aren't necessarily complaining about the wages. They're not complaining about the fact that Amazon offers really good medical benefits to their employees. And it's something that Amazon is very quick to point out and rightfully so, that they have raised wages in their warehouses. They understand that these $15 an hour is not a great wage, but it's better - it's twice as good basically than the federal minimum wage. But I think it's really interesting right now. I mean, Jay Carney, who's the former spokesman for President Obama and is now a senior vice president at Amazon, kind of their - Bezos' top spokesperson just had an op-ed in The New York Times recently about saying that they are this industry leader. And even Bernie Sanders called him up and said, look - you know, we applaud you for raising your wages to $15 an hour. That op-ed was written in anticipation of a scathing letter from a bunch of Democratic senators about working conditions. But it - Carney does raise a really important point, which is that Amazon has created more jobs than any other private employer in the country over the past decade and that they are an industry leader in paying these higher wages and that they do give benefits and that, in the absence of government doing anything about raising the minimum wage, they feel like they're filling the void here. The counterargument to that would come from people, you know - for instance, from the unions - who would say, well, in a unionized environment, we'd be able to negotiate even higher wages that may be a living wage in certain parts of the country. So there's a debate about the wages, but that's not - the wages aren't really the main complaint of workers, nor are the benefits. It's more about the nature of the work, and that there really isn't - a lot of workers will tell you there's not really an opportunity to move up in the organization, to get out of these jobs, and they're so grueling, and the turnover is so high. Interestingly, Amazon has kind of taken that complaint to heart, to some degree, that these are sort of these jobs that are kind of go-nowhere jobs. And they've taken it upon themselves to come up with this $700 million upskilling program, where they're essentially paying tuition for, I think, about 100,000 employees to go to college or to go to vocational schools to try to get better jobs. And that also is an interesting model going forward. But it does raise questions about whether that's something that we want to rely on a private company to do or something that government should be doing. GROSS: But the bottom line question still is, is it a manageable job? JACOBY: Well. . . GROSS: Were they pushing people beyond rates that they could actually do? JACOBY: That's the right question to ask, and I think a lot of workers will tell you no, it's not a manageable job to stay in for a very long time. And the more cynical view of the raising the wages to $15 an hour is that unemployment's rather low right now. So it's a tougher market for Amazon to find employees that want to take these grueling jobs, so market conditions forced them to raise the wages; it wasn't necessarily something that they did out of the goodness of their hearts, as an industry leader. It's market conditions that dictated it. Back when unemployment was high, you didn't see them raising wages. So that's what a lot of labor economists will point out to you about this decision to raise it to $15 an hour. DAVIES: We're listening to the interview Terry recorded yesterday with James Jacoby, the correspondent and director of the PBS Frontline documentary \"Amazon Empire: The Rise And Reign Of Jeff Bezos. \" It premieres Tuesday. After a short break, they'll talk about what Amazon didn't disclose when it released Echo and Alexa, the company's listening device and program and why Jeff Bezos has shifted his attention to space exploration. Also, rock critic Ken Tucker will review the new album from singer-songwriter John Moreland. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF CHICK COREA'S \"WORK\")DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross, who's home with a cold. Let's get back to the interview she recorded yesterday with James Jacoby about the new PBS Frontline documentary \"Amazon Empire: The Rise And Reign Of Jeff Bezos. \" Jacoby is the film's director and correspondent. It premieres Tuesday. The documentary investigates how Amazon has disrupted and transformed nearly every aspect of our lives and has come under scrutiny for its tactics and expanding power. GROSS: Let's talk about Alexa. You know, Alexa is the Amazon device that you can talk to and give instructions to. And it can play you something. It can turn something on in your house if it speaks to Alexa, you know if it's on Bluetooth. But Alexa not only listens when you ask it to do something, it's listening to other things, too. And this has become a big concern. So tell us more about Alexa as a listening device and how is what it hears is being used. JACOBY: So Amazon takes issue with describing Alexa as a listening device, but I think that that basically is what it is in that - so there's a distinction to be made. Alexa is the artificial intelligence of Amazon. It's the voice that you are speaking to. The little devices are called an Echo, or they can be embedded in cars now or hotel rooms or even in showers. They've got Alexa - what they call Alexa-enabled devices, and there - it's now compatible, Alexa, the system is compatible with over 100,000 devices, I think. Basically, what's going on is that with the thing in your home, the Echo device, if the microphone is on that Alexa is on, and you say Alexa, she wakes up because she's listening for that word, and then you see the blue light come on. And essentially, after she's awake, she's listening and she's recording. And she's recording so that the artificial intelligence can get smarter. So they use that data that she records in order to make Alexa smarter. So, for instance, you know, if you have a type of accent, accented English, and she's not really understanding what you're saying, what command you're giving her or what question you're asking her, there may be a team of human beings that are listening to that recording to try to understand and train her better to respond to those commands are questions. This was not clearly disclosed to consumers, that there are teams of thousands of people around the world that are listening to the recordings, once she's awake, once that blue light is on, trying to train her better. Now, these are anonymized to some degree, these recordings, and not all recordings are listened to by human beings. But it's a rather jarring thing for people that have these devices to realize that, oh, wow, one, she's actually recording when she's awake and I'm talking to her, and, two, there's a chance that a human being is actually listening, annotating and transcribing what I'm talking about. And we had an interesting exchange in - that's featured in the film with this guy named Robert Frederick. He's one of the founders of Amazon Web Services, their cloud computing company. And he talked about the fact that he approaches his Alexa with caution. He'll - when he wants to have a private moment in his house - he has an Alexa device; he has several - he'll press the button that disables the microphone because he doesn't want to even risk it that somehow she's triggered, she wakes up, and she records a private moment. And he doesn't want those - he doesn't - he wants to eliminate the chance that any sort of private moment could be listened to by another human being, which I think is fair and reasonable. GROSS: So, you know, you talk about in your documentary how Amazon wants to have the entire environment miked. So what other devices has it created or purchased to mike or video our world, your world? JACOBY: So one purchase that Amazon made recently was this company called Ring, and Ring makes these doorbell cameras. That was their first main device. And so you may see them these days, and essentially, it's a doorbell that has a camera on it. And in part, Amazon liked the idea of it because package theft is a big deal for the company, that a lot of people get packages to their door and then someone's stealing that package. So now you can watch your front step. You know, of course, if the camera's watching the front step, it's also watching the public space on the street as well, which is somewhat problematic. But - so there's this - now this whole suite of Ring devices or Ring cameras and not just to monitor the outside of your home, but also the inside of your home. And there was a recent hack of indoor Ring cameras, which was rather frightful, where all of a sudden there's - you know, we show it in the documentary. There's a little girl in her room, and her parents had installed a Ring camera in that room, and all of a sudden there's a voice coming from the camera that's basically terrorizing her as she's alone in her room. And, you know, she's a young girl. And, you know, we feature this moment. It was a hack, and this actually - this hack happened all around the country. And it was a rather embarrassing moment for Amazon, certainly, because here they are saying that these cameras are introduced to make your home more secure, but here's an invasion of privacy that's rather frightening. GROSS: So is Amazon trying to do anything to prevent further hacks? JACOBY: Yes, absolutely. I mean, the company, I think, has tried to investigate what the nature of that hack was. And the executives we spoke to about it say that they're - you know, they're putting new features in. It's - you know, that's one thing, which is to address the actual security of these devices. And we generally do have an issue with the Internet of things - that not all of these devices are secure, not everybody sets them up properly, not everybody is instructed to set them up properly. But the larger issue at hand here is that, in some ways, these devices are being sold as a way to enhance your safety and security, but people aren't necessarily taking into account what they're introducing to their homes, the risks attendant with putting cameras that are connected to networks in their homes and on their doorsteps. GROSS: Let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is James Jacoby. He's the director of and correspondent for the new Frontline documentary, \"Amazon Empire: The Rise And Reign Of Jeff Bezos,\" which premieres Tuesday on PBS. We'll be right back after we take a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF ALLEN TOUSSAINT'S \"EGYPTIAN FANTASY\")GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is James Jacoby. He's the director of and correspondent for Frontline's new two-hour documentary, \"Amazon Empire: The Rise And Reign Of Jeff Bezos,\" which premieres Tuesday on public television. I want to ask you if Amazon is being regulated at all as a monopoly, but I don't even know what to call Amazon. It's not an old-fashioned monopoly. It's the kind of entity that has never existed before. But what are the efforts to consider regulating Amazon? JACOBY: Well, there's a rather robust investigation going on right now in Congress, bipartisan investigation in the subcommittee, antitrust subcommittee, run by David Cicilline. He's a Rhode Island congressman who - where they're really gathering testimony - one, on what it's like for businesses, large and small, to do business with Amazon in the online marketplace, but about their data gathering. They've held hearings about their Web services and what it's like for companies to do business with their Web services. So there's a big information gathering process going on right now in Congress as to, like, what is Amazon, how do they do business? - asking the company questions that it hasn't been asked before - and to try to come up with some way to figure out how to regulate it. And at the same time, the Federal Trade Commission, which has kind of been tasked with enforcing our antitrust laws, they're in the midst of a reexamination of the fact that in their history, they've never brought an action against any of the major tech companies. And they're in the midst of saying, OK, well, what are we going to do? We need to figure out how we enforce antitrust laws with companies like Amazon, Facebook and Google, which are distinctly different in some ways than some of the monopolies of the past. GROSS: You know, when it comes to a government possibly regulating Amazon, there's a couple of questions that enter into the story. One is, like, should it regulate? You know, should government regulate Amazon, and if so, what aspects of it? But there's also the question, is President Trump trying to interfere with Amazon for retribution because Bezos owns The Washington Post, and Trump hates The Washington Post and considers it fake news, and considers The Post a publication that's out to get Trump? So what do you see happening with President Trump and his allies and Amazon? JACOBY: Well, Amazon right now is challenging the fact that they lost this $10 billion contract. They were passed over for it, and it was given to Microsoft. And their challenge is saying that President Trump essentially corrupted the process because he doesn't like Bezos. And he's made it clear that he doesn't like Bezos in Tweets and elsewhere because Bezos owns The Washington Post. It's one of the craziest wrinkles in the whole story, which is that, you know, Bezos bought The Post well before Trump became president or was a candidate for president. But Bezos' ownership of The Washington Post has made him a target for the president's ire. And so it'll be interesting if, for instance, the Federal Trade Commission, which is independent from the president - but still, he appointed the chairman there - whether they take an enforcement action against Amazon, and that in some way that could be construed as a political act. I would urge caution about that. I think that the FTC would probably take that independently. But just the mere fact that that could be insinuated because the president doesn't like Bezos makes for a really interesting time right now when it comes to this. And what's also interesting is that the president raises some valid points about Amazon, you know. And so I think that for some of the critics of Amazon, it's a very strange thing that their criticisms are echoed by President Trump, because those aren't necessarily natural bedfellows. GROSS: Do you think any of the Democratic candidates have interesting proposals for regulating Amazon? JACOBY: Yes. I mean, I think Elizabeth Warren has really been at the forefront of thinking through what to do with Amazon and the other big tech companies. And really, I mean, before she was even running for president really did open up a conversation about the concentration of power, especially monopoly power, among the big tech companies. And, I mean, she's come up, as she does, with a very detailed proposal. But she's also made a big deal of the idea of break them up, which can mean a lot of different things. Essentially, what break them up really means, though, is that - to try to limit the lines of business that Amazon can engage in. So, for instance, Amazon is this platform for online commerce that they themselves are competing on as a store against other stores and retailers. So she has this idea of, maybe they shouldn't be competing on a platform that they own. Maybe they shouldn't be allowed to be doing that because they have an unfair advantage. That's in part what break them up means. And so I think it's certainly something that Congress is going to be considering. And I, you know, I think some of the other candidates have been supportive of that idea, of breaking them up. GROSS: Amazon owns so many companies. Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post. Amazon has contracted with the CIA for cloud computing services. They're selling facial recognition services to police departments. I mean, Amazon is involved with just about everything. And Bezos' big goal is to get into outer space. So let's talk about that for a second. What are his plans? JACOBY: When it comes to Jeff Bezos, he's got two CEOs that are running Amazon. And he has stepped away a bit from the company - I mean, he's helping to expand it into India and other places. But as we understand it, his primary goal is to focus on his company, Blue Origin. And Blue Origin is his space exploration company. It's his rocket ship company. And essentially, it's the fulfillment of something that has been his lifelong goal and plan, which is to, as he puts it, build the infrastructure to go to space and to it make cost-effective for us to figure out what to do in space. And he claims - and I think he's genuine in believing this - that he wants to save planet Earth. And his whole idea is that he doesn't - he wants there to be dynamism and growth. He believes in capitalism. He believes in consumerism. He believes that all of these advancements of energy usage and things that we're doing here are for the better, but obviously, they're hurting the planet, and that we're going to need to look to the heavens, essentially, to figure out how we can continue to live in a world of dynamism and growth. And that, in Jeff Bezos' mind, means we may need to move heavy industry into space. We may need to mine other planets or planetary objects for their resources, or we may need to actually build space colonies. And he is really serious about this. GROSS: Well, it's a complicated vision because - do we want outer space to be owned by a private company? JACOBY: Yeah, I think that that's complicated. I think that there are other - obviously, other very wealthy people that have their space endeavors have similar things in mind. The way that Bezos thinks about it is - he's going to spend a billion dollars of his own fortune every year, pump it into Blue Origin, this company. And by the way, Blue Origin is also seeking out a lot of federal contracts to try to do this, to send satellites up - contracts with the intelligence community, contracts with the Department of Defense, contracts with the - with NASA because even the richest person in the world can't fund this himself. He needs the help of the federal government. GROSS: Did you change your mind about anything pertaining to Amazon or Bezos through the course of doing the documentary? JACOBY: Yeah, I mean, certainly. It's - in the course of reporting this for the past year with my partner, Anya Bourg, and Megan Robertson, who went through every shred of footage of Jeff Bezos over the years to try to kind of see what he was saying as the company was growing - I mean, you can't help but be absolutely astounded by what he's done. I think, though, one of the things that - it just felt for the past year of - like, OK, on one hand, it's amazing, because we're all enjoying these inventions. You know, PBS runs on Amazon Web Services, right? And I am actually - I am a Prime member, you know? So you're dealing with all these conflicts as you go along. But I think that Franklin Foer in the film puts it best, which is, like, everything that's amazing or awesome about Jeff Bezos and Amazon is also something to be feared about Amazon and Jeff Bezos. And that really - at the end of the day, you know, I think what I was surprised by was just how complicated this is - you know, the nature of the power that comes with being such an innovator and such an inventor but also how problematic that is that so much power is pooled into the hands of one company and one man. GROSS: James Jacoby, thank you so much for talking with us. JACOBY: Thank you. DAVIES: James Jacoby spoke with Terry Gross yesterday. He's the correspondent and director of the new \"Frontline\" documentary \"Amazon Empire: The Rise And Reign Of Jeff Bezos. \" It premieres Tuesday on PBS. You can also see it on the PBS Video app and pbs. org/frontline. After we take a short break, Ken Tucker will review the new album from singer-songwriter John Moreland. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MALACHI THOMPSON SONG, \"BLUES FOR A SAINT CALLED LOUIS\") DAVE DAVIES, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross. Amazon started as an online bookseller, but now it not only sells nearly everything. It owns a wide range of companies, including Whole Foods. It's created streaming services, developed facial recognition and surveillance technologies and sold cloud computing services to the CIA. Bezos, the richest man in the world, owns The Washington Post and is developing technology for space travel. A new documentary titled \"Amazon Empire: The Rise And Reign Of Jeff Bezos\" will premiere on PBS next Tuesday as part of \"Frontline,\" the investigative documentary series. Our guest is the film's director and correspondent, James Jacoby, who worked with producers Anya Bourg and Megan Robertson. The documentary investigates how Amazon has disrupted and transformed nearly every aspect of our lives and has come under scrutiny for its tactics and expanding power. Terry spoke with James Jacoby yesterday, and as you'll hear, she has a cold. Here's her interview. TERRY GROSS, BYLINE: James Jacoby, welcome to FRESH AIR. JAMES JACOBY: Thank you so much. GROSS: So let's start with - how big is Amazon? JACOBY: It's very big. It's a trillion-dollar company, and it's a company that really extends in a lot of different directions. And so it's not just the online e-commerce company that a lot of us interact with on a very regular basis. It's also the largest cloud computing company in the world. It has a - does about a third of the cloud computing, which means the sort of digital infrastructure of the Internet and storing and managing the data of millions of companies out there and governments and academic institutions. It's a streaming service. It's a big Hollywood producer. It owns Whole Foods. The reach of Amazon in many different directions is tremendous. And it's certainly - by, you know, the market standards, it's one of the largest companies in the world. GROSS: So Jeff Bezos started his career at a hedge fund. Why did he look to the Web? JACOBY: Well, he started his career at D. E. Shaw, which was a hedge fund in New York, a rather secretive hedge fund started by a computer scientist named David Shaw. And Shaw was one of the first traders on Wall Street that used data and algorithmic trading. And Jeff Bezos was recently - rather recently out of Princeton, had studied computer science and engineering. And he - Shaw had taken on a lot of people like Bezos, who were real QuantMinds, and applying that type of scientific mind to Wall Street trading. And he had tasked Bezos at the time with looking into new major business opportunities, including - this is the mid-'90s - including looking at the World Wide Web, the Internet, which was in its nascent stages at that point, at least for commercial purposes. And Bezos recognized this startling statistic, which is - essentially, it was growing at 2,300% a year. And as he puts it in his own words, he says, you know, that things only grow at that rate in Petri dishes. It's really something you rarely see. And he saw an opportunity there that this was going to be the next big thing and that he needed to figure out a way in. And his way in was selling books online. GROSS: Yeah, why was it books? Bezos never intended Amazon to be just a bookstore, so why did he start with books? JACOBY: There's a number of reasons why he started with books. First of all, books are easy to ship. They don't really get hurt in shipping. And he also realized that in the online world, there would be an advantage that no single bookstore could hold all of the books in print. But if you had an online bookstore, you could basically get any book to a customer. You'd have to just source it, find it and get it to a customer. He also, I think, saw an opportunity to learn about customers through what they read. He recognized very early on the power of data kind of to predict what people would want. So in many ways, you are what you read. And you could glean a lot about a customer from what he or she reads. GROSS: Amazon lost money for a really long time. Was it 20 years? JACOBY: Yeah, it was about 20 years. I don't have the exact number, but it was - for roughly 20 years, Amazon was losing money. It was unprofitable. Yeah. GROSS: But that didn't stop people from investing in it, and it didn't stop Jeff Bezos from building his empire. What was his strategy, realizing that he was going to give up making profits in order to gain market share? JACOBY: Yeah, he had - Jeff Bezos really came at Wall Street and investors with a big idea pitch at the time. And he spelled it out, actually, in 1997 with the company's first shareholder letter, where he basically lays out a vision that he still cites to this day, which is that we're not going to really pay attention to the vicissitudes of the market. We're not going to pay attention too much to our share price or to Wall Street reactions. What - really, what we want is to play a very long game, which, as we know, is not necessarily the Wall Street game. Wall Street's interested in quarterly earnings, and Wall Street investors can be rather fickle if you have a bad quarter. He wasn't going to play that game. He was going to say, come along with me. I have a plan to basically gain market share in this burgeoning economy online. Part of that means I'm going to have to reinvest every single dollar back into building infrastructure, digital infrastructure, keeping prices low. And that - if I stick to that strategy, the nature of this new marketplace is that I will win, and you should come along with me. And Wall Street - it wasn't always an easy ride with Wall Street. But investors really did stick with him and obviously have been very handsomely rewarded over the years. GROSS: One of the reasons why Bezos was able to undersell his competitors was that, you know, on the Web, you didn't have to pay sales tax. So how much of an edge did that give him, and how did he use it? JACOBY: Well, Bezos was using an advantage that any new online business had at that point. He just did so very skillfully, which was that online businesses were not subjected to sales tax in the states. And they had a sort of exemption, which was in order to sort of grow this nascent industry online. They had this advantage. So in any given state, it could be that you go and buy a book or you go and buy a kayak, and it's six or seven percent cheaper than it would be in a physical store. And at the time, there were a lot of mom and pop retailers on Main Street or even retailers like Wal-Mart that had a physical presence that were - that had a disadvantage when it came to what Amazon was doing. They had a six or seven percent advantage over physical stores, and they - that was a very important part of an early strategy to what they called get big fast. There was this very early idea that Bezos had, which was that the Internet economy was going to be a land grab, and they had to get big fast. And one of their advantages that they needed to really exploit from early on was the sales tax advantage and be very careful about not opening up in states or having a physical presence in states that charge sales tax. So they strategically set up their warehouses in places - states that didn't charge it but would be across the border from a state that did charge it. So they were really strategic about keeping that advantage for as long as they could. GROSS: So books was the first area Bezos expanded into, and he demanded concessions from publishers whose books he was selling through Amazon. So part of what the publishers were up against is that Amazon basically said, if you don't comply - that Amazon was going to lead customers to cheaper price vendors. And also that - publishers were concerned that Amazon was not only selling their books. Amazon was competing with them. So describe both of those predicaments. JACOBY: One of Bezos' genius moves was to make Amazon into a platform or a marketplace. So there's Amazon the store, which sells you anything from books to electronics, but then he realized - he always had this vision of creating the everything store or the place where people could buy everything. But he couldn't stock all that himself in his store, so he said, all right, well, I'm going to create a platform or a marketplace for other businesses to come sell on amazon. com who had all sorts of goods that he himself didn't stock. So essentially, he owns the platform but also has a store that exists on the platform, that is competing against all the other stores, which is now really the focus of what regulators and anti-trust enforcers are looking at, which is - is it really fair to both own the platform and have all the data that comes with it and the knowledge and be competing with all the other businesses on the platform that you own? And that's really the rub when it comes to Amazon's online business. GROSS: Amazon has always been about, in part, collecting data. And is the data collection so as to better sell to customers, or does Bezos want to use the data for other things, too? JACOBY: The company says that all of the data that it collects is in order to serve customers, and I think the jury's still out on that. And there's certainly businesses that will tell you that Amazon has used the data that they gather on their business and how they're doing business on Amazon to then undercut them in certain ways. If you make a widget that you're selling on Amazon and it's doing really well, the widget-maker will often say, well, Amazon then went straight to our manufacturer in China and started manufacturing our widget itself, and then there goes our business. GROSS: Let's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is James Jacoby. He's the director and the correspondent for Frontline's two-hour documentary \"Amazon Empire: The Rise And Reign Of Jeff Bezos. \" It premieres Tuesday, February 18 on public television. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF NOAM WIESENBERG'S \"DAVKA\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is James Jacoby. He's the director of and correspondent for a new Frontline documentary called \"Amazon Empire: The Rise And Reign Of Jeff Bezos. \" It premieres Tuesday on public television. So one of the biggest drivers of Amazon's growth was Amazon Prime. You pay Amazon an annual fee, and you get free two-day shipping for many, but not all goods that you could order on Amazon. So how did Prime become such a big driver of Amazon's growth? JACOBY: Well, it's the idea of a membership program, which isn't new. But what Bezos was promising in those early days was pretty outrageous. A lot of people internally thought it was kind of a crazy idea to - you know, shipping is expensive, and it takes a huge logistical, complicated logistical operation to pull off the idea of two-day, three-day shipping in those days. I mean, this wasn't that long ago, but now we expect things same day. But a few years ago, you know, the idea of two-day shipping was almost ludicrous and that it would be free. So Bezos came up with this idea that as long as you could get something quickly - this is what customers want - then they'd be willing to pay this fee for it. And the idea was to keep them loyal to Amazon, to get them into the Amazon ecosystem, that this would truly be the place where you would buy everything. And so you offer the customer a great incentive to stay there and to make it your go-to shopping destination online, as they put it. And so it was kind of this ingenious move, but it was also wildly expensive for the company because the logistical operations they had to build out were enormous and would take sort of military grade precision in order to deliver on this promise. And part of the reason why Amazon is such a trusted brand in the United States is because they actually do deliver on promises and are incredibly competent in what they do. But it was - it set into motion this huge internal build out, and it's been, you know, wildly popular. I should mention, there's now 150 million Prime numbers, which is just a mind-boggling number. GROSS: Once Bezos developed Amazon Prime, he had to open fulfillment centers, warehouses around the country in order to fulfill the two-day delivery promise. So that created a lot of jobs, but there were complaints from a lot of employees - and you go into this in the documentary - complaints about the working conditions and the speed at which they were expected to work and the constant monitoring of employees to make sure that they were working and working to capacity all the time. So tell us about some of the complaints you heard from employees. JACOBY: Yeah, well, we spoke to dozens of current and former employees in the reporting process. And the nature of the work has changed a bit over the years. When Bezos was first building out these fulfillment centers all over the country in order to deliver on the promise of delivering packages quickly, it was almost ad hoc. It was - they were growing so quickly. And there were a lot of complaints at the time about things like heat stress. I mean, there wouldn't be the proper air conditioning in these warehouses, and people would be working like crazy to try to meet these quotas to get the packages out. People would be fainting in these warehouses. There would be injuries. Over time, the warehouses become much more systematized and in part because of the automation of the warehouses and buying a robot company that helped to automate things. But one thing that hasn't changed in talking to workers, both current and former, is the pace of work is incredibly grueling. You have to make rates. And something we heard from, I'd say, almost every single worker we spoke to was about the rates, that, you know, the rates were really high. They have a way of kind of setting the rates for the whole warehouse that, you know, if you don't make that rate, then you can get a write-up, and if you get three write-ups, then you can be fired. There's a lot of anxiety in these warehouses about making rates. And essentially. . . GROSS: And what is the rate measuring? JACOBY: The rate essentially measures how quickly you pick and pack items. So there's a conveyor belt, and you're picking an item off the conveyor belts or off of kind of a shelf, a very high-tech shelf, and then you're packing it in a box. And so you're measured on that rate and keeping up with that rate. And those rates fluctuate. And the company will say that the rates are reasonable, but a lot of the workers we spoke to say that they're not. GROSS: So, you know, we're talking about the difficult working conditions at a lot of the Amazon fulfillment centers. What Amazon says is, like, look - we raised the pay scale for workers. Workers are getting paid $15 an hour now, which is twice minimum wage or just about twice minimum wage. And Amazon says that's going to - you know, that's going to raise the rates for workers at other places, too. What do workers have to say about that? JACOBY: Workers aren't necessarily complaining about the wages. They're not complaining about the fact that Amazon offers really good medical benefits to their employees. And it's something that Amazon is very quick to point out and rightfully so, that they have raised wages in their warehouses. They understand that these $15 an hour is not a great wage, but it's better - it's twice as good basically than the federal minimum wage. But I think it's really interesting right now. I mean, Jay Carney, who's the former spokesman for President Obama and is now a senior vice president at Amazon, kind of their - Bezos' top spokesperson just had an op-ed in The New York Times recently about saying that they are this industry leader. And even Bernie Sanders called him up and said, look - you know, we applaud you for raising your wages to $15 an hour. That op-ed was written in anticipation of a scathing letter from a bunch of Democratic senators about working conditions. But it - Carney does raise a really important point, which is that Amazon has created more jobs than any other private employer in the country over the past decade and that they are an industry leader in paying these higher wages and that they do give benefits and that, in the absence of government doing anything about raising the minimum wage, they feel like they're filling the void here. The counterargument to that would come from people, you know - for instance, from the unions - who would say, well, in a unionized environment, we'd be able to negotiate even higher wages that may be a living wage in certain parts of the country. So there's a debate about the wages, but that's not - the wages aren't really the main complaint of workers, nor are the benefits. It's more about the nature of the work, and that there really isn't - a lot of workers will tell you there's not really an opportunity to move up in the organization, to get out of these jobs, and they're so grueling, and the turnover is so high. Interestingly, Amazon has kind of taken that complaint to heart, to some degree, that these are sort of these jobs that are kind of go-nowhere jobs. And they've taken it upon themselves to come up with this $700 million upskilling program, where they're essentially paying tuition for, I think, about 100,000 employees to go to college or to go to vocational schools to try to get better jobs. And that also is an interesting model going forward. But it does raise questions about whether that's something that we want to rely on a private company to do or something that government should be doing. GROSS: But the bottom line question still is, is it a manageable job? JACOBY: Well. . . GROSS: Were they pushing people beyond rates that they could actually do? JACOBY: That's the right question to ask, and I think a lot of workers will tell you no, it's not a manageable job to stay in for a very long time. And the more cynical view of the raising the wages to $15 an hour is that unemployment's rather low right now. So it's a tougher market for Amazon to find employees that want to take these grueling jobs, so market conditions forced them to raise the wages; it wasn't necessarily something that they did out of the goodness of their hearts, as an industry leader. It's market conditions that dictated it. Back when unemployment was high, you didn't see them raising wages. So that's what a lot of labor economists will point out to you about this decision to raise it to $15 an hour. DAVIES: We're listening to the interview Terry recorded yesterday with James Jacoby, the correspondent and director of the PBS Frontline documentary \"Amazon Empire: The Rise And Reign Of Jeff Bezos. \" It premieres Tuesday. After a short break, they'll talk about what Amazon didn't disclose when it released Echo and Alexa, the company's listening device and program and why Jeff Bezos has shifted his attention to space exploration. Also, rock critic Ken Tucker will review the new album from singer-songwriter John Moreland. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF CHICK COREA'S \"WORK\") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross, who's home with a cold. Let's get back to the interview she recorded yesterday with James Jacoby about the new PBS Frontline documentary \"Amazon Empire: The Rise And Reign Of Jeff Bezos. \" Jacoby is the film's director and correspondent. It premieres Tuesday. The documentary investigates how Amazon has disrupted and transformed nearly every aspect of our lives and has come under scrutiny for its tactics and expanding power. GROSS: Let's talk about Alexa. You know, Alexa is the Amazon device that you can talk to and give instructions to. And it can play you something. It can turn something on in your house if it speaks to Alexa, you know if it's on Bluetooth. But Alexa not only listens when you ask it to do something, it's listening to other things, too. And this has become a big concern. So tell us more about Alexa as a listening device and how is what it hears is being used. JACOBY: So Amazon takes issue with describing Alexa as a listening device, but I think that that basically is what it is in that - so there's a distinction to be made. Alexa is the artificial intelligence of Amazon. It's the voice that you are speaking to. The little devices are called an Echo, or they can be embedded in cars now or hotel rooms or even in showers. They've got Alexa - what they call Alexa-enabled devices, and there - it's now compatible, Alexa, the system is compatible with over 100,000 devices, I think. Basically, what's going on is that with the thing in your home, the Echo device, if the microphone is on that Alexa is on, and you say Alexa, she wakes up because she's listening for that word, and then you see the blue light come on. And essentially, after she's awake, she's listening and she's recording. And she's recording so that the artificial intelligence can get smarter. So they use that data that she records in order to make Alexa smarter. So, for instance, you know, if you have a type of accent, accented English, and she's not really understanding what you're saying, what command you're giving her or what question you're asking her, there may be a team of human beings that are listening to that recording to try to understand and train her better to respond to those commands are questions. This was not clearly disclosed to consumers, that there are teams of thousands of people around the world that are listening to the recordings, once she's awake, once that blue light is on, trying to train her better. Now, these are anonymized to some degree, these recordings, and not all recordings are listened to by human beings. But it's a rather jarring thing for people that have these devices to realize that, oh, wow, one, she's actually recording when she's awake and I'm talking to her, and, two, there's a chance that a human being is actually listening, annotating and transcribing what I'm talking about. And we had an interesting exchange in - that's featured in the film with this guy named Robert Frederick. He's one of the founders of Amazon Web Services, their cloud computing company. And he talked about the fact that he approaches his Alexa with caution. He'll - when he wants to have a private moment in his house - he has an Alexa device; he has several - he'll press the button that disables the microphone because he doesn't want to even risk it that somehow she's triggered, she wakes up, and she records a private moment. And he doesn't want those - he doesn't - he wants to eliminate the chance that any sort of private moment could be listened to by another human being, which I think is fair and reasonable. GROSS: So, you know, you talk about in your documentary how Amazon wants to have the entire environment miked. So what other devices has it created or purchased to mike or video our world, your world? JACOBY: So one purchase that Amazon made recently was this company called Ring, and Ring makes these doorbell cameras. That was their first main device. And so you may see them these days, and essentially, it's a doorbell that has a camera on it. And in part, Amazon liked the idea of it because package theft is a big deal for the company, that a lot of people get packages to their door and then someone's stealing that package. So now you can watch your front step. You know, of course, if the camera's watching the front step, it's also watching the public space on the street as well, which is somewhat problematic. But - so there's this - now this whole suite of Ring devices or Ring cameras and not just to monitor the outside of your home, but also the inside of your home. And there was a recent hack of indoor Ring cameras, which was rather frightful, where all of a sudden there's - you know, we show it in the documentary. There's a little girl in her room, and her parents had installed a Ring camera in that room, and all of a sudden there's a voice coming from the camera that's basically terrorizing her as she's alone in her room. And, you know, she's a young girl. And, you know, we feature this moment. It was a hack, and this actually - this hack happened all around the country. And it was a rather embarrassing moment for Amazon, certainly, because here they are saying that these cameras are introduced to make your home more secure, but here's an invasion of privacy that's rather frightening. GROSS: So is Amazon trying to do anything to prevent further hacks? JACOBY: Yes, absolutely. I mean, the company, I think, has tried to investigate what the nature of that hack was. And the executives we spoke to about it say that they're - you know, they're putting new features in. It's - you know, that's one thing, which is to address the actual security of these devices. And we generally do have an issue with the Internet of things - that not all of these devices are secure, not everybody sets them up properly, not everybody is instructed to set them up properly. But the larger issue at hand here is that, in some ways, these devices are being sold as a way to enhance your safety and security, but people aren't necessarily taking into account what they're introducing to their homes, the risks attendant with putting cameras that are connected to networks in their homes and on their doorsteps. GROSS: Let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is James Jacoby. He's the director of and correspondent for the new Frontline documentary, \"Amazon Empire: The Rise And Reign Of Jeff Bezos,\" which premieres Tuesday on PBS. We'll be right back after we take a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF ALLEN TOUSSAINT'S \"EGYPTIAN FANTASY\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is James Jacoby. He's the director of and correspondent for Frontline's new two-hour documentary, \"Amazon Empire: The Rise And Reign Of Jeff Bezos,\" which premieres Tuesday on public television. I want to ask you if Amazon is being regulated at all as a monopoly, but I don't even know what to call Amazon. It's not an old-fashioned monopoly. It's the kind of entity that has never existed before. But what are the efforts to consider regulating Amazon? JACOBY: Well, there's a rather robust investigation going on right now in Congress, bipartisan investigation in the subcommittee, antitrust subcommittee, run by David Cicilline. He's a Rhode Island congressman who - where they're really gathering testimony - one, on what it's like for businesses, large and small, to do business with Amazon in the online marketplace, but about their data gathering. They've held hearings about their Web services and what it's like for companies to do business with their Web services. So there's a big information gathering process going on right now in Congress as to, like, what is Amazon, how do they do business? - asking the company questions that it hasn't been asked before - and to try to come up with some way to figure out how to regulate it. And at the same time, the Federal Trade Commission, which has kind of been tasked with enforcing our antitrust laws, they're in the midst of a reexamination of the fact that in their history, they've never brought an action against any of the major tech companies. And they're in the midst of saying, OK, well, what are we going to do? We need to figure out how we enforce antitrust laws with companies like Amazon, Facebook and Google, which are distinctly different in some ways than some of the monopolies of the past. GROSS: You know, when it comes to a government possibly regulating Amazon, there's a couple of questions that enter into the story. One is, like, should it regulate? You know, should government regulate Amazon, and if so, what aspects of it? But there's also the question, is President Trump trying to interfere with Amazon for retribution because Bezos owns The Washington Post, and Trump hates The Washington Post and considers it fake news, and considers The Post a publication that's out to get Trump? So what do you see happening with President Trump and his allies and Amazon? JACOBY: Well, Amazon right now is challenging the fact that they lost this $10 billion contract. They were passed over for it, and it was given to Microsoft. And their challenge is saying that President Trump essentially corrupted the process because he doesn't like Bezos. And he's made it clear that he doesn't like Bezos in Tweets and elsewhere because Bezos owns The Washington Post. It's one of the craziest wrinkles in the whole story, which is that, you know, Bezos bought The Post well before Trump became president or was a candidate for president. But Bezos' ownership of The Washington Post has made him a target for the president's ire. And so it'll be interesting if, for instance, the Federal Trade Commission, which is independent from the president - but still, he appointed the chairman there - whether they take an enforcement action against Amazon, and that in some way that could be construed as a political act. I would urge caution about that. I think that the FTC would probably take that independently. But just the mere fact that that could be insinuated because the president doesn't like Bezos makes for a really interesting time right now when it comes to this. And what's also interesting is that the president raises some valid points about Amazon, you know. And so I think that for some of the critics of Amazon, it's a very strange thing that their criticisms are echoed by President Trump, because those aren't necessarily natural bedfellows. GROSS: Do you think any of the Democratic candidates have interesting proposals for regulating Amazon? JACOBY: Yes. I mean, I think Elizabeth Warren has really been at the forefront of thinking through what to do with Amazon and the other big tech companies. And really, I mean, before she was even running for president really did open up a conversation about the concentration of power, especially monopoly power, among the big tech companies. And, I mean, she's come up, as she does, with a very detailed proposal. But she's also made a big deal of the idea of break them up, which can mean a lot of different things. Essentially, what break them up really means, though, is that - to try to limit the lines of business that Amazon can engage in. So, for instance, Amazon is this platform for online commerce that they themselves are competing on as a store against other stores and retailers. So she has this idea of, maybe they shouldn't be competing on a platform that they own. Maybe they shouldn't be allowed to be doing that because they have an unfair advantage. That's in part what break them up means. And so I think it's certainly something that Congress is going to be considering. And I, you know, I think some of the other candidates have been supportive of that idea, of breaking them up. GROSS: Amazon owns so many companies. Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post. Amazon has contracted with the CIA for cloud computing services. They're selling facial recognition services to police departments. I mean, Amazon is involved with just about everything. And Bezos' big goal is to get into outer space. So let's talk about that for a second. What are his plans? JACOBY: When it comes to Jeff Bezos, he's got two CEOs that are running Amazon. And he has stepped away a bit from the company - I mean, he's helping to expand it into India and other places. But as we understand it, his primary goal is to focus on his company, Blue Origin. And Blue Origin is his space exploration company. It's his rocket ship company. And essentially, it's the fulfillment of something that has been his lifelong goal and plan, which is to, as he puts it, build the infrastructure to go to space and to it make cost-effective for us to figure out what to do in space. And he claims - and I think he's genuine in believing this - that he wants to save planet Earth. And his whole idea is that he doesn't - he wants there to be dynamism and growth. He believes in capitalism. He believes in consumerism. He believes that all of these advancements of energy usage and things that we're doing here are for the better, but obviously, they're hurting the planet, and that we're going to need to look to the heavens, essentially, to figure out how we can continue to live in a world of dynamism and growth. And that, in Jeff Bezos' mind, means we may need to move heavy industry into space. We may need to mine other planets or planetary objects for their resources, or we may need to actually build space colonies. And he is really serious about this. GROSS: Well, it's a complicated vision because - do we want outer space to be owned by a private company? JACOBY: Yeah, I think that that's complicated. I think that there are other - obviously, other very wealthy people that have their space endeavors have similar things in mind. The way that Bezos thinks about it is - he's going to spend a billion dollars of his own fortune every year, pump it into Blue Origin, this company. And by the way, Blue Origin is also seeking out a lot of federal contracts to try to do this, to send satellites up - contracts with the intelligence community, contracts with the Department of Defense, contracts with the - with NASA because even the richest person in the world can't fund this himself. He needs the help of the federal government. GROSS: Did you change your mind about anything pertaining to Amazon or Bezos through the course of doing the documentary? JACOBY: Yeah, I mean, certainly. It's - in the course of reporting this for the past year with my partner, Anya Bourg, and Megan Robertson, who went through every shred of footage of Jeff Bezos over the years to try to kind of see what he was saying as the company was growing - I mean, you can't help but be absolutely astounded by what he's done. I think, though, one of the things that - it just felt for the past year of - like, OK, on one hand, it's amazing, because we're all enjoying these inventions. You know, PBS runs on Amazon Web Services, right? And I am actually - I am a Prime member, you know? So you're dealing with all these conflicts as you go along. But I think that Franklin Foer in the film puts it best, which is, like, everything that's amazing or awesome about Jeff Bezos and Amazon is also something to be feared about Amazon and Jeff Bezos. And that really - at the end of the day, you know, I think what I was surprised by was just how complicated this is - you know, the nature of the power that comes with being such an innovator and such an inventor but also how problematic that is that so much power is pooled into the hands of one company and one man. GROSS: James Jacoby, thank you so much for talking with us. JACOBY: Thank you. DAVIES: James Jacoby spoke with Terry Gross yesterday. He's the correspondent and director of the new \"Frontline\" documentary \"Amazon Empire: The Rise And Reign Of Jeff Bezos. \" It premieres Tuesday on PBS. You can also see it on the PBS Video app and pbs. org/frontline. After we take a short break, Ken Tucker will review the new album from singer-songwriter John Moreland. This is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)AMANDA ARONCZYK, HOST: Just a quick note - there is some swearing in this show. JAMIE BARTLETT: The minute you look into the story, you become instantly addicted to it. And it becomes an obsession. So it's weekends, evenings. I mean, I've got to be honest, I'm still completely consumed. ARONCZYK: This is Jamie Bartlett. He's a writer and a journalist. And a few years ago, he wrote a book called \"The Dark Net: Inside The Digital Underworld. \"BARTLETT: So I spent a couple of years of my life on darknet drugs markets, you know, troll forums and neo-Nazi groups really trying to get to grips with the hidden underbelly of the Internet. ARONCZYK: So while he was researching, he found online markets for organic fair-trade cocaine, stolen credit card data, illegal pornography - you know, all those things that you can't go pick up at Costco. And then in 2018, he was approached by a producer from the BBC named Georgia Catt. And she had this story that she thought might interest him. And it wasn't like anything he'd ever run into before. It's a story about a woman with an online empire and a massive, massive following - like, stadium-filling following. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Let's give a warm applause for our creator, our founder, our lovely Dr. Ruja. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"GIRL ON FIRE\")ALICIA KEYS: (Singing) This girl is on fire. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Ruja. . . (APPLAUSE)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Ruja. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"GIRL ON FIRE\")KEYS: (Singing) This girl is on fire. . . ARONCZYK: This is a video shot on June 11, 2016, at Wembley Arena in London. BARTLETT: Picture the scene. This is an enormous, packed arena, thousands of cheering fans. ARONCZYK: Actual fire shoots up from the stage. Then out walks this woman. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RUJA IGNATOVA: Thank you. ARONCZYK: She's wearing a floor-length red ball gown. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)IGNATOVA: Thank you so much. BARTLETT: She's incredibly well-groomed, well-dressed, long flowing black hair, incredibly expensive jewelry, brooches, dangling earrings. I mean, she looks incredibly wealthy. But she's also sort of incredibly mysterious in some ways as well. There's something about her, I think, that you can't quite - you can't fully understand. ARONCZYK: Her name is Ruja Ignatova, and people call her Dr. Ruja. And while she's not a doctor-doctor, she does have a Ph. D. in law. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)IGNATOVA: This network was created to become and to fuel the growth of OneCoin. ARONCZYK: So Jamie learns that Dr. Ruja is a 36-year-old Bulgarian German businesswoman. And she's come to Wembley Arena to spread the gospel about OneCoin. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)IGNATOVA: OneCoin is easy to use. OneCoin is for everyone, make payments everywhere, everyone globally. And this is. . . ARONCZYK: OneCoin is a new cryptocurrency. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)IGNATOVA: . . . Because this coin is going to be No. 1 worldwide. (APPLAUSE)ARONCZYK: But Jamie, this guy who who knows a lot about cryptocurrencies, he's never heard of OneCoin. He and Georgia team up, and they start to investigate together. Over the last year, how much of your time has been spent thinking about Dr. Ruja and OneCoin? BARTLETT: All of it, pretty much nonstop. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ARONCZYK: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Amanda Aronczyk. Jamie Bartlett and producer Georgia Catt from the BBC have been investigating the bizarre story of Dr. Ruja and OneCoin. Today on the show - one of my favorite stories of this past year - there's greed and corruption and cult-like devotion. And just when you think you understand what's going on, you realize you have no clue. (SOUNDBITE OF SHARINE O'NEILL SONG, \"ONE FOR ALL\")ARONCZYK: Jamie, is this a song about OneCoin? BARTLETT: (Laughter) It's one of many songs about OneCoin. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"ONE FOR ALL\")SHARINE O'NEILL: (Singing) We all around the world are changing the way happy people all around changing the way to pay. BARTLETT: You've got to remember, this is 2015, '16, '17. There's so much enthusiasm that we were on the cusp of this brand-new way of thinking about money. And Dr. Ruja Ignatova really tapped into that. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"ONE FOR ALL\")O'NEILL: (Singing) . . . Revolution, a currency for everyone. ARONCZYK: When Jamie started investigating OneCoin, this is one of the first things he learned. Dr. Ruja was presenting herself as a hero, this genius who had founded a new cryptocurrency that was going to be bigger than Bitcoin. But unlike Bitcoin, her currency wouldn't be for some small group that understands the technology or got in early. She was going to share it with the masses, help real people take control of money away from big banks, away from governments. She was going to lead a financial revolution for the people. BARTLETT: Fans of hers would just write poetry, write music about her. They'd almost - they'd really sort of worship the woman. We heard a lot of songs that had been dedicated to Ruja. That was one of many. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"ONE FOR ALL\")O'NEILL: (Singing) . . . People all around carrying financial solution. ARONCZYK: There are all these fans and this whole community online. And Jamie's trying to figure out, well, who are these people in real life? One of the first people he finds is a Scottish woman in her late 40s. Her name is Jen McAdam. Her father had recently passed away, and he'd left her about 10,000 euros. BARTLETT: So a friend of hers had heard about this new cryptocurrency, OneCoin, and heard about Dr. Ruja and then emailed Jen and said, hey, have you seen this? You know that money that your father left you? This could be a place to invest it. ARONCZYK: So Jen McAdam goes online. She watches some videos, and she's impressed. JEN MCADAM: Ruja - she's a doctor, and she has her Ph. D. She worked with McKinsey and Co. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)IGNATOVA: Thank you very much for the invitation to be a speaker at the Economist Forum today and to speak about the future of. . . MCADAM: I think when I saw her at the Economist summit, that did it for me. The Economist (laughter) - being a businesswoman previously, I thought, that's amazing. Power of the woman - well done. I felt proud of her. ARONCZYK: Jen then watches a webinar about OneCoin, and it seems so clear she's getting in early on this amazing investment. MCADAM: By the time you come off that webinar, you're actually thinking - oh, my goodness - I suppose I could try a thousand-euro package - because it was euros at the time - and then see how it goes. And that's what I did. ARONCZYK: So here's how this worked. Jen went to the OneCoin website, and she was directed to buy one of these packages that they offer. BARTLETT: And these packages are priced between, I think, 500 euros up to over a hundred thousand euros for a package. And technically, you are buying education. ARONCZYK: Actually, just some PDFs with info about cryptocurrencies. BARTLETT: And with each of those packages - they're differently priced - you receive things called tokens, and those tokens can then be transformed into OneCoin. ARONCZYK: So Jen gets her own OneCoin account. She buys a thousand-euro package. Every time she logs in, she sees the value of her OneCoin going up and up and up. MCADAM: When you think you're changing your life financially and your hardships are over - yeah, I remember that as clear as day. BARTLETT: Were you quite excited? You know, were you excited? MCADAM: So excited, so excited. So was my friend. ARONCZYK: She had told all of her friends and family about it, and she would make a commission when her friends invested, too. MCADAM: We were going to go on holiday. I remember going down to visit her afterward. We thought we would change our lives. We thought that we'd changed all of our family lives. ARONCZYK: Around the time that he meets Jen McAdam, Jamie gets a tip about OneCoin - that OneCoin has as many as a million investors - a million people like Jen McAdam, people who have OneCoin accounts and have invested some money. BARTLETT: This is going to blow you away. But we were shown documents - we were leaked documents that estimate that the total amount invested into OneCoin between 2014 and early 2017 is well over 4 billion euros. And it could be as high as 15 billion euros. ARONCZYK: At least $5 billion and possibly much, much more - and that's just from this one three-year period. And the money is coming in from all over. BARTLETT: From something like 175 countries in the world. ARONCZYK: A hundred and seventy-five countries. BARTLETT: Yeah. I mean, every corner of the globe - people from Palestine; people from the Congo; people from the Vatican; America, of course; China - hundreds of millions of dollars, euros invested from China. ARONCZYK: So then Jamie's wondering - well, how did this get so big so fast? It's this question that leads him to the mansion of a man who seemingly has everything. BARTLETT: Can I just quickly ask you about this enormous bear? IGOR ALBERTS: (Laughter). ARONCZYK: This is the home of Igor Alberts and his wife Andreea Cimbala. They have a massive garden surrounding their massive, eight-story mansion just outside of Amsterdam. ALBERTS: We have panthers, rhinos, giraffes. BARTLETT: When you walk into his garden, there's 30 or 40 fiberglass, lifesize animal sculptures from all the different places in the world that he's been to. ALBERTS: We have gorillas from Uganda. BARTLETT: You've got pelicans. You've got giraffes. ALBERTS: This is the house of dreams. And it's - it is a kingdom. ARONCZYK: Jamie says that Igor Alberts is a big Dutch guy. He's probably in his mid-50s. And he's larger than life in almost every single way. For example, there's the way that he is dressed. BARTLETT: Everything he wore was black and gold Dolce and Gabbana - socks, pants, shoes, sunglasses, waistcoats. ALBERTS: But when you look at my clothes, they are disciplined. ANDREEA CIMBALA: Everything - he has socks and pink underwear. And if he dresses in pink, he will dress in pink everything. ALBERTS: I have it in everything. ARONCZYK: The Siberian tiger statues, the outfits, the Maserati parked by the gate - if this seems like an ostentatious display of wealth, that is because it is. Igor Alberts and his wife want to look very rich because they're both experts at what's known as multilevel marketing. BARTLETT: People are probably familiar with this, with certain cosmetic products and vitamin tablets. And there's a lot of this kind of multilevel marketing around. ARONCZYK: Amway works like this, and so does Herbalife and Avon. People sell the products to their friends and their families. But more importantly, they try to recruit their friends and families to sell the product, too. That's how they make a commission. So you want to look like you're making a lot of money off of selling that product. BARTLETT: It's a huge industry. There's millions of people around the world doing this. ARONCZYK: And OneCoin is a great product for multilevel marketers because unlike selling bottles of vitamins, you don't have to store thousands of boxes of the stuff in your garage. A cryptocurrency doesn't need to be boxed or transported. BARTLETT: But Dr. Ruja Ignatova's genius was to realize that she could take her cryptocurrency and market it through existing multilevel marketing networks. ARONCZYK: Networks of salespeople who knew how to sell physical products, they could sell a virtual currency even faster. BARTLETT: And it took off like wildfire. There are people that had worked in multilevel marketing all their lives. They'd never seen anything like it. They'd never seen a product grow like it. ARONCZYK: And one of the best-known sellers is this guy - fiberglass tiger guy. Dr. Ruja recruited Igor Alberts and Andreea not long after she launched OneCoin. ALBERTS: They invited us to go to Dubai. . . CIMBALA: In May 2015. ALBERTS: . . . In May 2015 (laughter). And I saw thousands of people. I saw - when they can all make so much money, it must really be something. Then I saw Dr. Ruja, and she had all princess's dresses. And she definitely knew what she was talking about. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)IGNATOVA: Before you joined OneCoin, 99% of you did not know what cryptocurrency is about. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Yes. IGNATOVA: Now we understand, and we are shaping the future. Everybody needs to know OneCoin's name. (APPLAUSE)ALBERTS: What we did then, we gathered the teams together and we started to work like crazy. We made in our first month almost 90,000 euros out of nothing - bang. ARONCZYK: Eventually, Igor says, he was making a million dollars a month off of OneCoin because he's convincing people to invest, they're convincing other people to invest, they're convincing more people to invest. TIMOTHY CURRY: They're pretty genius how they put it together, actually. ARONCZYK: This is Timothy Curry. Jamie called him up because he works in the cryptocurrency industry and he was watching OneCoin. He told Jamie that Igor Alberts wasn't working alone. Igor had assembled a team of the best multilevel marketers in the world to spread the word about OneCoin. CURRY: Basically, think of it as an all-star soccer team or all-star baseball team or whatever. And they're like, OK, we have a bigger budget than any other baseball team in the United States. Right? And so what we're going to do is we're going to buy the biggest rookies. We're going to take the biggest stars from some of these biggest teams, and that's how we're going to build this team. Right? It's not that much different. You take the best talent; you pay them enough money. And so it's perfect. And if they're getting a paycheck, they're happy to do it. ARONCZYK: Timothy first heard about OneCoin back in 2015, and it immediately looked suspicious to him. BARTLETT: As soon as Tim Curry saw that, rather than there being a kind of easy way of buying and selling OneCoin for dollars and back again, you have to buy these confusing packages and you got commission to sell to your friends - which no other cryptocurrency was like - you know, alarm bells went off in his head. And he thought, this can't be right. ARONCZYK: Timothy's at home, and he's looking at this. And he's like, wait a second - this is not a real cryptocurrency. Now, cryptocurrencies don't always seem real in the first place to a lot of people. But if you're into them, you know that a legitimate cryptocurrency has a few safeguards, like an open ledger called the blockchain that anybody can participate in, and there's a market where you can trade the currency. OneCoin had none of those things - no blockchain, no market, no way to turn them back into dollars. So Timothy was convinced it was a scam. And he wanted to do something about it. BARTLETT: He became a bit of an online vigilante. He sort of took it upon himself to, I think, spend, like, 12 or 14 hours a day online warning people about OneCoin, trying to stop people from investing and trying to call out investors wherever he could. ARONCZYK: Timothy joins OneCoin Facebook groups. And he's like, guys, wake up; this is a scam. He kind of starts freaking out. He contacts hundreds of people. BARTLETT: And one of the people he comes across is Jen McAdam. ARONCZYK: Jen McAdam, the Scottish investor. Timothy Curry thinks Jen is a promoter - that she's part of the scam. So he gets in touch with her. And this next recording, which is kind of alarming, is a video chat between Timothy and Jen. It's a fight, and Jen recorded it. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CURRY: OneCoin is not a cryptocurrency. There is no blockchain, and I can prove it. MCADAM: Yes, there's a blockchain, Tim. CURRY: I can prove it to you that there's not. MCADAM: Well, then prove it to me. CURRY: I'll f****** prove it. It's a f****** scam. MCADAM: For me, that. . . CURRY: This is the biggest scam in the world right now. Do you understand? It's the biggest scam in the f****** world. BARTLETT: He sees Jen as a OneCoin promoter because he's seen that she's selling it to her friends and family. At that point, she has been told by OneCoin that this guy Timothy Curry is a dangerous fanatic who hates OneCoin because he's scared of the financial revolution. And he sees her as being this kind of scam artist who's ripping people off. ARONCZYK: First Jen's like, no way - it is not possible that OneCoin is a scam. BARTLETT: I know it sounds ludicrous, but once you've put your money into something, it's actually quite hard to let go of that. You know, you don't want to believe the truth because it's too hard to take. ARONCZYK: But over the next few weeks after that video call, Timothy sends Jen all of this stuff about how cryptocurrencies actually work. He sends links and articles and YouTube videos. MCADAM: So he sent me loads of information, which took me three months to eventually go through and digest it, to understand it. BARTLETT: So the things he sent you, slowly, you did start looking at - you did start reading? MCADAM: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Once it starts to digesting, then that's when the serious red flags were popping up. ARONCZYK: Then Timothy told her, go on - go ask the people at OneCoin to show you the blockchain. See what happens. See what they say. MCADAM: So I started asking my OneCoin leaders, was there a blockchain? And I want answers. ARONCZYK: The more questions she asks of those OneCoin leaders, the more defensive they get. They say that she doesn't need to see it, that it's stored somewhere secretive. And it's at that point she realizes there is no blockchain and there is no OneCoin. MCADAM: And I - literally, my legs just went, and I fell on the floor. ARONCZYK: Jen's investment is worthless. The 250,000 euros her friends and family had invested is gone. It's finally clear to her - OneCoin is a scam. BARTLETT: But the problem is, even at the bottom of the pyramid, there are people that are selling it, too, to their friends and family, often unwittingly. So the line between perpetrator and victim is just not clear when you're dealing with this kind of pyramid scheme. ARONCZYK: Not even Igor Alberts, the multilevel marketer who got rich off OneCoin, admits to knowing that the cryptocurrency was a fake. ALBERTS: I have no clue about cryptocurrency at all - nothing. But what I saw is a lot of people that have a lot of knowledge about it. I see those people making the money. What doubt can I have? ARONCZYK: Igor told Jamie that there were all sorts of mysteries behind OneCoin. ALBERTS: You never know what is behind because when we started, there were very influential people behind. BARTLETT: Would you tell us anything about who they are? ALBERTS: No, I cannot tell that because I don't want to take that risk with our lives. ARONCZYK: Don't want to take that risk with our lives - that wasn't the only time that Jamie heard this fear. There was a rumor that the mafia was somehow involved with OneCoin, which might help to explain what happened next. Jamie learned that in 2017, money was still pouring into OneCoin. Dr. Ruja was still flying around the world promoting it. And then there was this big event. It was supposed to be in Portugal, and Dr. Ruja was scheduled to speak. ALBERTS: Dr. Ruja was extremely disciplined. ARONCZYK: Igor was there that night helping promote OneCoin. ALBERTS: It never happened that she didn't show up for an appointment. And she was always on time - not one minute late. BARTLETT: Then suddenly, at this event in Lisbon, Portugal, she just doesn't turn up. ALBERTS: The people from the office were desperate. We saw them. Where is she? How can that be? We should call her one more time. BARTLETT: Frantic calls and emails; she's not at the head office in Sofia. ALBERTS: She didn't react on the email, not on the WhatsApp or nothing. Nothing helped. BARTLETT: That's the last time, really, anyone hears anything of her. She seems to have vanished into thin air. ALBERTS: And nobody knew where is Dr. Ruja. ARONCZYK: We'll be back in one moment. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ARONCZYK: Dr. Ruja was the founder and the face of OneCoin, but Jamie says she wasn't running the company alone. BARTLETT: When Ruja disappeared in October 2017, her brother Konstantin took over and essentially became the acting boss of OneCoin. ARONCZYK: Konstantin, who is this tattooed bodybuilder, was Dr. Ruja's personal assistant before she disappeared. And for about a year and a half, he's the one running OneCoin. But then he makes a mistake. In March 2019, Konstantin travels to Las Vegas. He's there for some meetings. And then he heads to LAX to fly back to Bulgaria. Now, up until that time, OneCoin had largely avoided the U. S. , probably for good reason - because just as Konstantin was preparing to board his flight, he was picked up by the FBI. BARTLETT: So when he was arrested in the U. S. , it was essentially the U. S. arresting the big boss of the whole scam. ARONCZYK: Konstantin and Dr. Ruja, in absentia, were charged with a list of crimes. . . BARTLETT: Money laundering, conspiracy to commit money laundering, wire fraud and securities fraud. The state attorney essentially called OneCoin an old-fashioned pyramid scheme using new technology. So they're pretty serious charges, obviously. ARONCZYK: Konstantin gets sent to jail in lower Manhattan. He hasn't been sentenced yet, but he could be going to prison for 90 years. Dr. Ruja - she's at large. At the time of the arrest, Jamie and BBC producer Georgia Catt are deeply into reporting their podcast. They end up calling it The Missing Cryptoqueen. And for a moment, they wonder if that's the end of the story. But people are clearly still investing in OneCoin online. There are still webinars and new videos. And perhaps strangest of all, a month after Konstantin's arrest, OneCoin organizers have planned a beauty pageant. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: The first annual Miss OneLife 2019 beauty pageant. For the first time. . . ARONCZYK: OneCoin was like this machine that had been so well-built, it just seemed to keep going. Jamie and Georgia Catt, the BBC producer, are like, what is this? SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BARTLETT: And they're saying the biggest beauty pageant in the world. . . GEORGIA CATT: The biggest event in the world. BARTLETT: The biggest event in the world. And millions of people will be watching, the media. . . CATT: All the mainstream media outlets. BARTLETT: All the mainstream media and. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: The biggest event in the world. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BARTLETT: And we're thinking, OK, what? This is ridiculous. We thought, we got to go because it's a OneCoin event. CATT: So we tried calling the organizer, a multi-level marketer networker called Cristi Calina. And remarkably, he answered. And I think we weren't quite expecting him to answer. BARTLETT: No. CATT: And he kind of said, yes, sure, come along. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: See you in Romania. ARONCZYK: Georgia and Jamie make their way to Romania, and they buy themselves some last-minute cocktail party attire. CATT: And yeah, we're right there in the evening. And it was a really big event. BARTLETT: Champagne on every table, vodka on every table. CATT: And people - just cigar smoke everywhere. BARTLETT: Oh, there's four more bottles of champagne coming out. Just send away a bottle my way. Oh, dear, OK, that's what we do. Yeah, what can you say was? I mean, it was a beauty pageant with real people, real contestants. No other media. There wasn't any other international media, of course. I thought we're just going to blend in. We are not blending in. ARONCZYK: They're sitting in the corner. They're not drinking. They're holding this giant microphone. And they feel like they're really sticking out. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: (Unintelligible). BARTLETT: The music's going down. CATT: It was really, really surreal. BARTLETT: Oh, my God. The stage has descended from the ceiling. Oh, my God. ARONCZYK: As they're watching the pageant, Jamie and Georgia realized that this event isn't being held just for the people in a club. This event is being livestreamed. BARTLETT: And you're watching this pageant at home. And you're seeing, wow, there's this huge beauty pageant, loads of people, champagne. This has to be a legitimate company. Champagne's being popped. So it kind of made us realize, I think, just how good these scammers are at creating a sort of facade of believability, just enough that an ordinary person that doesn't understand the technology will believe that OneCoin is legitimate. ARONCZYK: Jamie says that OneCoin was able to keep the lie going even though the founder had disappeared, the boss was arrested by controlling that image, that facade of believability and also by going after anyone who tried to attack them. Even before the first episode of The Missing Cryptoqueen was released, the BBC was flooded with complaints. And then once a couple of episodes were out, someone posted this really odd, negative video about Jamie. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE: OneCoin, How to Disrupt BBC Propaganda by Jamie Bartlett. BARTLETT: I got onto this fairly well-known BBC news program just to talk about the podcast. And probably within 24 hours, footage of me being interviewed on that program had been taken by OneCoin promoters, re-edited, basically insulting me. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE: Jamie Bartlett is not a serious journalist with ethical practices. It's like a children who want the attention, and it's just for his personal interest. But nobody listen you. BARTLETT: They edited a red nose onto my face, played stupid music over the top, basically saying to OneCoin promoters, you can ignore this podcast about OneCoin. It's all lies. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BARTLETT: Well, I mean, Jen, as well, you know, it was sort of F, F. . . ARONCZYK: (Laughter). COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE: F, F, F. This guy cannot even speak correctly. And he has pretend to have made serious investigation about OneCoin. BARTLETT: You're talking about people that have invested money and are now tied into the program. And they have to recruit more people. So you being out there criticizing them, calling it a scam is directly harming their personal prospects. So invariably, what happens is those current investors will do anything to silence you. ARONCZYK: And they don't just criticize Jamie and the BBC. OneCoiners have even gone after people like Jen McAdam, the Scottish woman you heard from before. Jamie says that once the podcast was out and Jen was publicly out there calling OneCoin a scam, she received all sorts of awful messages. BARTLETT: Some of the messages that you've received so far - what have you got? MCADAM: Online? BARTLETT: Yeah. MCADAM: Death threats. BARTLETT: What were people saying? MCADAM: You won't be living within the next few days. And there was sexual abuse threats, as well. I really - I don't even want to repeat it. It's not nice at all. Sometimes, I feel as though I'm in a nightmare that I just can't wake up from. I try to contain it because of my loved ones, not to show them that I'm worried. I don't sleep. I just worry constantly. ARONCZYK: She's now doing for others what Timothy did for her, trying to help people see what OneCoin really is through the smoke and mirrors. MCADAM: I mean, I speak to people every day that are suicidal, and this is only the beginning. They don't want to hear this because they've gave everything they've got. They've sold their houses. Who wants to hear someone say, listen - this is actually a scam? They don't want to hear that. And I understand that. I really do understand that because I was there. ARONCZYK: We reached out to OneCoin but didn't hear back. They did get back to the BBC, though, and they denied any wrongdoing. OneCoin had told the BBC, quote, \"OneCoin verifiably fulfills all criteria of the definition of a cryptocurrency,\" end of quote. The company also claimed that they are challenging the allegations made about it, stating, quote, \"Our partners, our customers and our lawyers are fighting successfully against this action around the globe. And we are sure that the vision of a new system on the basis of a financial revolution will be established. \" Since the FBI got involved and the BBC podcast came out, the growth of OneCoin seems like it's finally slowing down. The last time I looked, the website wasn't even working. But it's clear that this kind of international online scam, especially one that exploits our ignorance about new technologies, it's more like a contagion than a business - self-spreading, leaderless. BARTLETT: No one's entirely sure whose jurisdiction it is. No one's sure whether it's a cryptocurrency or not. Technically speaking, because OneCoin is not really regulated, no regulator is in charge of it. ARONCZYK: Because so much of OneCoin's rise happened online, it's a crime that's happening everywhere and nowhere at the same time. Meanwhile, Dr. Ruja is still missing, and so is all of the money that people invested. But some of the same people who are involved in OneCoin, they've started something new. BARTLETT: We heard that there's a new opportunity. . . SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #7: Yes. Yes. And we are here with the reason. . . BARTLETT: . . . Run by some of the same people with a very similar compensation scheme called Dagcoin. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #7: We like to bring the real future of payment. We like to. . . BARTLETT: Even when OneCoin dies, there are many other similar things out there that look remarkably alike. SOUNDBITE OF UNIDENTIFIED SONG)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #8: (Singing) Let's go, crypto. Let's go cashless. Let's go, crypto. Get your money. Let's go cashless. OneCoin.

Thanks to Georgia Catt and Rachel Simpson at the BBC, Nolan Bauerle at Coindesk and Jeff Locke. Please also be sure to check out the eight-part part BBC series. It's called The Missing Cryptoqueen. There's so much more to the story. There's what Dr. Ruja was up to before OneCoin, just how far OneCoin traveled. And, of course, they have a lot more details on the whereabouts of the missing cryptoqueen. This episode was produced by Liza Yeager. Planet Money's editor is Bryant Urstadt.

Thanks for listening. SOUNDBITE OF UNIDENTIFIED SONG)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #8: OneCoin, together for all (ph). UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1, BYLINE: This is PLANET MONEY from NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) AMANDA ARONCZYK, HOST:  Just a quick note - there is some swearing in this show. JAMIE BARTLETT: The minute you look into the story, you become instantly addicted to it. And it becomes an obsession. So it's weekends, evenings. I mean, I've got to be honest, I'm still completely consumed. ARONCZYK: This is Jamie Bartlett. He's a writer and a journalist. And a few years ago, he wrote a book called \"The Dark Net: Inside The Digital Underworld. \" BARTLETT: So I spent a couple of years of my life on darknet drugs markets, you know, troll forums and neo-Nazi groups really trying to get to grips with the hidden underbelly of the Internet. ARONCZYK: So while he was researching, he found online markets for organic fair-trade cocaine, stolen credit card data, illegal pornography - you know, all those things that you can't go pick up at Costco. And then in 2018, he was approached by a producer from the BBC named Georgia Catt. And she had this story that she thought might interest him. And it wasn't like anything he'd ever run into before. It's a story about a woman with an online empire and a massive, massive following - like, stadium-filling following. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Let's give a warm applause for our creator, our founder, our lovely Dr. Ruja. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"GIRL ON FIRE\") ALICIA KEYS: (Singing) This girl is on fire. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Ruja. . . (APPLAUSE) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Ruja. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"GIRL ON FIRE\") KEYS: (Singing) This girl is on fire. . . ARONCZYK: This is a video shot on June 11, 2016, at Wembley Arena in London. BARTLETT: Picture the scene. This is an enormous, packed arena, thousands of cheering fans. ARONCZYK: Actual fire shoots up from the stage. Then out walks this woman. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RUJA IGNATOVA: Thank you. ARONCZYK: She's wearing a floor-length red ball gown. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) IGNATOVA: Thank you so much. BARTLETT: She's incredibly well-groomed, well-dressed, long flowing black hair, incredibly expensive jewelry, brooches, dangling earrings. I mean, she looks incredibly wealthy. But she's also sort of incredibly mysterious in some ways as well. There's something about her, I think, that you can't quite - you can't fully understand. ARONCZYK: Her name is Ruja Ignatova, and people call her Dr. Ruja. And while she's not a doctor-doctor, she does have a Ph. D. in law. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) IGNATOVA: This network was created to become and to fuel the growth of OneCoin. ARONCZYK: So Jamie learns that Dr. Ruja is a 36-year-old Bulgarian German businesswoman. And she's come to Wembley Arena to spread the gospel about OneCoin. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) IGNATOVA: OneCoin is easy to use. OneCoin is for everyone, make payments everywhere, everyone globally. And this is. . . ARONCZYK: OneCoin is a new cryptocurrency. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) IGNATOVA: . . . Because this coin is going to be No. 1 worldwide. (APPLAUSE) ARONCZYK: But Jamie, this guy who who knows a lot about cryptocurrencies, he's never heard of OneCoin. He and Georgia team up, and they start to investigate together. Over the last year, how much of your time has been spent thinking about Dr. Ruja and OneCoin? BARTLETT: All of it, pretty much nonstop. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ARONCZYK: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Amanda Aronczyk. Jamie Bartlett and producer Georgia Catt from the BBC have been investigating the bizarre story of Dr. Ruja and OneCoin. Today on the show - one of my favorite stories of this past year - there's greed and corruption and cult-like devotion. And just when you think you understand what's going on, you realize you have no clue. (SOUNDBITE OF SHARINE O'NEILL SONG, \"ONE FOR ALL\") ARONCZYK: Jamie, is this a song about OneCoin? BARTLETT: (Laughter) It's one of many songs about OneCoin. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"ONE FOR ALL\") SHARINE O'NEILL: (Singing) We all around the world are changing the way happy people all around changing the way to pay. BARTLETT: You've got to remember, this is 2015, '16, '17. There's so much enthusiasm that we were on the cusp of this brand-new way of thinking about money. And Dr. Ruja Ignatova really tapped into that. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"ONE FOR ALL\") O'NEILL: (Singing) . . . Revolution, a currency for everyone. ARONCZYK: When Jamie started investigating OneCoin, this is one of the first things he learned. Dr. Ruja was presenting herself as a hero, this genius who had founded a new cryptocurrency that was going to be bigger than Bitcoin. But unlike Bitcoin, her currency wouldn't be for some small group that understands the technology or got in early. She was going to share it with the masses, help real people take control of money away from big banks, away from governments. She was going to lead a financial revolution for the people. BARTLETT: Fans of hers would just write poetry, write music about her. They'd almost - they'd really sort of worship the woman. We heard a lot of songs that had been dedicated to Ruja. That was one of many. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"ONE FOR ALL\") O'NEILL: (Singing) . . . People all around carrying financial solution. ARONCZYK: There are all these fans and this whole community online. And Jamie's trying to figure out, well, who are these people in real life? One of the first people he finds is a Scottish woman in her late 40s. Her name is Jen McAdam. Her father had recently passed away, and he'd left her about 10,000 euros. BARTLETT: So a friend of hers had heard about this new cryptocurrency, OneCoin, and heard about Dr. Ruja and then emailed Jen and said, hey, have you seen this? You know that money that your father left you? This could be a place to invest it. ARONCZYK: So Jen McAdam goes online. She watches some videos, and she's impressed. JEN MCADAM: Ruja - she's a doctor, and she has her Ph. D. She worked with McKinsey and Co. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) IGNATOVA: Thank you very much for the invitation to be a speaker at the Economist Forum today and to speak about the future of. . . MCADAM: I think when I saw her at the Economist summit, that did it for me. The Economist (laughter) - being a businesswoman previously, I thought, that's amazing. Power of the woman - well done. I felt proud of her. ARONCZYK: Jen then watches a webinar about OneCoin, and it seems so clear she's getting in early on this amazing investment. MCADAM: By the time you come off that webinar, you're actually thinking - oh, my goodness - I suppose I could try a thousand-euro package - because it was euros at the time - and then see how it goes. And that's what I did. ARONCZYK: So here's how this worked. Jen went to the OneCoin website, and she was directed to buy one of these packages that they offer. BARTLETT: And these packages are priced between, I think, 500 euros up to over a hundred thousand euros for a package. And technically, you are buying education. ARONCZYK: Actually, just some PDFs with info about cryptocurrencies. BARTLETT: And with each of those packages - they're differently priced - you receive things called tokens, and those tokens can then be transformed into OneCoin. ARONCZYK: So Jen gets her own OneCoin account. She buys a thousand-euro package. Every time she logs in, she sees the value of her OneCoin going up and up and up. MCADAM: When you think you're changing your life financially and your hardships are over - yeah, I remember that as clear as day. BARTLETT: Were you quite excited? You know, were you excited? MCADAM: So excited, so excited. So was my friend. ARONCZYK: She had told all of her friends and family about it, and she would make a commission when her friends invested, too. MCADAM: We were going to go on holiday. I remember going down to visit her afterward. We thought we would change our lives. We thought that we'd changed all of our family lives. ARONCZYK: Around the time that he meets Jen McAdam, Jamie gets a tip about OneCoin - that OneCoin has as many as a million investors - a million people like Jen McAdam, people who have OneCoin accounts and have invested some money. BARTLETT: This is going to blow you away. But we were shown documents - we were leaked documents that estimate that the total amount invested into OneCoin between 2014 and early 2017 is well over 4 billion euros. And it could be as high as 15 billion euros. ARONCZYK: At least $5 billion and possibly much, much more - and that's just from this one three-year period. And the money is coming in from all over. BARTLETT: From something like 175 countries in the world. ARONCZYK: A hundred and seventy-five countries. BARTLETT: Yeah. I mean, every corner of the globe - people from Palestine; people from the Congo; people from the Vatican; America, of course; China - hundreds of millions of dollars, euros invested from China. ARONCZYK: So then Jamie's wondering - well, how did this get so big so fast? It's this question that leads him to the mansion of a man who seemingly has everything. BARTLETT: Can I just quickly ask you about this enormous bear? IGOR ALBERTS: (Laughter). ARONCZYK: This is the home of Igor Alberts and his wife Andreea Cimbala. They have a massive garden surrounding their massive, eight-story mansion just outside of Amsterdam. ALBERTS: We have panthers, rhinos, giraffes. BARTLETT: When you walk into his garden, there's 30 or 40 fiberglass, lifesize animal sculptures from all the different places in the world that he's been to. ALBERTS: We have gorillas from Uganda. BARTLETT: You've got pelicans. You've got giraffes. ALBERTS: This is the house of dreams. And it's - it is a kingdom. ARONCZYK: Jamie says that Igor Alberts is a big Dutch guy. He's probably in his mid-50s. And he's larger than life in almost every single way. For example, there's the way that he is dressed. BARTLETT: Everything he wore was black and gold Dolce and Gabbana - socks, pants, shoes, sunglasses, waistcoats. ALBERTS: But when you look at my clothes, they are disciplined. ANDREEA CIMBALA: Everything - he has socks and pink underwear. And if he dresses in pink, he will dress in pink everything. ALBERTS: I have it in everything. ARONCZYK: The Siberian tiger statues, the outfits, the Maserati parked by the gate - if this seems like an ostentatious display of wealth, that is because it is. Igor Alberts and his wife want to look very rich because they're both experts at what's known as multilevel marketing. BARTLETT: People are probably familiar with this, with certain cosmetic products and vitamin tablets. And there's a lot of this kind of multilevel marketing around. ARONCZYK: Amway works like this, and so does Herbalife and Avon. People sell the products to their friends and their families. But more importantly, they try to recruit their friends and families to sell the product, too. That's how they make a commission. So you want to look like you're making a lot of money off of selling that product. BARTLETT: It's a huge industry. There's millions of people around the world doing this. ARONCZYK: And OneCoin is a great product for multilevel marketers because unlike selling bottles of vitamins, you don't have to store thousands of boxes of the stuff in your garage. A cryptocurrency doesn't need to be boxed or transported. BARTLETT: But Dr. Ruja Ignatova's genius was to realize that she could take her cryptocurrency and market it through existing multilevel marketing networks. ARONCZYK: Networks of salespeople who knew how to sell physical products, they could sell a virtual currency even faster. BARTLETT: And it took off like wildfire. There are people that had worked in multilevel marketing all their lives. They'd never seen anything like it. They'd never seen a product grow like it. ARONCZYK: And one of the best-known sellers is this guy - fiberglass tiger guy. Dr. Ruja recruited Igor Alberts and Andreea not long after she launched OneCoin. ALBERTS: They invited us to go to Dubai. . . CIMBALA: In May 2015. ALBERTS: . . . In May 2015 (laughter). And I saw thousands of people. I saw - when they can all make so much money, it must really be something. Then I saw Dr. Ruja, and she had all princess's dresses. And she definitely knew what she was talking about. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) IGNATOVA: Before you joined OneCoin, 99% of you did not know what cryptocurrency is about. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Yes. IGNATOVA: Now we understand, and we are shaping the future. Everybody needs to know OneCoin's name. (APPLAUSE) ALBERTS: What we did then, we gathered the teams together and we started to work like crazy. We made in our first month almost 90,000 euros out of nothing - bang. ARONCZYK: Eventually, Igor says, he was making a million dollars a month off of OneCoin because he's convincing people to invest, they're convincing other people to invest, they're convincing more people to invest. TIMOTHY CURRY: They're pretty genius how they put it together, actually. ARONCZYK: This is Timothy Curry. Jamie called him up because he works in the cryptocurrency industry and he was watching OneCoin. He told Jamie that Igor Alberts wasn't working alone. Igor had assembled a team of the best multilevel marketers in the world to spread the word about OneCoin. CURRY: Basically, think of it as an all-star soccer team or all-star baseball team or whatever. And they're like, OK, we have a bigger budget than any other baseball team in the United States. Right? And so what we're going to do is we're going to buy the biggest rookies. We're going to take the biggest stars from some of these biggest teams, and that's how we're going to build this team. Right? It's not that much different. You take the best talent; you pay them enough money. And so it's perfect. And if they're getting a paycheck, they're happy to do it. ARONCZYK: Timothy first heard about OneCoin back in 2015, and it immediately looked suspicious to him. BARTLETT: As soon as Tim Curry saw that, rather than there being a kind of easy way of buying and selling OneCoin for dollars and back again, you have to buy these confusing packages and you got commission to sell to your friends - which no other cryptocurrency was like - you know, alarm bells went off in his head. And he thought, this can't be right. ARONCZYK: Timothy's at home, and he's looking at this. And he's like, wait a second - this is not a real cryptocurrency. Now, cryptocurrencies don't always seem real in the first place to a lot of people. But if you're into them, you know that a legitimate cryptocurrency has a few safeguards, like an open ledger called the blockchain that anybody can participate in, and there's a market where you can trade the currency. OneCoin had none of those things - no blockchain, no market, no way to turn them back into dollars. So Timothy was convinced it was a scam. And he wanted to do something about it. BARTLETT: He became a bit of an online vigilante. He sort of took it upon himself to, I think, spend, like, 12 or 14 hours a day online warning people about OneCoin, trying to stop people from investing and trying to call out investors wherever he could. ARONCZYK: Timothy joins OneCoin Facebook groups. And he's like, guys, wake up; this is a scam. He kind of starts freaking out. He contacts hundreds of people. BARTLETT: And one of the people he comes across is Jen McAdam. ARONCZYK: Jen McAdam, the Scottish investor. Timothy Curry thinks Jen is a promoter - that she's part of the scam. So he gets in touch with her. And this next recording, which is kind of alarming, is a video chat between Timothy and Jen. It's a fight, and Jen recorded it. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CURRY: OneCoin is not a cryptocurrency. There is no blockchain, and I can prove it. MCADAM: Yes, there's a blockchain, Tim. CURRY: I can prove it to you that there's not. MCADAM: Well, then prove it to me. CURRY: I'll f****** prove it. It's a f****** scam. MCADAM: For me, that. . . CURRY: This is the biggest scam in the world right now. Do you understand? It's the biggest scam in the f****** world. BARTLETT: He sees Jen as a OneCoin promoter because he's seen that she's selling it to her friends and family. At that point, she has been told by OneCoin that this guy Timothy Curry is a dangerous fanatic who hates OneCoin because he's scared of the financial revolution. And he sees her as being this kind of scam artist who's ripping people off. ARONCZYK: First Jen's like, no way - it is not possible that OneCoin is a scam. BARTLETT: I know it sounds ludicrous, but once you've put your money into something, it's actually quite hard to let go of that. You know, you don't want to believe the truth because it's too hard to take. ARONCZYK: But over the next few weeks after that video call, Timothy sends Jen all of this stuff about how cryptocurrencies actually work. He sends links and articles and YouTube videos. MCADAM: So he sent me loads of information, which took me three months to eventually go through and digest it, to understand it. BARTLETT: So the things he sent you, slowly, you did start looking at - you did start reading? MCADAM: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Once it starts to digesting, then that's when the serious red flags were popping up. ARONCZYK: Then Timothy told her, go on - go ask the people at OneCoin to show you the blockchain. See what happens. See what they say. MCADAM: So I started asking my OneCoin leaders, was there a blockchain? And I want answers. ARONCZYK: The more questions she asks of those OneCoin leaders, the more defensive they get. They say that she doesn't need to see it, that it's stored somewhere secretive. And it's at that point she realizes there is no blockchain and there is no OneCoin. MCADAM: And I - literally, my legs just went, and I fell on the floor. ARONCZYK: Jen's investment is worthless. The 250,000 euros her friends and family had invested is gone. It's finally clear to her - OneCoin is a scam. BARTLETT: But the problem is, even at the bottom of the pyramid, there are people that are selling it, too, to their friends and family, often unwittingly. So the line between perpetrator and victim is just not clear when you're dealing with this kind of pyramid scheme. ARONCZYK: Not even Igor Alberts, the multilevel marketer who got rich off OneCoin, admits to knowing that the cryptocurrency was a fake. ALBERTS: I have no clue about cryptocurrency at all - nothing. But what I saw is a lot of people that have a lot of knowledge about it. I see those people making the money. What doubt can I have? ARONCZYK: Igor told Jamie that there were all sorts of mysteries behind OneCoin. ALBERTS: You never know what is behind because when we started, there were very influential people behind. BARTLETT: Would you tell us anything about who they are? ALBERTS: No, I cannot tell that because I don't want to take that risk with our lives. ARONCZYK: Don't want to take that risk with our lives - that wasn't the only time that Jamie heard this fear. There was a rumor that the mafia was somehow involved with OneCoin, which might help to explain what happened next. Jamie learned that in 2017, money was still pouring into OneCoin. Dr. Ruja was still flying around the world promoting it. And then there was this big event. It was supposed to be in Portugal, and Dr. Ruja was scheduled to speak. ALBERTS: Dr. Ruja was extremely disciplined. ARONCZYK: Igor was there that night helping promote OneCoin. ALBERTS: It never happened that she didn't show up for an appointment. And she was always on time - not one minute late. BARTLETT: Then suddenly, at this event in Lisbon, Portugal, she just doesn't turn up. ALBERTS: The people from the office were desperate. We saw them. Where is she? How can that be? We should call her one more time. BARTLETT: Frantic calls and emails; she's not at the head office in Sofia. ALBERTS: She didn't react on the email, not on the WhatsApp or nothing. Nothing helped. BARTLETT: That's the last time, really, anyone hears anything of her. She seems to have vanished into thin air. ALBERTS: And nobody knew where is Dr. Ruja. ARONCZYK: We'll be back in one moment. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ARONCZYK: Dr. Ruja was the founder and the face of OneCoin, but Jamie says she wasn't running the company alone. BARTLETT: When Ruja disappeared in October 2017, her brother Konstantin took over and essentially became the acting boss of OneCoin. ARONCZYK: Konstantin, who is this tattooed bodybuilder, was Dr. Ruja's personal assistant before she disappeared. And for about a year and a half, he's the one running OneCoin. But then he makes a mistake. In March 2019, Konstantin travels to Las Vegas. He's there for some meetings. And then he heads to LAX to fly back to Bulgaria. Now, up until that time, OneCoin had largely avoided the U. S. , probably for good reason - because just as Konstantin was preparing to board his flight, he was picked up by the FBI. BARTLETT: So when he was arrested in the U. S. , it was essentially the U. S. arresting the big boss of the whole scam. ARONCZYK: Konstantin and Dr. Ruja, in absentia, were charged with a list of crimes. . . BARTLETT: Money laundering, conspiracy to commit money laundering, wire fraud and securities fraud. The state attorney essentially called OneCoin an old-fashioned pyramid scheme using new technology. So they're pretty serious charges, obviously. ARONCZYK: Konstantin gets sent to jail in lower Manhattan. He hasn't been sentenced yet, but he could be going to prison for 90 years. Dr. Ruja - she's at large. At the time of the arrest, Jamie and BBC producer Georgia Catt are deeply into reporting their podcast. They end up calling it The Missing Cryptoqueen. And for a moment, they wonder if that's the end of the story. But people are clearly still investing in OneCoin online. There are still webinars and new videos. And perhaps strangest of all, a month after Konstantin's arrest, OneCoin organizers have planned a beauty pageant. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: The first annual Miss OneLife 2019 beauty pageant. For the first time. . . ARONCZYK: OneCoin was like this machine that had been so well-built, it just seemed to keep going. Jamie and Georgia Catt, the BBC producer, are like, what is this? SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BARTLETT: And they're saying the biggest beauty pageant in the world. . . GEORGIA CATT: The biggest event in the world. BARTLETT: The biggest event in the world. And millions of people will be watching, the media. . . CATT: All the mainstream media outlets. BARTLETT: All the mainstream media and. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: The biggest event in the world. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BARTLETT: And we're thinking, OK, what? This is ridiculous. We thought, we got to go because it's a OneCoin event. CATT: So we tried calling the organizer, a multi-level marketer networker called Cristi Calina. And remarkably, he answered. And I think we weren't quite expecting him to answer. BARTLETT: No. CATT: And he kind of said, yes, sure, come along. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: See you in Romania. ARONCZYK: Georgia and Jamie make their way to Romania, and they buy themselves some last-minute cocktail party attire. CATT: And yeah, we're right there in the evening. And it was a really big event. BARTLETT: Champagne on every table, vodka on every table. CATT: And people - just cigar smoke everywhere. BARTLETT: Oh, there's four more bottles of champagne coming out. Just send away a bottle my way. Oh, dear, OK, that's what we do. Yeah, what can you say was? I mean, it was a beauty pageant with real people, real contestants. No other media. There wasn't any other international media, of course. I thought we're just going to blend in. We are not blending in. ARONCZYK: They're sitting in the corner. They're not drinking. They're holding this giant microphone. And they feel like they're really sticking out. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: (Unintelligible). BARTLETT: The music's going down. CATT: It was really, really surreal. BARTLETT: Oh, my God. The stage has descended from the ceiling. Oh, my God. ARONCZYK: As they're watching the pageant, Jamie and Georgia realized that this event isn't being held just for the people in a club. This event is being livestreamed. BARTLETT: And you're watching this pageant at home. And you're seeing, wow, there's this huge beauty pageant, loads of people, champagne. This has to be a legitimate company. Champagne's being popped. So it kind of made us realize, I think, just how good these scammers are at creating a sort of facade of believability, just enough that an ordinary person that doesn't understand the technology will believe that OneCoin is legitimate. ARONCZYK: Jamie says that OneCoin was able to keep the lie going even though the founder had disappeared, the boss was arrested by controlling that image, that facade of believability and also by going after anyone who tried to attack them. Even before the first episode of The Missing Cryptoqueen was released, the BBC was flooded with complaints. And then once a couple of episodes were out, someone posted this really odd, negative video about Jamie. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE: OneCoin, How to Disrupt BBC Propaganda by Jamie Bartlett. BARTLETT: I got onto this fairly well-known BBC news program just to talk about the podcast. And probably within 24 hours, footage of me being interviewed on that program had been taken by OneCoin promoters, re-edited, basically insulting me. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE: Jamie Bartlett is not a serious journalist with ethical practices. It's like a children who want the attention, and it's just for his personal interest. But nobody listen you. BARTLETT: They edited a red nose onto my face, played stupid music over the top, basically saying to OneCoin promoters, you can ignore this podcast about OneCoin. It's all lies. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BARTLETT: Well, I mean, Jen, as well, you know, it was sort of F, F. . . ARONCZYK: (Laughter). COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE: F, F, F. This guy cannot even speak correctly. And he has pretend to have made serious investigation about OneCoin. BARTLETT: You're talking about people that have invested money and are now tied into the program. And they have to recruit more people. So you being out there criticizing them, calling it a scam is directly harming their personal prospects. So invariably, what happens is those current investors will do anything to silence you. ARONCZYK: And they don't just criticize Jamie and the BBC. OneCoiners have even gone after people like Jen McAdam, the Scottish woman you heard from before. Jamie says that once the podcast was out and Jen was publicly out there calling OneCoin a scam, she received all sorts of awful messages. BARTLETT: Some of the messages that you've received so far - what have you got? MCADAM: Online? BARTLETT: Yeah. MCADAM: Death threats. BARTLETT: What were people saying? MCADAM: You won't be living within the next few days. And there was sexual abuse threats, as well. I really - I don't even want to repeat it. It's not nice at all. Sometimes, I feel as though I'm in a nightmare that I just can't wake up from. I try to contain it because of my loved ones, not to show them that I'm worried. I don't sleep. I just worry constantly. ARONCZYK: She's now doing for others what Timothy did for her, trying to help people see what OneCoin really is through the smoke and mirrors. MCADAM: I mean, I speak to people every day that are suicidal, and this is only the beginning. They don't want to hear this because they've gave everything they've got. They've sold their houses. Who wants to hear someone say, listen - this is actually a scam? They don't want to hear that. And I understand that. I really do understand that because I was there. ARONCZYK: We reached out to OneCoin but didn't hear back. They did get back to the BBC, though, and they denied any wrongdoing. OneCoin had told the BBC, quote, \"OneCoin verifiably fulfills all criteria of the definition of a cryptocurrency,\" end of quote. The company also claimed that they are challenging the allegations made about it, stating, quote, \"Our partners, our customers and our lawyers are fighting successfully against this action around the globe. And we are sure that the vision of a new system on the basis of a financial revolution will be established. \" Since the FBI got involved and the BBC podcast came out, the growth of OneCoin seems like it's finally slowing down. The last time I looked, the website wasn't even working. But it's clear that this kind of international online scam, especially one that exploits our ignorance about new technologies, it's more like a contagion than a business - self-spreading, leaderless. BARTLETT: No one's entirely sure whose jurisdiction it is. No one's sure whether it's a cryptocurrency or not. Technically speaking, because OneCoin is not really regulated, no regulator is in charge of it. ARONCZYK: Because so much of OneCoin's rise happened online, it's a crime that's happening everywhere and nowhere at the same time. Meanwhile, Dr. Ruja is still missing, and so is all of the money that people invested. But some of the same people who are involved in OneCoin, they've started something new. BARTLETT: We heard that there's a new opportunity. . . SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #7: Yes. Yes. And we are here with the reason. . . BARTLETT: . . . Run by some of the same people with a very similar compensation scheme called Dagcoin. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #7: We like to bring the real future of payment. We like to. . . BARTLETT: Even when OneCoin dies, there are many other similar things out there that look remarkably alike. SOUNDBITE OF UNIDENTIFIED SONG) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #8: (Singing) Let's go, crypto. Let's go cashless. Let's go, crypto. Get your money. Let's go cashless. OneCoin.

The area is supposed to become a so-called smart city with high-tech sensors and data collectors baked into the infrastructure. As David McGuffin reports, many in Canada's biggest city are concerned about the company chosen to develop the site. DAVID MCGUFFIN, BYLINE: The company's name is Sidewalk Labs. That may not ring a bell. But it's a spinoff of a corporation whose name is much more instantly recognizable, Google. Here's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announcing the plan to develop the 12-acre block of public lands called Quayside on Toronto's Lake Ontario waterfront back in 2017. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JUSTIN TRUDEAU: A world leader in urban innovation, Sidewalk Labs will create a test bed for new technologies in Quayside, technologies that will help us build smarter, greener, more inclusive cities, which we hope to see scaled across Toronto's eastern waterfront and eventually in other parts of Canada and around the world. MCGUFFIN: Jesse Shapins is the Sidewalk Labs director of urban design and digital innovation. He's especially excited about the green aspects of the project, like plans to build the world's tallest timber buildings, soaring, 35-story, curved structures of glass and high-density wood. JESSE SHAPINS: And the benefits of that are that steel and concrete, which is the primary materials for our buildings today, are some of the most significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. Wood itself, obviously a renewable resource in itself, actually embodied carbon. MCGUFFIN: Innovative plans also include roads and sidewalks made of modular concrete slabs fitted with heating systems to melt snow and ice. And the project involves thousands of monitors, sensors and cameras on streets, inside buildings and embedded in the infrastructure. The monitoring of people's movements is intended to improve the efficiency of traffic flow, energy use, garbage collection and more. BRENDA MCPHAIL: So we're concerned about creating, essentially, a neighborhood in the city that's fundamentally based on a model of surveillance. MCGUFFIN: Brenda McPhail is a lawyer with the Canadian Civil Liberties Association. It is suing to block the development, saying it is full of potential privacy breaches that violate Canadian constitutional rights. MCPHAIL: Particularly because you're embedding technologies in the infrastructure that people don't have any choice about whether or not they're there, don't have any control over what data is or isn't being collected and have no meaningful way to consent to the information being collected. MCGUFFIN: McPhail says the only way to prevent that from happening is to completely avoid going to that part of the city. She says that's just not fair. But Jesse Shapins of Sidewalk Labs says this project is not about data harvesting or surveillance. SHAPINS: That's just not the business that we're in. There's only data collected when it is truly in service of achieving a public benefit. MCGUFFIN: For example, he says, if there are sensors to improve pedestrian safety, that would all be collected by the city of Toronto. And since its initial proposal, Sidewalk Labs has made a number of concessions, including agreeing to hand over any of the data it collects to a government agency for safe keeping. Thorben Weiditz, who heads the community organization Block Sidewalk, remains skeptical. SHAPINS: The notion that we allow a Google sister company access to publicly owned land in the city of Toronto and allow them to develop, you know, new forms of delivering municipal services, I think, is something that sort of strikes a nerve among a lot of people in Toronto.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)CARDIFF GARCIA, HOST: Mustafa Nuur was born in Mogadishu, Somalia, in 1992. His father owned and ran a few small businesses. MUSTAFA NUUR: We had an ice cream shop, and then we had a clothing store. But the ice cream would have been the. . . GARCIA: The big moneymaker back then. NUUR: . . . The big moneymaker because Somalia is a very hot country. STACEY VANEK SMITH, HOST: But when Mustafa was 11, the Somali terrorist group al-Shabab asked his father to provide them with funding. His father refused multiple times, Mustafa says. And then one day around noon, members of al-Shabab came to Mustafa's house, and in front of Mustafa, his mother and his seven younger siblings, they murdered his father in their courtyard. By 4 p. m. , the family was fleeing Somalia. NUUR: So we didn't have any time to, like, start thinking about where should we go or what we should take. We didn't even take any of our belongings. The only item I just managed to grab was a bedsheet from my bed. That's pretty much it. GARCIA: That's all you left with. NUUR: That's all I left with. GARCIA: Mustafa and his family spent roughly the next decade - until he was 22 - in refugee camps in Kenya until they were resettled Lancaster City, Pa. , in 2014. VANEK SMITH: And out of these tragic circumstances, just five years later, Mustafa is a small business owner just like his dad was. And refugees like him and other immigrants are a meaningful part of a complicated success story - the story of how Lancaster City and the surrounding Lancaster County have prospered economically. I'm Stacey Vanek Smith. GARCIA: And I'm Cardiff Garcia. Normally, the two of us are the co-hosts of PLANET MONEY'S daily podcast called The Indicator From Planet Money. VANEK SMITH: And, you know, if you are feeling like you need more podcasts in your life, you should subscribe. We welcome new subscribers always. GARCIA: We are pretty welcoming, I think. VANEK SMITH: I think so, yeah. GARCIA: We try to be. The Indicator tells a short story about economics every single day in less than 10 minutes, and today on PLANET MONEY - two of those Indicators back-to-back. VANEK SMITH: First up is Mustafa Nuur. He is a refugee living in Lancaster County, Pa. , and he teaches us a few things about the relationship between refugees and their local economy. GARCIA: And then The Indicator rides along delivering Amazon Prime packages to find out what it actually takes for one of those packages to arrive at your door. VANEK SMITH: Mustafa Nuur and his family found that they had been selected to be resettled in the U. S. And initially, they had mixed feelings. NUUR: So when the country selects you, you're notified two years in that, hey; the United States has selected you. And that has - in the refugee camp, that always comes as a great news - at the same time, bad news because the United States takes the longest to process anybody. They have a harder process. They have a harder scrutiny, harder background checks. GARCIA: And he's right. The vetting process for refugees coming to the U. S. is intense. There's multiple interviews and background checks and security checks by different branches of the U. S. government, fingerprints, tests for contagious diseases. It can take years. For Mustafa's family, it took a decade. VANEK SMITH: But eventually, as with other refugees who make it through the whole process, the family was paired with a resettlement agency. Mustafa and his family were paired with Church World Service, which has a branch in Lancaster. It's a nonprofit that receives funding from the federal government and from private donors, and it sets up refugee families with a few months of housing, some counseling services, food and clothing. NUUR: And then they try to find you a job right away because once you land here, you have to start paying back your bill for - to the government for bringing you. GARCIA: A lot of people don't know this, but yes, refugees pay back the U. S. government for the cost of flying here. For Mustafa's big family, those were not cheap flights. NUUR: It's around eleven to twelve hundred per person, so a family of 10 people - you get a bill of almost 10,000 right away. VANEK SMITH: Mustafa says he found Lancaster City and Lancaster County unexpectedly welcoming to his refugee family and to other refugee families, and that, in fact, is the city's reputation. In 2016, before the Trump administration started limiting how many refugees could come to the U. S. , the number of refugees that were resettled in Lancaster City hit a peak of 407. As a share of the city's population, that's almost 23 times more refugees resettled than in the U. S. as a whole, which is why the city was labeled the refugee capital of America by the BBC. GARCIA: So why is Lancaster able to resettle so many refugees? Well, one reason is resources. For example, Church World Service, the resettlement agency, is able to partner with local organizations to provide services beyond just the basics, beyond the initial housing and food and clothes. For example, there's a nonprofit that provides health care to refugees. There's English language tutors. There's school district and universities to help with education, employment programs and companies that will actively try to hire refugees and train them. VANEK SMITH: Sheila Mastropietro runs the Lancaster office of Church World Service, and she says that all these resources make it possible for Lancaster to accept even the hardest cases, like when there's a huge refugee family of 10 or 15 people or when a refugee has a medical issue and can't work or if a refugee only speaks a really obscure foreign language. SHEILA MASTROPIETRO: There are no cases in this area that we would refuse. So we do have the option when a case is sent to us by our national office to say - they say - basically, they're saying, will you accept this case? So we always do. VANEK SMITH: And it's not just tangible resources. There's something else that has given Lancaster the ability to absorb refugees - its history. Starting in the early 18th century, members of the Mennonite and Amish churches were fleeing persecution in Europe and started moving to Lancaster. The county still has a huge Amish and Mennonite population, and the value of welcoming people in need of a new home has remained. GARCIA: Steve Nolt, a professor at Elizabethtown College, spoke with us at the Mennonite Historical Society, which features exhibits about the Amish and Mennonite history of Lancaster. STEVE NOLT: Well, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, for example, Mennonites in this area were deeply involved in resettlement of refugees from Southeast Asia - from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. And that's - that was motivated both by, you know, Christian humanitarian concerns and also concerns that - as Mennonites, as conscientious objectors, as pacifists. VANEK SMITH: And, in fact, Mustafa's own experience right after arriving in Lancaster reflects this. NUUR: My first ever job was - I worked with the Amish. I used to work for a company that build garages and sheds. So I used to install windows. GARCIA: He did well enough at this job installing windows for these sheds that he was hired by a company called E-Impact Marketing, which provides marketing for Amish companies in the area and which trained Mustafa in web design. Mustafa would end up becoming their head web developer. VANEK SMITH: And then he started thinking more broadly. He started a company called Bridge, which is a website where people can sign up to have dinner in the home of a refugee family in the area. The refugee family will cook the meal and share their story, and the family will also set a fee for the dinner, which it gets to keep. Bridge charges a service fee, which is how it makes money. Mustafa's original pitch for Bridge won a business plan competition, which provided the funding to get it started. NUUR: My pitch was that I was going to - instead of retraining or giving refugees a new skill, why not give them a platform where they can earn an income with what they already know and what they already have, which is their culture and their food? GARCIA: Adam Ozimek is a Lancaster-based economist, and he says that refugees and immigrants contribute to a local economy by helping its population grow and thereby giving new businesses more people to sell to - customers - and also people to hire as employees. Adam says that Mustafa's story also demonstrates some more subtle ways that immigrants and refugees contribute. ADAM OZIMEK: They move into neighborhoods that, you know, others might find less desirable, and they start interesting businesses. And they really contribute to the diversity of consumer experiences downtown. I mean, you can - in downtown Lancaster, you can eat at a Vietnamese place. You can eat at a Nepalese place. There's just a huge amount of variety there. NUUR: Mustafa says his company is making money, and he even has plans to expand into neighboring York County. And he adds that his story shows the symbiotic relationship between the Lancaster economy and its refugees. GARCIA: And it goes something like this. The success of the economy makes it possible for the city to offer resources to these refugees so that they can prosper, and their prospering feeds right back into the success of the Lancaster economy. NUUR: So what happens is, when a refugee person comes here, the community - this community has done a very good job of harnessing that refugee person as a whole, from employment to training to job opportunities to entrepreneurship training. So I went through those different circles of coming here, receiving welcome, finding a stable job and then find - developing a skill, which is the development - web development, and then using that skill to create a company. And now - so it's a great circle, and it's something which is very - I don't want to say unique but special about Lancaster. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GARCIA: Coming up after the break - inside Amazon Flex and all the hidden work that goes into getting you your packages in two days or less. Stacey, for this one, I'm out. You take it with reporter Adrian Ma from WBUR in Boston. VANEK SMITH: Yes. Adrian, you brought us this story about Amazon. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)ADRIAN MA: Right. VANEK SMITH: And, of course, we could not resist. MA: Yes. So if you're among the millions of Americans who buy stuff on Amazon, you probably know the feeling, right? You get home, you see that brown box by your door, and you think, sweet. It's that thing I ordered. VANEK SMITH: Oh, so good. It's like mini-Christmas without the terrible airports. MA: Yes, exactly. And, you know, you see that box. You have this warm, fuzzy feeling inside. But do you ever stop to think about the person who brought you that box? Now, if your first guess was maybe the postal worker or the UPS driver, you'd be about 50% right. VANEK SMITH: According to a recent estimate by Morgan Stanley, almost half of Amazon shipments are actually delivered by Amazon itself, and often, the final drop is made by one of thousands of gig workers hired through this app called Amazon Flex. MA: How much of your week do you spend doing Flex? LYNNE: Oh, my goodness - pretty much every waking hour that I'm not eating or sleeping (laughter). MA: This is Lynne. We're only using her first name here because she's worried speaking to a reporter could affect her ability to get work from Amazon. Lynne used to be an administrative assistant, but a couple of years ago, she quit and drove headfirst into the gig economy. LYNNE: Once I realized that there were other jobs out there that were a lot more convenient, a lot more flexible, I never really looked back once I started. VANEK SMITH: Soon, Amazon Flex went from being Lynne's side hustle to her main source of income. MA: It became her front hustle. VANEK SMITH: Her front hustle. MA: So Lynne is among the roughly 1% of U. S. workers who make a living through online gig work, and to better understand with this particular gig involves, we took a ride. Can you, like, walk me through? How does this thing work? LYNNE: Sure. So this is the main page right here. It's the home page. It's basically showing that I have. . . MA: At her home in central Massachusetts, Lynne pulls up the Amazon Flex app on her phone. On screen is a list of what they call blocks - basically, shifts of two to four hours where she can sign up to deliver stuff. And next to each shift is a dollar amount for how much she can earn. VANEK SMITH: Which sounds pretty simple, but here is the tricky part. The dollar amounts for the blocks will change. LYNNE: Usually, the closer it gets to the starting time, the rates will start to raise. And it's kind of like a game to see how high you can get it before that block disappears on you. MA: The wonky term for this is dynamic pricing, and it means she's got to be strategic. Grab a block too soon, and she could be leaving money on the table. VANEK SMITH: Wait too long, and someone else might grab it. LYNNE: You keep on having to do this. Swipe down on the app. It refreshes. And you basically have to do that constantly throughout the day to see what's available for work. MA: Lynne says the feeling of catching a block is addictive, and on the good days, it pays a lot more than she used to make as an administrative assistant. VANEK SMITH: And the day that you were there, Adrian, Lynne booked a 3 1/2-hour shift for 95 bucks, and then you guys went for a ride. MA: We did. (SOUNDBITE OF CAR ENGINE REVVING)MA: So on that afternoon, we hop in her sedan and drive to a nearby Amazon warehouse. And when we got there, she drove past a bunch of big trucks and entered this building through a big door. Half the space was taken up by, basically, this, like, big metal tower and this network of chutes and conveyor belts, and then next to that was a long row of parking spaces. And so Lynne drove over to one of these spots where a shelf full of boxes and envelopes was already waiting for her, and then to find out where it all went, she took out her phone. LYNNE: It kind of scans it, downloads the packages onto my phone. And - looks like I'm going to Worcester - not my favorite place to go to. MA: No shade on Worcester. She said it was actually - the roads there are kind of rough. VANEK SMITH: Sure, it's the roads. MA: (Laughter) So, you know, as she was loading up the car, I noticed that some of these packages are pretty big. Like, there was a fancy pressure cooker, a child's car seat, a fish aquarium. LYNNE: I break a lot of nails doing this job. MA: But she managed to get the car packed up, and once she did, the rest of her afternoon basically went like this. She drives to a house, grabs a package and carefully traverses the snow-covered walkway. And, ignoring the scary sounding dog. . . (SOUNDBITE OF DOG BARKING)MA: She drops off the package and scans the label to let Amazon know it's done. (SOUNDBITE OF SCANNER BEEPING)MA: Over the next few hours, Lynne repeats this process 18 times. (SOUNDBITE OF SCANNER BEEPING)VANEK SMITH: That's a lot of times and a lot of dogs. MA: OK, there weren't 18 dogs. VANEK SMITH: (Laughter). MA: And, you know, Lynne told me, like, 18 stops is actually a pretty easy shift. Often, she'll make 30 or 40 stops in one go. VANEK SMITH: I mean, this sounds exactly like a UPS job or a mail carrier. MA: Yeah. And just like a mail carrier, Lynne has to deal with bad roads, hungry dogs, lousy weather - oh, and slip-and-falls. Like, she told me about this one time when she slipped on a customer's wet stone walkway. LYNNE: And my feet went straight out from under me, and I landed right on my back. And I went so hard that my teeth, like, clanked together (laughter). And I think the guy inside must've heard me because he peered out the door and said, are you OK? And I said, I think so. And he said, all right, and then shut the door and didn't even helped me up. So I was like, OK. MA: I swear that people in Massachusetts are nice. VANEK SMITH: I mean, I suppose he asked if she was OK. That's something. MA: Yes. But, you know, it's a pretty scary thing to happen. And stories like this are why some experts are critical of Amazon Flex, like David Weil. He's a professor studying labor policy at Brandeis University. DAVID WEIL: The mail deliverer who came to your house to deliver a package or the UPS driver was an employee of those companies, and they would be protected by a whole set of workplace laws. MA: If they get injured on the job, they might get worker's comp, or their union might help. If they face harassment or discrimination, civil rights laws might cover them. But these don't apply to Flex drivers because they're not technically employees. VANEK SMITH: And, Adrian, you reached out to Amazon for this story, and they were pretty clear with you. They consider Flex drivers to be independent contractors. MA: But David Weil, he's pretty skeptical of this label. WEIL: A real independent contractor - keyword there is independent. MA: And through the Flex app, Amazon exerts a lot of control over when drivers work and how much it pays. It also tracks their performance and punishes those that fail to meet a certain standard. WEIL: When you have that much control over what a worker does and the consequences of failing to do that, we call that employment. MA: At least Weil does. He argues there ought to be laws that give Flex drivers and other gig workers the kinds of protections employees get - protections that could help folks like Lynne. Right now if she breaks her arm making a delivery, she has to figure out how to pay for it. And while she's laid up, of course, she's not making money. VANEK SMITH: And, Adrian, you talked to Lynne. Like, how did she feel about this? MA: She says it might be nice to have some more benefits but not if it means losing the flexibility she expects from gig work. VANEK SMITH: Oh, interesting. MA: Yeah, but there's an irony here. Lynn has flexibility, but also, she says she works a lot harder than she used to. While we were on the road together, she told me she spends about 35 hours a week driving. And then there's all the time she spends on her phone swiping and just trying to get a shift. LYNNE: My day is taken up between looking for work, doing work and then squeezing in a bite to eat here and there, which can be difficult. MA: Does that, like, affect your social life? LYNNE: What social life (laughter)? MA: And that schedule doesn't leave a lot of time for things like shopping either, which she says is actually fine because if there's ever anything she needs to buy, she can usually find it on Amazon. VANEK SMITH: Oh, no (laughter). It all comes back around. MA: There is no escape. VANEK SMITH: Amazon wins in the end. MA: Yeah. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VANEK SMITH: That was reporter Adrian Ma from WBUR in Boston, and this has been two Indicators. Cardiff, get back in here for the credits. GARCIA: I never actually left.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: This is PLANET MONEY from NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) CARDIFF GARCIA, HOST:  Mustafa Nuur was born in Mogadishu, Somalia, in 1992. His father owned and ran a few small businesses. MUSTAFA NUUR: We had an ice cream shop, and then we had a clothing store. But the ice cream would have been the. . . GARCIA: The big moneymaker back then. NUUR: . . . The big moneymaker because Somalia is a very hot country. STACEY VANEK SMITH, HOST:  But when Mustafa was 11, the Somali terrorist group al-Shabab asked his father to provide them with funding. His father refused multiple times, Mustafa says. And then one day around noon, members of al-Shabab came to Mustafa's house, and in front of Mustafa, his mother and his seven younger siblings, they murdered his father in their courtyard. By 4 p. m. , the family was fleeing Somalia. NUUR: So we didn't have any time to, like, start thinking about where should we go or what we should take. We didn't even take any of our belongings. The only item I just managed to grab was a bedsheet from my bed. That's pretty much it. GARCIA: That's all you left with. NUUR: That's all I left with. GARCIA: Mustafa and his family spent roughly the next decade - until he was 22 - in refugee camps in Kenya until they were resettled Lancaster City, Pa. , in 2014. VANEK SMITH: And out of these tragic circumstances, just five years later, Mustafa is a small business owner just like his dad was. And refugees like him and other immigrants are a meaningful part of a complicated success story - the story of how Lancaster City and the surrounding Lancaster County have prospered economically. I'm Stacey Vanek Smith. GARCIA: And I'm Cardiff Garcia. Normally, the two of us are the co-hosts of PLANET MONEY'S daily podcast called The Indicator From Planet Money.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GARCIA: Coming up after the break - inside Amazon Flex and all the hidden work that goes into getting you your packages in two days or less. Stacey, for this one, I'm out. You take it with reporter Adrian Ma from WBUR in Boston. VANEK SMITH: Yes. Adrian, you brought us this story about Amazon. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) ADRIAN MA: Right.

LYNNE: I break a lot of nails doing this job. MA: But she managed to get the car packed up, and once she did, the rest of her afternoon basically went like this. She drives to a house, grabs a package and carefully traverses the snow-covered walkway. And, ignoring the scary sounding dog. . . (SOUNDBITE OF DOG BARKING) MA: She drops off the package and scans the label to let Amazon know it's done. (SOUNDBITE OF SCANNER BEEPING) MA: Over the next few hours, Lynne repeats this process 18 times. (SOUNDBITE OF SCANNER BEEPING) VANEK SMITH: That's a lot of times and a lot of dogs. MA: OK, there weren't 18 dogs. VANEK SMITH: (Laughter). MA: And, you know, Lynne told me, like, 18 stops is actually a pretty easy shift. Often, she'll make 30 or 40 stops in one go. VANEK SMITH: I mean, this sounds exactly like a UPS job or a mail carrier. MA: Yeah. And just like a mail carrier, Lynne has to deal with bad roads, hungry dogs, lousy weather - oh, and slip-and-falls. Like, she told me about this one time when she slipped on a customer's wet stone walkway. LYNNE: And my feet went straight out from under me, and I landed right on my back. And I went so hard that my teeth, like, clanked together (laughter). And I think the guy inside must've heard me because he peered out the door and said, are you OK? And I said, I think so. And he said, all right, and then shut the door and didn't even helped me up. So I was like, OK. MA: I swear that people in Massachusetts are nice. VANEK SMITH: I mean, I suppose he asked if she was OK. That's something. MA: Yes. But, you know, it's a pretty scary thing to happen. And stories like this are why some experts are critical of Amazon Flex, like David Weil. He's a professor studying labor policy at Brandeis University. DAVID WEIL: The mail deliverer who came to your house to deliver a package or the UPS driver was an employee of those companies, and they would be protected by a whole set of workplace laws. MA: If they get injured on the job, they might get worker's comp, or their union might help. If they face harassment or discrimination, civil rights laws might cover them. But these don't apply to Flex drivers because they're not technically employees. VANEK SMITH: And, Adrian, you reached out to Amazon for this story, and they were pretty clear with you. They consider Flex drivers to be independent contractors. MA: But David Weil, he's pretty skeptical of this label. WEIL: A real independent contractor - keyword there is independent. MA: And through the Flex app, Amazon exerts a lot of control over when drivers work and how much it pays. It also tracks their performance and punishes those that fail to meet a certain standard. WEIL: When you have that much control over what a worker does and the consequences of failing to do that, we call that employment. MA: At least Weil does. He argues there ought to be laws that give Flex drivers and other gig workers the kinds of protections employees get - protections that could help folks like Lynne. Right now if she breaks her arm making a delivery, she has to figure out how to pay for it. And while she's laid up, of course, she's not making money. VANEK SMITH: And, Adrian, you talked to Lynne. Like, how did she feel about this? MA: She says it might be nice to have some more benefits but not if it means losing the flexibility she expects from gig work. VANEK SMITH: Oh, interesting. MA: Yeah, but there's an irony here. Lynn has flexibility, but also, she says she works a lot harder than she used to. While we were on the road together, she told me she spends about 35 hours a week driving. And then there's all the time she spends on her phone swiping and just trying to get a shift. LYNNE: My day is taken up between looking for work, doing work and then squeezing in a bite to eat here and there, which can be difficult. MA: Does that, like, affect your social life? LYNNE: What social life (laughter)? MA: And that schedule doesn't leave a lot of time for things like shopping either, which she says is actually fine because if there's ever anything she needs to buy, she can usually find it on Amazon. VANEK SMITH: Oh, no (laughter). It all comes back around. MA: There is no escape. VANEK SMITH: Amazon wins in the end. MA: Yeah. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VANEK SMITH: That was reporter Adrian Ma from WBUR in Boston, and this has been two Indicators. Cardiff, get back in here for the credits. GARCIA: I never actually left. I've been here the whole time. VANEK SMITH: You've been here the whole time. GARCIA: If you like these stories, The Indicator From Planet Money publishes one every single day, so subscribe to us. VANEK SMITH: All the days. GARCIA: Yeah. VANEK SMITH: The Indicator is produced by Leena Sanzgiri and Darius Rafieyan. Our editor is Paddy Hirsch, and our fact-checker and intern is Brittany Cronin. GARCIA: Shoutout to Alexi Horowitz-Ghazi and Nick Fountain for adapting today's episode for PLANET MONEY. VANEK SMITH: And if you haven't already, subscribe to the PLANET MONEY newsletter. It is a short, scintillating read about one interesting topic each week. You can find it at npr. org/planetmoneynewsletter. GARCIA: And one last pitch - come be our intern. Both PLANET MONEY and The Indicator podcasts are hiring interns. Details are at our website, and honestly, the easiest way to find that is just by Googling it. . . VANEK SMITH: Always the easiest way. GARCIA: . . . Like anything else. VANEK SMITH: I'm Stacey Vanek Smith. GARCIA: And I'm Cardiff Garcia. This is NPR. Thanks for listening.

MOTT: But it's actually a term that has existed in printing and publishing for centuries going back from the time when they would actually cut and paste elements in paper to put together rough copy. SIMON: Mott and Tesler worked for Xerox in the 1970s. The company wanted to bring computer technology into the world of publishing. They were asked to design a word processor that made sense to people who weren't computer nerds - publishers and editors. MOTT: I mean, the prototypical customer or user was a woman I worked with who was in her 60s, and she'd been in publishing our entire life. And we had to design a product that she could actually sit down and use instead of a typewriter and a pencil. SIMON: Back then, computer users toggled between modes like command and edit. Hansen Hsu, a curator with the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, Calif. , explained this ancient technology to us. HANSEN HSU: If you were in edit mode and you typed on your keyboard, everything would be just like you might type in Microsoft Word today.

Larry Tesler worked with Tim Mott to make cutting and pasting copy a simple process familiar to everybody in publishing.

A group of researchers at University of California Berkeley is tracking the organizing and protesting. Nataliya Nedzhvetskaya is one of those researchers and joins us now from Berkeley. Thanks so much for being with us. NATALIYA NEDZHVETSKAYA: Thanks for having me. SIMON: How significant do you find this Kickstarter vote? NEDZHVETSKAYA: You know, it's unprecedented in that it's the first successful formal recognition of a union for these kind of more privileged class of tech workers. SIMON: Well, what - why have those efforts failed in the past, and what's changed now? Is it just the times? NEDZHVETSKAYA: It's interesting. There have been a few really close calls. Back in the early 2000s, there was a company called E-town (ph) that had a successful vote, but the company actually went bankrupt before then. Amazon technicians in 2014 took it as far as, you know, a vote with the National Labor Relations Board. I think they ultimately didn't get enough votes. SIMON: Well, I think there might be a lot of people listening to this conversation who don't think of tech workers as being in the same category at all as factory workers or, for that matter, overworked teachers. They're high-paid, inside work - no heavy lifting, air conditioning. What are some of the circumstances that are leading them to unionize? NEDZHVETSKAYA: Yeah. So what set this all off with Kickstarter was there's this comic book that was, you know, on the fundraising platform. It's called \"Always Punch Nazis. \" The news outlet Breitbart saw that this was on Kickstarter. They got in touch with the company and basically said, you know, this is a violation of your company policy. This promotes violence. The company initially took it down. A lot of workers were upset by this action because they felt like it was acquiescing to the alt-right. Basically, the workers had one kind of moral take on the issue, and then company management had a very different one. And I think it was this moment in the company when people realized, you know, we don't have as much of a say in the decision-making as we would like to. This is our - you know, our intellectual labor as employees. We want a little bit more control over exactly what happens with that. SIMON: Are the people who own and run high-tech companies resistant to that? NEDZHVETSKAYA: We have seen a fair amount of resistance, yeah. Tech itself is really interesting because it started with this really kind of ideological, almost utopian vision. You go back to the early days of tech, the people who were involved in this industry weren't doing it for the money. They were doing it because they really just loved the technology and the promise of it. And that's kind of carried forward to today. Google, up until a couple of years ago, had the phrase don't be evil in their corporate handbook. That's since been removed. But that kind of, you know, ideology lives on in tech. In other countries - so in places like Germany and France, you actually have workers formally represented as part of the corporate board of directors, so there is precedent for workers having a greater say in how these corporations are run around the world. The U. S. doesn't have this kind of structure. And in some ways, I see this unionization effort as a small way to try to get a little bit more influence over company decision-making and just kind of a seat at the table, a voice in the room. SIMON: Yeah. So this is just Kickstarter. Do you expect that union efforts at other companies will be emboldened by this and say, well, if they can do it at Kickstarter, we can do it here? NEDZHVETSKAYA: I think that Kickstarter - you know, it's a relatively small company, so organizing at Kickstarter is different than organizing at, you know, Amazon, for instance. But it's certainly - it sets a precedent. It shows this can be done. It shows kind of a blueprint for how it can be done, actually. I'd be surprised if we didn't see more actions like this coming on.

And most of them don't even realize it. A pilot program in five counties has just wrapped up that uses a computer algorithm to instantly target eligible records. Code for America is a nonprofit that has partnered with district attorney offices in California to develop the program. And we're joined now from San Francisco by Alia Toran-Burrell, senior program manager for Code for America. Welcome to the program. ALIA TORAN-BURRELL: Hi. Thanks for having me. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So you were able to do this project because of Prop 64, a 2016 law that legalized marijuana use for adults. So how does this algorithm work? TORAN-BURRELL: So the algorithm works by reading bulk criminal conviction history based on a district attorney's eligibility criteria and produces an output with eligibility determinations that a district attorney can then provide to the court for updates. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So your algorithm, in essence, sort of gobbles up records that meet the eligibility standards. And then what happens? TORAN-BURRELL: It produces and outputs - pretty similar to an Excel spreadsheet - with all eligibility determinations already complete. So the alternative would be that a district attorney would have to cull through hundreds of thousands of lines of conviction data to determine eligibility for each of the convictions in their county that might be eligible. So this technology allows district attorneys to do this in an incredibly streamlined way so that people can get record relief sooner and so that the district attorneys and government resources are saved for other important things. GARCIA-NAVARRO: And these are for what? - simple possession, low-level dealing? TORAN-BURRELL: Yeah. So when Prop 64 was passed, it identified four different types of marijuana convictions that somebody could get relief for - so things like possession, things like use. The problem, though, was that the vast majority of people who had those convictions weren't getting relief through the petition-based process. So the petition-based process meaning you have to go to court. You have to, in a lot of cases, have a lawyer. You have to take time off of work, potentially have to pay money. And so there were hundreds of thousands of people in California who were eligible for this conviction relief who just weren't getting it. GARCIA-NAVARRO: And I think we're talking about 220,000 convictions? TORAN-BURRELL: Yes. Across California, 220,000 convictions were eligible for relief. GARCIA-NAVARRO: And so once this happens, people may not even be aware that their records have been cleared. Why is that? TORAN-BURRELL: Sure. The law itself didn't specify a method to notify those people who received conviction relief. Code for America is currently exploring ways that are effective to notify people. And each district attorney's office and county in California are also embarking on ways to get the word out to people in their counties who might have eligible convictions. GARCIA-NAVARRO: What does it practically mean for someone to have their record expunged? TORAN-BURRELL: Sure. So 1 in 3 Americans have a criminal record. That number is immense. So that's between 70 million to 100 million people. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's a lot of people. TORAN-BURRELL: It's a lot of people, yeah. And convictions present thousands of barriers for people in moving on with their lives - so things like getting housing, getting jobs, getting education. And so the ability to clear records is a way for people to get rid of these barriers that are potentially holding them back from being successful in their lives and their communities. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So the pilot phase is over. What happens now? TORAN-BURRELL: While we were embarking on the pilot, we realized that we could actually expand the technology to help serve every county district attorney in California. And so we developed an easy-to-use desktop application that any district attorney's office can can download onto their computer. So it's a way for every county in California to take advantage of the technology that we provided to those five pilot counties originally.

Nearly five years have passed since those murders, but videos from the broadcast and from the gunman's GoPro camera are still being shared and often manipulated and posted by conspiracy theorists. Despite YouTube's community guidelines about graphic violence, videos keep appearing on the site. Alison's father, Andy Parker, has been fighting for years to get YouTube and its parent company, Google, to stop airing those videos. He's now filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission. We should note here that Google is one of NPR's financial supporters. Andy Parker joins us now from his home in Collinsville, Va. Thank you so much for being with us. ANDY PARKER: Thank you, Lulu. I'm glad to be here. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Tell me a little bit about how you first discovered these videos and what kind of impact that had on you. PARKER: Well, I - you know, I don't recall the exact time, but it was very shortly after Alison's murder. And I had a YouTube channel myself, like a lot of people do. And you know, I'd archive Alison's dance recitals. I would create videos of, you know, our kayaking adventures and just stuff like that. And I uploaded all that stuff. Nobody paid any attention to it until Alison was killed. And then suddenly, they swarmed it. I mean, people were posting the most vile comments you could imagine on her dance recital. You know, people - I remember there were comments like, I watched her die, and I really enjoyed it - I mean, sick, evil stuff like that. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So you've been waging this long fight to get these videos taken down. Can you sort of share what that fight has looked like? What did you have to do? PARKER: Yeah. Initially - it's not like you can call up Google customer service and say, hey, you know, got a problem here. They're the most opaque company in the world. But I got some young man overseas, and he - he was actually very helpful. And he said, we have a thing called the moment of death certificate. And you apply that to videos, and then they'll be removed. And I thought, well, that's great - well, until I found out that you couldn't just use it as a blanket tool. They were asking me essentially to go in and flag every single video to - you know, to have it removed. You know, imagine being told that if you want videos of your child's murder removed from the Internet, you got to watch and describe every single one of them. You know, and you're talking to a machine. At the time, I thought, well, you know, somebody is going to recognize this. No, they don't. It's all an algorithm. It's all a robot that responds back. And so nothing was getting done. GARCIA-NAVARRO: This has obviously been horrific to live with. And you know, I can't even imagine how hard this has been. We should say that YouTube has said that it has taken down thousands of Alison's videos and, quote, \"rigorously enforce these policies using a combination of machine learning and human review. \" Also, there is no law against posting disturbing images, is there? PARKER: Right. There is not. And Google's response is - it's the same response that we've been hearing for years. All they do is regurgitate their terms of service, which they violate, and their policies. They don't tell you - and they lie about the - you know, the fact that, you know, they have human eyeballs on it. They really don't. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So you filed an FTC complaint, and you want to sort of revoke or amend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects tech companies for being responsible for what's on their sites. So for example, at NPR, we can't say bad words on air. We could certainly not play a murder on air. But tech companies who say that they're simply platforms can do that. What are you hoping to achieve here? PARKER: Yeah, you're right. I mean, if Google had to abide by the same editorial oversight that you or Fox News or any legitimate news organization - you know, we wouldn't be having this conversation. So what I'm trying to accomplish here - and I'm doing this not just for me, but I'm doing it for, you know, the Sandy Hook families, the Parkland families, anybody that's been victimized like I have - we think that this action is the first step. GARCIA-NAVARRO: I just have a last question. I mean, YouTube has said it makes exceptions for graphic material that has educational, news, scientific or artistic value. And people who oppose any restrictions on the Internet say that it's a short step to sort of censorship because one person's conspiracy theory might be another person's freedom of speech. I understand that in the case of the death of your daughter - the murder of your daughter - that may not be the case. But the wider issue - do you see that there might be problems with trying to infringe on freedom of speech online? PARKER: I understand that argument, but as I told Senator Cruz when I testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, look; we can all agree that we can protect the First Amendment, but there are limits. Recording and publishing murder online should not be one of them. There are limits to freedom of speech. Just like you can't yell fire in a theater, this is one of those exceptions. And I think anybody with any common sense would recognize that to continue to promote this - literally promote it and monetize murder - my daughter's murder - which is what Google does - it's reprehensible. It's pernicious. And it's got to stop. And that can be done without violating the First Amendment and freedom of speech. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Andy Parker - he filed a complaint against YouTube with the FTC for failing to remove videos of the murder of his daughter Alison Parker. Thank you very much, Mr. Parker. PARKER: Thank you, Lulu. GARCIA-NAVARRO: We contacted Google and asked them to respond to Andy Parker's charge that the company was lying about having human beings review objectionable content. Google reiterated it has hired 10,000 people to do just that, which is the number of human reviewers Google announced it would hire in 2017.

Over the years, the site has continued to thrive. And Jessa Lingel writes in a piece for the website The Conversation, Craigslist may even hold the key to a more democratic way of interacting online. Lingel is an assistant professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania, and she joins us now. Welcome. JESSA LINGEL: Thank you. KELLY: So there is something remarkable about a site that looks like an old classified section of the newspaper but is still profitable and very widely used today. How has Craigslist managed to do that? LINGEL: So it's great that you used the word classified because Craigslist is a classified ad site, and it is the most popular platform in any medium at any time in history for posting classified ads. KELLY: And why leave it so simple and so true to how it has always looked? Is this the if-it-ain't-broke-don't-fix-it model of the Internet? LINGEL: It really is. It sort of comes down to the commitment of its CEO, Jim Buckmaster, who's been at the helm since 1999, and the founder, Craig Newmark. And they're both just old-school engineer-type guys who just really believe in keeping the design as simple and functional as possible. It does not sell user data to third parties. It doesn't have banner ads. The only ads on the site are the ads that users write to try and get rid of their coffee tables and cellphones. KELLY: Now, Craigslist has had all kinds of challenges. There have been scams. There's been fraud. There have been violent crimes. And I wonder - is that linked to another very distinctive feature, which is anonymity? LINGEL: So that policy goes back to Craigslist's early days in the 1990s when it was very common to be anonymous online or pseudononymous (ph). And they see that policy as providing a form of privacy to their users. Though it is true that there have been some, you know, very violent crimes; there's been scams on Craigslist - but of course, there are also scams on platforms that we think of as much classier or much safer. You know, there's scams on LinkedIn, on eBay, on Facebook. KELLY: You did hear one very powerful defense of Craigslist from users who you talked to who are people of color. What did they tell you? LINGEL: Yeah. So I heard over and over again the sense that Craigslist is part of the poor people's Internet. Craigslist sort of has this stigma that using it means you're lower-class; using it means you're sort of hard up. But it also meant that people of color, poor people found that they could use the site in a way that really made sense for them. So we actually know for a fact that there have been these high-profile incidents on Airbnb of hosts discriminating against guests because of their name or what they look like. So suddenly, on a site like Craigslist, you can rent an apartment; you can try and search for a job. And you don't have to worry about people discriminating against you because you're anonymous. KELLY: And when you write that you think Craigslist could play a role in a more democratic Internet, is that part of what you're getting at? LINGEL: Yeah. I've been studying digital culture for about 10 years, and I've always been interested in platforms that are sort of outside the mainstream. And one thing that really interests me about Craigslist is that it's been online for so long, and it hasn't had to change its politics. So Craigslist holds on to these early-1990s Web values about a platform being truly accessible, a platform being open and doesn't change its appearance. And in that sense, Craigslist reminds us there's a path that a company can take, and it can feel democratic, and it can feel less commercial and still be incredibly successful. You don't have to sacrifice your profit in order to protect user data.

S. officials have warned that Russia is interfering in the presidential election again. In 2016, Russia launched a massive disinformation campaign designed to influence voters. Since then, many schools have added digital literacy courses, but some experts say the voters who struggle the most with fake news are senior citizens. For All Tech Considered, NPR's Sam Gringlas visited a class that's tackling the challenge. BRE CLARK: You'll see the sign-in sheet's coming around. SAM GRINGLAS, BYLINE: We're in the daisy room at the Schweinhaut Senior Center in suburban Maryland. The walls are washed in bright yellow and decorated with - you guessed it - pink and purple daisies. Around a bank of tables, a dozen seniors are on iPads and laptops, and they're in the middle of an investigation. PAUL MINK: What you got here is a possibly fake article. GRINGLAS: That's Paul Mink (ph). Like the other students in this workshop, he's staring at a meme. It's an image of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi with a caption. Instructor Bre Clark reads it aloud. CLARK: California received three extra seats in Congress by including 2 1/2 million illegal aliens in their population total. GRINGLAS: Does that sound right? MINK: Let's put the source up there; K-R-Y-P. GRINGLAS: Searching on Google leads to some dead ends and some detours. CLARK: Oh, you found Fortnite memes (laughter). So did you perform a search for memes? OK. GRINGLAS: Eventually, everyone pulls up a reputable fact-checking site like Snopes or PolitiFact, just like they've been taught. And Marlene Cianci (ph) finds the Pelosi meme. MARLENE CIANCI: A meme on Facebook falsely claims - so. . . CLARK: Awesome. CIANCI: It's right there. It's just a two-step thing. CLARK: Awesome. CIANCI: And there it was. GRINGLAS: This session, how to spot fake news, is organized by the nonprofit Older Adults Technology Services. These kind of classes aren't common yet nationwide, but a recent study suggests they're increasingly important. Researchers at Princeton and NYU found that Facebook users 65 and over posted seven times as many articles from fake news websites compared to adults under 29. In the daisy room, Clark tells these seniors that a key to spotting fake news is knowing its source. CLARK: So where does the information come from? Many of you - or a few of you - cited that you kind of go directly to a source you already trust. But if you do stumble upon something, where did the information come from? GRINGLAS: Ninety-two year old Patricia Kramer (ph) says she appreciated the lesson, even though she thinks older adults know how to spot something fishy and shouldn't shoulder all the blame for this problem. PATRICIA KRAMER: If you tell me that you've got an ice cream cone, I'm going to say, where is it? You know? I want to see the proof. I'm going to question every single thing, and I think that would be something that older people would do 'cause we've been fooled a lot of times when we were younger. GRINGLAS: Beside memes, the class learns about deepfakes - online audio and video that seem real but aren't - also, Russian trolls and propaganda. After the class, Joyce Wu (ph) says she feels empowered to wade through it all. JOYCE WU: In this new technology where things go so fast, we just get left out sometimes or we get confused. So having this program really enlightens us and help us to advance and become more braver. GRINGLAS: Over at Stanford University, Susan Nash is one of the few researchers who's been looking at why seniors may be more likely to struggle with fake news. SUSAN NASH: If we were standing in line in the supermarket and we saw a tabloid, I mean, people in my generation know what that means. But when we see something online, the traditional cues that we're used to are not present. GRINGLAS: Nash, who is 63, also says confirmation bias can get stronger with age. Isolation can be a factor, too. And since the AARP finds tech use is climbing among older adults, Nash says it's important to tailor workshops to their specific needs. NASH: Just because you're online doesn't mean you're ready to evaluate everything you're seeing there. GRINGLAS: Nash says classes for seniors taught by peers can be especially effective; so are checklists and hands-on practice. NASH: We all know that an informed democracy is the only way a democracy works. And if we don't teach them how to evaluate what they're seeing, then we are poisoning our electorate. GRINGLAS: So Nash and other groups are racing to whip up more programming. And with an election on the horizon, the stakes are incredibly high. Sam Gringlas, NPR News, Washington.

I'm Terry Gross. You'd be hard-pressed to name an American company that's more distrusted and yet more influential today than Facebook. The social media site has been rocked by scandals involving the misuse of its users' personal information and harsh criticism of its role in the 2016 election. And yet it remains huge, with nearly 3 billion users, and profitable, with annual earnings in the billions of dollars. Our guest, Steven Levy, is a veteran technology journalist who's been reporting on Facebook for years and has written a new in-depth history of the company. Facebook's founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg gave Levy leaving nine interviews and permission to talk to many other present and former employees of the company. Levy writes that virtually every problem Facebook has confronted since 2016 is a consequence of its unprecedented mission to connect the world and its reckless haste to do so. Steven Levy has written for Rolling Stone, Harper's Magazine, The New York Times and The New Yorker. He's now editor at large for Wired and the author of seven previous books. He spoke with FRESH AIR's Dave Davies about his new book, \"Facebook: The Inside Story. \"DAVE DAVIES, BYLINE: Well, Steven Levy welcome to FRESH AIR. You have covered technology for a long time. When did you decide you had to make this a book-length exploration of Facebook? STEVEN LEVY: I could pinpoint that pretty precisely. I think it was the end of August of 2015. Mark Zuckerberg posted on his Facebook feed that a billion people had signed on to Facebook that day, and I realized that had never happened before. I'd covered Facebook for a long time before that, but I realized that this is something utterly new, enabled by technology and whatever this company did. And I had to write about it and explain how that happened and what it meant and how they dealt with it. DAVIES: Right. So what kind of commitment did Zuckerberg and others at Facebook make to cooperating with you? LEVY: Well, it took me a few months to get them to this point, but eventually, they agreed to give me access to their employees, including Mark and Sheryl Sandberg, his chief operating officer. And this is also very important. They would give a go-ahead to former employees who wouldn't talk to me unless Facebook said it was OK. There were no strings attached. They didn't get the read the manuscript. The only thing that I said was the interviews I did for the book would be embargoed for the book. And I wouldn't be able to take something if someone said something controversial and just write it in an article for Wired the next day. DAVIES: All right. Everything on the record? LEVY: Well, they're allowed to go and background. They're off the record if they wanted to go there. And some of the interviews I did, particularly with some people who may be - not be at Facebook, were either on background or not for attribution. So some people were a little worried about direct quotes against Facebook being in the book. DAVIES: Right. That makes sense. But Zuckerberg himself - was all that on the record? LEVY: I don't think Mark once said, this is off the record. I think pretty much everything he says - there's - the PR people can't say, Mark, don't say that. At least they don't. And he calls his own shots. Some other people would say, oh, let me say this off the record. And I would try to dissuade them, but a couple of people did that. And one in particular - in the course of our interviews, I kept saying, hey; this has got to be on the record. I really ought to use this. DAVIES: Right. What's he like in person? What was the relationship like? LEVY: We got to a pretty good place where I think he was probably as candid with me as he's been with any journalist, although I don't think he ever forgot that he was talking to a journalist. He has grown over the years as an interviewee. When I first met him and started asking him questions - this is 2006 - he would just stare at me blankly. And it took him a while before I can get any answer out of him. And by the time I started this book, he had obviously been more comfortable with this. He'd been a CEO for many years and a CEO of a public company, so he understood how to give answers to journalists. And he's a very curious person. People describe him as a learning machine. So sometimes he'll ask questions of me, and I think he did this with other journalists, too. DAVIES: Yeah. Can you think of an example of him asking you a question? LEVY: Well, I think one of the most interesting examples - and this sort of casts a light on how Facebook is dealing with its current issues - it was 2018, and it was a run up to their big developer conference they called F8, which has the resonance of fate. And he was explaining to me how he was going to spend half of his keynote speech not apologizing exactly but saying that Facebook knew it made mistakes and we're going to win back your trust. And the other half was going to be about how - well, we have to introduce new things, too, because we can't stand still. So on one hand, it was saying, hey; don't worry; we're fine, and on the other hand saying, here's the new disturbing things we're doing. And he said, well, we're going to introduce a product called Facebook Dating. And I said, really? Don't you think that's a little off-tone considering people are so concerned about the data they give you? This is just basically a few weeks after Cambridge Analytica, which was the biggest scandal in the company's history, involving the release of data. And he said, well, Facebook has always been sort of a secret dating site of some kind, and we don't think it's that big a deal. And then he went on. And then a few minutes later, he just stopped and he said, hey; do you really think that's going to be a big problem for us? DAVIES: What'd you say? LEVY: I said, yeah. DAVIES: (Laughter) And it didn't happen or did happen? It says in the book, but I can't remember. LEVY: Well, he - as one would expect, people said, what's going on here? In this moment, they're introducing a dating site. They introduce it in some smaller countries first. And then a year later, they rolled it out to the United States, and you can now date on Facebook. DAVIES: One of the things you see about Facebook after it got going for a few years was there was a decision to focus on growth - more users, more engagement among the users that we have. What motivated this? I mean. . . LEVY: Well. . . DAVIES: It's sort of natural for every business, I suppose, but. . . LEVY: Sure. DAVIES: This was sort of a different business. LEVY: Right, right. Well, it's - every business wants to grow. But what this thing with Facebook was its relentless focus on growth. And Mark always believed in it, but in 2008, an executive named Chamath Palihapitiya said, I want to take this a step farther. I want to start an internal group called the Growth Circle. And we would just do anything we can to make Facebook grow faster and faster and faster and get it to a billion people really, really quickly. And this was unthinkable at the time, but Chamath was very smart, and he gathered the team of the best people at Facebook. He got a few people from outside. And they were almost a group, a wrecking crew from within Facebook. They sat differently in a different place than everyone else, and they did things that really pushed the boundaries of what was acceptable in Silicon Valley practices to push growth even farther than it had before. DAVIES: What were some of the things that they did? LEVY: Well, one thing was - and this was kind of standard; they did a really great job of it - was to make Facebook higher and higher when you searched in Google for it. And, you know, Facebook profiles were available on Google, so when people search themselves, a Facebook profile would come up with you with your name on it, even though you weren't there. And they would encourage you to take a look and sign up. And another thing was sometimes they would - if you signed up. . . DAVIES: Wait one second. You said that it would show a profile of you even if you weren't a user, weren't registered with Facebook? LEVY: That's right. This is a controversial area of Facebook. It's something - Mark, you know, in 2006, he kept this notebook, and he would speculate on something called dark profiles. And Facebook didn't quite implement it the way he outlined that, which is almost like a Wikipedia page that your friends would start about you even if you weren't on Facebook. That didn't happen. But there was apparently something - I talked to a couple people in early Facebook who said that if someone tagged you in a photo, Facebook would keep a stub that you would then bring to life if you actually came and signed up for it. And Chamath told me that, yeah, one of the things they would do was have this - he referred to it as a dark profile to me - that would show up. And if you signed up, then they would immediately try to populate your newsfeed so you would have a reason to stay on Facebook. DAVIES: Right. And so if I weren't even registered with Facebook but Facebook collected information about me - because there's information on the Internet - someone does a Google search and finds my name, then suddenly there's me connected with Facebook. I see that. And I think, how - man, I should sign up? (Laughter). LEVY: That's what Chamath told me. Oh, yeah. And you know, So. . . DAVIES: Wow. LEVY: . . . Facebook has since said that they never use shadow profiles or dark profiles for reasons like that. And I'm not quite sure what they do now, you know, but they do keep tabs on people for security reasons and some other things. But they say they don't serve advertising to anything they keep. So it's sort of a gray area that I found some contradictions when I was doing the book. DAVIES: They also translated the site into foreign languages and - so that it would grow internationally, too. Right? LEVY: That's right. And you know, they were very aggressive about translations. They didn't hire translators. They let people - users in that country translate it themselves. And they would sometimes refine it. And especially in the big countries, they would do refinements. But in obscure dialects of certain languages, people would just, you know, translate for themselves. And in some smaller countries, Facebook would be in there in the native language when no one at Facebook spoke the language. There was no way to police what went on in that country from Facebook. DAVIES: Right. And in some cases, it became a major medium of information and was abused - right? - by people spreading rumors and hate speech. LEVY: That's right. We're thinking - yeah. Yeah, the prime example is Myanmar, where Facebook went and became very popular. And then it became even more popular when Facebook wound up giving it away. If you had a mobile plan, you wouldn't pay for the Facebook pages you used. So it became almost, like, synonymous with the Internet in Myanmar and some other places. Meanwhile, Facebook had at first none and then very few people who could read what was going on there and couldn't police it. And it was abuse. People would put up false content that spurred people to violence, literally. And it wasn't until 2015 that Facebook even translated its book of rules into Burmese. DAVIES: Steven Levy is editor at large for Wired. His new book is \"Facebook: The Inside Story. \" We'll talk more after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF ALEXANDRE DESPLAT'S \"SPY MEETING\")DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with Steven Levy. He is editor at large for Wired. He is a veteran technology writer, and he has a deep dive into Facebook. His new book is called \"Facebook: The Inside Story. \"All right. Let's talk about the 2016 presidential campaign. How much did Facebook know, as that campaign progressed, about Russian efforts to plant fake or provocative stories in the newsfeed and also put bogus information in ads it was buying? LEVY: Well, the Russian misinformation, which we could talk about, is part of a number of things that happened in the 2016 election that Facebook was involved in. The first thing was, you know, proliferation of fake stories. This called fake news weren't necessarily cooked up by the Russians. Only a small percentage of those turned out to be a part of this big Russian disinformation campaign that took place on Facebook. But a lot of it was done for financial gain - a lot of it from this small town in Macedonia, as it turned out, where people would make up fake stories or take a fake story that some obscure blogger posted and circulate it on Facebook. And because of decisions made earlier in Facebook's history - around 2008 and 2009, Mark had a Twitter obsession, and he made Facebook more friendly to things that went viral on the system. These fake news stories - things like, you know, the pope endorsed Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton was involved in a sex ring in a pizzeria - they would go viral on Facebook and be more popular than legitimate news stories. And Facebook had been warned against this sort of phenomenon. And particularly in the later stage of the presidential campaign, people were saying - hey, this has got to stop. But the company made a decision not to stop it because they felt it was part of people's expression to be able to post what they wanted. And Facebook didn't want to be in the position of a referee. Now, that decision, in part, was made by the head of Facebook's Washington office, who was a lifelong Republican and who saw his job, according to people who worked with him, as protecting the Republicans. So that went on till the end of the election, and fake news proliferated on Facebook. DAVIES: And I think it's worth making the point that one of the reasons that people in Macedonia found that they could make money by doing this was that, as part of its drive for growth, Facebook had its algorithm tweaked so that the most addictive material would come up at the top of your newsfeed. So there was an incentive for viral stuff, whether it was true or not. LEVY: Right. Engagement was part of the formula for what would appear on your newsfeed. So if a lot of people shared a post, it would be ranked higher and it would appear in more people's newsfeeds. DAVIES: Right. So what about the ads that were coming through? LEVY: So - the fact is that Facebook offered help to political candidates who wanted to use Facebook better. And one side did a much better job of it than the other, and that was Donald Trump's team. And they took advantage of everything you could on Facebook. They spent much, much more on Facebook than the Clinton campaign did. They accepted the help that Facebook offered both sides, and they just built the heck out of their campaign around Facebook. They would do things like create many, many variations of an ad directed to different kinds of people just to see what clicked, and the Clinton campaign did nothing like that. So the people at Facebook watched this with kind of awe. They're saying, wow, these people are really doing a great job with our campaign there on the Trump campaign. They didn't do anything about it because it wasn't - you know, they wanted to be fair to both sides. And they weren't too bothered by it because they thought - well, Clinton's going to win anyway, so this is just an interesting phenomenon about how someone uses our platform. DAVIES: And the company was making money from every ad, right? LEVY: Oh, sure. Yeah, it was making money. It wasn't the giant part of their revenues, but political ads in general were a significant source of revenue. DAVIES: Right. And of course, it's worth mentioning that that microtargeting of ads based on Facebook's information about its users was its chief selling point, not just on political ads but everything. I mean, you could really a target an ad at a specific kind of customer. LEVY: Right. And it sort of changed what the feel-good pitch of Facebook advertising was. You know, they would always say when you complained about microtargeting was - hey, this helps us serve more relevant ads to people. If you're interested in a certain musical star, we're going to let you know when that person has an album out or is appearing in your area because the advertisers will know where to find you. This is something a little different because Facebook knows so much about you that you could target someone who might be vulnerable to a certain kind of pitch that make you change your mind about something or even deter you from voting. So this isn't part of the feel-good vibe of Facebook advertising that it presents to the world. DAVIES: So Trump wins the election, which was not well-greeted by a lot of the staff at Facebook. LEVY: No, people were in tears when it's what happened, and they had a big meeting the day after the election. DAVIES: Tell us about the meeting. LEVY: Well, people wanted to know for the first time - gee, did we have a hand in this? Were we, in part, responsible for this electoral outcome that we, meaning a lot of the people at Facebook, didn't want to see? And there was some soul-searching among them. And a couple days afterwards, though, Mark Zuckerberg, in speaking at a conference in Half Moon Bay, said he thought it was a crazy idea to think that Facebook influenced the election, which was a statement he had to later walk back. DAVIES: Right. And eventually, real information came out. How did Zuckerberg's attitude change then? LEVY: Well, I think he realized that, one, it sounded blithe. I actually was in the room when he said that, and it really didn't sound that blithe. It was part of a longer, more thoughtful answer, and it didn't really bring the room to a standstill. But we learned more in the weeks following about the abuse of Facebook, including the Russian disinformation campaign that took place on Facebook through ads and other posts. And it didn't seem like such a reach when we learned those things. DAVIES: Yeah. How big were the numbers? How many people were - how many users got this misinformation? LEVY: Well, the Russian disinformation was hundreds of thousands - but again, not a big percentage at all, a very tiny percentage of the stuff that people saw on Facebook. Yet it had some really disturbing aspects to it. The Russians would do things - like, they would be able to find people who were against immigration and tell them - hey, there's this rally happening somewhere in Texas, you know, that's pro-immigration. You ought to go there and protest against it. And then they would inform people who were on the other side about the same rally, which was a nonexistent rally that the Russians were trying to create to bring two sides together that might fight each other. Basically, they were just trying to sow dissent and bad feelings to make people think that the system was really screwed up and, in some cases, deter them from voting. GROSS: We're listening to the interview FRESH AIR's Dave Davies recorded with Steven Levy, editor at large for Wired and author of the new book \"Facebook: The Inside Story. \"After a break, they'll talk about the damage to Facebook from the Cambridge Analytica scandal and about Mark Zuckerberg's plans for the future of the company. Later, Ken Tucker will review a newly released Bryan Ferry concert recorded live at the Royal Albert Hall in 1974. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF WAYNE HORVITZ AND THE ROYAL ROOM COLLECTIVE ENSEMBLE'S \"A WALK IN THE RAIN\")GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to the interview Dave Davies recorded with Wired editor at large Steven Levy about the social media giant Facebook. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg gave Levy nine interviews and permission to talk to many other present and former employees of the company for Levy's new book, \"Facebook: The Inside Story. \" When we left off, they were talking about the damage to Facebook's reputation from its role in the 2016 presidential election. DAVIES: The criticisms about the fake news and the ad campaigns, some of them from foreign sources, were almost overshadowed by the Cambridge Analytica scandal. This really grew out of a decision Facebook had made to make its product not just a social networking site but a platform so that outside software developers could use Facebook data to create apps, software products on Facebook. This was kind of a fateful decision, wasn't it? LEVY: That's right, and this took place really early in Facebook's history, in 2007. It was a big leap that Facebook all of a sudden said, we want to be kind of the next operating system in the world, and this will be a social operating system. The Internet should be built around people, and we're the place that's going to host that. And you can't say the platform was an unmitigated failure because they really lifted Facebook to the top rung of technology companies. It took place in 2007. And all of a sudden, everyone was talking about Facebook in a way they weren't before. And a couple of months afterwards, I wrote a cover story about Facebook for Newsweek, where I was working then. But the problem with it was, first, in order to do this, you had to hand over personal data to outsiders, to the software developers who were writing applications for this Facebook platform. And the platform itself had its dreams dashed when mobile phones became popular and people used those as operating systems. So your iPhone apps or your Android apps would be the operating system that you used, and the developers turned their attention to writing applications for phones. The platform still persisted, but it became more of an exchange of information between the developers and Facebook, with Facebook giving a lot of the information to the developers. In 2010 - and this was where I really say Cambridge Analytica started - Facebook said, we'll give more information than ever to the developers. So when you signed up as a user for one of these apps, the third party would not only get your information that you posted on Facebook but the information that your friends posted on Facebook. You would be giving away your friends' likes, which are very revealing, and their relationship status, sometimes their political status - all falling out of the hands of Facebook into the hands of these developers who could use them for their apps and were told, you can't sell these or give them to anyone else. But Facebook didn't really have strong enforcement to make sure that happened. DAVIES: And so Cambridge Analytica ends up getting the data of tens of millions of Facebook users. LEVY: That's right. There was an academic researcher who followed Facebook's rules in getting the information but then broke Facebook's rules in licensing the information to this company called Cambridge Analytica, which was run by this British military consultancy company, which made a partnership with a big funder of the far-right in the United States. DAVIES: Right, the Mercers. LEVY: Right. DAVIES: Right. You said that it's - to this day, it isn't clear whether the company's election efforts used Facebook profiles. Is that right? I thought that was accepted fact. LEVY: Well, they had the data handed over, but the Trump campaign, which worked with Cambridge Analytica, said that they really didn't use it much as a data source. But they helped with television ads, and they liked some of the people who worked there. It is fuzzy because on the other hand, the head of Cambridge Analytica, the company behind it, was boasting about the information they used. So I think it is a big mystery the degree to which that data was used in the election, but we do know the Trump campaign did use a lot of data and merged it with other databases. I think the shock to people was that this information got handed over to this company that no one ever heard of that worked for Trump. And that became Facebook's biggest scandal, ironically, even though some of this information had been published in 2015 by The Guardian, the same place that returned with the scoop in 2018. But this is pre-Trump, and it wasn't a big deal then. DAVIES: So this information about the 2016 campaign and then a subsequent hack of, like, 50 million user accounts sent the company's public image into a real nosedive. And Mark Zuckerberg went before Congress, and they promised serious steps to change things. What are they doing? LEVY: Well, they've done a number of things. For one thing, they give you more information. When you see something that looks like it's fake on Facebook, they have fact-checkers go over some of these claims. And when they turn out they're not factual, they don't take them off, but they might downrank it in the newsfeed. Fewer people might say it. They give you a chance to mouse over and see a little more information about the publication where this is printed. Maybe it's, like, a phony publication that doesn't exist besides Facebook. DAVIES: Now, those aren't ads. Those are items posted to the newsfeed, right? So. . . LEVY: Right. Yeah. And also, they - during elections, they monitor things. They look for the signals of disinformation campaigns and try to shut them down. So they're doing certain things that would have stopped some of the tricks in the 2016 election. And in the couple elections since - the midterm in 2018, elections in France and other places - they've done a better job, but it's an open question of how well they're going to do in 2020 when the people using Facebook and trying to abuse it again are going to come up with a new set of tricks. DAVIES: Steven Levy's book is \"Facebook: The Inside Story. \" We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF COOTIE WILLIAMS' \"RINKY DINK\")DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with Steven Levy. He is a veteran technology writer and the editor at large for Wired. He has a new book about the history of Facebook. It's called \"Facebook: The Inside Story. \"So Facebook has this challenge where people can post things on a newsfeed that may be misleading or false, right? And then. . . LEVY: Correct. DAVIES: People can run paid ads. What's the company's policy in dealing with potentially inaccurate or misleading information in the organic posts that people put on the site and the ads that people buy? LEVY: Well, Facebook will allow people to post misleading content, but if it starts circulating a lot and people complain about it, it will have fact-checkers to verify whether that's true or not. And if it's not true, they may downrank it, show it to fewer people. Then they might provide extra information, saying, you know, this is a publication that you may not want to trust, or, here's some other articles about the same thing that are more factual. Ads are a different thing. Mark has gone out on a limb and said, we are not going to fact-check political ads. So if someone makes a false claim, even consciously, about an opponent in a political ad, Facebook is going to be hands-off. DAVIES: Right, and that's been controversial. LEVY: It's really controversial, but Mark has stuck to his guns on this. He went before Congress this past October, where people just pummeled him about this. But he feels that he doesn't want Facebook to be in the position of saying, you know, well, this politician's ad is fake. The thing is a lie, and this isn't. DAVIES: Does the company have any disclosure requirements for funding sources of the ads? LEVY: It's the same funding disclosures that people have for ads in print or on TV. You have to say, this is my ad, and I approve this content. DAVIES: And for Facebook to be looking at not the ads but the posts by users, which might be factually suspect - I mean, given, you know, the scale of the posts every day, that's a huge challenge. How many people are doing this? LEVY: Well, it is a huge challenge. So the problem they had in 2016 is these Russians were posting it on their fake accounts, so that's not allowed. So if the account is inauthentic, as Facebook calls it, it could be taken down. But if an authentic person somewhere posts something that's fake, Facebook will not take it down. And we've heard that one thing the outside actors - Russians - might do is get people in the United States to post the fake content that they create. And Facebook then, by its own rules, would not be taking it down. DAVIES: Right. So a fake account can be taken down, right? LEVY: Yeah. Yeah. So this - and this became clear early in the 2016 election, when there was a page called DCLeaks, which was meant to spread the emails that were hacked from the Democratic National Committee. And at first, Facebook said, we're going to leave this up because it looks like a legitimate account. And then they figured out that it was not an authentic account, and they took it down because of that. DAVIES: Right, right. LEVY: Not because it was circulating this stuff about the Democrats that was hacked. DAVIES: You had one astonishing number in here. If I remember this accurately, in one three-month period, Facebook stopped 2 billion phony accounts from being registered. LEVY: Yeah. There's an unbelievable number of fake accounts that people try to stop. Now, in a way, that's worse than it sounds because when people try to create these fake accounts, they just bombard the website with one after another, and the vast majority are easily identified by Facebook algorithms. But there are 5% of accounts on Facebook that are fake, and this is hundreds of millions - right? - because you have almost 3 billion people now on Facebook. So even though 5% doesn't sound like a lot, that's an unbelievably big number. DAVIES: You know, in the middle of all this, Mark Zuckerberg talked about a new vision for Facebook. What is it? LEVY: Yeah. Recently, Mark said that his vision for Facebook and the thing he's going to move the focus to is private messaging. So it's going to take advantage of WhatsApp and Instagram and Facebook Messenger, which is the messaging system that Facebook built from scratch, and use that as sort of the center gravity for a lot of activities that people do on Facebook. And it'll happen with end-to-end encryption, meaning that their messages will be private. And he's not going to make the newsfeed go away, but maybe it won't be quite as important to the future of Facebook as it is now when people spend more and more time using these other things in the Facebook family coming from these acquisitions that Facebook made a few years ago. DAVIES: Wow. So in other words, rather than this huge community which has open registration and you can post something which can be viewed by literally a billion people, the focus is on communities, people that you know talking to each other, right? LEVY: That's right. DAVIES: It's a different kind of vision, right? LEVY: It is a different vision, and Mark has talked a lot more about community in the last couple of years. And in a way, this is almost a revival of some of the initial impulses of Facebook before it became almost this giant broadcast system. That happened when Mark became obsessed with Twitter. He's looking ahead to see - and for one thing, the newsfeed and Facebook aren't as popular among young people, and these other applications that Facebook owns are. I spoke to a high school class about a year ago and asked them if anyone used Facebook, and I don't think any hands went up. But I asked if they used Instagram, and everyone raised their hand. They all use Instagram and Snapchat. DAVIES: So what do you think the future is of this company? LEVY: Well, it's not going away. And one thing that happens - in the midst of all the problems that Facebook has, it's making billions of dollars. Every year, it makes more money. The revenues get higher and higher. Their operating expenses are a little higher. They're doing more in research, and they spend more for moderating the content, policing the content and security. So it's almost like a split screen scenario. I described one day in Facebook's history when, because of a privacy-violating app that it used on the Apple system, Apple pulled the plug on it. And people in Facebook weren't allowed, because this app went away, to develop their upcoming apps for Facebook. And even the shuttles on the Facebook campus weren't running. So there was chaos in the workforce, but literally that same moment, Mark and Sheryl and the financial officer of Facebook were announcing record earnings. DAVIES: So despite the fact it's one of the least trusted companies in America, I guess at least by some measures, it's one of the most profitable. LEVY: That's right. So Facebook isn't going away, and we still use it. That's the other thing - that despite the problems with its reputation, Facebook still has the big numbers, and it's still growing. Now, its growth in North America is kind of flat, but around the world, it's still getting bigger. Pretty soon, I think they're going to say, we crossed the 3 billion user mark. And if you consider how many people are on planet Earth, that's an astounding percentage of all of humanity. And really, which is what led me to be drawn to do this in the first place before all that all these problems is this has never happened before - so many people getting on one network, which makes Mark Zuckerberg such a powerful figure in the world. DAVIES: You know, you had enormous access to Mark Zuckerberg and others at Facebook to do this book. And I've always thought that the smartest people in media management were the ones who brought reporters in the door and talked to them at length, I mean, assuming they had a, you know, decent or at least plausible story to tell. And I'm just wondering how you deal with the inevitable criticism that all this access might have made you more willing to accept their explanations and credit their good faith or the possibility that it had that effect on you. It can seductive, I think. LEVY: Well, you know, you have to be aware of that. I think that one thing that was an implicit promise, one that I kept, is that their point of view will be represented in there. And I think I would be criminally negligent if I didn't give you the flavor of that interaction I had with Mark, with Sheryl, with other important executives at Facebook. So it's a pretty colorful group of people. Sometimes, they would leave the middle of my work, and then I'd talk to them again, and they'd be even more candid. But I think that, ultimately, the facts drive the narrative. I think this is a book which is fair to Facebook. But yeah, I guess I think your listeners can tell from what we're talking about it's critical because the facts show that they haven't always behaved in the best possible way. DAVIES: You know, the book is full of information and insight. And I've got to give you credit for that. So let me ask you - and you can take a pass if you want to - but for a couple of opinions. I mean, this is clearly a whole different kind of communication than humanity has ever seen. On the whole, is it a good thing? LEVY: Well, that's a really tough one. I feel there's a lot of positive aspects that come of it. I think that you could argue that Facebook could have done things in a different way. Maybe if it wasn't so hungry for growth, it wouldn't have made it so easy for bad content to bubble up and be so prominent. I think - and that's what I was able to do in the book - is sort of identify those points where, gee, it took a turn in this direction that maybe it didn't have to take that made it a little worse than it would be otherwise while pursuing what might be a laudable goal. On the other hand, the base premise that connecting the world is a good thing is one that is an open question. You know, knowing what we think, is that good? And the jury's out on that. DAVIES: Well, Steven Levy, thank you so much for speaking with us. LEVY: It's my pleasure. Thank you, Dave. GROSS: Steven Levy is editor-at-large for Wired. He spoke with Dave Davies about his new book, \"Facebook: The Inside Story. \" Coming up, rock critic Ken Tucker reviews the new album \"Bryan Ferry: Live at the Royal Albert Hall, 1974. \" This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF THE ADAM PRICE GROUP'S \"STORYVILLE\") TERRY GROSS, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. You'd be hard-pressed to name an American company that's more distrusted and yet more influential today than Facebook. The social media site has been rocked by scandals involving the misuse of its users' personal information and harsh criticism of its role in the 2016 election. And yet it remains huge, with nearly 3 billion users, and profitable, with annual earnings in the billions of dollars. Our guest, Steven Levy, is a veteran technology journalist who's been reporting on Facebook for years and has written a new in-depth history of the company. Facebook's founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg gave Levy leaving nine interviews and permission to talk to many other present and former employees of the company. Levy writes that virtually every problem Facebook has confronted since 2016 is a consequence of its unprecedented mission to connect the world and its reckless haste to do so. Steven Levy has written for Rolling Stone, Harper's Magazine, The New York Times and The New Yorker. He's now editor at large for Wired and the author of seven previous books. He spoke with FRESH AIR's Dave Davies about his new book, \"Facebook: The Inside Story. \" DAVE DAVIES, BYLINE: Well, Steven Levy welcome to FRESH AIR. You have covered technology for a long time. When did you decide you had to make this a book-length exploration of Facebook? STEVEN LEVY: I could pinpoint that pretty precisely. I think it was the end of August of 2015. Mark Zuckerberg posted on his Facebook feed that a billion people had signed on to Facebook that day, and I realized that had never happened before. I'd covered Facebook for a long time before that, but I realized that this is something utterly new, enabled by technology and whatever this company did. And I had to write about it and explain how that happened and what it meant and how they dealt with it. DAVIES: Right. So what kind of commitment did Zuckerberg and others at Facebook make to cooperating with you? LEVY: Well, it took me a few months to get them to this point, but eventually, they agreed to give me access to their employees, including Mark and Sheryl Sandberg, his chief operating officer. And this is also very important. They would give a go-ahead to former employees who wouldn't talk to me unless Facebook said it was OK. There were no strings attached. They didn't get the read the manuscript. The only thing that I said was the interviews I did for the book would be embargoed for the book. And I wouldn't be able to take something if someone said something controversial and just write it in an article for Wired the next day. DAVIES: All right. Everything on the record? LEVY: Well, they're allowed to go and background. They're off the record if they wanted to go there. And some of the interviews I did, particularly with some people who may be - not be at Facebook, were either on background or not for attribution. So some people were a little worried about direct quotes against Facebook being in the book. DAVIES: Right. That makes sense. But Zuckerberg himself - was all that on the record? LEVY: I don't think Mark once said, this is off the record. I think pretty much everything he says - there's - the PR people can't say, Mark, don't say that. At least they don't. And he calls his own shots. Some other people would say, oh, let me say this off the record. And I would try to dissuade them, but a couple of people did that. And one in particular - in the course of our interviews, I kept saying, hey; this has got to be on the record. I really ought to use this. DAVIES: Right. What's he like in person? What was the relationship like? LEVY: We got to a pretty good place where I think he was probably as candid with me as he's been with any journalist, although I don't think he ever forgot that he was talking to a journalist. He has grown over the years as an interviewee. When I first met him and started asking him questions - this is 2006 - he would just stare at me blankly. And it took him a while before I can get any answer out of him. And by the time I started this book, he had obviously been more comfortable with this. He'd been a CEO for many years and a CEO of a public company, so he understood how to give answers to journalists. And he's a very curious person. People describe him as a learning machine. So sometimes he'll ask questions of me, and I think he did this with other journalists, too. DAVIES: Yeah. Can you think of an example of him asking you a question? LEVY: Well, I think one of the most interesting examples - and this sort of casts a light on how Facebook is dealing with its current issues - it was 2018, and it was a run up to their big developer conference they called F8, which has the resonance of fate. And he was explaining to me how he was going to spend half of his keynote speech not apologizing exactly but saying that Facebook knew it made mistakes and we're going to win back your trust. And the other half was going to be about how - well, we have to introduce new things, too, because we can't stand still. So on one hand, it was saying, hey; don't worry; we're fine, and on the other hand saying, here's the new disturbing things we're doing. And he said, well, we're going to introduce a product called Facebook Dating. And I said, really? Don't you think that's a little off-tone considering people are so concerned about the data they give you? This is just basically a few weeks after Cambridge Analytica, which was the biggest scandal in the company's history, involving the release of data. And he said, well, Facebook has always been sort of a secret dating site of some kind, and we don't think it's that big a deal. And then he went on. And then a few minutes later, he just stopped and he said, hey; do you really think that's going to be a big problem for us? DAVIES: What'd you say? LEVY: I said, yeah. DAVIES: (Laughter) And it didn't happen or did happen? It says in the book, but I can't remember. LEVY: Well, he - as one would expect, people said, what's going on here? In this moment, they're introducing a dating site. They introduce it in some smaller countries first. And then a year later, they rolled it out to the United States, and you can now date on Facebook. DAVIES: One of the things you see about Facebook after it got going for a few years was there was a decision to focus on growth - more users, more engagement among the users that we have. What motivated this? I mean. . . LEVY: Well. . . DAVIES: It's sort of natural for every business, I suppose, but. . . LEVY: Sure. DAVIES: This was sort of a different business. LEVY: Right, right. Well, it's - every business wants to grow. But what this thing with Facebook was its relentless focus on growth. And Mark always believed in it, but in 2008, an executive named Chamath Palihapitiya said, I want to take this a step farther. I want to start an internal group called the Growth Circle. And we would just do anything we can to make Facebook grow faster and faster and faster and get it to a billion people really, really quickly. And this was unthinkable at the time, but Chamath was very smart, and he gathered the team of the best people at Facebook. He got a few people from outside. And they were almost a group, a wrecking crew from within Facebook. They sat differently in a different place than everyone else, and they did things that really pushed the boundaries of what was acceptable in Silicon Valley practices to push growth even farther than it had before. DAVIES: What were some of the things that they did? LEVY: Well, one thing was - and this was kind of standard; they did a really great job of it - was to make Facebook higher and higher when you searched in Google for it. And, you know, Facebook profiles were available on Google, so when people search themselves, a Facebook profile would come up with you with your name on it, even though you weren't there. And they would encourage you to take a look and sign up. And another thing was sometimes they would - if you signed up. . . DAVIES: Wait one second. You said that it would show a profile of you even if you weren't a user, weren't registered with Facebook? LEVY: That's right. This is a controversial area of Facebook. It's something - Mark, you know, in 2006, he kept this notebook, and he would speculate on something called dark profiles. And Facebook didn't quite implement it the way he outlined that, which is almost like a Wikipedia page that your friends would start about you even if you weren't on Facebook. That didn't happen. But there was apparently something - I talked to a couple people in early Facebook who said that if someone tagged you in a photo, Facebook would keep a stub that you would then bring to life if you actually came and signed up for it. And Chamath told me that, yeah, one of the things they would do was have this - he referred to it as a dark profile to me - that would show up. And if you signed up, then they would immediately try to populate your newsfeed so you would have a reason to stay on Facebook. DAVIES: Right. And so if I weren't even registered with Facebook but Facebook collected information about me - because there's information on the Internet - someone does a Google search and finds my name, then suddenly there's me connected with Facebook. I see that. And I think, how - man, I should sign up? (Laughter). LEVY: That's what Chamath told me. Oh, yeah. And you know, So. . . DAVIES: Wow. LEVY: . . . Facebook has since said that they never use shadow profiles or dark profiles for reasons like that. And I'm not quite sure what they do now, you know, but they do keep tabs on people for security reasons and some other things. But they say they don't serve advertising to anything they keep. So it's sort of a gray area that I found some contradictions when I was doing the book. DAVIES: They also translated the site into foreign languages and - so that it would grow internationally, too. Right? LEVY: That's right. And you know, they were very aggressive about translations. They didn't hire translators. They let people - users in that country translate it themselves. And they would sometimes refine it. And especially in the big countries, they would do refinements. But in obscure dialects of certain languages, people would just, you know, translate for themselves. And in some smaller countries, Facebook would be in there in the native language when no one at Facebook spoke the language. There was no way to police what went on in that country from Facebook. DAVIES: Right. And in some cases, it became a major medium of information and was abused - right? - by people spreading rumors and hate speech. LEVY: That's right. We're thinking - yeah. Yeah, the prime example is Myanmar, where Facebook went and became very popular. And then it became even more popular when Facebook wound up giving it away. If you had a mobile plan, you wouldn't pay for the Facebook pages you used. So it became almost, like, synonymous with the Internet in Myanmar and some other places. Meanwhile, Facebook had at first none and then very few people who could read what was going on there and couldn't police it. And it was abuse. People would put up false content that spurred people to violence, literally. And it wasn't until 2015 that Facebook even translated its book of rules into Burmese. DAVIES: Steven Levy is editor at large for Wired. His new book is \"Facebook: The Inside Story. \" We'll talk more after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF ALEXANDRE DESPLAT'S \"SPY MEETING\") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with Steven Levy. He is editor at large for Wired. He is a veteran technology writer, and he has a deep dive into Facebook. His new book is called \"Facebook: The Inside Story. \" All right. Let's talk about the 2016 presidential campaign. How much did Facebook know, as that campaign progressed, about Russian efforts to plant fake or provocative stories in the newsfeed and also put bogus information in ads it was buying? LEVY: Well, the Russian misinformation, which we could talk about, is part of a number of things that happened in the 2016 election that Facebook was involved in. The first thing was, you know, proliferation of fake stories. This called fake news weren't necessarily cooked up by the Russians. Only a small percentage of those turned out to be a part of this big Russian disinformation campaign that took place on Facebook. But a lot of it was done for financial gain - a lot of it from this small town in Macedonia, as it turned out, where people would make up fake stories or take a fake story that some obscure blogger posted and circulate it on Facebook. And because of decisions made earlier in Facebook's history - around 2008 and 2009, Mark had a Twitter obsession, and he made Facebook more friendly to things that went viral on the system. These fake news stories - things like, you know, the pope endorsed Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton was involved in a sex ring in a pizzeria - they would go viral on Facebook and be more popular than legitimate news stories. And Facebook had been warned against this sort of phenomenon. And particularly in the later stage of the presidential campaign, people were saying - hey, this has got to stop. But the company made a decision not to stop it because they felt it was part of people's expression to be able to post what they wanted. And Facebook didn't want to be in the position of a referee. Now, that decision, in part, was made by the head of Facebook's Washington office, who was a lifelong Republican and who saw his job, according to people who worked with him, as protecting the Republicans. So that went on till the end of the election, and fake news proliferated on Facebook. DAVIES: And I think it's worth making the point that one of the reasons that people in Macedonia found that they could make money by doing this was that, as part of its drive for growth, Facebook had its algorithm tweaked so that the most addictive material would come up at the top of your newsfeed. So there was an incentive for viral stuff, whether it was true or not. LEVY: Right. Engagement was part of the formula for what would appear on your newsfeed. So if a lot of people shared a post, it would be ranked higher and it would appear in more people's newsfeeds. DAVIES: Right. So what about the ads that were coming through? LEVY: So - the fact is that Facebook offered help to political candidates who wanted to use Facebook better. And one side did a much better job of it than the other, and that was Donald Trump's team. And they took advantage of everything you could on Facebook. They spent much, much more on Facebook than the Clinton campaign did. They accepted the help that Facebook offered both sides, and they just built the heck out of their campaign around Facebook. They would do things like create many, many variations of an ad directed to different kinds of people just to see what clicked, and the Clinton campaign did nothing like that. So the people at Facebook watched this with kind of awe. They're saying, wow, these people are really doing a great job with our campaign there on the Trump campaign. They didn't do anything about it because it wasn't - you know, they wanted to be fair to both sides. And they weren't too bothered by it because they thought - well, Clinton's going to win anyway, so this is just an interesting phenomenon about how someone uses our platform. DAVIES: And the company was making money from every ad, right? LEVY: Oh, sure. Yeah, it was making money. It wasn't the giant part of their revenues, but political ads in general were a significant source of revenue. DAVIES: Right. And of course, it's worth mentioning that that microtargeting of ads based on Facebook's information about its users was its chief selling point, not just on political ads but everything. I mean, you could really a target an ad at a specific kind of customer. LEVY: Right. And it sort of changed what the feel-good pitch of Facebook advertising was. You know, they would always say when you complained about microtargeting was - hey, this helps us serve more relevant ads to people. If you're interested in a certain musical star, we're going to let you know when that person has an album out or is appearing in your area because the advertisers will know where to find you. This is something a little different because Facebook knows so much about you that you could target someone who might be vulnerable to a certain kind of pitch that make you change your mind about something or even deter you from voting. So this isn't part of the feel-good vibe of Facebook advertising that it presents to the world. DAVIES: So Trump wins the election, which was not well-greeted by a lot of the staff at Facebook. LEVY: No, people were in tears when it's what happened, and they had a big meeting the day after the election. DAVIES: Tell us about the meeting. LEVY: Well, people wanted to know for the first time - gee, did we have a hand in this? Were we, in part, responsible for this electoral outcome that we, meaning a lot of the people at Facebook, didn't want to see? And there was some soul-searching among them. And a couple days afterwards, though, Mark Zuckerberg, in speaking at a conference in Half Moon Bay, said he thought it was a crazy idea to think that Facebook influenced the election, which was a statement he had to later walk back. DAVIES: Right. And eventually, real information came out. How did Zuckerberg's attitude change then? LEVY: Well, I think he realized that, one, it sounded blithe. I actually was in the room when he said that, and it really didn't sound that blithe. It was part of a longer, more thoughtful answer, and it didn't really bring the room to a standstill. But we learned more in the weeks following about the abuse of Facebook, including the Russian disinformation campaign that took place on Facebook through ads and other posts. And it didn't seem like such a reach when we learned those things. DAVIES: Yeah. How big were the numbers? How many people were - how many users got this misinformation? LEVY: Well, the Russian disinformation was hundreds of thousands - but again, not a big percentage at all, a very tiny percentage of the stuff that people saw on Facebook. Yet it had some really disturbing aspects to it. The Russians would do things - like, they would be able to find people who were against immigration and tell them - hey, there's this rally happening somewhere in Texas, you know, that's pro-immigration. You ought to go there and protest against it. And then they would inform people who were on the other side about the same rally, which was a nonexistent rally that the Russians were trying to create to bring two sides together that might fight each other. Basically, they were just trying to sow dissent and bad feelings to make people think that the system was really screwed up and, in some cases, deter them from voting. GROSS: We're listening to the interview FRESH AIR's Dave Davies recorded with Steven Levy, editor at large for Wired and author of the new book \"Facebook: The Inside Story. \" After a break, they'll talk about the damage to Facebook from the Cambridge Analytica scandal and about Mark Zuckerberg's plans for the future of the company. Later, Ken Tucker will review a newly released Bryan Ferry concert recorded live at the Royal Albert Hall in 1974. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF WAYNE HORVITZ AND THE ROYAL ROOM COLLECTIVE ENSEMBLE'S \"A WALK IN THE RAIN\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to the interview Dave Davies recorded with Wired editor at large Steven Levy about the social media giant Facebook. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg gave Levy nine interviews and permission to talk to many other present and former employees of the company for Levy's new book, \"Facebook: The Inside Story. \" When we left off, they were talking about the damage to Facebook's reputation from its role in the 2016 presidential election. DAVIES: The criticisms about the fake news and the ad campaigns, some of them from foreign sources, were almost overshadowed by the Cambridge Analytica scandal. This really grew out of a decision Facebook had made to make its product not just a social networking site but a platform so that outside software developers could use Facebook data to create apps, software products on Facebook. This was kind of a fateful decision, wasn't it? LEVY: That's right, and this took place really early in Facebook's history, in 2007. It was a big leap that Facebook all of a sudden said, we want to be kind of the next operating system in the world, and this will be a social operating system. The Internet should be built around people, and we're the place that's going to host that. And you can't say the platform was an unmitigated failure because they really lifted Facebook to the top rung of technology companies. It took place in 2007. And all of a sudden, everyone was talking about Facebook in a way they weren't before. And a couple of months afterwards, I wrote a cover story about Facebook for Newsweek, where I was working then. But the problem with it was, first, in order to do this, you had to hand over personal data to outsiders, to the software developers who were writing applications for this Facebook platform. And the platform itself had its dreams dashed when mobile phones became popular and people used those as operating systems. So your iPhone apps or your Android apps would be the operating system that you used, and the developers turned their attention to writing applications for phones. The platform still persisted, but it became more of an exchange of information between the developers and Facebook, with Facebook giving a lot of the information to the developers. In 2010 - and this was where I really say Cambridge Analytica started - Facebook said, we'll give more information than ever to the developers. So when you signed up as a user for one of these apps, the third party would not only get your information that you posted on Facebook but the information that your friends posted on Facebook. You would be giving away your friends' likes, which are very revealing, and their relationship status, sometimes their political status - all falling out of the hands of Facebook into the hands of these developers who could use them for their apps and were told, you can't sell these or give them to anyone else. But Facebook didn't really have strong enforcement to make sure that happened. DAVIES: And so Cambridge Analytica ends up getting the data of tens of millions of Facebook users. LEVY: That's right. There was an academic researcher who followed Facebook's rules in getting the information but then broke Facebook's rules in licensing the information to this company called Cambridge Analytica, which was run by this British military consultancy company, which made a partnership with a big funder of the far-right in the United States. DAVIES: Right, the Mercers. LEVY: Right. DAVIES: Right. You said that it's - to this day, it isn't clear whether the company's election efforts used Facebook profiles. Is that right? I thought that was accepted fact. LEVY: Well, they had the data handed over, but the Trump campaign, which worked with Cambridge Analytica, said that they really didn't use it much as a data source. But they helped with television ads, and they liked some of the people who worked there. It is fuzzy because on the other hand, the head of Cambridge Analytica, the company behind it, was boasting about the information they used. So I think it is a big mystery the degree to which that data was used in the election, but we do know the Trump campaign did use a lot of data and merged it with other databases. I think the shock to people was that this information got handed over to this company that no one ever heard of that worked for Trump. And that became Facebook's biggest scandal, ironically, even though some of this information had been published in 2015 by The Guardian, the same place that returned with the scoop in 2018. But this is pre-Trump, and it wasn't a big deal then. DAVIES: So this information about the 2016 campaign and then a subsequent hack of, like, 50 million user accounts sent the company's public image into a real nosedive. And Mark Zuckerberg went before Congress, and they promised serious steps to change things. What are they doing? LEVY: Well, they've done a number of things. For one thing, they give you more information. When you see something that looks like it's fake on Facebook, they have fact-checkers go over some of these claims. And when they turn out they're not factual, they don't take them off, but they might downrank it in the newsfeed. Fewer people might say it. They give you a chance to mouse over and see a little more information about the publication where this is printed. Maybe it's, like, a phony publication that doesn't exist besides Facebook. DAVIES: Now, those aren't ads. Those are items posted to the newsfeed, right? So. . . LEVY: Right. Yeah. And also, they - during elections, they monitor things. They look for the signals of disinformation campaigns and try to shut them down. So they're doing certain things that would have stopped some of the tricks in the 2016 election. And in the couple elections since - the midterm in 2018, elections in France and other places - they've done a better job, but it's an open question of how well they're going to do in 2020 when the people using Facebook and trying to abuse it again are going to come up with a new set of tricks. DAVIES: Steven Levy's book is \"Facebook: The Inside Story. \" We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF COOTIE WILLIAMS' \"RINKY DINK\") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with Steven Levy. He is a veteran technology writer and the editor at large for Wired. He has a new book about the history of Facebook. It's called \"Facebook: The Inside Story. \" So Facebook has this challenge where people can post things on a newsfeed that may be misleading or false, right? And then. . . LEVY: Correct. DAVIES: People can run paid ads. What's the company's policy in dealing with potentially inaccurate or misleading information in the organic posts that people put on the site and the ads that people buy? LEVY: Well, Facebook will allow people to post misleading content, but if it starts circulating a lot and people complain about it, it will have fact-checkers to verify whether that's true or not. And if it's not true, they may downrank it, show it to fewer people. Then they might provide extra information, saying, you know, this is a publication that you may not want to trust, or, here's some other articles about the same thing that are more factual. Ads are a different thing. Mark has gone out on a limb and said, we are not going to fact-check political ads. So if someone makes a false claim, even consciously, about an opponent in a political ad, Facebook is going to be hands-off. DAVIES: Right, and that's been controversial. LEVY: It's really controversial, but Mark has stuck to his guns on this. He went before Congress this past October, where people just pummeled him about this. But he feels that he doesn't want Facebook to be in the position of saying, you know, well, this politician's ad is fake. The thing is a lie, and this isn't. DAVIES: Does the company have any disclosure requirements for funding sources of the ads? LEVY: It's the same funding disclosures that people have for ads in print or on TV. You have to say, this is my ad, and I approve this content. DAVIES: And for Facebook to be looking at not the ads but the posts by users, which might be factually suspect - I mean, given, you know, the scale of the posts every day, that's a huge challenge. How many people are doing this? LEVY: Well, it is a huge challenge. So the problem they had in 2016 is these Russians were posting it on their fake accounts, so that's not allowed. So if the account is inauthentic, as Facebook calls it, it could be taken down. But if an authentic person somewhere posts something that's fake, Facebook will not take it down. And we've heard that one thing the outside actors - Russians - might do is get people in the United States to post the fake content that they create. And Facebook then, by its own rules, would not be taking it down. DAVIES: Right. So a fake account can be taken down, right? LEVY: Yeah. Yeah. So this - and this became clear early in the 2016 election, when there was a page called DCLeaks, which was meant to spread the emails that were hacked from the Democratic National Committee. And at first, Facebook said, we're going to leave this up because it looks like a legitimate account. And then they figured out that it was not an authentic account, and they took it down because of that. DAVIES: Right, right. LEVY: Not because it was circulating this stuff about the Democrats that was hacked. DAVIES: You had one astonishing number in here. If I remember this accurately, in one three-month period, Facebook stopped 2 billion phony accounts from being registered. LEVY: Yeah. There's an unbelievable number of fake accounts that people try to stop. Now, in a way, that's worse than it sounds because when people try to create these fake accounts, they just bombard the website with one after another, and the vast majority are easily identified by Facebook algorithms. But there are 5% of accounts on Facebook that are fake, and this is hundreds of millions - right? - because you have almost 3 billion people now on Facebook. So even though 5% doesn't sound like a lot, that's an unbelievably big number. DAVIES: You know, in the middle of all this, Mark Zuckerberg talked about a new vision for Facebook. What is it? LEVY: Yeah. Recently, Mark said that his vision for Facebook and the thing he's going to move the focus to is private messaging. So it's going to take advantage of WhatsApp and Instagram and Facebook Messenger, which is the messaging system that Facebook built from scratch, and use that as sort of the center gravity for a lot of activities that people do on Facebook. And it'll happen with end-to-end encryption, meaning that their messages will be private. And he's not going to make the newsfeed go away, but maybe it won't be quite as important to the future of Facebook as it is now when people spend more and more time using these other things in the Facebook family coming from these acquisitions that Facebook made a few years ago. DAVIES: Wow. So in other words, rather than this huge community which has open registration and you can post something which can be viewed by literally a billion people, the focus is on communities, people that you know talking to each other, right? LEVY: That's right. DAVIES: It's a different kind of vision, right? LEVY: It is a different vision, and Mark has talked a lot more about community in the last couple of years. And in a way, this is almost a revival of some of the initial impulses of Facebook before it became almost this giant broadcast system. That happened when Mark became obsessed with Twitter. He's looking ahead to see - and for one thing, the newsfeed and Facebook aren't as popular among young people, and these other applications that Facebook owns are. I spoke to a high school class about a year ago and asked them if anyone used Facebook, and I don't think any hands went up. But I asked if they used Instagram, and everyone raised their hand. They all use Instagram and Snapchat. DAVIES: So what do you think the future is of this company? LEVY: Well, it's not going away. And one thing that happens - in the midst of all the problems that Facebook has, it's making billions of dollars. Every year, it makes more money. The revenues get higher and higher. Their operating expenses are a little higher. They're doing more in research, and they spend more for moderating the content, policing the content and security. So it's almost like a split screen scenario. I described one day in Facebook's history when, because of a privacy-violating app that it used on the Apple system, Apple pulled the plug on it. And people in Facebook weren't allowed, because this app went away, to develop their upcoming apps for Facebook. And even the shuttles on the Facebook campus weren't running. So there was chaos in the workforce, but literally that same moment, Mark and Sheryl and the financial officer of Facebook were announcing record earnings. DAVIES: So despite the fact it's one of the least trusted companies in America, I guess at least by some measures, it's one of the most profitable. LEVY: That's right. So Facebook isn't going away, and we still use it. That's the other thing - that despite the problems with its reputation, Facebook still has the big numbers, and it's still growing. Now, its growth in North America is kind of flat, but around the world, it's still getting bigger. Pretty soon, I think they're going to say, we crossed the 3 billion user mark. And if you consider how many people are on planet Earth, that's an astounding percentage of all of humanity. And really, which is what led me to be drawn to do this in the first place before all that all these problems is this has never happened before - so many people getting on one network, which makes Mark Zuckerberg such a powerful figure in the world. DAVIES: You know, you had enormous access to Mark Zuckerberg and others at Facebook to do this book. And I've always thought that the smartest people in media management were the ones who brought reporters in the door and talked to them at length, I mean, assuming they had a, you know, decent or at least plausible story to tell. And I'm just wondering how you deal with the inevitable criticism that all this access might have made you more willing to accept their explanations and credit their good faith or the possibility that it had that effect on you. It can seductive, I think. LEVY: Well, you know, you have to be aware of that. I think that one thing that was an implicit promise, one that I kept, is that their point of view will be represented in there. And I think I would be criminally negligent if I didn't give you the flavor of that interaction I had with Mark, with Sheryl, with other important executives at Facebook. So it's a pretty colorful group of people. Sometimes, they would leave the middle of my work, and then I'd talk to them again, and they'd be even more candid. But I think that, ultimately, the facts drive the narrative. I think this is a book which is fair to Facebook. But yeah, I guess I think your listeners can tell from what we're talking about it's critical because the facts show that they haven't always behaved in the best possible way. DAVIES: You know, the book is full of information and insight. And I've got to give you credit for that. So let me ask you - and you can take a pass if you want to - but for a couple of opinions. I mean, this is clearly a whole different kind of communication than humanity has ever seen. On the whole, is it a good thing? LEVY: Well, that's a really tough one. I feel there's a lot of positive aspects that come of it. I think that you could argue that Facebook could have done things in a different way. Maybe if it wasn't so hungry for growth, it wouldn't have made it so easy for bad content to bubble up and be so prominent. I think - and that's what I was able to do in the book - is sort of identify those points where, gee, it took a turn in this direction that maybe it didn't have to take that made it a little worse than it would be otherwise while pursuing what might be a laudable goal. On the other hand, the base premise that connecting the world is a good thing is one that is an open question. You know, knowing what we think, is that good? And the jury's out on that.

An activist investor has been buying shares in the social media company and now wants to make big changes. NPR's Shannon Bond has the story. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Jack Dorsey isn't your typical CEO. He's a dedicated yogi and is known for his extreme personal habits like intermittent fasting. Here's what he told Wired magazine in January. (SOUNDBITE OF INTERVIEW)JACK DORSEY: I try to meditate two hours every single day. And I eat seven meals every week - just dinner. BOND: Not long ago, he said he was moving to Africa for three to six months this year. But the most unusual thing about Dorsey - he's CEO of two companies, Twitter and also a payments company, Square. Now one large investor has had enough and says Twitter needs a full-time CEO. Elliott Management is a big hedge fund without much patience for leaders who don't deliver. It's bought a sizable stake in Twitter and nominated four directors to the board, according to people familiar with the matter. Twitter and Elliott both declined to comment. Elliott is following a playbook it's used to force change at other big companies like eBay and AT&T. MICHAEL PACHTER: Elliott is pretty notorious for being activist. And they're pretty accomplished. So their history has been to pick battles that they think they can win. BOND: Michael Pachter is an analyst at Wedbush Securities. He says that even if Jack Dorsey ends up keeping his job, Elliott can still make its point and make some money. PACHTER: The downside for them if they fail is they get the dialogue going. They get investors talking about how the target company could be significantly more profitable, and the stock tends to go up. BOND: Elliott has zeroed in on Twitter because it thinks the company could be worth a lot more. Twitter is influential and popular with celebrities and public figures, including President Trump. But it just hasn't grown the way other social media companies have. It has hundreds of millions of users compared with Facebook's billions. And it brings in only a fraction of Facebook's ad revenue. That's frustrated investors. SCOTT GALLOWAY: I think product development has been anemic. I think their business model is flawed. BOND: Scott Galloway is a marketing professor at NYU and a Twitter investor until recently. After Dorsey said he was moving to Africa, Galloway wrote a letter to Twitter's board urging them to replace him. GALLOWAY: But more than anything, the lowest-lying fruit here is to find a full-time CEO. BOND: Galloway says he never got a response, and he sold all his shares. So far, Elliott and Twitter have had constructive talks, according to the people I spoke with. But this fight adds pressure on Twitter. It's struggling to deal with misinformation and how to handle abuse of users and trolls. 2020 is a big year. News events like the presidential election, the Summer Olympics in Tokyo and the coronavirus outbreak should all attract people and advertisers to the platform. The question is, is Jack Dorsey the right CEO for Twitter today? Shannon Bond, NPR News, San Francisco. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  The CEO of Twitter could be looking for a new job soon.

Back then, it used social media to spread disinformation and hoaxes. Yoel Roth is in charge of fighting these efforts on Twitter. He told me the company hasn't traced specific tweets about the 2020 campaign back to Russia, but he says Russia's tactics have also evolved. YOEL ROTH: One of the main things that we saw in 2016 was the use of inauthentic personas. So these would be accounts that were pretending to be Americans to try and influence certain parts of the conversation. We've seen some indication that that remains part of the Russian playbook. And so they're trying to set up accounts that appear to be Americans or other people participating in political conversations to try and seem as though they are actually a member of the community that they're trying to impact. SHAPIRO: And beyond candidates, these might be about gun rights or Black Lives Matter or LGBT rights or anything else that was controversial. At least that's what was documented in the Mueller report. ROTH: Right. Those were some of the tactics that we saw most clearly in 2016, but I'd note that some of the tactics have evolved a little bit since then. For instance, in 2018, we saw activity that we believe to have been connected with the Russian Internet Research Agency that was specifically targeting journalists in an attempt to convince them that there had been large-scale activity on the platform that didn't actually happen. SHAPIRO: Oh, so you're saying that in 2018, Russia didn't just interfere in the election. They tried to make it look like there was more interference in the election than there was just to undermine confidence. ROTH: That's right. So on election night 2018, a website went up that was called IRAUSA. So it explicitly indicated that it was the Internet Research Agency in the United States. SHAPIRO: And that's the so-called troll farm operated out of St. Petersburg, Russia. ROTH: Yes. And this website's claim was a very simple one. They said, we have been setting up thousands of accounts, and we were interfering in the 2018 midterms the way that we interfered in 2016. SHAPIRO: So that's what was new in 2018. I know it's early days still, but what's your best sense of what's new in 2020? ROTH: I think in 2020, we're facing a particularly divisive political moment here in the United States, and attempts to capitalize on those divisions amongst Americans seem to be where malicious actors are headed. This is a similar pattern to what we saw in 2016 and 2018, but one of the things that we've seen from not only Russia but a wide range of malicious actors is an attempt to capitalize on some of the major domestic voices that are participating in these conversations and then double down on some of those activities. SHAPIRO: And you're saying they don't have to create their own original messaging. They can just amplify some of the most extreme messaging that's coming out from real-life, authentic Americans. ROTH: That's right. SHAPIRO: I want to ask you about a slightly different topic. The distortion of reality in the election is not just coming from foreign actors. American political campaigns are also trying to use social media to their advantage. What are you seeing from 2020 candidates that raises flags for you? ROTH: We've seen everything ranging from accounts that are pretending to be compromised - so they'll sort of pretend that they were hacked and then share content that they might otherwise not have, but it was actually a real person - to sort of large-scale attempts to mobilize volunteers to share content on the service. SHAPIRO: I understand you've suspended dozens of pro-Bloomberg accounts for platform manipulation. These are real people that the campaign paid to promote the candidate. How do you know that you're not overreaching and suspending accounts of Americans who are expressing their real beliefs? ROTH: The first thing I'd emphasize is that we don't know whether these accounts were, in fact, operated by the campaign or not. Our focus whenever we're enforcing our policies is to look at the behavior that the accounts are engaged in, not who we think is behind them or what their motivations were because, in most instances, we don't know. And so we enforced our policies against a number of accounts that were engaged in spam. These were accounts that were all tweeting the same thing at the same time. And so behaviorally, we were able to clearly identify that those accounts were in violation of our rules. SHAPIRO: Are you saying that if I text all of my supporters and say, please tweet, Ari will make my life better, and a thousand people tweet, Ari will make my life better, that would be spamming, even though those are real people who might actually believe I'll make their life better? ROTH: No. The behavior that you described - a lot of people getting together and organizing and mobilizing around a topic and sharing information about it - isn't by itself spam. But if each one of your supporters were to set up 10 different accounts just for the purpose of tweeting about how much they like you, that's something that would cross the line on some of our policies around coordinated manipulation. And so the action that you saw around some of these campaign accounts was really that a single individual was operating multiple accounts with the intent of disseminating these messages. Individual people who are participating in a conversation in an organic way are, of course, free to use the service to advocate on behalf of whomever or whatever they choose. You just can't do it in a way that crosses the lines of coordinated manipulation and spam. SHAPIRO: Yoel Roth is Twitter's head of site integrity. Thank you for the conversation. ROTH: Thank you. SHAPIRO: And tomorrow, we'll hear about Twitter's new policy to flag misleading content.

People in remote parts of Alaska are already being counted. And everybody else gets their chance soon. The counting will be different this year. For the first time, the federal government is trying to use the Internet to count most of the people living in the United States. The numbers, of course, determine how political representation and federal funding are distributed. So this isn't just a bunch of numbers, it's an expression of power. Some worry about cybersecurity as we move over to the Internet, though. And NPR's Hansi Lo Wang has been covering the 2020 census. Hey there, Hansi. HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: How will it be different this year for the average person who might have received a letter in the mail in the past? WANG: Well, a letter is still coming to most households on March 12 or around that date. And it's important to point out paper is not going away, but not every household is getting a paper form at first. This is a big change. Most are going to just get a letter with instructions to go to a website, my2020census. gov. It's worth mentioning there's also going to be toll-free numbers to call in census responses. But again, the bureau hopes that more people do it online. They say it'll take just about 10 minutes. It would save them money, be a quicker way to gather information and hopefully be more convenient, the government says. You don't even have to leave your house to mail out a form this time around. And ultimately, this is to determine which households respond by the end of April. That's when the bureau has to figure out how many door knockers it has to start sending out to complete the count because federal law requires every home to participate in the census. INSKEEP: So they're going to try to count online, which works great except when it doesn't. And people have all these concerns about security. What could possibly go wrong? WANG: A lot could go wrong here. This is a big operation, a massive scale we're talking about. We're trying to count, theoretically, more than 300 million people if everyone in the country used this form. INSKEEP: Wow. WANG: And important to point out - there is no census app. It's just a form on a website. And the bureau has had - has months, really, to gather and try to process this information. But in this age of disinformation, cybersecurity risks, there are some concerns that there could be some sort of website outage that could hurt public perception if too many people try to use the website at the same time, and also could hurt the trust in the data that the census is ultimately supposed to produce. These have - they have major implications on redrawing voting districts, redistricting congressional seats and Electoral College votes. INSKEEP: What is the Census Bureau doing to ensure trust? WANG: The bureau says it's working with the Department of Homeland Security and federal intelligence agencies, trying to stop any potential foreign actors who want to disrupt the census online. I spoke with the bureau's chief information officer, Kevin Smith. He told me one lightweight precaution is not allowing IP addresses from outside the U. S. to access the census website. Let's listen to what he said. KEVIN SMITH: People who are trying to break into systems can make themselves look like they're coming from many places in the country, even next door. So to block the websites at the front door is like putting a screen door in front of your iron door with five locks. That screen door does a little bit, but not much. The iron door you have and the second iron door and the five deadbolts you have in that door, that's your security protections. WANG: So those other security protections, the bureau has been mum about those. They don't want to give too many - don't want to give an advantage to any potential census disruptors, they say. And it's hard for the public to determine exactly what they're doing. And some lawmakers I've talked to are worried that the threats are always evolving. And they're worried that there has been some last-minute changes to IT systems. And there's little time left to fully test them at this point. INSKEEP: What's plan B if something does go wrong? WANG: Well, the bureau has lots of plans, and one of them that I found out is they've printed millions of extra paper forms and confirmed that the bureau's printed more than 150 million paper forms, enough for each household in the country. And one thing to keep in mind for the public - if you prefer to do the census offline, not online, and you don't get a form in the mail, you cannot request a form. But if you wait until early April, every household that hasn't responded by then, there will be a form - paper form - mailed to your home. And you should get that in by the end of April if you do not want a census worker knocking on your door. INSKEEP: Oh, which could still happen in many cases, a live person. WANG: Yes. They start going out in mid-May. INSKEEP: Hansi, thanks for your in-depth coverage of the census all the way along here, really appreciate it. WANG: You're very welcome, Steve.

And it's important to point out paper is not going away, but not every household is getting a paper form at first. This is a big change. Most are going to just get a letter with instructions to go to a website, my2020census. gov. It's worth mentioning there's also going to be toll-free numbers to call in census responses. But again, the bureau hopes that more people do it online. They say it'll take just about 10 minutes. It would save them money, be a quicker way to gather information and hopefully be more convenient, the government says. You don't even have to leave your house to mail out a form this time around. And ultimately, this is to determine which households respond by the end of April. That's when the bureau has to figure out how many door knockers it has to start sending out to complete the count because federal law requires every home to participate in the census. INSKEEP: So they're going to try to count online, which works great except when it doesn't. And people have all these concerns about security. What could possibly go wrong? WANG: A lot could go wrong here. This is a big operation, a massive scale we're talking about. We're trying to count, theoretically, more than 300 million people if everyone in the country used this form. INSKEEP: Wow. WANG: And important to point out - there is no census app. It's just a form on a website. And the bureau has had - has months, really, to gather and try to process this information. But in this age of disinformation, cybersecurity risks, there are some concerns that there could be some sort of website outage that could hurt public perception if too many people try to use the website at the same time, and also could hurt the trust in the data that the census is ultimately supposed to produce. These have - they have major implications on redrawing voting districts, redistricting congressional seats and Electoral College votes. INSKEEP: What is the Census Bureau doing to ensure trust? WANG: The bureau says it's working with the Department of Homeland Security and federal intelligence agencies, trying to stop any potential foreign actors who want to disrupt the census online. I spoke with the bureau's chief information officer, Kevin Smith. He told me one lightweight precaution is not allowing IP addresses from outside the U. S. to access the census website. Let's listen to what he said. KEVIN SMITH: People who are trying to break into systems can make themselves look like they're coming from many places in the country, even next door. So to block the websites at the front door is like putting a screen door in front of your iron door with five locks. That screen door does a little bit, but not much. The iron door you have and the second iron door and the five deadbolts you have in that door, that's your security protections. WANG: So those other security protections, the bureau has been mum about those. They don't want to give too many - don't want to give an advantage to any potential census disruptors, they say. And it's hard for the public to determine exactly what they're doing. And some lawmakers I've talked to are worried that the threats are always evolving. And they're worried that there has been some last-minute changes to IT systems. And there's little time left to fully test them at this point. INSKEEP: What's plan B if something does go wrong? WANG: Well, the bureau has lots of plans, and one of them that I found out is they've printed millions of extra paper forms and confirmed that the bureau's printed more than 150 million paper forms, enough for each household in the country. And one thing to keep in mind for the public - if you prefer to do the census offline, not online, and you don't get a form in the mail, you cannot request a form. But if you wait until early April, every household that hasn't responded by then, there will be a form - paper form - mailed to your home. And you should get that in by the end of April if you do not want a census worker knocking on your door. INSKEEP: Oh, which could still happen in many cases, a live person. WANG: Yes. They start going out in mid-May. INSKEEP: Hansi, thanks for your in-depth coverage of the census all the way along here, really appreciate it. WANG: You're very welcome, Steve.

It's part of an attempt to stop the spread of misleading and possibly harmful content. So how exactly does Twitter define what qualifies? I put that question to Twitter's Yoel Roth. YOEL ROTH: We're looking for evidence that the video or image or audio have been significantly altered in a way that changes their meaning, and we don't really care about the technology that was used to accomplish that. Now, in the event that we find evidence that the media was significantly modified, the next question we ask ourselves is, is it being shared on Twitter in a way that is deceptive or misleading? SHAPIRO: So let's imagine there's a video out there of me endorsing a presidential candidate, which I haven't done, and this is clearly manipulated or synthesized. What happens when somebody goes to retweet or reply to that tweet? ROTH: So there's two possible scenarios here. The first one is, in situations where the media has been modified and we believe that it is actively harmful - so it could put somebody in harm's way or it could interfere with somebody's ability to exercise their fundamental rights, like participating in an election or speaking freely - in those situations, we would require the content to be removed from Twitter. We think that's generally unlikely to happen. In the majority of circumstances, like the one that you suggested, we would apply a label to that tweet. The label would indicate clearly that the video, wherever it appears, has been manipulated. And then if you tap on that label, it'll take you into an experience that provides additional expert context about that tweet. SHAPIRO: I'm curious who draws the line about what gets flagged as manipulated media. I mean, the audio that NPR listeners are hearing right now is manipulated. You and I have pretaped this interview. A very talented producer has taken out our stumbles and umms (ph) and uhs (ph) and dropped the Q&As that didn't seem as important. Would a tweet with this interview get flagged as manipulated audio, which, by definition, it is? ROTH: We definitely don't want to end up in a circumstance where ordinary and expected practices of editing get flagged as manipulated media. We're instead looking for manipulation that changes the meaning of content and that people are likely to be confused or deceived by. SHAPIRO: You know, in January, NPR did a poll with \"PBS NewsHour\" and Marist. And it found that 82% of Americans think they will read misleading information on social media this election, and three-quarters said they don't trust tech companies to prevent their platforms from being misused for election interference. What do you say to those people, a majority of people in the United States? ROTH: We've made really significant investments since 2018 in protecting the integrity of the Twitter platform and building product experiences that help people find credible information. But I think the challenge there is there's a lot of people engaged in a lot of different conversations who may be real, authentic people sharing things that aren't true. And the challenge for us as a technology company is how to create a product that helps you find accurate, credible information while also ensuring that people do have the ability to express themselves freely on issues that they care about. SHAPIRO: Sounds like there is an implicit admission there that this is not a problem that will ever go away - just maybe a problem you can give people tools to help fight back against a little bit. ROTH: The ability for people to dispute and talk about issues of the day in public is a really important function for a platform like Twitter to play. I think the responsibility of a technology company is to create a product that is free from attempts of people to put their thumb on the scale and shift conversations in a way that gives false or misleading information, unearned reach while ensuring that people still have the ability to participate authentically in a conversation about the issues that they care about.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ALEXI HOROWITZ-GHAZI, HOST: John and Jen Palmer love to buy each other little presents - figurines, desk toys. Tchotchkes are their love language. But a while ago, this got them into trouble. JACOB GOLDSTEIN, HOST: What is the inciting tchotchke? What is the tchotchke that gets this whole story going? JOHN PALMER: It was basically looking for something for Jen for her desk at work. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: John goes online, finds this website called kleargear. com - Kleargear with a K, of course. It's just a website that sells, like, little toys for grown-ups. And John decides to order not one but two little tchotchkes for Jen. JEN PALMER: I think one of them was a - one of the ones where it's the sand art, and then I think another one was one little perpetual motion toys. . . GOLDSTEIN: Like the little silver ball things or something? JOHN PALMER: Yeah, exactly. JEN PALMER: Exactly. JOHN PALMER: They were meant to be stocking stuffers. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: The total cost is around 20 bucks. John pays with PayPal. Then a week goes by, two weeks; the sand art thing and the little click, click silver ball thing never show up. GOLDSTEIN: So Jen gets involved. She tries to call the company, but she can't get anybody on the phone. She's getting the runaround on email. Eventually, John and Jen do get their money back from PayPal. And then Jen decides to leave an online review at a site called ripoffreport just to warn other people about Kleargear. JEN PALMER: My husband ordered items from kleargear. com for Christmas presents. After several weeks went by with no delivery, he attempted to contact. . . HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Jen pastes in this sort of absurd email exchange she's had with the company into the review. Then she hits publish. It goes up online, and that's the end of it. JEN PALMER: Our response was, OK, we've put our experience out there for the world to see. We're good. We're done. We went on with our lives. We. . . JOHN PALMER: We bought a house. JEN PALMER: . . . Bought a house, had a kid. And it was 3 1/2 years later. John was working from home, and I was upstairs taking care of our toddler. And all of a sudden, I hear John screaming bloody murder. And he's swearing up a storm, yelling, Jen, get down here. What in the - what's going on? GOLDSTEIN: Jen gets downstairs, and John is looking at an email on his computer. JOHN PALMER: It basically says it's from Kleargear's legal department, and it is saying that because you posted this and it's in violation of our non-disparagement clause, we are going to fine you $3,500 because you disparaged us online. GOLDSTEIN: So it's a letter from a lawyer saying you owe Kleargear how much? JOHN PALMER: Thirty-five-hundred dollars. GOLDSTEIN: For what? JOHN PALMER: For posting the truth about them online. GOLDSTEIN: And what is your response? JEN PALMER: Panic. (SOUNDBITE OF TRUE STORIES' \"OUR HOLIDAY ROMANCE\")GOLDSTEIN: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Jacob Goldstein. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: And I'm Alexi Horowitz-Ghazi. Every day as we make our way across the Internet, we are swimming through a sea of legalese - terms, conditions, warnings. Most of us just click accept and move on without so much as a glance. GOLDSTEIN: Today on the show - what happened when Jen and John got caught in a fine-print nightmare and fought it all the way to Washington. So John has this email, remember, from Kleargear. It's saying that he and Jen had violated the terms of service, the fine print that we all agree to all the time whenever we do anything online. Specifically, it's saying there was a clause in the terms that said, you cannot leave a nasty review about us online. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: But remember. It's been three years since they posted that review. They don't remember seeing any non-disparagement clause when they bought the tchotchkes, so they use this Internet archive site to look at the old terms and conditions from three years earlier. And that clause was not there when they tried to buy those tchotchkes. GOLDSTEIN: But there is still that email from Kleargear threatening to fine John $3,500, which, of course, is a scary warning, so John and Jen started calling lawyers. And all the lawyers said basically the same thing. JEN PALMER: Oh, sure. You know, give us a $5,000 retainer, and we'll see what we can do. And I'm like, dude, if I don't have $3,500 to give them, I don't have five grand to give you. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: They couldn't pay any of these lawyers, so they just went on with their lives. A while later, they went to buy a car. JEN PALMER: And we were sitting in the dealership, and the finance manager comes over to us and kind of loudly says, OK, well, we're trying to find you financing. But who is Kleargear? And why do you owe them $3,500? JOHN PALMER: And both of us just facepalm (ph). JEN PALMER: Yeah. GOLDSTEIN: Because of this whole thing with Kleargear, John now had this, like, black mark on his credit report. JEN PALMER: We fast-forward to October of that next year. Our hot water heater died on us. We used our savings to get that repaired. Three days later, our furnace goes out. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: It's going to cost them thousands of dollars to get a new furnace and they just don't have it on hand. JEN PALMER: We tried to get emergency financing. Every company I tried to go through turned us down. So finally, I am at my wit's end. It's October in Utah. My house has no furnace. I have a 3-year-old and thinking to myself, oh, my God, we're going to end up in - with a frozen house. And CPS is going to come and take my child away because I can't keep the heat on because of this stupid mark on John's credit, and there's nothing we can do. So finally, I mean, I am almost crying. I'm at work, and I have no idea what to do. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Their case was too small for the FBI, too strange for the local police. But, luckily, there's a certain kind of person who is perfect for helping people just like Jen. JEN PALMER: My boss comes up to me and says, well, why don't you give KUTV's Matt Gephardt a call? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: There's one reporter in Utah who arms you with the information you need to protect yourself. Get help. Get answers. \"Get Gephardt\" - five nights a week on 2 News at 10. JEN PALMER: So I called up \"Get Gephardt,\" and I left them a really long message and explained to them the entire story. And the more I'm speaking, the more I'm just realizing how utterly ridiculous all of this sounds. I mean, you cannot make this up. GOLDSTEIN: You're leaving it just like a voicemail? JEN PALMER: Yeah, I think I had caught them like off-hours or something. And I think it was the next day, I get a call from Matt Gephardt. GOLDSTEIN: Of \"Get Gephardt\"? JEN PALMER: Yes. He calls me back and says, I believe you and I want to help. And all of a sudden, I saw the light at the end of the tunnel. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"GET GEPHARDT\")UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: If you get horrible customer service from a company, you will likely tell people about that. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Yeah. Get this, though. A company is ordering a Layton couple to pay thousands all because they don't like the review they posted online. JEN PALMER: It aired, like, on a Tuesday. Three days later, the story has gone viral. And by viral, I mean England and France and Australia and China and Canada. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: And in the middle of all this, John and Jen get a call from a lawyer named Scott Michelman at a nonprofit called Public Citizen. He said he wanted to take their case, and agreed to do it pro bono. The lawyer got John's credit report fixed, and he sued Kleargear in federal court. JEN PALMER: We show up to court, and he's got his fancy lawyer formulas that they do to calculate things like real damages versus pain and suffering and all of that. GOLDSTEIN: Basically, how much is he going to ask for? JEN PALMER: Three hundred and seven thousand dollars. So we got to court, and, of course, Kleargear doesn't show up. And. . . HOROWITZ-GHAZI: So it's just you guys and the judge hanging out? JEN PALMER: Pretty much. It's - I mean, the judge still sat and heard our story. We still gave our testimony, laid out, you know, all the damages. And as the judge is hearing all of this, he decides. He's like, you know what? I've heard enough. I don't need to take this under advisement, I'm going to give you everything you're asking for and the lawyer's fees on top of it. And I remember sitting at the table and kind of, like, whispering, did he just do what I think he just did? The lawyer's just going, shut up. Shut up. Shut up. And, you know, and he went ahead and gave us the judgment right then and there. But even with this huge number that neither of us could have ever dreamed of, we knew we were never going to see a dime of it. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: You couldn't even get them on the phone. How are you going to get $307,000 plus lawyer's fees out of them? JEN PALMER: Exactly. But this was a significant enough number to at least deter anybody else from attempting the same thing on somebody else. So this was huge, and we knew this was making an impact. GOLDSTEIN: And you would think that would be the end of the story. JEN PALMER: You would really think. GOLDSTEIN: And yet there is one more truly surprising twist in the Palmer story. We will hear about that and have some deep thoughts about terms of service in a minute. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GOLDSTEIN: So I think one reason that Jen and John's story went viral is that what happened to them could have happened to anybody, to any of us. You know, all day long - it feels like every day we are just clicking accept, accept, accept, agree, agree, agree to terms of service, and we essentially never know what's in there. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: It feels like we've gotten to a place where, in order to actually be an informed consumer, you basically have to be a contract lawyer with an absurd amount of free time on your hands. GOLDSTEIN: And as we started looking into this and researching it, one of the really interesting things that we found out was this universe we live in now, it actually comes out of this really reasonable sounding sort of well-meaning place, right? There is this basic idea that is, it's a good thing when companies give consumers - give customers, give us - information. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: We talked about this with Omri Ben-Shahar, he's a law professor at the University of Chicago, and he co-wrote a book about this stuff called \"More Than You Wanted To Know. \"OMRI BEN-SHAHAR: If the problem is people made bad decisions because they did not have good information, then the solution seems obvious. Give them information. It doesn't offend any ideology. Liberals like it because it protects consumers. It protects the little person against the power of the companies. And conservatives, too, believe that if you give people information, then you don't need to do any more intense intervention in the market. The campaign for full and complete disclosure is supported by everyone. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: So if a product is dangerous, the government makes the manufacturer add a warning label. GOLDSTEIN: If a loan is complicated, make the bank explain the details to the borrower. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: If a tech company is going to sell its customers' data, make the company tell the customers. GOLDSTEIN: This is all very reasonable. But, as a result, for decades, terms of service and warnings and loan documents have been getting longer and longer in order to provide more and more information to us, the consumers. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Does anybody actually read these things? BEN-SHAHAR: Nobody. There is enormous amount of evidence showing that nobody reads. A colleague at NYU actually looked at how many people click on the terms to read them, open the pages. She found that something like one in every thousand people look at it. Even the simplest of disclosures are not read. If they are read, they are not fully understood. If they are read and understood, they are not used. And if they are read, understood and used, they are not used well. GOLDSTEIN: So what does that mean, I mean, that we have this huge sea of terms coming at us every day that pretty much nobody is reading? Like, what do we do? BEN-SHAHAR: Well, we have to look for solutions other than disclosure, I guess, right? If you think that they are particularly grave problems, you may want to think about solutions that are more than placebo. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Omri says, look, terms of service just don't work. GOLDSTEIN: And so he says, if there's something that's really bad, you shouldn't try to solve it with disclosure. You shouldn't tell companies this thing is OK as long as you tell customers that you're doing it. He says, in extreme cases, maybe you should just ban things outright, prohibit them. Which brings us back to Jen and John's story. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GOLDSTEIN: A couple of years after their big day in court, Jen got a call from the lawyer who had sued Kleargear on their behalf. JEN PALMER: He says to me, Senator Thune has drafted a bill to make non-disparagement clauses illegal. They want you to come and testify in front of the Senate Commerce Committee as to why these are so important. And my jaw dropped. GOLDSTEIN: So Jen went to Washington. JEN PALMER: I remember I was in the taxi. We were - and it was getting up to Capitol Hill. And we turned a corner, and I see the Capitol Building right in front of us. There was one thought that went through my mind, and it was (singing) I'm just a bill. Yes, I'm only a bill. And I made it here to Capitol Hill. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"SCHOOLHOUSE ROCK\")JACK SHELDON: (As Bill, singing) Well, it's a long, long journey. JEN PALMER: I'm like, oh, my God. I'm in \"Schoolhouse Rock\" (laughter). (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"SCHOOLHOUSE ROCK\")JACK SHELDON: (As Bill, singing) It's a long, long wait while I'm sitting in committee. But I know I'll be a law some day at least I hope and pray that I will, but today, I am still just a bill. GOLDSTEIN: A few minutes later, Jen Palmer is sitting in committee, about to testify for the Senate. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Next up is Ms. Palmer. Share your story. JEN PALMER: Chairman Thune, Ranking Member Nelson and members of the committee, thank you for inviting me to testify today. My name is Jen Palmer, and my family's ordeal with a bullying company that tried to fine us for a negative review demonstrates why non-disparagement clauses should be prohibited. GOLDSTEIN: Not long after that, Congress passed the Consumer Review Fairness Act. The bill made it illegal for companies to bar their customers from posting honest negative reviews. JEN PALMER: It was one of the last bills President Obama signed, turning this into law. And I just looked at John. I'm like, oh, my God, we did it. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: What do you feel, like, each of you kind of are taking away from this whole experience? Or what have you learned by going through it? JOHN PALMER: Biggest thing that I've walked away with is, don't mess with Jen. (LAUGHTER)JEN PALMER: Thanks, dear. (SOUNDBITE OF TRUE STORIES' \"5TH AVENUE SHOPPING SPREE\")GOLDSTEIN: As far as we can tell, Kleargear with a K has disappeared from the face of the earth. No website. We tried to call them for comment, but the two phone numbers we found didn't work. (SOUNDBITE OF TRUE STORIES' \"5TH AVENUE SHOPPING SPREE\")GOLDSTEIN: Have you fought some weird Internet nightmare all the way to the United States Senate? Let us know. We're at planetmoney@npr. org.

Eventually, John and Jen do get their money back from PayPal. And then Jen decides to leave an online review at a site called ripoffreport just to warn other people about Kleargear. JEN PALMER: My husband ordered items from kleargear. com for Christmas presents. After several weeks went by with no delivery, he attempted to contact. . . HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Jen pastes in this sort of absurd email exchange she's had with the company into the review. Then she hits publish. It goes up online, and that's the end of it. JEN PALMER: Our response was, OK, we've put our experience out there for the world to see. We're good. We're done. We went on with our lives. We. . . JOHN PALMER: We bought a house. JEN PALMER: . . . Bought a house, had a kid. And it was 3 1/2 years later. John was working from home, and I was upstairs taking care of our toddler. And all of a sudden, I hear John screaming bloody murder. And he's swearing up a storm, yelling, Jen, get down here. What in the - what's going on? GOLDSTEIN: Jen gets downstairs, and John is looking at an email on his computer. JOHN PALMER: It basically says it's from Kleargear's legal department, and it is saying that because you posted this and it's in violation of our non-disparagement clause, we are going to fine you $3,500 because you disparaged us online. GOLDSTEIN: So it's a letter from a lawyer saying you owe Kleargear how much? JOHN PALMER: Thirty-five-hundred dollars. GOLDSTEIN: For what? JOHN PALMER: For posting the truth about them online. GOLDSTEIN: And what is your response? JEN PALMER: Panic. (SOUNDBITE OF TRUE STORIES' \"OUR HOLIDAY ROMANCE\") GOLDSTEIN: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Jacob Goldstein. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: And I'm Alexi Horowitz-Ghazi. Every day as we make our way across the Internet, we are swimming through a sea of legalese - terms, conditions, warnings. Most of us just click accept and move on without so much as a glance. GOLDSTEIN: Today on the show - what happened when Jen and John got caught in a fine-print nightmare and fought it all the way to Washington. So John has this email, remember, from Kleargear. It's saying that he and Jen had violated the terms of service, the fine print that we all agree to all the time whenever we do anything online. Specifically, it's saying there was a clause in the terms that said, you cannot leave a nasty review about us online. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: But remember. It's been three years since they posted that review. They don't remember seeing any non-disparagement clause when they bought the tchotchkes, so they use this Internet archive site to look at the old terms and conditions from three years earlier. And that clause was not there when they tried to buy those tchotchkes. GOLDSTEIN: But there is still that email from Kleargear threatening to fine John $3,500, which, of course, is a scary warning, so John and Jen started calling lawyers. And all the lawyers said basically the same thing. JEN PALMER: Oh, sure. You know, give us a $5,000 retainer, and we'll see what we can do. And I'm like, dude, if I don't have $3,500 to give them, I don't have five grand to give you. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: They couldn't pay any of these lawyers, so they just went on with their lives. A while later, they went to buy a car. JEN PALMER: And we were sitting in the dealership, and the finance manager comes over to us and kind of loudly says, OK, well, we're trying to find you financing. But who is Kleargear? And why do you owe them $3,500? JOHN PALMER: And both of us just facepalm (ph). JEN PALMER: Yeah. GOLDSTEIN: Because of this whole thing with Kleargear, John now had this, like, black mark on his credit report. JEN PALMER: We fast-forward to October of that next year. Our hot water heater died on us. We used our savings to get that repaired. Three days later, our furnace goes out. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: It's going to cost them thousands of dollars to get a new furnace and they just don't have it on hand. JEN PALMER: We tried to get emergency financing. Every company I tried to go through turned us down. So finally, I am at my wit's end. It's October in Utah. My house has no furnace. I have a 3-year-old and thinking to myself, oh, my God, we're going to end up in - with a frozen house. And CPS is going to come and take my child away because I can't keep the heat on because of this stupid mark on John's credit, and there's nothing we can do. So finally, I mean, I am almost crying. I'm at work, and I have no idea what to do. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Their case was too small for the FBI, too strange for the local police. But, luckily, there's a certain kind of person who is perfect for helping people just like Jen. JEN PALMER: My boss comes up to me and says, well, why don't you give KUTV's Matt Gephardt a call? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: There's one reporter in Utah who arms you with the information you need to protect yourself. Get help. Get answers. \"Get Gephardt\" - five nights a week on 2 News at 10. JEN PALMER: So I called up \"Get Gephardt,\" and I left them a really long message and explained to them the entire story. And the more I'm speaking, the more I'm just realizing how utterly ridiculous all of this sounds. I mean, you cannot make this up. GOLDSTEIN: You're leaving it just like a voicemail? JEN PALMER: Yeah, I think I had caught them like off-hours or something. And I think it was the next day, I get a call from Matt Gephardt. GOLDSTEIN: Of \"Get Gephardt\"? JEN PALMER: Yes. He calls me back and says, I believe you and I want to help. And all of a sudden, I saw the light at the end of the tunnel. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"GET GEPHARDT\") UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: If you get horrible customer service from a company, you will likely tell people about that. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Yeah. Get this, though. A company is ordering a Layton couple to pay thousands all because they don't like the review they posted online. JEN PALMER: It aired, like, on a Tuesday. Three days later, the story has gone viral. And by viral, I mean England and France and Australia and China and Canada. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: And in the middle of all this, John and Jen get a call from a lawyer named Scott Michelman at a nonprofit called Public Citizen. He said he wanted to take their case, and agreed to do it pro bono. The lawyer got John's credit report fixed, and he sued Kleargear in federal court. JEN PALMER: We show up to court, and he's got his fancy lawyer formulas that they do to calculate things like real damages versus pain and suffering and all of that. GOLDSTEIN: Basically, how much is he going to ask for? JEN PALMER: Three hundred and seven thousand dollars. So we got to court, and, of course, Kleargear doesn't show up. And. . . HOROWITZ-GHAZI: So it's just you guys and the judge hanging out? JEN PALMER: Pretty much. It's - I mean, the judge still sat and heard our story. We still gave our testimony, laid out, you know, all the damages. And as the judge is hearing all of this, he decides. He's like, you know what? I've heard enough. I don't need to take this under advisement, I'm going to give you everything you're asking for and the lawyer's fees on top of it. And I remember sitting at the table and kind of, like, whispering, did he just do what I think he just did? The lawyer's just going, shut up. Shut up. Shut up. And, you know, and he went ahead and gave us the judgment right then and there. But even with this huge number that neither of us could have ever dreamed of, we knew we were never going to see a dime of it. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: You couldn't even get them on the phone. How are you going to get $307,000 plus lawyer's fees out of them? JEN PALMER: Exactly. But this was a significant enough number to at least deter anybody else from attempting the same thing on somebody else. So this was huge, and we knew this was making an impact. GOLDSTEIN: And you would think that would be the end of the story. JEN PALMER: You would really think. GOLDSTEIN: And yet there is one more truly surprising twist in the Palmer story. We will hear about that and have some deep thoughts about terms of service in a minute. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GOLDSTEIN: So I think one reason that Jen and John's story went viral is that what happened to them could have happened to anybody, to any of us. You know, all day long - it feels like every day we are just clicking accept, accept, accept, agree, agree, agree to terms of service, and we essentially never know what's in there. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: It feels like we've gotten to a place where, in order to actually be an informed consumer, you basically have to be a contract lawyer with an absurd amount of free time on your hands. GOLDSTEIN: And as we started looking into this and researching it, one of the really interesting things that we found out was this universe we live in now, it actually comes out of this really reasonable sounding sort of well-meaning place, right? There is this basic idea that is, it's a good thing when companies give consumers - give customers, give us - information. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: We talked about this with Omri Ben-Shahar, he's a law professor at the University of Chicago, and he co-wrote a book about this stuff called \"More Than You Wanted To Know. \" OMRI BEN-SHAHAR: If the problem is people made bad decisions because they did not have good information, then the solution seems obvious. Give them information. It doesn't offend any ideology. Liberals like it because it protects consumers. It protects the little person against the power of the companies. And conservatives, too, believe that if you give people information, then you don't need to do any more intense intervention in the market. The campaign for full and complete disclosure is supported by everyone. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: So if a product is dangerous, the government makes the manufacturer add a warning label. GOLDSTEIN: If a loan is complicated, make the bank explain the details to the borrower. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: If a tech company is going to sell its customers' data, make the company tell the customers. GOLDSTEIN: This is all very reasonable. But, as a result, for decades, terms of service and warnings and loan documents have been getting longer and longer in order to provide more and more information to us, the consumers. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Does anybody actually read these things? BEN-SHAHAR: Nobody. There is enormous amount of evidence showing that nobody reads. A colleague at NYU actually looked at how many people click on the terms to read them, open the pages. She found that something like one in every thousand people look at it. Even the simplest of disclosures are not read. If they are read, they are not fully understood. If they are read and understood, they are not used. And if they are read, understood and used, they are not used well. GOLDSTEIN: So what does that mean, I mean, that we have this huge sea of terms coming at us every day that pretty much nobody is reading? Like, what do we do? BEN-SHAHAR: Well, we have to look for solutions other than disclosure, I guess, right? If you think that they are particularly grave problems, you may want to think about solutions that are more than placebo. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Omri says, look, terms of service just don't work. GOLDSTEIN: And so he says, if there's something that's really bad, you shouldn't try to solve it with disclosure. You shouldn't tell companies this thing is OK as long as you tell customers that you're doing it. He says, in extreme cases, maybe you should just ban things outright, prohibit them. Which brings us back to Jen and John's story. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GOLDSTEIN: A couple of years after their big day in court, Jen got a call from the lawyer who had sued Kleargear on their behalf. JEN PALMER: He says to me, Senator Thune has drafted a bill to make non-disparagement clauses illegal. They want you to come and testify in front of the Senate Commerce Committee as to why these are so important. And my jaw dropped. GOLDSTEIN: So Jen went to Washington. JEN PALMER: I remember I was in the taxi. We were - and it was getting up to Capitol Hill. And we turned a corner, and I see the Capitol Building right in front of us. There was one thought that went through my mind, and it was (singing) I'm just a bill. Yes, I'm only a bill. And I made it here to Capitol Hill. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"SCHOOLHOUSE ROCK\") JACK SHELDON: (As Bill, singing) Well, it's a long, long journey. JEN PALMER: I'm like, oh, my God. I'm in \"Schoolhouse Rock\" (laughter). (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"SCHOOLHOUSE ROCK\") JACK SHELDON: (As Bill, singing) It's a long, long wait while I'm sitting in committee. But I know I'll be a law some day at least I hope and pray that I will, but today, I am still just a bill. GOLDSTEIN: A few minutes later, Jen Palmer is sitting in committee, about to testify for the Senate. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Next up is Ms. Palmer. Share your story. JEN PALMER: Chairman Thune, Ranking Member Nelson and members of the committee, thank you for inviting me to testify today. My name is Jen Palmer, and my family's ordeal with a bullying company that tried to fine us for a negative review demonstrates why non-disparagement clauses should be prohibited. GOLDSTEIN: Not long after that, Congress passed the Consumer Review Fairness Act. The bill made it illegal for companies to bar their customers from posting honest negative reviews. JEN PALMER: It was one of the last bills President Obama signed, turning this into law. And I just looked at John. I'm like, oh, my God, we did it. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: What do you feel, like, each of you kind of are taking away from this whole experience? Or what have you learned by going through it? JOHN PALMER: Biggest thing that I've walked away with is, don't mess with Jen. (LAUGHTER) JEN PALMER: Thanks, dear. (SOUNDBITE OF TRUE STORIES' \"5TH AVENUE SHOPPING SPREE\") GOLDSTEIN: As far as we can tell, Kleargear with a K has disappeared from the face of the earth. No website. We tried to call them for comment, but the two phone numbers we found didn't work. (SOUNDBITE OF TRUE STORIES' \"5TH AVENUE SHOPPING SPREE\") GOLDSTEIN: Have you fought some weird Internet nightmare all the way to the United States Senate? Let us know. We're at planetmoney@npr. org. We're on your various social media platforms @planetmoney. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: We also have a newsletter. GOLDSTEIN: That kind of blew up the Internet this week.

Foreign actors are using social media to interfere in this year's presidential race. Last month, Senator Bernie Sanders acknowledged he'd been briefed by the intelligence community about Russia's efforts to boost his campaign - efforts that are unwelcome. NPR's Tim Mak looks deeper into what Russia's campaign to boost Sanders looks like. TIM MAK, BYLINE: Russia's campaign includes an ever-changing number of targets based on Russian strategic goals, including, reportedly, the reelection of President Donald Trump. But its support for Sanders in particular has become an attack line. Take this example from former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg during a recent presidential debate. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MIKE BLOOMBERG: Vladimir Putin thinks that Donald Trump is - should be president of the United States, and that's why Russia is helping you get elected - so you'll lose to him. MAK: Sanders had this response. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BERNIE SANDERS: Hey, Mr. Putin. If I'm president of the United States, trust me. You're not going to interfere in any more American elections. MAK: The Russian government's apparent campaign to aid Sanders would mostly be hidden behind the anonymity of the Internet. But there are ways to look to Russia's public messaging to see how they're supporting the senator. Clint Watts has been monitoring Russian interference as part of his work with the Foreign Policy Research Institute. He says Russian state-backed media was more neutral on Sanders in the fall but has begun to mirror pro-Sanders talking points first seen four years ago. CLINT WATTS: Well, what's really come on strong just in the last 30 to 45 days are very similar narratives that we saw in 2016 about Sanders. MAK: On Russian news agencies RT and Sputnik, Watts noticed that Sanders receives substantially better coverage than his opponents. Sanders received a higher percentage of positive coverage - 2 1/2 times more - than any other Democratic candidate, surpassing even President Donald Trump by that metric. And Sanders receives far less negative coverage than his rivals. Jessica Brandt, who works for the Alliance for Securing Democracy, has also examined Russian narratives about Sanders. JESSICA BRANDT: Those tend to be that the corporate media and that the Democratic establishment, the DNC and elites are rigging the system against him and, you know, endeavoring to deny him a win. MAK: Another way to gauge Russia's support for Sanders is by examining social media accounts linked to their efforts. In October, Facebook announced it had suspended Instagram accounts with apparent links to the Internet Research Agency, a Kremlin-linked troll farm based in Saint Petersburg. Facebook shared its data with Graphika, a social media analytics firm, which said that four of the suspended accounts had a focus on praising Senator Sanders. He was the only candidate on the Democratic side that was a focus of these fake accounts. In some cases, these accounts plagiarized memes and content directly from the Sanders campaign. One post read, quote, \"Millions of people in America want to get an education, and Bernie Sanders is their last hope. \" The Sanders campaign says Russia is trying to do their best to sow discord in the race, not elect Bernie Sanders. And campaign co-chair Congressman Ro Khanna points out that the senator has been a fervent advocate of solutions to foreign interference. RO KHANNA: Senator Sanders has been at the forefront of election security. What we need is paper ballots. What we need is an investment in our election infrastructure. What we need is smart regulation against disinformation campaigns. MAK: But Sanders' disavowal of Russia's efforts haven't stopped them. Mieke Eoyang is the vice president of the National Security Program at Third Way, a center-left think tank that opposes a Sanders candidacy. MIEKE EOYANG: One of the things that I think Russia looks at when they see Bernie is that he's someone who's talking about a rigged system. He's talking about, the elites aren't with you.

AMANDA ARONCZYK, HOST: So as you might've heard, we are in the middle of a coronavirus outbreak, and this isn't the first one. There have been three bad ones in the past 18 years. SARAH GONZALEZ, HOST: There was SARS. Remember that one? That was a coronavirus. It hit in 2003, and it probably came from bats. And then there was MERS, which started in 2012, and that came from camels. ARONCZYK: And now there is COVID-19. That's the official name of this current coronavirus disease. And that one probably also came from bats. GONZALEZ: And once you know that these coronaviruses aren't something that came out of nowhere, that they've been around for years, the obvious question is, where's the vaccine? ARONCZYK: That would be great. A vaccine would be great right about now. GONZALEZ: I think people would buy it. ARONCZYK: Yes, we would. (SOUNDBITE OF ANDREW PETER KINGSLOW AND ROGER ROGER'S \"DEATH OVER DINNER\")GONZALEZ: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Sarah Gonzalez. ARONCZYK: And I'm Amanda Aronczyk. GONZALEZ: The free market is supposed to solve these kinds of problems, provide the thing that everyone wants. But it hasn't. ARONCZYK: Part of the reason is all of these coronaviruses are a little different. This one's new. So no matter what, it is going to take time. But another reason is economics. GONZALEZ: The market for emergency vaccines for pandemics, diseases that spread around the world - it is not like the regular market for, you know, bikes and raspberries. It is a lot weirder than that. ARONCZYK: Today on the show, we find out just how weird. This story involves the anthrax scare. GONZALEZ: And an undisclosed number of secret government chickens. RICK BRIGHT: Hello. This is Rick Bright. GONZALEZ: Rick Bright, you are the hardest person to get ahold of. BRIGHT: Unfortunately, it's been a busy month or two, yes. And it seems to be getting busier. GONZALEZ: Rick Bright is the director at BARDA, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority in Washington, D. C. They help prepare and respond to everything from nuclear and chemical threats to biological threats, like viruses. So he's super busy. BRIGHT: Very, very long days right now. ARONCZYK: And we were not the only ones who wanted a little bit of Rick Bright's time. GONZALEZ: I was bumped this morning. I was told it was Vice President Mike Pence. BRIGHT: You probably have some good information there. GONZALEZ: (Laughter) OK. ARONCZYK: Rick Bright is in his early 50s, and he's worked on viruses pretty much his whole career. He was at the CDC, then the biotech industry. Now he's back working for the government. But his interest in viruses started on a farm. BRIGHT: Very few people know that, you know, I was born in a small town in Kansas on a farm nearby. GONZALEZ: Did you have chickens as a farm boy? BRIGHT: We had chickens. We had a lot of animals (laughter) at the farm. Those chickens were just for eggs to eat. GONZALEZ: Eggs are a big part of Rick's life still. BRIGHT: I do have an Egg Genie in my office, as well, as a Christmas gift someone gave me. And it's like a little incubator. I can make omelets. I can heat up seven different eggs and poach them at one time. ARONCZYK: And Rick Bright got into vaccines because of something that a lot of people think was also born in Kansas - the 1918, 1919 pandemic flu. This was one of the deadliest outbreaks in human history, killed somewhere between 50 million to 100 million people around the world. GONZALEZ: And that pandemic came from birds. Basically all flus do, even the swine flu - starts in birds. But we didn't know any of that back then. BRIGHT: And my motivating force through my entire career is a small-town boy from Kansas could have the power or the ability or the knowledge to stop the next pandemic. So everything I've done in my career has put me right here right now. GONZALEZ: Rick Bright came to this pandemic preparedness agency, BARDA, 10 years ago when it was still fairly new. The event that led to this agency started one week after the 9/11 attacks. Anxieties were really high. Everything seemed like a potential terrorist attack. And there was this kind of crazy thing happening. A number of anonymous letters were being mailed out. BRIGHT: To news reporters, to Congresspeople, to others. ARONCZYK: And inside these letters, white powder. GONZALEZ: Anthrax. BRIGHT: Anthrax spores. GONZALEZ: And everyone is like, what do we do? How do we detect this? How do we treat this? Like, we don't know what to do right now. BRIGHT: During those days, it took too long to know what we were seeing and what was happening, and we were scrambling. ARONCZYK: If you inhale this powder, it can kill you. Five people died. GONZALEZ: It was clear that the United States wasn't prepared for bio threats - bio meaning, like, biology, nature. BRIGHT: Anthrax comes from nature. GONZALEZ: Where does it come from? BRIGHT: It's actually in the dirt, and it can also be isolated from nature and dirt. And terrorists can then grow and cultivate the organism itself to use as a weapon. GONZALEZ: And there wasn't really an anthrax antidote readily available. Things in the dirt that can kill you wasn't really a huge focus at the time. ARONCZYK: And right around this time, another threat popped up. Chickens picked up a strain of flu from wild ducks. GONZALEZ: Why these wild ducks and chickens were hanging out - still a charming mystery. But this flu, called avian flu, was spreading from chickens to people. And everyone thought, what if it starts spreading from people to people, you know, like the seasonal flu does? ARONCZYK: Everyone thought this might be the next big pandemic. And there were nowhere near enough vaccine doses for something like this - not in 2001, not in the United States, not really anywhere. BRIGHT: So it was an alarm bell that went off around the world. ARONCZYK: This is a big moment. The U. S. government realizes they can't get the drugs and vaccines they need when there's an emergency. There wasn't really a market for them. GONZALEZ: Now, for the regular vaccine market, like the vaccines you get as a kid - the one for the chicken pox or measles, mumps and rubella, HPV - that vaccine market is fine. Pharmaceutical companies can predict that market size, predict how many doses of the measles vaccine they'll need to make and build a facility to make that amount. They know that there's a long-term market as long as babies are being born. ARONCZYK: But the market for emergency vaccines and drugs to treat things like pandemic flu or anthrax - that's the problem because it's really, really expensive to develop a new vaccine really, really quickly. And also, the market is uncertain. BRIGHT: With something like an emerging infectious disease, such as Zika or MERS or SARS or this novel coronavirus, it's really difficult for them to predict a market size. There's really no long-term promise of a revenue stream for those vaccines. GONZALEZ: Here's why. Outbreaks go away, sometimes on their own. Sometimes we contain them - right? - like SARS, the other coronavirus that came from bats. It came, then went, but it will come back at some point. Everyone says this. Viruses like this come back. It's just no one knows when. And this is a problem for this industry because markets hate uncertainty. ARONCZYK: So during the avian flu/anthrax attacks, the U. S. government is like, if pharmaceutical companies aren't going to make this on their own, we'll give them a little incentive. We will become the market. We will become the buyer for this drug and this vaccine. GONZALEZ: So would it have been like the U. S. government told pharmaceutical companies, hey, if you make an anthrax antidote, we will buy it, so just make it, and we promise to buy it? BRIGHT: Absolutely. That's the commitment - that if you make these for us, then we will buy them from you. GONZALEZ: Congress sets aside billions of dollars for this and, a few years later, opens up a whole new part of the U. S. government - the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, BARDA, where Rick right now works. BARDA tells companies, we will share the cost of developing these new products. We will share the cost of paying the researcher of building the facilities. Bio threats are national security threats. Let's just accelerate this process. ARONCZYK: Which is hard to do because vaccines require time. Life needs to grow. Consider one of the most common vaccines that we make every single year, the flu vaccine. GONZALEZ: It is a shockingly fragile, delicate, expensive process involving chicken eggs - thousands of them. And hens only lay one egg a day, so you need thousands of chickens working around-the-clock for their one egg. And then those eggs report for work straight from a farm to a pharmaceutical company. Every morning, they line up. Like, millions of rows of chicken eggs? BRIGHT: It is millions of rows of chicken eggs. ARONCZYK: The eggs are gently placed on a conveyor belt. Needles drop down, poke a hole in the eggs. And then a live flu virus is injected into the holes. BRIGHT: That hole will be sealed, and then those eggs will go into an oven - an incubator - for a number of days - say, 10 days. GONZALEZ: The virus needs to grow in there, all cozy in an incubator. They'll come back out after those 10 days, back on the conveyor belt. BRIGHT: And then there's a series of knives that will swing through and chop off the top portion of those eggs - just kind of clip off the upper, you know, one-tenth percent of that egg. ARONCZYK: Then new needles drop down - not ones that poke holes - suction needles. BRIGHT: They will vacuum out all of that allantoic fluid, or that egg white. . . GONZALEZ: The egg white, OK. BRIGHT: . . . That's in there - the egg white. GONZALEZ: That is where the virus has grown - in the egg white. BRIGHT: So it sucks out that - the egg white. ARONCZYK: Dumps it into a giant spinning container that separates any particles that might've gotten in by accident. BRIGHT: Maybe it's some eggshells, maybe it's some of the yolk that got in it. GONZALEZ: Eggshells always kind of get in a little bit, so sure. BRIGHT: You always get a little eggshell, yes. GONZALEZ: Now you have just the egg white that has the virus in it, which you now have to kill because it's live virus. BRIGHT: You kill the virus. GONZALEZ: By chopping it up. BRIGHT: You have to make sure it's dead. GONZALEZ: By chopping it up more. And then you kind of wash it with detergent. BRIGHT: Just regular detergent. ARONCZYK: By the end, there's almost zero actual egg white left, so you mix it with other fluid. BRIGHT: That becomes your vaccine. Many, many, many, many months of work in that process. GONZALEZ: And in an emergency, you need a lot of eggs all at once. BRIGHT: Very few people realize that in a pandemic influenza outbreak that you need 900,000 chicken eggs every single day for a six- to nine-month period of time to make the vaccine supply needed just for the United States. ARONCZYK: And just in case there aren't enough incubators, Rick does have that Egg Genie. BRIGHT: I'd tell myself and six of my closest colleagues, anytime, if there's an outbreak, I can probably whip you up a vaccine and save some people. ARONCZYK: So that's seven eggs' worth of vaccine. GONZALEZ: OK, so very slow process. And back in 2001, in the middle of the avian flu scare, there was only one company in the U. S. making a flu vaccine. The rest were in other countries. So the government was like, we got to start making more on U. S. soil so we don't have to wait for some other company to ship it to us in an emergency. BRIGHT: We can't rely on other countries to share vaccines with us. GONZALEZ: Meaning, like, we should have our own chickens in the United States laying eggs so that we can make an avian flu vaccine. BRIGHT: One of the first thing we did was secure a large number of chicken flocks, yes. And we call it our egg supply program. GONZALEZ: So these are like hardworking government chickens. BRIGHT: They are hardworking government chickens. But we have. . . GONZALEZ: Where are they? BRIGHT: A lot of farms that we have in undisclosed places. As you can imagine, it's our national security. GONZALEZ: It's a secret where they are? BRIGHT: It's a national security secret. GONZALEZ: I feel very attached to them all of a sudden. BRIGHT: (Laughter) We have to protect those flocks. ARONCZYK: We aren't even allowed to know how many chickens there are. It's super, super top-secret. GONZALEZ: The government is paying for a year-round supply of eggs just in case there's a pandemic flu outbreak, so that a pharmaceutical company can, you know, turn on the machines right away. No one has to go looking for new chickens. And if the eggs are not used to become a vaccine, which happens often, the government still pays for them. They become animal feed. Because what the government is doing here is creating a market for the down times when we're not in the middle of a crisis just to keep the chickens around, keep up the capability. ARONCZYK: To be clear, there are several newer, faster ways to make a vaccine. So a lot of the coronavirus vaccines that people are working on right now - they're using less chicken-oriented techniques. GONZALEZ: And maybe fire the chickens - the government chickens? BRIGHT: Yeah, I'd like to retire. . . GONZALEZ: Retire. BRIGHT: . . . The government - retire the government chickens and let them get some rest and go about doing other important things. GONZALEZ: The government now buys all kinds of vaccines and drugs. BRIGHT: Smallpox, anthrax - we're the buyer for the - we're planning to be the buyer for the Zika virus vaccine. ARONCZYK: And they don't just buy it one time in bulk. Drugs and vaccines have a shelf life. They expire. So in order to make sure pharmaceutical companies keep making them, the government has to keep buying them. BRIGHT: 'Cause if I don't have a company that can make them when I need them, then I basically don't have the drug or vaccine. GONZALEZ: Rick says all of these drugs that they buy wouldn't be available if the government didn't promise to buy them. BRIGHT: The market would not exist without government intervention. I'm confident of that. That's where we were in 2001 - no one making those drugs and vaccines. GONZALEZ: And getting into the vaccine business is risky for everyone involved - the government, pharmaceutical companies, universities - because there's this stage in this whole process that is time-sensitive. At a certain point, you have to test a new vaccine candidate on a human being to see if it works. And if the outbreak goes away, which, again, happens all the time, it kind of messes up that phase. Companies actually have to wait for an outbreak to come back to finish their product. BRIGHT: We were working very expeditiously on a SARS virus vaccine back in 2003 and 2004. Fortunately, the SARS virus disappeared. Unfortunately, when the virus disappeared, the funding tended to disappear with it, and the companies that were making a SARS virus vaccine lost interest and shifted back to their more profitable vaccines. ARONCZYK: A lot of people say the interest and the funding are only really there once an outbreak has started. So a real SARS vaccine would be helpful right now because it's a coronavirus, too. BRIGHT: There's knowledge. There's experience from a SARS vaccine candidate. But I don't have any coronavirus vaccine candidate sitting in the freezer. ARONCZYK: So what BARDA really does is share risk - you know, make it safe for companies to commit to developing the vaccines for outbreaks that will probably go away. Say, OK, we know it'll go away, but make it anyway for us. We will buy X many doses. And when it comes back, we'll be ready to go. There is a national stockpile of emergency vaccines and antidotes. BRIGHT: There are several locations across the United States. And, yeah, they're not obviously marked. They're not branded as a strategic national stockpile in any way that you would see them, so it's not a single target if someone wanted to take out our strategic national stockpile. GONZALEZ: Whoa. Picture warehouses filled with an anthrax antidote and other things like that. BRIGHT: A stockpile contains vaccines and drugs for anthrax and many other threats that we face - smallpox, antiviral drugs. GONZALEZ: Just little, tiny vials in dry ice - something like that? BRIGHT: Some of the products are frozen and stored, yeah, in minus 80, or super cold. Some of those things are face masks or ventilators. ARONCZYK: And they're hoping to add a COVID-19 vaccine to the stockpile as soon as possible. Right now, there are at least 20 companies, universities, labs all rushing to create a vaccine for this new coronavirus. And the U. S. government - BARDA - has partnered with two companies. BRIGHT: What they're doing in the laboratory right now is basically all hands on deck. They're working long hours, long days. And they have shifted people away from other vaccine or drug products or projects onto the coronavirus. GONZALEZ: Some companies say they already have a vaccine candidate, but they still need to test it, like, on human beings who volunteer in clinical trials. Rick Bright says it'll be about a year before there's a coronavirus vaccine on the market. BRIGHT: And that is assuming everything goes well the first time through, and we've never seen that happen. GONZALEZ: Oh. (SOUNDBITE OF DANIEL ALEXIS PEMBERTON'S \"DOCTOR DIZZY\")GONZALEZ: Do you have a chicken that works for the government or that lays special eggs we should know about? ARONCZYK: Then you can email us at planetmoney@npr. org. GONZALEZ: We are also on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. We're @planetmoney. ARONCZYK: We also have a newsletter. You can go to npr. org/planetmoneynewsletter to sign up. GONZALEZ: Today's show was produced by Alexi Horowitz-Ghazi, Darian Woods and Liza Yeager. Alex Goldmark is our supervising producer. And Bryant Urstadt edits the show. ARONCZYK: James Sneed fact-checked the show. GONZALEZ: We need to thank so many people who helped us with this episode, like Kawsar Talaat - she helped us understand influenza - Josefa Steinhauer, Mike Osterholm - he helped us understand the market failures for emergency vaccines. And we have to thank the pharmaceutical companies Sanofi and GSK for helping us understand the vaccine race. I'm Sarah Gonzalez. ARONCZYK: And I'm Amanda Aronczyk. This is NPR. Thanks for listening. (SOUNDBITE OF LEIGH MCALLISTER GRACIE'S \"EDGE OF FEAR\")GONZALEZ: Yeah, it seems like the real problem here is birds, bats, pigs, camels, (laughter) dirt. BRIGHT: And people. GONZALEZ: And people. BRIGHT: (Laughter) And people. And so we all live together as one ecosystem. And, you know, we all have to work and live in harmony. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER, BYLINE: This is PLANET MONEY from NPR. AMANDA ARONCZYK, HOST:  So as you might've heard, we are in the middle of a coronavirus outbreak, and this isn't the first one. There have been three bad ones in the past 18 years. SARAH GONZALEZ, HOST:  There was SARS. Remember that one? That was a coronavirus. It hit in 2003, and it probably came from bats. And then there was MERS, which started in 2012, and that came from camels. ARONCZYK: And now there is COVID-19. That's the official name of this current coronavirus disease. And that one probably also came from bats. GONZALEZ: And once you know that these coronaviruses aren't something that came out of nowhere, that they've been around for years, the obvious question is, where's the vaccine? ARONCZYK: That would be great. A vaccine would be great right about now. GONZALEZ: I think people would buy it. ARONCZYK: Yes, we would. (SOUNDBITE OF ANDREW PETER KINGSLOW AND ROGER ROGER'S \"DEATH OVER DINNER\") GONZALEZ: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Sarah Gonzalez. ARONCZYK: And I'm Amanda Aronczyk. GONZALEZ: The free market is supposed to solve these kinds of problems, provide the thing that everyone wants. But it hasn't. ARONCZYK: Part of the reason is all of these coronaviruses are a little different. This one's new. So no matter what, it is going to take time. But another reason is economics. GONZALEZ: The market for emergency vaccines for pandemics, diseases that spread around the world - it is not like the regular market for, you know, bikes and raspberries. It is a lot weirder than that. ARONCZYK: Today on the show, we find out just how weird. This story involves the anthrax scare. GONZALEZ: And an undisclosed number of secret government chickens. RICK BRIGHT: Hello. This is Rick Bright. GONZALEZ: Rick Bright, you are the hardest person to get ahold of. BRIGHT: Unfortunately, it's been a busy month or two, yes. And it seems to be getting busier. GONZALEZ: Rick Bright is the director at BARDA, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority in Washington, D. C. They help prepare and respond to everything from nuclear and chemical threats to biological threats, like viruses. So he's super busy. BRIGHT: Very, very long days right now. ARONCZYK: And we were not the only ones who wanted a little bit of Rick Bright's time. GONZALEZ: I was bumped this morning. I was told it was Vice President Mike Pence. BRIGHT: You probably have some good information there. GONZALEZ: (Laughter) OK. ARONCZYK: Rick Bright is in his early 50s, and he's worked on viruses pretty much his whole career. He was at the CDC, then the biotech industry. Now he's back working for the government. But his interest in viruses started on a farm. BRIGHT: Very few people know that, you know, I was born in a small town in Kansas on a farm nearby. GONZALEZ: Did you have chickens as a farm boy? BRIGHT: We had chickens. We had a lot of animals (laughter) at the farm. Those chickens were just for eggs to eat. GONZALEZ: Eggs are a big part of Rick's life still. BRIGHT: I do have an Egg Genie in my office, as well, as a Christmas gift someone gave me. And it's like a little incubator. I can make omelets. I can heat up seven different eggs and poach them at one time. ARONCZYK: And Rick Bright got into vaccines because of something that a lot of people think was also born in Kansas - the 1918, 1919 pandemic flu. This was one of the deadliest outbreaks in human history, killed somewhere between 50 million to 100 million people around the world. GONZALEZ: And that pandemic came from birds. Basically all flus do, even the swine flu - starts in birds. But we didn't know any of that back then. BRIGHT: And my motivating force through my entire career is a small-town boy from Kansas could have the power or the ability or the knowledge to stop the next pandemic. So everything I've done in my career has put me right here right now. GONZALEZ: Rick Bright came to this pandemic preparedness agency, BARDA, 10 years ago when it was still fairly new. The event that led to this agency started one week after the 9/11 attacks. Anxieties were really high. Everything seemed like a potential terrorist attack.

In fact, the entire landmass of the Earth is being photographed from space every day. For more on this, NPR's Greg Myre visited a spy agency many have never heard of. GREG MYRE, BYLINE: In 1960, the U. S. government began taking satellite photos, but it wasn't easy getting those pictures back to Earth. The satellite had to drop a small film capsule attached to a parachute. A military plane with a large hook flew by to collect the capsule in midair over the Pacific Ocean. KATIE DONEGAN: They called the pilots who flew these missions star catchers because they were catching what looked like stars falling from the sky. MYRE: Katie Donegan is with the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, or NGA for short. She says after all this effort for photos of Soviet military sites. . . DONEGAN: Analysts might be lucky to get one or two images of their target per year. MYRE: Fast-forward to 2011. The NGA scored a major coup by locating Osama bin Laden's hideout in Pakistan. The agency took detailed photos and also found it had archival pictures taken before the roof was placed on the house. This allowed the military to build a full-size replica of the exterior and the interior, where Navy SEALs practiced before the actual raid. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BARACK OBAMA: Tonight I can report to the American people and to the world. MYRE: . . . Which led to this announcement by President Obama. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)OBAMA: The United States has conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden. MYRE: A tabletop model of bin Laden's compound is on display at NGA headquarters in Fort Belvoir, Va. , just off a highway south of Washington. Today the NGA, one of the nation's least-known spy agencies, is undergoing another revolution. It's working closely with private commercial satellite companies, and this has created an endless stream of imagery from space. The NGA's Dave Gauthier here explains what this could mean for militaries worldwide. DAVE GAUTHIER: We will all be observed every second of every day by something. And so we have to learn how to operate in the open, and it makes strategic surprise very difficult for everybody. (SOUNDBITE OF BEEPING)MYRE: After speaking with Gauthier in a secure briefing room, NPR is led inside an even more sensitive space - the operation center - but only to look, not to record. Dozens of analysts are working, yet it's dark, quiet as a library. All overhead lights are off. The darkness eliminates glare for the analysts who pore over satellite images on their computers. The sheer volume of incoming photos these days is overwhelming. Gauthier tells us how the partnership with private satellite companies has changed the game. GAUTHIER: Most people have a notion of a satellite being a school-bus-sized instrument. What's amazing today is to see that a satellite that does imaging of the Earth is the size of a loaf of bread. MYRE: This has created a division of labor. The government owns these very large satellites. They take high-resolution images of extremely sensitive sites, like nuclear facilities in North Korea. Commercial companies like Planet of San Francisco are putting up the much smaller satellites. Their photos aren't as detailed, but they see most everything. For the past three years, Planet has produced more than 1 million images a day showing the entire landmass of the Earth as it changes every 24 hours. The government buys those images from Planet, says Gauthier. GAUTHIER: We can look at the whole haystack, and things that look like needles can gather our attention. (SOUNDBITE OF BEEPING)MYRE: Rich Leshner runs Planet's office in Washington. RICH LESHNER: Imagine laying the Earth flat, taking a picture of it from space with a really cool camera. We do that every day. MYRE: Planet sell those pictures to a range of customers. LESHNER: And those customers exist in the private sector. They exist in the not-for-profit sector. They exist in the government sector. MYRE: The government used to have a monopoly on satellite images, but now anyone can get them. Environmentalists track melting sea ice. Farmers monitor crops. Aid groups keep tabs on refugee flows. So if all this is now being observed from space, what does this mean for your privacy? The Geospatial Intelligence Agency stresses that it doesn't look at images of the U. S. unless requested to do so by another government agency. This might involve checking the damage caused by a forest fire or a hurricane. Still, Dave Gauthier says people should have a general awareness. GAUTHIER: Most people understand by carrying a cellphone with them that some of their information is being monitored, and we just have to recognize that there's an ability to observe more from space than ever before. MYRE: Which means most everyone - governments, armies and even individuals - can be seen by the eyes in the sky. Greg Myre, NPR News, Fort Belvoir, Va.

That's true for some staff here at NPR. While there are perks working in your pajamas and the close proximity to the refrigerator, it can be a nightmare for managers who still have to keep the proverbial trains running on time. So we turned to a CEO who has decades of experience running a company where nearly all the employees and contractors work remotely. KATE WALTON: My name is Kate Walton. And I'm the owner and CEO of Steyer Content. And we're headquartered in Seattle. GARCIA-NAVARRO: As a manager, Walton says, she's always had to create important virtual-office connections. WALTON: So we've, for quite a number of years now, had an online community where we gather every day. That's where we collaborate. That's how we connect in normal times. GARCIA-NAVARRO: But these are not normal times. With the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases growing by the day, so too has our collective anxiety, even for a work-from-home veteran like Walton. WALTON: I think once you're in a crisis, like this - I mean, the way I think about it is those of us who aren't actually on the frontlines of emergency response - and, you know, huge kudos to those who are - it sort of feels like tending to the mental and emotional health of our teams needs to be our top priority. I mean, I really see that as part of the response, even before you get to the smaller issue of how to keep a business going through times like this. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Walton says that, in the past five years, advances in technology have made it easier to keep her teams connected. Steyer Content uses Slack, a messaging program where co-workers can post and exchange ideas in private groups. While it's used for work, Walton will also hold trivia contests, mark birthdays or ask people to post photos of their pets, not unlike something you might see in a nonvirtual office. WALTON: As of literally this morning, you know, a couple hours ago, there was a movement to get some RPGs going, some role-playing games - not rocket-propelled grenades, just to be clear. So it's sort of taken off. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Recently, Walton decided to get even more creative. This month, employees were invited to their first virtual happy hour, giving a new meaning to the term BYOB. We asked her how it went. WALTON: We set a specific time, set out a video link and asked people to, you know, bring the beverage of their choice - made it clear that it could be an adult beverage - to the video call. It was quite simply a way for us to shoot the breeze, you know, from a safe distance, to kind of have a little bit of that water cooler effect that, even after a few days, we were starting to miss. And so it's kind of a nice, new thing to have in our quiver. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Happy hour was so successful that they did it again last Thursday. And now the Steyer crew is working to pull off a session of online karaoke. Walton says the trick is not to force the connections but rather give permission to be creative and see where employees take it. Though not everything has taken off. She posted an exercise challenge and invited others to join her. WALTON: One of my colleagues and I have been doing the 7-minute exercise routine. But so far, it is literally the two of us. GARCIA-NAVARRO: What it comes down to, Walton says, is connection. WALTON: It's something that humans crave. I mean, it's that fundamental.

TIM MAK, BYLINE: The coronavirus is the first epidemic that has received this much attention in the social media age. JOHN GREGORY: It's definitely unprecedented. I've never seen something like this that the medical and scientific communities have had to address in real time. MAK: John Gregory is the deputy editor of health at NewsGuard, which reviews news platforms for their credibility and trustworthiness. He says there are three big buckets of coronavirus misinformation circulating right now. GREGORY: No. 1, conspiracies about the origins of the virus; two, bad health cures, either ineffective or both ineffective and harmful. And three, minimizing the outbreak, saying it's not as big of a deal as the media is making it out to be. MAK: Big tech firms have been grappling for years with foreign coordinated disinformation campaigns, like the one launched by Russia to interfere with the 2016 election. But misinformation about the coronavirus seems to be organic and domestic. In fact, much of it appears to be spread by Americans interested in profit, Gregory said. GREGORY: Some are promoting their own phony health cures for the coronavirus. Other people are selling other, like, survivalist kind of supplies and using this news as a way to, essentially, scare people into thinking they need all of that. They need buckets of food supplies or big supplies of masks. MAK: Tech companies are trying to elevate trusted sources of information while removing false information on a rolling basis. When users search for coronavirus, Facebook and Twitter have put a link to the Centers for Disease Control as the first result. Google is doing the same with information from the World Health Organization available in more than 20 languages. YouTube says it is removing videos promoting dangerous and false cures.

She's been a critic of how social media companies have dealt with political disinformation but is now praising tech companies for proactive steps like these. LINDSAY GORMAN: I think this is really a serious response. And it shows what aggressively confronting a disinformation challenge actually looks like and what our big tech platforms can do when there is a strong will to act. MAK: Big tech firms have not wanted to be arbiters of political truth. But with the coronavirus, both the dangers and the truth are much clearer, said Gorman. GORMAN: The platforms' policies all talk about the threat of serious harm to the public as being sort of of a higher order than fact-checking around the political context. I think it's a clear call for them in many cases, and they don't have to get into this role of playing editor.

NPR's Yuki Noguchi is one of many parents trying to navigate. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Last week, I had just transitioned to working from home full-time. Then my 10-year-old son Kenzo came home with a large Ziploc bag full of school supplies. Is this an iPad? KENZO NOGUCHI: Yeah. NOGUCHI: Oh, OK. KENZO: This is, like, all of fourth grade in one Google Classroom. NOGUCHI: He says his class will gather for attendance at 8 a. m. There are worksheets to complete and submit online. Tiny icons representing his teacher and classmates will appear in the corner. KENZO: I can see Miss Furr, and she can hear us. NOGUCHI: There's a microphone built into here. KENZO: Yeah. NOGUCHI: How do you raise your hand? KENZO: She's going to explain that to us. NOGUCHI: OK. KENZO: I mean. . . NOGUCHI: Remote learning is a brave new world for both of us, one we've entered with little warning. KENZO: They try to make it as real as possible, as school-like as possible. They said they might do virtual P. E. NOGUCHI: What on Earth is that? KENZO: I don't know. NOGUCHI: (Laughter) Like, do you have an avatar doing jumping jacks or something? KENZO: I don't know. NOGUCHI: Life during a pandemic has left parents everywhere grappling with remote work and remote school. Some schools are giving kids devices, workbooks and other resources. Others may not. Parents are left with this dual challenge - managing new ways of working while not allowing their kids to disappear into social media and video games. Jennifer Hertrich lives in Seattle and is already managing remote work and remote school. Her school district was one of the first to cancel classes. Her son's at home. JENNIFER HERTRICH: It's interesting. A lot of what we do for work is also mirrored in the experience for my child. You know, having things like a schedule is very important. NOGUCHI: Hertrich is an account manager for furnishings company Steelcase. She sets multiple alarms during the day to keep everyone on task. That enables her to schedule her own calls and Web meetings. HERTRICH: I was having some live sessions in the morning from about 9:30 to 10:30, and then I could get my son going on some assignments. NOGUCHI: Her home has been carved into zones to avoid talking over each other's calls. She is in her home office. Her 8-year-old set up shop in the living room. HERTRICH: And my husband's in the basement area. NOGUCHI: There are some benefits. They enjoy lunch and dinner together as a family. Morale and Wi-Fi have held up. But then last week, Washington state canceled school an additional month. Now things aren't looking so great. HERTRICH: When it was 14 days, you can kind of take it day by day, and we'll get through this. And when you're looking at six weeks out, you know, how does that impact everyone's life? MICHAEL RICH: This is a whole new experience for all of us. NOGUCHI: Michael Rich is director of the Center on Media and Child Health and a father of two out-of-school teenagers. Keeping to a schedule, he says, is paramount. RICH: This gives both the parent and the child an idea of when they will be doing what and when they will not be doing what. NOGUCHI: Like watching hours of TikTok - but he says not all video is bad. Some might spur your kid's curiosity. RICH: We could look at this as an opportunity to do a little independent study. NOGUCHI: But that will require parents to curate appropriate content. Challenges will pop up throughout the day. There are plenty of distractions and interruptions. These days, there's no separating work and parenting. RICH: We're not going to be very good at parenting them if we're constantly frustrated that they're interrupting us, and we do need to be able to parent and guide them and, frankly, to model self-discipline and focus because they're going to learn from that much more than they will from what we tell them. NOGUCHI: In other words, as parents learn to remote work, their children, too, will learn by example. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News, Washington. AILSA CHANG, HOST:   Parents and children alike are adjusting to a life of school and work at home, and they're having to do it together. NPR's Yuki Noguchi is one of many parents trying to navigate. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Last week, I had just transitioned to working from home full-time. Then my 10-year-old son Kenzo came home with a large Ziploc bag full of school supplies. Is this an iPad? KENZO NOGUCHI: Yeah. NOGUCHI: Oh, OK. KENZO: This is, like, all of fourth grade in one Google Classroom. NOGUCHI: He says his class will gather for attendance at 8 a. m. There are worksheets to complete and submit online. Tiny icons representing his teacher and classmates will appear in the corner. KENZO: I can see Miss Furr, and she can hear us. NOGUCHI: There's a microphone built into here. KENZO: Yeah. NOGUCHI: How do you raise your hand? KENZO: She's going to explain that to us. NOGUCHI: OK. KENZO: I mean. . . NOGUCHI: Remote learning is a brave new world for both of us, one we've entered with little warning. KENZO: They try to make it as real as possible, as school-like as possible. They said they might do virtual P. E. NOGUCHI: What on Earth is that? KENZO: I don't know. NOGUCHI: (Laughter) Like, do you have an avatar doing jumping jacks or something? KENZO: I don't know. NOGUCHI: Life during a pandemic has left parents everywhere grappling with remote work and remote school. Some schools are giving kids devices, workbooks and other resources. Others may not. Parents are left with this dual challenge - managing new ways of working while not allowing their kids to disappear into social media and video games. Jennifer Hertrich lives in Seattle and is already managing remote work and remote school. Her school district was one of the first to cancel classes. Her son's at home. JENNIFER HERTRICH: It's interesting. A lot of what we do for work is also mirrored in the experience for my child. You know, having things like a schedule is very important. NOGUCHI: Hertrich is an account manager for furnishings company Steelcase. She sets multiple alarms during the day to keep everyone on task. That enables her to schedule her own calls and Web meetings. HERTRICH: I was having some live sessions in the morning from about 9:30 to 10:30, and then I could get my son going on some assignments. NOGUCHI: Her home has been carved into zones to avoid talking over each other's calls. She is in her home office. Her 8-year-old set up shop in the living room. HERTRICH: And my husband's in the basement area. NOGUCHI: There are some benefits. They enjoy lunch and dinner together as a family. Morale and Wi-Fi have held up. But then last week, Washington state canceled school an additional month. Now things aren't looking so great. HERTRICH: When it was 14 days, you can kind of take it day by day, and we'll get through this. And when you're looking at six weeks out, you know, how does that impact everyone's life? MICHAEL RICH: This is a whole new experience for all of us. NOGUCHI: Michael Rich is director of the Center on Media and Child Health and a father of two out-of-school teenagers. Keeping to a schedule, he says, is paramount. RICH: This gives both the parent and the child an idea of when they will be doing what and when they will not be doing what. NOGUCHI: Like watching hours of TikTok - but he says not all video is bad. Some might spur your kid's curiosity. RICH: We could look at this as an opportunity to do a little independent study. NOGUCHI: But that will require parents to curate appropriate content. Challenges will pop up throughout the day. There are plenty of distractions and interruptions. These days, there's no separating work and parenting. RICH: We're not going to be very good at parenting them if we're constantly frustrated that they're interrupting us, and we do need to be able to parent and guide them and, frankly, to model self-discipline and focus because they're going to learn from that much more than they will from what we tell them.

NPR's tech correspondent Shannon Bond reports. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: More people are shifting to the digital world these days as life outside the home is put on hold.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KAREN DUFFIN, HOST: Hello and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I am Karen Duffin. And today on the show, we are going to take you inside the pandemic testing system to try to understand what are these coronavirus tests that we've all been hearing so much about. How do they work? Who even makes them? And most importantly, why is it taking so long? But first, we want to just answer the question, what is it like to take one of these tests? And to answer that, we are going to take you to a parking garage in Seattle with Jon Hamilton, who is a science reporter at NPR. JON HAMILTON, BYLINE: You know, it's one of these multilevel concrete parking garages, the kind you see outside of most hospitals, and they had actually set up a testing station in the ground floor. DUFFIN: A University of Washington hospital setup their own drive-through coronavirus testing. You may have heard of this by now. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: I'm going to have you pull up. And I want you. . . HAMILTON: So you pull in. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Don't get out of your car. Stay in your car at all. . . HAMILTON: . . . Roll down the window. Nobody ever gets out of their car. They pull up to the next place, which is in front of these three medical tents. And then the second nurse. . . JEFF: My name's Jeff. I'm the employee. . . HAMILTON: . . . Goes up to the window. . . JEFF: We're going to be doing your swabs today. HAMILTON: . . . Through the open window has people kind of lean back and make their nostrils available. JEFF: OK, I'm just going to have you lean your head back just a little bit. HAMILTON: Then takes a swab. This is not just a regular nasal swab; this is what is known as a nasopharyngeal swab. It's like, it goes up your nose and then, like, most of the way back to your throat. DUFFIN: People who've had this test say that it feels like that swab is actually touching your brain. HAMILTON: It's a little invasive (laughter). (SOUNDBITE OF COUGHING)JEFF: OK, one down. HAMILTON: But they take one swab from each nostril, package it up in this plastic tube. JEFF: . . . As well as COVID-19. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: OK. JEFF: We'll get you back results as soon as possible, OK? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: OK. Sounds good. HAMILTON: These folks had figured out a very practical and - done it very quickly, a way to test a whole bunch of people and to do it with professionals who really know what they're doing. So I took a lot of hope from that. DUFFIN: But that is just the first step in the test. And, you know, when we say the word test, here is what that actually means. It's three things, really. There is, No. 1, equipment - things like swabs and test tubes. No. 2 - there are special chemicals that, like, hunt for the virus. And No. 3 - there is a machine that you actually run the test on. And to know whether or not someone has the virus, all of those three things have to work together. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)DUFFIN: Today on the show, we are going to introduce you to the people who tried to make this test, who can help us understand why the test took so long to get to all of our local garages. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)DUFFIN: You've probably heard of the CDC, the FDA, the National Security Council. These are all government organizations that get activated in a public health emergency. But there's also a group that you may not have heard of that are, like, first responders for outbreaks like this - public health labs. While our doctors monitor me and you, public health labs monitor us, the health of the collective that we are all now so much more aware of. KELLY WROBLEWSKI: We always say that sort of clinical and commercial laboratories do testing to inform the care of patients, where public health laboratories do testing to inform the care of population. DUFFIN: Kelly Wroblewski is the director of infectious disease programs at the Association of Public Health Laboratories, or APHL. Firefighters have hoses, EMTs have tourniquets, and public health labs have tests so they can test the population and know how to treat it. Every state has at least one public health lab; some cities do, too. These labs are like public health threat detectives. They're constantly scanning every corner for biological and chemical threats. Remember when E. coli was spreading in lettuce? Public health labs tested lettuce to help inform the recall. They also monitor for STD outbreaks and influenza outbreaks, in part so they can do things like help develop the yearly flu vaccines. Most days, Kelly's job is a lot like most of our jobs. WROBLEWSKI: Yeah. So I certainly send a lot of emails. We're on a lot of conference calls. But, I mean, it is a pretty steady kind of job. DUFFIN: That all changed last December. On December 31, New Year's Eve, a health official in China contacted the World Health Organization to say, hey, we have spotted a new strain of virus here, and we think that this one might be very bad. Before most of us knew the word coronavirus, back when we were obliviously going to concerts, innocently riding subways, hugging with abandon, Kelly was worried. That's what public health labs do; they worry in advance. But for 11 days, there wasn't a whole lot that anyone could do because to make a test to detect this virus, you have to know exactly what the virus looks like. You have to have access to the virus. But at that point, the virus had only been spotted in China, so the world had to wait while China mapped the genome. WROBLEWSKI: That's basically the genetic fingerprint of the virus. DUFFIN: Finally, on January 11, China posted that genetic fingerprint, and the race to create a test began in earnest around the world so that everyone else could find out, has this virus crossed the border into our country, too? Germany created a test within days. The World Health Organization picked up that test and started distributing that one. And the United States created its own test. WROBLEWSKI: CDC scientists start to develop a test based on the sequence. So you sort of reverse engineer and then develop an assay from there. DUFFIN: An assay - A-S-S-A-Y. Assays are essentially chemicals that cling only to one specific virus - if the test works right, that is. And this particular new virus lives in RNA strands. So this assay wanders through a person's RNA looking for a match, and if the assay does meet its viral match, it clings to it and, like, waves at the scientist, like, hey, I found it; that virus, it's here. WROBLEWSKI: Using that information, scientists at CDC and around the world were able to develop tests to detect the virus. DUFFIN: And it's at this point, now that the CDC has developed the chemicals for this test, that Kelly's team, this network of public health labs, really starts to suit up. What needs to happen next is that the CDC's assay, those coronavirus-hunting chemicals, get sent to the public health labs so those labs can, like, test drive the test, make sure that the test works, so that then tests can be widely used on actual patients. Kelly set up an emergency operations center to help coordinate the work of public health labs across America. The CDC detected the first case of the virus in the United States on January 18. And so, you know, at that point, Kelly's labs are like, cool, send us the test. A week passes, then 10 days passed, and you have these public health labs around the country waiting - I can imagine refreshing the FedEx website because in those 10 days, as they waited, the only way to makeshift test the increasing number of patients around the country was to take a swab, like they did in that parking garage in Seattle, and mail that swab to the CDC in Atlanta. In those 10 days, only the CDC could conduct tests. But while the labs are waiting for the test, Kelly is starting to work the phones. WROBLEWSKI: Normally, what would happen is the - we would start to have phone calls at the laboratories. DUFFIN: Like, the test is coming; are you ready? Because the CDC provides the chemicals, but this is a BYO equipment kind of situation. The labs have to have equipment to run the test. So she's calling labs and running down the supply list. WROBLEWSKI: Make sure they have the extraction platform. DUFFIN: Do you have the right swabs? WROBLEWSKI: There's the different chemicals that they need. DUFFIN: Test tubes, information systems. Like, are you stocked? Because a tidal wave is coming. WROBLEWSKI: And so while CDC is working on developing the test, the public health labs are preparing all of those things in the background. DUFFIN: Finally, on January 28, the CDC publishes the protocol for their test, which is essentially a recipe. Like, you need our CDC assay, those chemicals, and this kind of equipment to make the test work. So yay - America finally has a test. But before it can be actually used on the many patients who are now clamoring for this test, the FDA first has to sign off on it. And, you know, that's what the FDA does every day; they approve all medicine and medical equipment to verify it does what it says it does. Even the CDC has to get approval from the FDA. And FDA approval often takes months, if not years. And that slowness is by design. The public health system was created to stop people from just, like, willy-nilly making medicine that might actually kill you instead of heal you or, like, marketing cocaine as a great diet supplement. The public health system is designed to check and triple-check. But in a crisis, we don't need perfection. We don't just need quality; we also need speed. So in an emergency like this, the FDA does have a route to fast-track their approvals. It's a special bureaucratic magic wand called an emergency use authorization, and they use that here. A week after the CDC submits its test for approval, the FDA waves that wand and clears the test for use with patients. And then one more thing has to happen to get this test in shape for patients - the labs have to test drive the test to make sure that the CDC's recipe works in their specific state and local labs, on their equipment. So the public health labs get the CDC test, and their work begins. WROBLEWSKI: So very shortly, the day after the tests started to be delivered, we at APHL and CDC started to receive calls and emails from a few laboratories that had come in on a Saturday and - just not everything was where it should be. DUFFIN: The test that they had been waiting for, once they finally get it, they realize that it's not working the way that it's supposed to be - in some of the labs, at least, not all of them, but a lot of them. WROBLEWSKI: We sort of continue to monitor the situation through the weekend. By early in the week, it becomes clear that this isn't a problem in a single laboratory. So it is probably a problem with the test. DUFFIN: And is this normal? Does this happen or is this unusual? WROBLEWSKI: It's not usual, but it does happen. And it was just very unfortunate timing that it happened as we were preparing for, you know, the coronavirus to come to the U. S. DUFFIN: The United States was already several weeks behind other countries in testing. Now, with this glitchy test, it will be even more time before testing can start in full. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)DUFFIN: So it's mid-February, and the public health labs are waiting for the CDC to send their new test. Remember, Germany's test was done within days. The CDC's first test, the glitchy one, that one took a week. But as the labs are waiting for this second test, the new test, a week passes, 10 days pass - still no test. What's the time between decision to remake it and then they get back out to the public health labs? WROBLEWSKI: Yeah. It was about two weeks - 2 1/2 weeks before the labs were able to have a new test. DUFFIN: Within 2 1/2 weeks, the test does finally show up. But in that gap, the public health labs have been doing some contingency planning. With the virus spreading, they don't want to wait because, you know, speed matters in a pandemic. And at this point, only public health labs were allowed to run tests. But, of course, there are a lot more labs in this country. There are also private health labs, labs that are built to scale to do testing en masse. But at that point, private labs were being kept on the sidelines. The FDA had not yet given private labs emergency waivers to start testing, which left the public health labs to test at a scale that they had never faced before, all alone and at that point still without a working test. So the labs decided to do something that, in their history, they have never done before. Kelly sends a letter to the FDA. WROBLEWSKI: That basically asked, during this emergency situation, due to the issues with the kit, can public health laboratories go forward and perform their tests? DUFFIN: Dear FDA, please, please let us make our own tests. Frankly, some of the public health labs had already gone rogue. They'd already started doing their own tests sort of under the radar. And this is something we have all seen lately. As the federal agencies that we normally look to in a moment like this are grappling with this unprecedented situation and not all operating in the way that we need them to, people on the ground are improvising. And it's not just for the reasons that we're all familiar with now, like patients needing tests. Like, you feel sick, you want a test. Your grandma feels sick, you want her to have a test. For the public health labs, they also want to test populations, like, zoom out and scan the country and see the trends in how this thing is spreading, data that helps public officials as they start to make these huge decisions that we've watched them make over the past week or so. Population-wide testing helps public officials prescribe more surgical solutions. Like, maybe they don't have to lock down an entire city, but instead maybe just shut down one hotel or just one school - interventions that could still help slow the virus but with less disruption. But on Feb 26, the first case shows up that no one can trace its origins. Nobody knows where it came from, which means the virus has taken root in America. Shortly after this, the FDA shifts gears. WROBLEWSKI: They issued this new guidance. DUFFIN: The FDA says certain labs - more advanced labs, the ones that can do more complex science - those public health labs can start developing their own tests. They just have to apply for FDA approval within two weeks. And this is new for public health labs. You guys have not done this before? WROBLEWSKI: Yeah. It's new. DUFFIN: Were people - is that exciting, or is that just frustrating, like, we shouldn't have to do this, or how. . . WROBLEWSKI: Well, I think it's exciting. And I think the - ultimately, having more testing available is a new thing. But how is our system going to ensure the quality of the testing and sort of adapt to this new process sort of while we're in the middle of an emergency? DUFFIN: But at this point, it feels like a risk worth taking. So public health labs begin to ramp up - way up. WROBLEWSKI: So in those labs, they are working, really, around the clock. They're hiring new staff, and they're really taking some heroic measures to just make sure they get as much testing done as possible. DUFFIN: But as the labs are toiling away, Kelly says they're also thinking, you know what? We could use some help here. WROBLEWSKI: And CDC is not a commercial manufacturer, right? They're a. . . DUFFIN: Right, right. WROBLEWSKI: . . . Government agency. So I think right now what we're eagerly awaiting is for the large-scale commercial diagnostic manufacturers, for those people that make your cholesterol tests and your flu tests - we would expect them to have testing - tests available to sell to laboratories in hospitals and commercial laboratories. DUFFIN: And as I've spoken with public health leaders, several of them have told me that bringing in the private sector more and faster probably would have really helped. Do you know why it took them so long to do that? WROBLEWSKI: I don't. DUFFIN: OK. Well, I am talking to them this afternoon. I will ask. WROBLEWSKI: Great (laughter). DUFFIN: The FDA was not able to get on the phone that day, understandably. They have a lot going on right now. But in just the last few days, the FDA did finally give some private businesses their first emergency waiver. And to be fair, you know, some of those companies were not even ready to apply for an emergency use authorization until late February, and once they did apply, some of them told me that the FDA granted the authorization within days, not the many months this kind of thing can usually take. But these first emergency waivers for private companies, they were issued just last Friday, March 13 - two weeks after the public health labs had started making their own tests. So not until two and a half months after the virus was first spotted did the capitalism capital of the world let the private sector do what they do best - make stuff for the masses. And for comparison, the United States and South Korea each detected the virus on the same day in January, but South Korea allowed private health care companies to start making tests by the end of January. And as of this recording, South Korea has now tested close to 300,000 people. The United States has tested close to 80,000. But private companies here in America are now ramping up and making tests - lots of them. JOHN GERACE: I mean, we have a 100,000-square-foot manufacturing facility here in Southern California, and that's all we do - is, you know, develop and manufacture molecular diagnostic kits. DUFFIN: That is John Gerace. He's the president of DiaSorin Molecular. He's based in Southern California, but it is an Italian company, so they are painfully aware of how this can spread. And DiaSorin and had been ready to help, actually, for a long time before they got the go-ahead. GERACE: Our R & D scientists in Italy, they had design and assay right - you know, very, very shortly after the outbreak was announced. DUFFIN: Assay - remember the chemical part of the test? GERACE: We are ramping up very quickly. We're implementing multiple shifts, and we plan to have, you know, full - we're ramping up to full production to where, you know, we can satisfy the demands, particularly in the U. S. and in Italy. DUFFIN: And in the past week, the FDA has allowed several other private companies to start helping out with the tests. And actually, in just the last day or so, as we were finalizing this episode, President Trump announced that he will introduce new policies that will relax the FDA approval process even more. And this is the thing about crises. When the world turns into a place that you no longer recognize, all of those rules and big ideals spelled out so meticulously when times were good will probably have to change. I see - because it's just so widespread. It has to just, like - you have to let go a little bit, it sounds like. Everyone in this situation has had to let go a little bit. WROBLEWSKI: Yeah. Everybody has had to let go. That's a great way to describe it. DUFFIN: Seems necessary but a little scary, especially in the moment of crisis. WROBLEWSKI: Yes.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1, BYLINE: This is PLANET MONEY from NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KAREN DUFFIN, HOST:  Hello and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I am Karen Duffin. And today on the show, we are going to take you inside the pandemic testing system to try to understand what are these coronavirus tests that we've all been hearing so much about. How do they work? Who even makes them? And most importantly, why is it taking so long? But first, we want to just answer the question, what is it like to take one of these tests? And to answer that, we are going to take you to a parking garage in Seattle with Jon Hamilton, who is a science reporter at NPR. JON HAMILTON, BYLINE: You know, it's one of these multilevel concrete parking garages, the kind you see outside of most hospitals, and they had actually set up a testing station in the ground floor. DUFFIN: A University of Washington hospital setup their own drive-through coronavirus testing. You may have heard of this by now. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: I'm going to have you pull up. And I want you. . . HAMILTON: So you pull in. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Don't get out of your car. Stay in your car at all. . . HAMILTON: . . . Roll down the window. Nobody ever gets out of their car. They pull up to the next place, which is in front of these three medical tents. And then the second nurse. . . JEFF: My name's Jeff. I'm the employee. . . HAMILTON: . . . Goes up to the window. . . JEFF: We're going to be doing your swabs today. HAMILTON: . . . Through the open window has people kind of lean back and make their nostrils available. JEFF: OK, I'm just going to have you lean your head back just a little bit. HAMILTON: Then takes a swab. This is not just a regular nasal swab; this is what is known as a nasopharyngeal swab. It's like, it goes up your nose and then, like, most of the way back to your throat. DUFFIN: People who've had this test say that it feels like that swab is actually touching your brain. HAMILTON: It's a little invasive (laughter). (SOUNDBITE OF COUGHING) JEFF: OK, one down. HAMILTON: But they take one swab from each nostril, package it up in this plastic tube. JEFF: . . . As well as COVID-19. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: OK. JEFF: We'll get you back results as soon as possible, OK? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: OK. Sounds good. HAMILTON: These folks had figured out a very practical and - done it very quickly, a way to test a whole bunch of people and to do it with professionals who really know what they're doing. So I took a lot of hope from that. DUFFIN: But that is just the first step in the test. And, you know, when we say the word test, here is what that actually means. It's three things, really. There is, No. 1, equipment - things like swabs and test tubes. No. 2 - there are special chemicals that, like, hunt for the virus. And No. 3 - there is a machine that you actually run the test on. And to know whether or not someone has the virus, all of those three things have to work together. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DUFFIN: Today on the show, we are going to introduce you to the people who tried to make this test, who can help us understand why the test took so long to get to all of our local garages. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DUFFIN: You've probably heard of the CDC, the FDA, the National Security Council. These are all government organizations that get activated in a public health emergency. But there's also a group that you may not have heard of that are, like, first responders for outbreaks like this - public health labs. While our doctors monitor me and you, public health labs monitor us, the health of the collective that we are all now so much more aware of. KELLY WROBLEWSKI: We always say that sort of clinical and commercial laboratories do testing to inform the care of patients, where public health laboratories do testing to inform the care of population. DUFFIN: Kelly Wroblewski is the director of infectious disease programs at the Association of Public Health Laboratories, or APHL. Firefighters have hoses, EMTs have tourniquets, and public health labs have tests so they can test the population and know how to treat it. Every state has at least one public health lab; some cities do, too. These labs are like public health threat detectives. They're constantly scanning every corner for biological and chemical threats. Remember when E. coli was spreading in lettuce? Public health labs tested lettuce to help inform the recall. They also monitor for STD outbreaks and influenza outbreaks, in part so they can do things like help develop the yearly flu vaccines. Most days, Kelly's job is a lot like most of our jobs. WROBLEWSKI: Yeah. So I certainly send a lot of emails. We're on a lot of conference calls. But, I mean, it is a pretty steady kind of job. DUFFIN: That all changed last December. On December 31, New Year's Eve, a health official in China contacted the World Health Organization to say, hey, we have spotted a new strain of virus here, and we think that this one might be very bad. Before most of us knew the word coronavirus, back when we were obliviously going to concerts, innocently riding subways, hugging with abandon, Kelly was worried. That's what public health labs do; they worry in advance. But for 11 days, there wasn't a whole lot that anyone could do because to make a test to detect this virus, you have to know exactly what the virus looks like. You have to have access to the virus. But at that point, the virus had only been spotted in China, so the world had to wait while China mapped the genome. WROBLEWSKI: That's basically the genetic fingerprint of the virus. DUFFIN: Finally, on January 11, China posted that genetic fingerprint, and the race to create a test began in earnest around the world so that everyone else could find out, has this virus crossed the border into our country, too? Germany created a test within days. The World Health Organization picked up that test and started distributing that one. And the United States created its own test. WROBLEWSKI: CDC scientists start to develop a test based on the sequence. So you sort of reverse engineer and then develop an assay from there. DUFFIN: An assay - A-S-S-A-Y. Assays are essentially chemicals that cling only to one specific virus - if the test works right, that is. And this particular new virus lives in RNA strands. So this assay wanders through a person's RNA looking for a match, and if the assay does meet its viral match, it clings to it and, like, waves at the scientist, like, hey, I found it; that virus, it's here. WROBLEWSKI: Using that information, scientists at CDC and around the world were able to develop tests to detect the virus. DUFFIN: And it's at this point, now that the CDC has developed the chemicals for this test, that Kelly's team, this network of public health labs, really starts to suit up. What needs to happen next is that the CDC's assay, those coronavirus-hunting chemicals, get sent to the public health labs so those labs can, like, test drive the test, make sure that the test works, so that then tests can be widely used on actual patients. Kelly set up an emergency operations center to help coordinate the work of public health labs across America. The CDC detected the first case of the virus in the United States on January 18. And so, you know, at that point, Kelly's labs are like, cool, send us the test. A week passes, then 10 days passed, and you have these public health labs around the country waiting - I can imagine refreshing the FedEx website because in those 10 days, as they waited, the only way to makeshift test the increasing number of patients around the country was to take a swab, like they did in that parking garage in Seattle, and mail that swab to the CDC in Atlanta. In those 10 days, only the CDC could conduct tests. But while the labs are waiting for the test, Kelly is starting to work the phones. WROBLEWSKI: Normally, what would happen is the - we would start to have phone calls at the laboratories. DUFFIN: Like, the test is coming; are you ready? Because the CDC provides the chemicals, but this is a BYO equipment kind of situation. The labs have to have equipment to run the test. So she's calling labs and running down the supply list. WROBLEWSKI: Make sure they have the extraction platform. DUFFIN: Do you have the right swabs? WROBLEWSKI: There's the different chemicals that they need. DUFFIN: Test tubes, information systems. Like, are you stocked? Because a tidal wave is coming. WROBLEWSKI: And so while CDC is working on developing the test, the public health labs are preparing all of those things in the background. DUFFIN: Finally, on January 28, the CDC publishes the protocol for their test, which is essentially a recipe. Like, you need our CDC assay, those chemicals, and this kind of equipment to make the test work. So yay - America finally has a test. But before it can be actually used on the many patients who are now clamoring for this test, the FDA first has to sign off on it. And, you know, that's what the FDA does every day; they approve all medicine and medical equipment to verify it does what it says it does. Even the CDC has to get approval from the FDA. And FDA approval often takes months, if not years. And that slowness is by design. The public health system was created to stop people from just, like, willy-nilly making medicine that might actually kill you instead of heal you or, like, marketing cocaine as a great diet supplement. The public health system is designed to check and triple-check. But in a crisis, we don't need perfection. We don't just need quality; we also need speed. So in an emergency like this, the FDA does have a route to fast-track their approvals. It's a special bureaucratic magic wand called an emergency use authorization, and they use that here. A week after the CDC submits its test for approval, the FDA waves that wand and clears the test for use with patients. And then one more thing has to happen to get this test in shape for patients - the labs have to test drive the test to make sure that the CDC's recipe works in their specific state and local labs, on their equipment. So the public health labs get the CDC test, and their work begins. WROBLEWSKI: So very shortly, the day after the tests started to be delivered, we at APHL and CDC started to receive calls and emails from a few laboratories that had come in on a Saturday and - just not everything was where it should be. DUFFIN: The test that they had been waiting for, once they finally get it, they realize that it's not working the way that it's supposed to be - in some of the labs, at least, not all of them, but a lot of them. WROBLEWSKI: We sort of continue to monitor the situation through the weekend. By early in the week, it becomes clear that this isn't a problem in a single laboratory. So it is probably a problem with the test. DUFFIN: And is this normal? Does this happen or is this unusual? WROBLEWSKI: It's not usual, but it does happen. And it was just very unfortunate timing that it happened as we were preparing for, you know, the coronavirus to come to the U. S. DUFFIN: The United States was already several weeks behind other countries in testing. Now, with this glitchy test, it will be even more time before testing can start in full. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DUFFIN: So it's mid-February, and the public health labs are waiting for the CDC to send their new test. Remember, Germany's test was done within days. The CDC's first test, the glitchy one, that one took a week. But as the labs are waiting for this second test, the new test, a week passes, 10 days pass - still no test. What's the time between decision to remake it and then they get back out to the public health labs? WROBLEWSKI: Yeah. It was about two weeks - 2 1/2 weeks before the labs were able to have a new test. DUFFIN: Within 2 1/2 weeks, the test does finally show up. But in that gap, the public health labs have been doing some contingency planning. With the virus spreading, they don't want to wait because, you know, speed matters in a pandemic. And at this point, only public health labs were allowed to run tests. But, of course, there are a lot more labs in this country. There are also private health labs, labs that are built to scale to do testing en masse. But at that point, private labs were being kept on the sidelines. The FDA had not yet given private labs emergency waivers to start testing, which left the public health labs to test at a scale that they had never faced before, all alone and at that point still without a working test. So the labs decided to do something that, in their history, they have never done before. Kelly sends a letter to the FDA. WROBLEWSKI: That basically asked, during this emergency situation, due to the issues with the kit, can public health laboratories go forward and perform their tests? DUFFIN: Dear FDA, please, please let us make our own tests. Frankly, some of the public health labs had already gone rogue. They'd already started doing their own tests sort of under the radar. And this is something we have all seen lately. As the federal agencies that we normally look to in a moment like this are grappling with this unprecedented situation and not all operating in the way that we need them to, people on the ground are improvising. And it's not just for the reasons that we're all familiar with now, like patients needing tests. Like, you feel sick, you want a test. Your grandma feels sick, you want her to have a test. For the public health labs, they also want to test populations, like, zoom out and scan the country and see the trends in how this thing is spreading, data that helps public officials as they start to make these huge decisions that we've watched them make over the past week or so. Population-wide testing helps public officials prescribe more surgical solutions. Like, maybe they don't have to lock down an entire city, but instead maybe just shut down one hotel or just one school - interventions that could still help slow the virus but with less disruption. But on Feb 26, the first case shows up that no one can trace its origins. Nobody knows where it came from, which means the virus has taken root in America. Shortly after this, the FDA shifts gears. WROBLEWSKI: They issued this new guidance. DUFFIN: The FDA says certain labs - more advanced labs, the ones that can do more complex science - those public health labs can start developing their own tests. They just have to apply for FDA approval within two weeks. And this is new for public health labs. You guys have not done this before? WROBLEWSKI: Yeah. It's new. DUFFIN: Were people - is that exciting, or is that just frustrating, like, we shouldn't have to do this, or how. . . WROBLEWSKI: Well, I think it's exciting. And I think the - ultimately, having more testing available is a new thing. But how is our system going to ensure the quality of the testing and sort of adapt to this new process sort of while we're in the middle of an emergency? DUFFIN: But at this point, it feels like a risk worth taking. So public health labs begin to ramp up - way up. WROBLEWSKI: So in those labs, they are working, really, around the clock. They're hiring new staff, and they're really taking some heroic measures to just make sure they get as much testing done as possible. DUFFIN: But as the labs are toiling away, Kelly says they're also thinking, you know what? We could use some help here. WROBLEWSKI: And CDC is not a commercial manufacturer, right? They're a. . . DUFFIN: Right, right. WROBLEWSKI: . . . Government agency. So I think right now what we're eagerly awaiting is for the large-scale commercial diagnostic manufacturers, for those people that make your cholesterol tests and your flu tests - we would expect them to have testing - tests available to sell to laboratories in hospitals and commercial laboratories. DUFFIN: And as I've spoken with public health leaders, several of them have told me that bringing in the private sector more and faster probably would have really helped. Do you know why it took them so long to do that? WROBLEWSKI: I don't. DUFFIN: OK. Well, I am talking to them this afternoon. I will ask. WROBLEWSKI: Great (laughter). DUFFIN: The FDA was not able to get on the phone that day, understandably. They have a lot going on right now. But in just the last few days, the FDA did finally give some private businesses their first emergency waiver. And to be fair, you know, some of those companies were not even ready to apply for an emergency use authorization until late February, and once they did apply, some of them told me that the FDA granted the authorization within days, not the many months this kind of thing can usually take. But these first emergency waivers for private companies, they were issued just last Friday, March 13 - two weeks after the public health labs had started making their own tests. So not until two and a half months after the virus was first spotted did the capitalism capital of the world let the private sector do what they do best - make stuff for the masses. And for comparison, the United States and South Korea each detected the virus on the same day in January, but South Korea allowed private health care companies to start making tests by the end of January. And as of this recording, South Korea has now tested close to 300,000 people. The United States has tested close to 80,000. But private companies here in America are now ramping up and making tests - lots of them. JOHN GERACE: I mean, we have a 100,000-square-foot manufacturing facility here in Southern California, and that's all we do - is, you know, develop and manufacture molecular diagnostic kits. DUFFIN: That is John Gerace. He's the president of DiaSorin Molecular. He's based in Southern California, but it is an Italian company, so they are painfully aware of how this can spread. And DiaSorin and had been ready to help, actually, for a long time before they got the go-ahead. GERACE: Our R & D scientists in Italy, they had design and assay right - you know, very, very shortly after the outbreak was announced. DUFFIN: Assay - remember the chemical part of the test? GERACE: We are ramping up very quickly. We're implementing multiple shifts, and we plan to have, you know, full - we're ramping up to full production to where, you know, we can satisfy the demands, particularly in the U. S. and in Italy. DUFFIN: And in the past week, the FDA has allowed several other private companies to start helping out with the tests. And actually, in just the last day or so, as we were finalizing this episode, President Trump announced that he will introduce new policies that will relax the FDA approval process even more. And this is the thing about crises. When the world turns into a place that you no longer recognize, all of those rules and big ideals spelled out so meticulously when times were good will probably have to change. I see - because it's just so widespread. It has to just, like - you have to let go a little bit, it sounds like. Everyone in this situation has had to let go a little bit. WROBLEWSKI: Yeah. Everybody has had to let go. That's a great way to describe it. DUFFIN: Seems necessary but a little scary, especially in the moment of crisis. WROBLEWSKI: Yes.

It's Manoush here. A quick note before we get started - the TED Radio Hour team is now working from home. Maybe you are, too, because lots of things in our world are changing, for all of us. But we want you to know that we are working extra hard to keep bringing you great stories and big ideas each week. Some episodes we hope will provide a welcome distraction from the coronavirus and everything going on; others like this one will provide context to our new reality, which, for a lot of us, includes spending a lot of time online. Just so you know, the show may sound a little different in the weeks to come since we're producing it remotely. But our goal is to keep bringing you context, kindness and stories that help you understand this weird world better. So be well, and enjoy the show. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Manoush Zomorodi, and I think I'm a pretty good citizen. I am law abiding. I stop at red lights. I pay my taxes. I try to be nice to my neighbors. You probably do, too. But what rules do we follow when we go online? Well, none. There are no rules, but maybe there should be because what happens on the Internet can have real life repercussions. CLAIRE WARDLE: So this particular example happened towards the end of April 2019. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: That's Claire Wardle. She studies how information spreads online and how tech platforms filter facts from misinformation. She's been researching a recent case related to the polio vaccine in Pakistan. WARDLE: A series of videos emerged in Pakistan, which basically questioned the safety of the polio vaccine. ZOMORODI: One of the videos claimed that kids were dying after getting the vaccine. Another claim - that the vaccine was making us sick. WARDLE: I mean, if you watch the video, it is absolutely clear that it's a fabricated video. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Non-English language spoken). ZOMORODI: It shows a man talking to the camera, and then the camera pans and you see a row of kids laying down one by one on a hospital bed, supposedly after getting the polio vaccine. WARDLE: You see this guy basically saying to these kids on a bed, shh, lie down. ZOMORODI: So clearly, like, coaching them to act a specific way. WARDLE: Exactly. But in an era of social media where we just look at the headlines and we don't watch the clip, just seeing the imagery of the children lying on the bed with a caption that was, like, kids affected by polio vaccine, that was enough. ZOMORODI: So the video started spreading. WARDLE: And, you know, these videos of kind of children fainting in a hospital, they were being shared on Twitter and Facebook and WhatsApp. And then, unfortunately, we saw mainstream media repeat what had happened. (SOUNDBITE OF NEWS MONTAGE)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: (Non-English language spoken). UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: (Non-English language spoken). UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: (Non-English language spoken). WARDLE: And even though some of them said, well, there are reports that we're looking into, it just gave more flames, more oxygen to these rumors. And in three days, we had a terrible situation where thousands of family members were taking their kids to hospitals. The hospitals were overwhelmed. There was a protest and a health clinic was set fire. Three people lost their lives. And as a result, Pakistan had to stop and suspend its polio eradication program. And this all happened in a space of three days. ZOMORODI: Just three days from when the videos first got posted to complete panic. But it's not like that panic came out of the blue. The images played into very real fears that were already out there. WARDLE: Yeah. So some of the most effective disinformation is that which has a kernel of truth. We have to acknowledge that there were concerns in Pakistan, and has been for a long time, around vaccinations. So you also had this sense of, well, maybe there is something to it. And actually, the CIA went into Pakistan before 2011 pretending to be vaccination offices trying to get DNA from bin Laden's family. ZOMORODI: Oh, yeah, that's right. WARDLE: Yeah. So that had created a context where there was concern about the West coming in and vaccinating children. So when you take a case study like this, there are so many elements. But it was kind of like a tinderbox. And then somebody threw the match in, and the fire took off and then oxygen was given by news organizations and by others saying there's something to this. ZOMORODI: Whether it's vaccinations in Pakistan or here in the U. S. , rumors that the coronavirus is a hoax or worries about tampering in elections - misinformation is everywhere. WARDLE: We are just living in a polluted information environment. The problem is is that we as the general public, we're kind of being weaponized because if we didn't share this stuff, we'd be OK. ZOMORODI: And there might be people who are like, well, who cares? People can talk all they want, sticks and stones, but that's not really true, is it? WARDLE: Yeah. So I think one thing that's missing in this conversation is a discussion about harm. Back in the day in our little villages, we were gossiping about each other. That's how humans interact. But back in our villages, it would hit the boundary of the village, and it would stop. Maybe somebody would get on a horse and gallop to the other village, but now, all of that is just on a level that we never could foresee, which is it happens at a speed of light. ZOMORODI: Right. And if people actually had the time to do the research and double check, maybe they wouldn't fall for all this false information. But it feels like things spark so much faster than they ever used to, and we just feel overloaded. WARDLE: So because we're overloaded, as you said, we rely increasingly on heuristics, which are mental shortcuts which help us make sense of credibility. So all these shortcuts, whether it's names or logos, takes us as humans a long way towards believing something, even though if we slow down, we did all the checks. Ninety percent of the rubbish online we could fact-check - anybody on the street could do in, you know, two minutes. The problem is we're not checking. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)WARDLE: We could have this conversation almost any week of this year, and misinformation would be impacting people's health, what they're eating, what they think about climate. On some level, you want to say, oh, it's frivolous, is it - you know, misinformation, whatever, it's always been around. But when you actually study this and you look at this every single day, it is - the magnitude is significant. MANOUSH ZOMORODI, HOST:   Hey, everybody. It's Manoush here.

(SOUNDBITE OF NEWS MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: (Non-English language spoken). UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: (Non-English language spoken). UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: (Non-English language spoken). WARDLE: And even though some of them said, well, there are reports that we're looking into, it just gave more flames, more oxygen to these rumors. And in three days, we had a terrible situation where thousands of family members were taking their kids to hospitals. The hospitals were overwhelmed. There was a protest and a health clinic was set fire. Three people lost their lives. And as a result, Pakistan had to stop and suspend its polio eradication program. And this all happened in a space of three days. ZOMORODI: Just three days from when the videos first got posted to complete panic. But it's not like that panic came out of the blue. The images played into very real fears that were already out there. WARDLE: Yeah. So some of the most effective disinformation is that which has a kernel of truth. We have to acknowledge that there were concerns in Pakistan, and has been for a long time, around vaccinations. So you also had this sense of, well, maybe there is something to it. And actually, the CIA went into Pakistan before 2011 pretending to be vaccination offices trying to get DNA from bin Laden's family. ZOMORODI: Oh, yeah, that's right. WARDLE: Yeah. So that had created a context where there was concern about the West coming in and vaccinating children. So when you take a case study like this, there are so many elements. But it was kind of like a tinderbox. And then somebody threw the match in, and the fire took off and then oxygen was given by news organizations and by others saying there's something to this. ZOMORODI: Whether it's vaccinations in Pakistan or here in the U. S. , rumors that the coronavirus is a hoax or worries about tampering in elections - misinformation is everywhere. WARDLE: We are just living in a polluted information environment. The problem is is that we as the general public, we're kind of being weaponized because if we didn't share this stuff, we'd be OK. ZOMORODI: And there might be people who are like, well, who cares? People can talk all they want, sticks and stones, but that's not really true, is it? WARDLE: Yeah. So I think one thing that's missing in this conversation is a discussion about harm. Back in the day in our little villages, we were gossiping about each other. That's how humans interact. But back in our villages, it would hit the boundary of the village, and it would stop. Maybe somebody would get on a horse and gallop to the other village, but now, all of that is just on a level that we never could foresee, which is it happens at a speed of light. ZOMORODI: Right. And if people actually had the time to do the research and double check, maybe they wouldn't fall for all this false information. But it feels like things spark so much faster than they ever used to, and we just feel overloaded. WARDLE: So because we're overloaded, as you said, we rely increasingly on heuristics, which are mental shortcuts which help us make sense of credibility. So all these shortcuts, whether it's names or logos, takes us as humans a long way towards believing something, even though if we slow down, we did all the checks. Ninety percent of the rubbish online we could fact-check - anybody on the street could do in, you know, two minutes. The problem is we're not checking. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WARDLE: We could have this conversation almost any week of this year, and misinformation would be impacting people's health, what they're eating, what they think about climate. On some level, you want to say, oh, it's frivolous, is it - you know, misinformation, whatever, it's always been around. But when you actually study this and you look at this every single day, it is - the magnitude is significant.", "section": "TED Radio Hour", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.

At this point, you might be feeling a little overwhelmed. Technology is growing fast. Misinformation is spreading quicker, and our digital economy is controlled by tech giants. If you want to shop, you go to Amazon. Social media - head to Facebook or Instagram, which Facebook owns. Searching the Web - you Google it. What's missing in all of this? A choice in the services we use, something one woman is working very hard to change. MARGRETHE VESTAGER: My name is Margrethe Vestager. I am the European commissioner for competition. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: And Margrethe says it's tough to ensure the Internet is safe and fair if the playing field is skewed. VESTAGER: I work with competition law enforcement, making sure that companies don't do cartels. ZOMORODI: By cartels, she means businesses coming together to form monopolies. VESTAGER: You cannot buy yourself a nice cartel. You cannot come together as businesses in secrecy squeezing out your competitors. ZOMORODI: You probably don't know many EU commissioners, but you might know Margrethe as the woman who's been fining tech companies for not following European law. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: Breaking news this morning. It is official. . . VESTAGER: Today, the commission has decided to fine Google. ZOMORODI: In 2018, Margrethe slapped Google with a record fine of $5 billion. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: . . . Five billion dollars. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: . . . Five billion dollars over its Android operating system. VESTAGER: . . . For breaching EU antitrust rules. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #4: It's the largest antitrust penalty ever leveled at a single company. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: The tech giant has 90 days to make changes, or face penalty payments. VESTAGER: . . . Penalty payments. ZOMORODI: She's launched investigations into Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #4: Margrethe Vestager, the EU's competition commissioner and resident dragon slayer. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: She hates the United States perhaps worse than any person I've ever met. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Wow. TRUMP: What she does to our country - she's suing all our companies. You know. . . VESTAGER: The purpose is to ensure competition and innovation for the benefits of European consumers. ZOMORODI: And that, she says, is the key to building an Internet we can trust. VESTAGER: Part of building trust is that you know there is a consequence if someone betrays your trust and do something illegal, something that they shouldn't do. Because if it's without consequence to betray people's trust, well, then trust disappears. And I think that is what is eroding societies and democracies. We need trust to make our society work. ZOMORODI: In just a moment, Margrethe Vestager explains how she's working to build that trust. On the show today - writing new rules for our online lives. I'm Manoush Zomorodi, and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Manoush Zomorodi. And on the show today - ideas about building trust in the internet. We just heard from EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who says the best way to build that trust is to make competition fair. And to do that, Margrethe is looking to the past to the very first time that Europe built a fair marketplace across its borders. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)VESTAGER: Let's go back to 1957 - Europe was destroyed. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: Here's Margrethe on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)VESTAGER: A world war had emerged from Europe. The human suffering was unbelievable and unprecedented. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR: The sound of ruin is silence. The smell of ruin is sick with the scent of dead and dust. VESTAGER: In order to avoid Europe being sort of the cradle (ph) of a third world war, we have to do something radical. We have to work together in a different way. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR: Will there be peace or war? (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)VESTAGER: Representatives from six European countries had come to Rome to sign the treaty that were to create the European Union. And one of the many building blocks was a common European market. Part of the inspiration came from the U. S. because in the U. S. , that was already sort of part of the societal contract for decades by the Sherman Act. So they took the inspiration from antitrust to say, well, you have to be innovative. You have to offer affordable prices, good service, high quality, come up with the latest. So we put a frame around this market to control bad behavior, and within that framework, we say now go compete. Now let the market powers work so that the customers and consumers, they get the best of what a market can offer. ZOMORODI: So how unlikely was it that people would actually come together to agree on this standard set of rules? VESTAGER: Well, I think back then, it was almost a miracle because we have a history of fighting our neighbors. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VESTAGER: Coming together and agreeing, not only on values, but also how you put values into real life, that was a manmade miracle. And here, literally men because it was men who was writing these rules. ZOMORODI: (Laughter). VESTAGER: But the thing is that it worked. Europe has been at peace ever since. ZOMORODI: But the key difference now is that we have a global economy that's driven by big tech companies, right? They have the highest valuations of any corporations. They operate around the world and on the Internet, and governments haven't really placed boundaries on them. So where are we now when we look back at 1957 in terms of applying those ideas? VESTAGER: Well, we still have some way to go, to say it mildly, but the fundamentals are the same. The reason why it was necessary to frame the market in this respect was human nature. And human nature doesn't change with digital technology because it's about greed and fear and power. Of course, we are profoundly challenged to fully grasp a fully digital economy because the dynamics are different from how it was in the old days, 10 years ago - also because we're in the midst sort of of breaking the fiction of the Web as a place of freedom. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VESTAGER: The Web is a very commercial place. It's a place where you also find some of the things that we have long, long time agreed on in the real world that we will not accept, like, you know, handing out bomb recipes, child abuse, incitement to terrorism. So there are temptations, there are conflicts, there are evil things that we'll have to deal with. And I think we are better off and much wiser if we look at the digital part of our society, of our market with the same eyes as we would look at the rest of the world because otherwise, I don't think that we can maintain democracy. ZOMORODI: So with that in mind, as commissioner, what sort of scenarios prompt you to do an investigation? Like, in my head, I'm thinking maybe small businesses who are selling their stuff on Amazon but struggling to compete with Amazon itself. VESTAGER: Exactly. And we do have an Amazon investigation in issues exactly as the one you just described. Because on the one hand side, it is great that small vendors can find a marketplace where they can be helped with shipping and payments and, you know, the things that makes it easy to do e-commerce. On the other hand side, it's not that good if the one who holds the marketplace also takes all the data that comes from your sale. And they have this information from all the vendors, then they themselves becomes an incredible competitor to you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VESTAGER: Because imagine sort of an old-school marketplace where you have people coming in with their different products. You would never accept if the municipality who owned the marketplace had a giant shop where they would sell things that were similar to the products that the vendors who had paid for their stalls in the marketplace that they would sell. And there's a lot of parallels in sort of the real world where we have discussed in depth how we would like things to be and agreed upon it and enforced it over decades. And I think only because we have had this illusion of the Internets and the digital world being special and free and innovative, we have kind of let go of some of the things that were fundamental to us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: So, clearly, small businesses benefit from your work, but what about the big guys? Some of them are kind of trying to beat you to the punch. Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook, for example, has said he wants to be regulated. Please, put framework around our company so we know when we're complying and not complying, he's basically said. Do you think that's just lip service? VESTAGER: Of course, I'm not in Mark Zuckerberg's head, but I think he's right that regulation is needed. But if you want regulation, you would also start with yourself. You would consider your business to say, well, I know it takes time for a regulator to get the legislation right, so I will start with myself to make sure that my fundamental values and the values reflected in the society where I do my business, that they are also reflected in the way I do business. ZOMORODI: Do you think that people are starting to understand that what happens online in the digital space really does affect what happens in the real world, that the two aren't that separate? VESTAGER: I think so. I think slowly but surely. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VESTAGER: For me, the important thing is that we live in a world with consequences, that be a digital world or a physical world or when the two things they kind of melt together as they do now. Just as there's no such thing as a free lunch, I'd say there's no such thing as a paradise without a snake. ZOMORODI: That's EU Commissioner Margrethe Vestager. You can find her full talk at ted. com. MANOUSH ZOMORODI, HOST:   OK. At this point, you might be feeling a little overwhelmed. Technology is growing fast.

MANOUSH ZOMORODI, HOST:  This is Zeynep Tufekci. She's a sociologist who studies the ways technology impacts society, which today is, like, every possible way. TUFEKCI: With the technology now, we have the infrastructure that can monetize, like, little snippets of our attention to try to grab it. Like, you know, your phone, it's almost like this Darwinian competition where all the apps are like, me, me, me, look at me, look at me, and they're all doing whatever they can to say, you know, turn on my notification. And if you turn them on, they're like, look at me, look at me, click on me, click on me because they make money by grabbing your attention and selling it to people or grabbing your attention and then recording your information. ZOMORODI: Search online, like a photo, share a link - the stuff we do all day every day tells tech companies about our habits, our interests, our location, age, gender. TUFEKCI: And if you have that much information on people, that information is going to be misused. Governments are going to go after it. It's going to be stolen and hacked. It's going to be used to blackmail people. It's going to be - rob people of their privacy. I mean, the idea that you can collect that much information on billions of people and not have it end up highly consequential in a negative way, that's just not true. The existence of that information is like radioactive waste. You have to do something with it. You have to not have it, ideally. ZOMORODI: But data collection is how the web as we know it functions. It runs all our platforms and apps, and it's how tech companies make money. All that data collection, though, has also set up society for a whole host of issues. TUFEKCI: The gig economy is a great example. ZOMORODI: The gig economy, where companies use big data to decide wages and schedules. TUFEKCI: Make Zeynep work from 10 to 3, 5 to 7. ZOMORODI: Which is convenient for some. TUFEKCI: You know, clean up 11 to 12 o'clock. ZOMORODI: But for others, it's. . . TUFEKCI: A brutal schedule. ZOMORODI: Yeah, it kind of is. TUFEKCI: It's terrible. ZOMORODI: And then there are the algorithms, which decide, like, who gets insurance. TUFEKCI: Where you're going to get hired. ZOMORODI: Who gets a mortgage. TUFEKCI: So they're making decisions. ZOMORODI: Important decisions, but we don't know how they work. TUFEKCI: Right. Algorithms that are being used for gatekeeping, that's a huge problem. ZOMORODI: And, of course, there's mass surveillance. TUFEKCI: Not just online, increasingly with sensors in the offline world. There are cameras everywhere. They're being linked to facial recognition systems. ZOMORODI: And to some degree, we know all this, but we also know that we depend on these platforms. And we don't feel like we have much of a choice but to use them. I mean, I feel like we could go on and on with the issues, but the way that you have summed it up is to say that combined altogether, we're creating a low-trust society. What does that mean? TUFEKCI: So we haven't built institutions of trust and verification into the digital infrastructure. What you have is basically, like, word of mouth and kind of your gut feeling and mostly frustration. So imagine a world in which instead of having food safety managed by government and companies and mandated - right? - we just throw you into a supermarket and say, hope you have a good chemistry lab in your basement. ZOMORODI: (Laughter). TUFEKCI: Hope you can tell if there's E. coli in your salad or if there's salmonella in your eggs. We don't do that, but that's exactly how we are doing things online. We throw people into the online world and we're like, buyer beware, hope you can figure out what's fake and what's real and what's misinformation and what's phishing and what's stealing your information. And good luck. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)TUFEKCI: So what can we do? This needs to change. ZOMORODI: In 2017, Zeynep Tufekci gave a TED talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)TUFEKCI: Now, I can't offer a simple recipe because we need to restructure the whole way our digital technology operates. ZOMORODI: I was in the audience that day, and actually I gave a talk at that same TED conference on how technology is changing the human experience. It's what I've been reporting on for the last decade. And at the time, there were some people who thought that Zeynep and I were being alarmist, but now lots of people are questioning the power of technology to influence everything, from how we spend our time to what we believe. TUFEKCI: This is really a significant transition in human history. It's not the first one. It's probably not the last one, but it's just as significant as almost anything I can think of. ZOMORODI: Our online lives have become our real lives. There's less and less distinction, but who decides what's right or wrong in this vast, virtual space? Can the same laws that govern nations apply to the borderless World Wide Web? Or is it just up to you to navigate this new era in human history? So today on the show - writing the rules for life online, figuring out how we can rebuild trust in the Internet. Many thanks to misinformation expert Claire Wardle and sociologist Zeynep Tufekci. You can find both of their talks at ted. com. You're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Manoush Zomorodi. Stay with us.

TUFEKCI: The gig economy is a great example. ZOMORODI: The gig economy, where companies use big data to decide wages and schedules. TUFEKCI: Make Zeynep work from 10 to 3, 5 to 7. ZOMORODI: Which is convenient for some. TUFEKCI: You know, clean up 11 to 12 o'clock. ZOMORODI: But for others, it's. . . TUFEKCI: A brutal schedule. ZOMORODI: Yeah, it kind of is. TUFEKCI: It's terrible. ZOMORODI: And then there are the algorithms, which decide, like, who gets insurance. TUFEKCI: Where you're going to get hired. ZOMORODI: Who gets a mortgage. TUFEKCI: So they're making decisions. ZOMORODI: Important decisions, but we don't know how they work. TUFEKCI: Right. Algorithms that are being used for gatekeeping, that's a huge problem. ZOMORODI: And, of course, there's mass surveillance. TUFEKCI: Not just online, increasingly with sensors in the offline world. There are cameras everywhere. They're being linked to facial recognition systems. ZOMORODI: And to some degree, we know all this, but we also know that we depend on these platforms. And we don't feel like we have much of a choice but to use them. I mean, I feel like we could go on and on with the issues, but the way that you have summed it up is to say that combined altogether, we're creating a low-trust society. What does that mean? TUFEKCI: So we haven't built institutions of trust and verification into the digital infrastructure. What you have is basically, like, word of mouth and kind of your gut feeling and mostly frustration. So imagine a world in which instead of having food safety managed by government and companies and mandated - right? - we just throw you into a supermarket and say, hope you have a good chemistry lab in your basement. ZOMORODI: (Laughter). TUFEKCI: Hope you can tell if there's E. coli in your salad or if there's salmonella in your eggs. We don't do that, but that's exactly how we are doing things online. We throw people into the online world and we're like, buyer beware, hope you can figure out what's fake and what's real and what's misinformation and what's phishing and what's stealing your information. And good luck. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) TUFEKCI: So what can we do? This needs to change. ZOMORODI: In 2017, Zeynep Tufekci gave a TED talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) TUFEKCI: Now, I can't offer a simple recipe because we need to restructure the whole way our digital technology operates. ZOMORODI: I was in the audience that day, and actually I gave a talk at that same TED conference on how technology is changing the human experience. It's what I've been reporting on for the last decade. And at the time, there were some people who thought that Zeynep and I were being alarmist, but now lots of people are questioning the power of technology to influence everything, from how we spend our time to what we believe. TUFEKCI: This is really a significant transition in human history. It's not the first one. It's probably not the last one, but it's just as significant as almost anything I can think of. ZOMORODI: Our online lives have become our real lives. There's less and less distinction, but who decides what's right or wrong in this vast, virtual space? Can the same laws that govern nations apply to the borderless World Wide Web? Or is it just up to you to navigate this new era in human history? So today on the show - writing the rules for life online, figuring out how we can rebuild trust in the Internet. Many thanks to misinformation expert Claire Wardle and sociologist Zeynep Tufekci.

I mean, the Internet connects us. It educates us, entertains us, saves us time. And even if most of us don't spend our waking hours worried about what happens to our data or how companies compete in the global market, a lot of us are thinking about our personal digital habits, starting with our screen time. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: As a psychologist, what do you tell people who say, man, I just - I can't - I - you know, I love being on Instagram, I want to see what everybody's doing. And, oh, my gosh, the news, there's just so much going on. I can't stop looking at the alerts. What do you tell people? ADAM ALTER: I mean, I think the first question to ask people is how many hours of the day or minutes of the day do you spend where you can reach your phone without moving your feet? ZOMORODI: (Laughter). That's a good question. ALTER: Yeah. And when you ask people this, about 75 to 80% of adults say 24 hours a day. ZOMORODI: Oh, that's a lot. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: This is Adam Alter. He's a professor of marketing and psychology at NYU's Stern School of Business. ALTER: And I'm the author of \"Irresistible. \" And \"Irresistible\" is about how we can't seem to tear ourselves away from our screens. ZOMORODI: By now, we've all heard about how our relationships with our phones can be described as, well, for lack of a better word, codependent. ALTER: I'm lying in my bed. I can reach over to my nightstand. I'm awake. It's on the desk next to me. It's in my pocket. Because it's functionally there all the time, it may as well be a part of our bodies. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: Adam has spent most of the last decade tracking how we're spending more and more time on our screens. ALTER: Now, before the introduction of the iPhone, it was a couple of hours, and that was usually just in front of a TV. We only spent about 18 minutes looking at our phones. Once that device was introduced a few years later, 10 years later actually in 2017, we were spending about three or four hours a day looking at those screens; sometimes for kids, five or six hours a day. Personal time, exercising, hobbies, conversations with friends and loved ones used to be a couple of hours a day. It was now about half an hour or even slightly less than half an hour a day. And that had changed in just a decade. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: And Adam says it's not like all those hours are spent learning a new language or meditating. Big surprise - most of that time is spent on games and social media. ALTER: We spend three times more on average on those apps that I think are a little bit hollow and not especially good for well-being. ZOMORODI: Adam Alter picks up the story from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)ALTER: Now, what's interesting about these apps - dating, social networking, gaming, entertainment, news, web browsing - about half the people, when you interrupt them and say, how do you feel, say they don't feel good about using them. We're spending three times longer on the apps that don't make us happy. That doesn't seem very wise. Now, one of the reasons we spend so much time on these apps that make us unhappy is they rob us of stopping cues. Stopping cues were everywhere in the 20th century. They were baked into everything we did. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ALTER: Think about newspapers. Eventually, you get to the end, you fold the newspaper away, you put it aside; the same with magazines. But the way we consume media today is such that there are no stopping cues. The news feed just rolls on, and everything's bottomless - Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, email, text messaging, the news. And when you do check all sorts of other sources, you can just keep going, on and on and on, on and on and on, on and on and on, on and on and on. ZOMORODI: OK. But it's not exactly that simple. There are plenty of voices in Silicon Valley who would say, hey, you have free will. Be disciplined. ALTER: In practice today, absolutely. That's true. But it's also really that it's not a fair fight because, to be completely frank with you, I don't think they are great products. I just think they are hard to stop using. ZOMORODI: (Laughter). ALTER: The people who are putting together these platforms, either they are very sophisticated psychologists or they hire very sophisticated psychologists or they don't even need psychologists because they have access to so many data points that all they need to do is try 10 different things, throw them all at the wall, see which one sticks the best with the audience and we as consumers have no insight into that. We don't know that that's going on. And because it's happening constantly, all of these platforms are evolving to be kind of weaponized to engage us. And we just don't have the resources to combat that as individuals. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: So when you think about screen time, maybe this is a fantasy, but let's think of Goldilocks, right? She's got the one plate that's too much, the other plate that's too little but then the one that's just right. Is there a just right when it comes to our smartphones, to our time on these digital platforms? ALTER: Yeah. So the first thing I tell people is try to spend the same period every day - maybe make it dinner time to begin because that's easy. We have dinner every day. Make it dinner time and maybe the half hour before and after and say for that period of time every day, I'm going to take my phone and put it in a drawer in a room that's far away or in my bag and put my bag far away so that it's not within physical reach during dinner time. And you're thoughtful about not spending a huge amount of time just scrolling through app after app after app but actually doing something that's engaging, that's enriching, that's good for you, that brings you closer to other people in a meaningful way. I think that's the Goldilocks moment is when you hit the right number, but you're also doing the right things with that time. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ALTER: And what's interesting is people first struggle with that. They find it difficult. They have FOMO. They feel that they're missing out on whatever else they might be doing on their phones. But very quickly, they start to tolerate that experience to being far away from their phones. And often, whether they're alone, whether they're with friends, with family members, no matter what it is, they find that that period of the day as a sort of oasis. It's time away. And they find it very enriching. ZOMORODI: So I'm going to make an admission here, which is that there have been moments - my kids are older now, but there were moments when somebody was having a tantrum - not me. And I have indeed handed over my phone to subdue a child. I don't feel proud about it. But, you know, at the end of the day, you just have to get through certain situations. ALTER: Absolutely agree. ZOMORODI: So I guess I'm just wondering, do we just have to accept that this is a reality, that screens are with us in our lives and as long as maybe we think carefully, do I need to look at this right now versus, like, I'm just going to do it because I'm kind of feeling lazy or - is that the question that we have to ask ourselves? ALTER: I think the right question is what's the alternative here? What are we missing out on if we're using screens? I think that's a good question because, in the moment, using screens for half an hour on a particular day, it's not going to change the way your brain functions. It's not going to destroy, you know, your attention span, things like that. So it's 2 p. m. on a random Saturday afternoon. Your kids could be playing outside because it's a beautiful day. I think that's a better alternative than using a screen in that moment. In the checkout line, on a plane, there aren't many better alternatives. I think it's probably in general, if those are exceptions, OK to use your screen in those moments. And I think we should give ourselves a bit of a break because, after all, we are human. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)ALTER: So what's the take-home here? You know, screens are miraculous. I've already said that, and I feel that it's true. But the way we use them is a lot like driving down a really fast, long road and you're in a car where the accelerator is mashed to the floor. It's kind of hard to reach the brake pedal. And you've got a choice. You can either glide by past, say, the beautiful ocean scenes and take snaps out the window, and that's the easy thing to do. Or you can go out of your way to move the car to the side of the road, to push that brake pedal, to get out, take off your shoes and socks, take a couple of steps onto the sand, feel what the sand feels like under your feet, walk to the ocean and let the ocean lap at your ankles. (SOUNDBITE OF WAVES CRASHING)ALTER: Your life will be richer and more meaningful because you breathe in that experience and because you've left your phone in the car. Thank you.

I'm Manoush Zomorodi. On the show today - ideas about writing the real-life rules for living online, especially when it comes to protecting our privacy. Hello, Ed? EDWARD SNOWDEN: I can hear you. ZOMORODI: Hey, Ed, it's Manoush in New York. Can you hear me? SNOWDEN: I can. I can hear you well. How are you? ZOMORODI: I'm good. I'm glad to be talking to you again. I interviewed you a couple years ago. . . (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: I'm just kind of curious before we start. Like, what is your life like right now? I read in one interview that you take care to avoid being recognized in public. But nowadays, you said everyone's too busy staring at their phones to give you a second glance. SNOWDEN: (Laughter) Yeah. You know, it's one of those unexpected ironies and, in this case, a welcome one. As you say, no one's looking for me other than the CIA. In day-to-day life, people don't recognize me because they're not paying attention. ZOMORODI: This is Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor who leaked confidential information about government surveillance programs in 2013. He spoke to us over video chat from his home in Moscow where he was given asylum after he spoke out about those programs. SNOWDEN: I came to understand that this was not only a violation of the laws as written in the United States, which, by the way, federal courts have since agreed with, but more fundamentally, the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. This was a fundamental violation of the right to privacy, not just for every American but everyone around the world. ZOMORODI: But since those leaks, Edward hasn't just spoken out about government overreach but also about what's being called surveillance capitalism - basically the access that the tech giants like Facebook and Google have to your personal information. SNOWDEN: And the companies go, look, it's fine for us. The government is restrained by the Fourth Amendment but the Fourth Amendment only restricts the government - right? - the state government, the federal government. It doesn't bind private companies. Why would it be OK for private companies to do something so intrusive, so violative of our basic rights? Now, this is the central point. Are people aware of the extent of the intrusion? Are people aware of what is happening? And is it necessary? Is it something they consented to? And I think for the vast majority of people, the answer is no. ZOMORODI: OK. Walk me through what it looks like, though, for the average person, like, regular people who use these platforms all day long and don't always think about or even know about the repercussions of having their data and information collected. SNOWDEN: That's precisely identifying the correct problem. When Facebook is sort of grinding down your privacy, you don't see it. And although you will feel it, you won't feel it for years. And this is what's really dangerous about the new sort of model of surveillance capitalism. When you sign up for an account, suddenly you get all the cat videos. You get all of the connection. You get all of this wonderful experience. But then, you know, six months on, six years on, you have not seen what happened as these companies have quietly created perfect records of everything you've done, everywhere you've gone, everything you've clicked, everything you've liked, how long you've stayed on a page, you know, when you had to scroll up to reread a section. All of that is captured, and they use this to model ways to influence your behavior to actually shape and manipulate the decisions you make as a human being. And then they sell this capability or rather at least rent this capability. Facebook says they don't sell data, which is absurd because what they're doing is they're collecting all of the data and then they're selling the use of the influence they can derive from this data to the highest bidder, right? And what they're selling is access to your eyeballs. What they're selling is access to your mind. And then they go, well, ok, yes, all of this data is being collected, but it's just data, right? It is fairly benign. But the reality is all of this manipulation and computation of this data is not for its own sake. It's not academic research. The only reason they collect this data - the only reason they care about this at all is because it's data about people. It's you being exploited, and you don't see it happening. If you saw that and you could just tap a little icon that says, yeah, no thanks, I would rather that not happen, everyone in the country would press that button. ZOMORODI: Would they, though? Because I think they're so used to getting what they get when they wake up and they turn on their phone immediately because it's right next to them and the phone tells them exactly where they need to be that day. It gets them in touch with their mom, their dad, all the people in their family. They know - they don't even have to get out of bed to do a business call. It tells them what the weather's going to be. I mean, we have come to depend on all those updates going on all night long while we sleep because they make our waking hours possible. We are living in a connected world where these companies, I think, would say, well, why do you think it's free that you get all that information? And how the heck do you expect it to be so personalized if we don't know you? SNOWDEN: Well, no, this is a great point, and I think it's half correct. There is a presumption underlying in there that these capabilities would not be possible without spying on everyone all the time. And that's simply false. That is entirely a profit-making activity on the point of the companies. And in many cases, this is beyond what's necessary for their essential business purposes. For example, AT&T has been storing all of our movements in the United States - what cell site - they call it CSLI, cell-site location information - for every handset, every customer, everybody who's not even their customer but happens to be connected to one of their towers as they go through traffic. Going back to 2009, they're storing this. They have the last 10 years of your movements, and everyone you know, more or less. And here's the thing - they sell that as a service to law enforcement agencies without a warrant. They don't have to go to court and say, you know, we need a warrant for this particular person at this particular time. They can do it on much lower authorities, like subpoenas and things like that. So what's more - that's just this location information. What about your actual calling records? I will tell you from having worked in intelligence, calling records are a proxy for what's called a person's social graph. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SNOWDEN: This is everyone you know. This is everyone you care about. This is everyone you've just interacted with. And from the frequency of calls, you can tell who matters the most to this person or who they talk to the most frequently. When you combine this with location information, you can go, well, who's sleeping with this person? Who goes to the same home that they go to, right? Who travels with them? Where do their - where are their children and, you know, all of these things based on what we call co-traveler tracking, right? When you see phones moving in tandem from cell site to cell site throughout the day, you can infer all of these things. Well, that is a terrifying thing, but that's the state of play today. ZOMORODI: But I think most people listening are like, yeah, that sounds bad, but you know what? I got to be on Google Drive because that's how my company works. And Facebook is the only way I can find out what time my soccer team is meeting for practice. And I've signed up for these things, and, like, I heard - I read somewhere that privacy was dead anyway. And this is the digital era. And I guess, like, what I've struggled to explain to people is, like, just because you don't say you need privacy doesn't mean that somebody else doesn't need it if they are of an ethnic minority or religious minority or sexual orientation or whatever else. But also, like, isn't it human to have thoughts that other people don't know about, to have conversations with yourself? And they can be as rude or mean or unkind or even violent. But the point is, if you don't act on them, that's OK. It's your mind. It's your brain. That's the pure definition of privacy to me. And I really struggle to explain why - what that means to people. They're like, what are you even talking about? SNOWDEN: OK. Well, there were about 12 questions in there. ZOMORODI: Sorry about that. SNOWDEN: (Laughter) So I'm going to try to take. . . ZOMORODI: Yeah, I. . . SNOWDEN: . . . A couple. All of this goes to that central point about the illusion of consent. When people go, look, I have to be connected to, you know, Google Drive or I've got a Gmail account or I need to be registered on LinkedIn to get a job or I need to be on this to file my taxes or I have to be on Facebook because there's a meeting or an event or whatever, this is precisely illustrating the illusion of consent. You cannot consent to something that is not a choice. And many of these technical services are intentionally designed to be monopolies, to exploit what called the network effect, particularly in secure messengers, things like Whatsapp or Facebook itself, which is not secure at all, so that the only way you can talk to someone or the only way you can read this is that you must use this service. And if you must use this or that, if you are reliant on this or that, and there are no effective or equivalent alternatives, then it was never a choice at all. ZOMORODI: Right. And it's that lack of choice that essentially forces us to give up our privacy. SNOWDEN: Yeah. You know, so many people - the - Eric Schmidt, former head of Google, argued that, you know, privacy is dead, that culture's changed, that we don't care about this anymore, that it's not right. And it's exactly as you said. You know, what is privacy really about? What privacy is about is actually power. The political argument that we get here all the time is if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear. And for us to hear that today, to begin with, should just, you know, raise the hairs on the back of our neck a little bit and go, why do we have any rights? What are rights for? If we're in a democracy - right? - a lot of people think, well, the democracy is constituted to represent the will of the majority. And the majority doesn't really need things like privacy protections because the majority decides the things that can and cannot be said. The majority decides literally what is popular, what is unpopular. What's scandalous and what's not, right? So the majority is never really at risk in the same way from violations of privacy. Privacy is not about something to hide. Privacy is about something to protect. And what you are protecting are the differences within society because that's where we get progress from. We get it from the strange idea, the - even heretical idea. Something different that someone says that the rest of us are like, ooh, not sure I am with that, but we protect that space for change. What we're doing is we're protecting the minority against the majority. And that is what every right accomplishes. Freedom of speech, freedom of religion, you know, private property - all of these things are about having something for you. The due process rights - right? - the right to a trial, why - where does that derive from? What does it mean? What is it establishing? It is recognizing that you have a right to your self, which society, the government, the other, the neighbor, whoever, must overcome before they can march you off to prison, right? And this is what the rights are about. They're establishing a baseline fundamental protection. They're intentionally making the life of government and power more difficult to ensure a level of agency for the individual, right? Privacy is the fountainhead from which all other rights derive because it is what says you belong to you. ZOMORODI: So let's say someone listening to this is like, OK, I'm with you. I'm with you on this privacy thing. What's the answer that we need the government, which you say, based on your track record, is untrustworthy, but they're the only answer to creating rules, regulations, laws around these tech companies so that we can begin to trust them again because we've lost trust in them as well? Or is this just - there's - we're talking about, like, two entities that will never actually protect the self because it's not in their interest. It's not their job. SNOWDEN: Yeah. No, this is a great question. This is the big one in a real way. There was always going to be a Mark Zuckerberg, a Jeff Bezos, a Peter Thiel who wants to advantage themselves at the cost of society. There was always going to be an elected leader who goes, you know, I know this is against the law. I know this is likely controversial. And I know if the public knew I was doing this, I would be in a scandal, but maybe we can just hide it. And maybe if nobody hears about it, I can do what I want. And this is the thing that's, again, always going to be causing problems. We are firefighters. I mean the American people, I mean humanity globally. We never pick the problems of our day. We inherit them from the previous generation, and we always have to be working to make them better. And I think that is - in a large way, you ask, you know, whose responsibility is this? Is it governments? Is it companies? Is it the individual? And the answer, sadly, is all of the above. The United States is probably the only advanced democracy in the world that does not have a basic privacy law. We talked before about the Fourth Amendment, right? That's not a basic privacy law. That's a specific prohibition against the government to engage in particular kinds of searches, but it does nothing to protect you from sort of the predatory activities of companies. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SNOWDEN: So, yes, we do need basic regulations, which I don't think is a particularly big ask. And it is only by believing that the government can be better. It is only believing that our industry, that these companies can be better that they will ever get better because they will only ever meet our bare minimum expectations of them. We have to raise our expectations for the centers of power in society if we want to have a fairer society. ZOMORODI: That's Edward Snowden. He wrote a book about his experiences called \"Permanent Record. \" And you can find his appearance on the TED stage at ted. com. MANOUSH ZOMORODI, HOST:   It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Manoush Zomorodi. On the show today - ideas about writing the real-life rules for living online, especially when it comes to protecting our privacy. Hello, Ed? EDWARD SNOWDEN: I can hear you. ZOMORODI: Hey, Ed, it's Manoush in New York. Can you hear me? SNOWDEN: I can. I can hear you well. How are you? ZOMORODI: I'm good. I'm glad to be talking to you again. I interviewed you a couple years ago. . . (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ZOMORODI: I'm just kind of curious before we start. Like, what is your life like right now? I read in one interview that you take care to avoid being recognized in public. But nowadays, you said everyone's too busy staring at their phones to give you a second glance. SNOWDEN: (Laughter) Yeah. You know, it's one of those unexpected ironies and, in this case, a welcome one. As you say, no one's looking for me other than the CIA. In day-to-day life, people don't recognize me because they're not paying attention. ZOMORODI: This is Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor who leaked confidential information about government surveillance programs in 2013. He spoke to us over video chat from his home in Moscow where he was given asylum after he spoke out about those programs. SNOWDEN: I came to understand that this was not only a violation of the laws as written in the United States, which, by the way, federal courts have since agreed with, but more fundamentally, the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. This was a fundamental violation of the right to privacy, not just for every American but everyone around the world. ZOMORODI: But since those leaks, Edward hasn't just spoken out about government overreach but also about what's being called surveillance capitalism - basically the access that the tech giants like Facebook and Google have to your personal information. SNOWDEN: And the companies go, look, it's fine for us. The government is restrained by the Fourth Amendment but the Fourth Amendment only restricts the government - right? - the state government, the federal government. It doesn't bind private companies. Why would it be OK for private companies to do something so intrusive, so violative of our basic rights? Now, this is the central point. Are people aware of the extent of the intrusion? Are people aware of what is happening? And is it necessary? Is it something they consented to? And I think for the vast majority of people, the answer is no. ZOMORODI: OK. Walk me through what it looks like, though, for the average person, like, regular people who use these platforms all day long and don't always think about or even know about the repercussions of having their data and information collected. SNOWDEN: That's precisely identifying the correct problem. When Facebook is sort of grinding down your privacy, you don't see it. And although you will feel it, you won't feel it for years. And this is what's really dangerous about the new sort of model of surveillance capitalism. When you sign up for an account, suddenly you get all the cat videos. You get all of the connection. You get all of this wonderful experience. But then, you know, six months on, six years on, you have not seen what happened as these companies have quietly created perfect records of everything you've done, everywhere you've gone, everything you've clicked, everything you've liked, how long you've stayed on a page, you know, when you had to scroll up to reread a section. All of that is captured, and they use this to model ways to influence your behavior to actually shape and manipulate the decisions you make as a human being. And then they sell this capability or rather at least rent this capability. Facebook says they don't sell data, which is absurd because what they're doing is they're collecting all of the data and then they're selling the use of the influence they can derive from this data to the highest bidder, right? And what they're selling is access to your eyeballs. What they're selling is access to your mind. And then they go, well, ok, yes, all of this data is being collected, but it's just data, right? It is fairly benign. But the reality is all of this manipulation and computation of this data is not for its own sake. It's not academic research. The only reason they collect this data - the only reason they care about this at all is because it's data about people. It's you being exploited, and you don't see it happening. If you saw that and you could just tap a little icon that says, yeah, no thanks, I would rather that not happen, everyone in the country would press that button. ZOMORODI: Would they, though? Because I think they're so used to getting what they get when they wake up and they turn on their phone immediately because it's right next to them and the phone tells them exactly where they need to be that day. It gets them in touch with their mom, their dad, all the people in their family. They know - they don't even have to get out of bed to do a business call. It tells them what the weather's going to be. I mean, we have come to depend on all those updates going on all night long while we sleep because they make our waking hours possible. We are living in a connected world where these companies, I think, would say, well, why do you think it's free that you get all that information? And how the heck do you expect it to be so personalized if we don't know you? SNOWDEN: Well, no, this is a great point, and I think it's half correct. There is a presumption underlying in there that these capabilities would not be possible without spying on everyone all the time. And that's simply false. That is entirely a profit-making activity on the point of the companies. And in many cases, this is beyond what's necessary for their essential business purposes. For example, AT&T has been storing all of our movements in the United States - what cell site - they call it CSLI, cell-site location information - for every handset, every customer, everybody who's not even their customer but happens to be connected to one of their towers as they go through traffic. Going back to 2009, they're storing this. They have the last 10 years of your movements, and everyone you know, more or less.

More people are relying on Facebook for updates on the coronavirus. And the company has made some changes so that when people go to Facebook or Instagram, they first see information from the World Health Organization or other credible sources. The harder challenge, though, is stopping the spread of misleading and harmful posts. I spoke about that with Facebook's vice president of global affairs and communications, Nick Clegg. NICK CLEGG: We do not allow misinformation to circulate on Facebook, which can lead to real-world harm. So if people say drinking bleach is going to help you vaccinate yourself against coronavirus, that is dangerous. It leads to real-world harm. We will not allow that to happen. We won't even allow folk to say social distancing makes no difference in dealing with this pandemic. The thing. . . CHANG: But what's the line? I mean, what is real-world harm? How would you define that? Isn't anything that's false considered harmful to some extent? CLEGG: No. I think things that lead to people being more likely to make themselves vulnerable to and susceptible to catching the virus, that is the real-world harm. CHANG: OK, so it's, like, a physical harm that you're talking about. CLEGG: Yeah, it's a physical harm. But to be absolutely clear, for other forms of information which are misleading or dubious but don't necessarily lead - don't have that knock-on effect of physical harm, we still act on it. We will then refer conspiracy theories, for instance, about the origin of the virus to a network of 55 fact-checking partners that we have. If they then find that the claim is false, we will then downgrade it massively. So it's much, much harder to find on your news feed, firstly. Secondly, we'll put a sort of filter on the screen if you do find it, saying this has been shown by an independent fact-checker to be of, you know, dubious accuracy. And we will link people to more authoritative information about it. And that will apply to people who are trying to share that post or have shared it in the past. CHANG: But it does seem like this could lead to a lot of murky, gray-area decisions. I mean, I'm imagining if your criteria for removal is simply real-world harm - that is physical harm - what do you do about xenophobic posts that, you know, encourage racism against Chinese people, for example? Because people are saying that, you know, that this is the Chinese virus, it's a Chinese disease, racism could eventually lead to real, physical harm against Chinese people. CLEGG: We have long-established policies that any incitement of violence and hatred is not allowed on our platform. On the other hand. . . CHANG: That would be taken down? CLEGG: It's - I'm afraid I'm going to be very reluctant to get into hypothetical examples because as your question rightly identified, of course there is always a fine line - always - between the liberty to say often deeply objectionable things - that's one of the defining qualities of living in a free society. The line between that - and you're quite right to push on this - and material that should be removed, of course is a. . . CHANG: Let me ask you - it sounds like Facebook is doing so much to stop the spread of fake news regarding the coronavirus, but your company took a lot of criticism after the 2016 election for not doing enough to stop misleading political information. So why can't Facebook be just as proactive with political posts? CLEGG: First, what Facebook - and it wasn't just Facebook, of course - the world as a whole - no one really anticipated exactly in that moment that there would have been such a concerted attempt by external forces. . . CHANG: Right, that was then. But given the lessons that we have learned since, would Facebook be more proactive during this 2020 election towards political posts, using the same rigor that Facebook is using to weed out misleading information with regard to the coronavirus? CLEGG: We do, of course, have some limits. You cannot use your freedom as a politician in the United States, for instance, to say things which will lead to real-world harm. But beyond that, in a democracy with an independent press and with the claims and counterclaims that politicians make about each other, we think it's very important that private companies should allow voters for themselves to make their own judgments about what politicians are saying, about the future of their country, whereas when it comes to a medical pandemic, as I say, underpinned by science and by authoritative institutions such as the CDC and the WHO and others, it's, of course, much easier for us to act under the strict expertise and guidance from those institutions themselves. CHANG: Facebook vice president of global affairs and communications Nick Clegg joined us via Skype. Thank you very much. CLEGG: Thank you.

But beyond that, in a democracy with an independent press and with the claims and counterclaims that politicians make about each other, we think it's very important that private companies should allow voters for themselves to make their own judgments about what politicians are saying, about the future of their country, whereas when it comes to a medical pandemic, as I say, underpinned by science and by authoritative institutions such as the CDC and the WHO and others, it's, of course, much easier for us to act under the strict expertise and guidance from those institutions themselves.

There has been lots to adjust to during this whole coronavirus pandemic, wouldn't you say, Ari? ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:  Absolutely. For those of us working from home, we've had to learn how to video conference, for example. CHANG: (Laughter) Yeah, so instead of your workmates looking into your cubicle or your office, they get to see into your bedroom or your home offices or your living rooms. SHAPIRO: So we are here with some remote meeting etiquette tips. First, avoid what one person on the service Zoom did. His computer camera was on but not much else; not one stitch of clothing. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Let's make sure everybody has clothes on. (LAUGHTER)CHANG: Excellent advice; though, there are less exposing mistakes to avoid in group telechats. Some tips from experts now - first, we asked Frank Weishaupt. He's at Owl Labs, which produces tech for video conferences. And he has this tip. FRANK WEISHAUPT: To be respectful to all the people that are going to be on the video call, make sure that you're prepared in advance. Start a few minutes early. Make sure your camera's working, your speakers are working, that the lighting is right and that you have the link ready to go so that you don't have to pay that 10-minute meeting tax to figure out how to get onto the video call and make yourself present. SHAPIRO: Here is another tip from USA Today columnist Steven Petrow. STEVEN PETROW: First up, dress appropriately. And I learned this by making a mistake. The other day, I put on a nice shirt, nice sweater, but I left my gym shorts on. And as I came to sit down in front of my laptop, which was already on, I could see - and so could everyone else - those beautiful gym shorts. Don't do that. CHANG: Zoom also has some tips. For example, they write, if it is a first meeting for the whole group, introduce yourselves because you would do that in a face-to-face meeting, wouldn't you? SHAPIRO: Also, have a work-appropriate background. You probably don't want your dirty laundry or a centerfold on the wall to be your legacy. CHANG: (Laughter) Zoom also says look into the camera when you're talking. It's tempting to look at yourself, but come on. Don't be vain. It's rude. SHAPIRO: And here's Steven Petrow again with one more big common error to avoid. PETROW: And finally, if you need to go to the bathroom - bio break - turn off the video. Turn off the audio because sound is louder than you think. CHANG: Yeah, so don't be like this woman in an online meeting with her colleagues. She decided to take a bathroom break, and she forgot to turn off her camera that was pointed her way. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: What happened? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: I saw nothing. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Oh, my God, Jennifer (ph). UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: What happened? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Nothing, keep going. SHAPIRO: In this moment, I'm glad we are audio-only. CHANG: (Laughter). SHAPIRO: Lesson - business meetings are no place to do your business. AILSA CHANG, HOST:   All right.

The Internet is now the most important part of the 2020 presidential campaign. And until this point, online strategy hasn't been Biden's strong suit. Here's NPR's Asma Khalid. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Joe Biden is a classic retail politician, a man who enjoys shaking hands, giving hugs and taking selfies. But now, because of the coronavirus, he can't do any of those things. Instead, it's virtual fundraisers, livestream speeches and remote TV interviews. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE VIEW\")JOE BIDEN: Well, the irony is, virtual campaigning, I'll probably reach more people than I would out there shaking hands. KHALID: That was Biden earlier this week in an interview with ABC's \"The View. \" The former vice president is not known to bring out the mega-crowds that greet Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump, and so he seems intrigued by the reach of this new campaign style. But quickly scaling up a digital operation can be difficult. Teddy Goff was the digital director for Barack Obama's 2012 reelection campaign. TEDDY GOFF: I think the next however many weeks or months it is are going to be really challenging for every campaign. I also think there's a huge opportunity, you know. Everyone in America is sitting in front of their device all day and all night. KHALID: The challenge, Goff says, is finding the right way to reach voters - figuring out what time people want to tune in and what channel works best. ROB FLAHERTY: The things that will make us successful now are, like, the things that are going to make us successful online in the general. It just means that we need to, like, do them faster (laughter). KHALID: That's Rob Flaherty. He's Biden's digital director. The campaign sees Facebook as a friendly space. But that's also one of Donald Trump's preferred platforms. And the president has millions more followers than Biden. The other complication is that Biden is not yet the Democratic nominee. He does have the largest number of delegates, but Bernie Sanders has not conceded. And, in fact, the Vermont senator has his own robust digital operation. He's seen as a pioneer in the video livestream space. Biden, on the other hand, was a late adopter. Still, it's one thing for a candidate to take his message totally online and another for volunteers and organizers to campaign on the ground when they're physically not allowed to knock on doors. Prior to the outbreak, Paul Ruiz used to hold weekly phone banks for Joe Biden with a bunch of volunteers packed into a room. This past weekend, he organized a remote phone bank through Zoom, a video conferencing platform. PAUL RUIZ: Really, the purpose of the Zoom is to bring everybody together and retain sort of the social element of campaigns. I mean, campaigns are very much social activities for a lot of people. KHALID: Ruiz admits that calling voters while on a video conference is awkward. So his phone bank was less about the actual work of dialing numbers and more about creating camaraderie between volunteers. Plus, he says, the tools already exist for a volunteer to dial or text voters from their own homes. RUIZ: There is a increasing virtualization of campaigns that I think has blunted the impact of the pandemic issue. KHALID: But even as modern campaigns have moved online in recent years, Ruiz says there's one essential ingredient in the campaign that has not changed. It's that physical, in-person aspect of campaigning. RUIZ: There really is something to be said about getting together as a group and, for example, marching in a parade or knocking on doors with somebody. KHALID: Ruiz says that kind of in-person engagement really connects with voters. But since that's not possible, Biden just announced an alternative way of connecting with people.

S. state has closed at least some schools to fight the coronavirus, and some are saying they plan to be closed for the rest of the school year. Millions of educators and parents are improvising to teach students remotely as best they can. Florida is one of the states that's been singled out by the vice president as doing an exceptional job, but as NPR's Anya Kamenetz reports, they can't yet reach every child. ROBIN NELSON: You can see me, but I can't see you. All I get to see is your little picture on your ID card. So how's your weekend? ANYA KAMENETZ, BYLINE: Robin Nelson teaches first grade in Jacksonville, Fla. Her district had just three days last week to retrain 8,000 teachers and have them create remote learning plans. Here she is chatting with her student Sadie Hernandez over an iPad. NELSON: Are you ready to do this online stuff? SADIE HERNANDEZ: Yeah. NELSON: Yeah. It's kind of scary, isn't it? SADIE: Kind of. NELSON: Kind of. But it's iReady, so we got that. And then we've got WritingCity. And now you know how to meet me in the morning. KAMENETZ: Nelson, a 10-year veteran teacher, says for remote lessons, teachers at her school are building off the learning software that students were already using, like iReady for math and reading. NELSON: We are working with some of the computer programs that the kids worked on during some of their school time anyway, so they're familiar with the format. They're familiar with how to use the log-ons and that kind of stuff. KAMENETZ: Nelson's school, Ortega Elementary, is small and tight-knit. She calls her students my babies, and she misses them. NELSON: I had one little girl and her family that live in the neighborhood drive by, and she left little, you know, love notes and pictures on my doorstep. And, you know, so yeah, that's the heartbreaking part. KAMENETZ: Why? NELSON: Well, 'cause I can't see my kids. Sorry. KAMENETZ: You really miss them, don't you? NELSON: I do. It's - you're not a teacher if you can't be with your kids. Computers are not kids. They're not your teacher. KAMENETZ: There's something else on her mind. Nelson teaches in a high-poverty school, and she estimates only about half of her class actually has a computer at home to work on right now. Others may be borrowing a parent's phone at best. Students without technology access are getting paper homework packets. The district is lending out laptops and mobile hot spot devices, but the high school and middle school students are taking priority for now. Paula Renfro, chief academic officer of the Duval County schools, says they're doing everything they can to reach students who can't connect online yet. PAULA RENFRO: We are contacting families through email, telephone each day for those students so that we are connected to them even though it might not be the computer right now to support them. KAMENETZ: Nelson is worried about many of her students being able to keep up. NELSON: You have particular kids that you feel like you're really going to try to make an effort to reach because they really are going to fall behind otherwise. KAMENETZ: Otherwise. NELSON: I do a monthly tutoring for those kids, and I go out to the communities that are in their housing complex. You know, we do different things. And I don't - I'm not allowed to do that. JUSTIN REICH: We sometimes talk about the transition from face-to-face learning to online learning as having an online penalty. KAMENETZ: Justin Reich researches online learning at MIT. He says the research shows online learning comes with an inherent penalty that hurts disadvantaged students the most. Not only are they less likely to have devices or high-speed internet. They're also less likely to have families with the time and energy to coach them along. REICH: All of the students who we're most worried about in the upcoming pandemic - the students whose parents are most likely to lose their jobs, to be gig workers who are negatively affected, to have inadequate access to health care - those are all the students that we would predict in advance would struggle most in the transition to online learning. KAMENETZ: Just over half of the nation's public school children are low-income, and many still lack broadband Internet access at home. Because of these inherent inequities, some researchers like Reich are advocating that public schools focus on making up lost learning when things get back to normal through summer school and other remediation. That, of course, would take money. But so far, the federal Education Department has encouraged schools closing due to coronavirus to pursue distance learning with, quote, \"creativity\" and, quote, \"flexibility\" even if they can't reach every student. Still, there are some things even the best technology can't do. Robin Nelson has come up with a way to hug her students over a computer screen. NELSON: I tell them it's from me, and they can hug themselves. And, you know, they can squeeze as hard as they want to. KAMENETZ: Anya Kamenetz, NPR News. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:   Every U.

And the other things I do are side hustles. BOND: Business was booming until the pandemic. BELL: Last year, I had approximately 90% occupancy. Ninety percent of the days were occupied. In March, I've had zero. BOND: Bell is one of millions of people in the gig economy whose livelihoods have been abruptly upended by the coronavirus. Emily Kuckelman (ph) has been driving for Uber in Denver since 2016. She's a full-time student and uses the platform to supplement her income from an internship. But now she's stopped driving because she's worried about spreading the virus. EMILY KUCKELMAN: My goal was, like, $500 a week. So I'm out, yeah, about - what? - $2,000 a month right now. BOND: Many people these days are like Bell and Kuckelman, cobbling together several sources of income to get by. But like other self-employed people, gig workers normally are not eligible for unemployment insurance if they lose those income streams. Veena Dubal is a labor law expert at the University of California, Hastings. VEENA DUBAL: The platform companies have maintained that these individual drivers, grocery delivery people are small businesses in and of themselves. And so the companies themselves have refused to pay into the unemployment insurance fund. BOND: Now gig workers may be getting some help. The economic relief package passed by the Senate on Wednesday allows self-employed people to apply for unemployment benefits that they normally wouldn't qualify for. Labor experts say the government needs to give guidance on whether workers can claim partial benefits if they have several jobs and lose one of them or if their hours are cut. Some states allow that. The package also lets some of the self-employed access disaster loans for small businesses. Lee Thomas (ph) is an Airbnb host in Queens near JFK Airport. His bookings have dried up as travel has come to a standstill. LEE THOMAS: We are suffering cancellations. The government should take into consideration that these are hard-working people that suffered from nothing of their own doing. BOND: Ed Bell, the San Francisco Airbnb host, is hoping for an interest-free loan to keep them afloat this year. Most of all, he says, he needs help quickly. BELL: I need money in my pocket and with the least amount of red tape. BOND: The bill means a lot more people will be seeking government assistance in the coming weeks.

BOND: Many people these days are like Bell and Kuckelman, cobbling together several sources of income to get by. But like other self-employed people, gig workers normally are not eligible for unemployment insurance if they lose those income streams. Veena Dubal is a labor law expert at the University of California, Hastings. VEENA DUBAL: The platform companies have maintained that these individual drivers, grocery delivery people are small businesses in and of themselves. And so the companies themselves have refused to pay into the unemployment insurance fund. BOND: Now gig workers may be getting some help. The economic relief package passed by the Senate on Wednesday allows self-employed people to apply for unemployment benefits that they normally wouldn't qualify for. Labor experts say the government needs to give guidance on whether workers can claim partial benefits if they have several jobs and lose one of them or if their hours are cut. Some states allow that. The package also lets some of the self-employed access disaster loans for small businesses. Lee Thomas (ph) is an Airbnb host in Queens near JFK Airport. His bookings have dried up as travel has come to a standstill. LEE THOMAS: We are suffering cancellations. The government should take into consideration that these are hard-working people that suffered from nothing of their own doing. BOND: Ed Bell, the San Francisco Airbnb host, is hoping for an interest-free loan to keep them afloat this year. Most of all, he says, he needs help quickly. BELL: I need money in my pocket and with the least amount of red tape. BOND: The bill means a lot more people will be seeking government assistance in the coming weeks. And it will take time for them to get help. Shannon Bond, NPR News, San Francisco.

Behind those clicks, of course, are people filling orders and delivering groceries, and some of those workers are walking off the job today. Amazon warehouse workers in New York and Instacart grocery delivery workers across the country say they want more protections for their health and safety and higher pay. NPR's Alina Selyukh is here to tell us more. Hey, Alina. ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE: Hello. KELLY: So what all are these workers asking for? SELYUKH: Well, just for context to begin with, I just want to point out that the reason this is happening is because we're in the situation where it - hourly and gig workers find that their low-paid work has become extremely critical. To your point, they pack, shop, deliver - all those things you named - human food, pet food, medicine. And, in fact, the demand is so massive right now that both Amazon and Instacart and others like them are hiring hundreds of thousands of new workers, and that puts a spotlight on their current workers. Companies have started referring to them as heroes. Amazon has bumped their pay by $2 an hour, but the workers say they don't feel their bosses are doing enough to keep them safe. KELLY: All right. So these are workers from, we said, Amazon and some from Instacart. Start with Amazon. What exactly are their concerns? SELYUKH: Right. So one warehouse in question is in Staten Island. It's a borough in New York, which is now the epicenter of the outbreak in the U. S. , but it's also a huge market for Amazon. Amazon has acknowledged that at least two workers there have tested positive for the coronavirus. The company says it's consulted with health officials, overall decided to keep the warehouse open after taking what it says are extreme measures for safety and cleanliness. But the workers there want the warehouse closed for a long time for deep cleaning while also getting paid. I spoke with one worker there, Terrell Worm, who says he left the warehouse an hour after he found out about the first case. TERRELL WORM: I touch over 2,000 different items every day I work there. I have to get products out of the shelf and put them in bins. Like, two-, 3,000 items every day is being touched by one person, and I'm not wearing any protection there. Like, I'm going in there without anything. SELYUKH: He does confirm that Amazon has, in fact, started checking temperature when workers arrive at the office, and they have been adding sanitizer stations and pushing tables further apart in the cafeteria, doing some measures to help workers. KELLY: Meanwhile, what are the demands of the workers at Instacart, which is a little bit of a different situation, right? SELYUKH: Exactly. We're talking about contract workers who get paid to deliver grocery orders through an app. They're not employees. They want more access to protective items like disinfectants. They want higher pay for the risks they're taking, like an extra $5 per order. My colleague Shannon Bond spoke this weekend with one gig delivery worker, April McGhee from California, who says despite a crush of orders, the company itself is not paying more. APRIL MCGHEE: There is a lot of work, and the pay has not gone up. I open the app sometimes, and I see $10, $10. And they want me to drive literally 15 miles to the opposite side of town. It's a $10 gig for risking my life, and it's insulting. SELYUKH: Instacart is now saying it will distribute hand sanitizer to more workers, make other changes. But it did not address paid sick leave for its contractors. KELLY: Stay for a second, Alina, with that issue - paid sick leave - because it sounds like both Amazon and Instacart workers are asking for that. What does that look like? What are the options? SELYUKH: Indeed, this is the heart, to me, of the frustration faced by low-wage workers across the board. It's Amazon, Instacart, Walmart, McDonald's. Workers have been saying they wish their companies gave them more generous paid sick leave. Since the pandemic, most companies have expanded access. Usually, it's two weeks paid but only if you officially test positive for the coronavirus or if the company confirms you were in contact with someone else who did. So in essence, it all hinges on folks getting tested and diagnosed, which has been difficult for a lot of people. KELLY: And just briefly, Alina, what about workers who have pre-existing conditions? SELYUKH: Exactly - or those living with elderly grandparents. There are a lot of concerns for them going into the office and - or into their workplace and hanging out with other folks at a time when the rest of the country is asked to stay away. And, you know, companies are offering unpaid leave. Amazon has extended unpaid leave that's unlimited. But a lot of people say they cannot afford to take even a few days of being unpaid. KELLY: NPR's Alina Selyukh. Thanks, Alina. SELYUKH: Thank you. KELLY: And we should note Amazon is one of NPR's financial sponsors.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KAREN DUFFIN, HOST: Todd, how much time do you have? Let me ask that first. TODD OLSON: I've been working till about 10:00, 11:00 at night so you might just have to make me work till midnight. KENNY MALONE, HOST: Todd Olson is CEO of Twin City Die Castings Company. They make metal parts for other companies that make things. DUFFIN: Twin City is a 100-year-old employee-owned company. They've got a few factories, a couple hundred employees. And Todd says about 50 to 60% of their business comes from automotive companies. MALONE: So if I get in my car, like, what parts came from your place? OLSON: Yeah, we don't have a lot of real sexy parts a lot of times, but we've got parts in your transmission. We've got - we do a lot of housings for electronics, also do dashboard parts for BMWs. MALONE: Oh, that sounds a little sexier. OLSON: Yeah. Yeah. That's a little more fun for you. DUFFIN: Yeah. MALONE: Yeah. DUFFIN: But about two weeks ago, Ford and GM announced that they were stopping car production altogether. So a huge chunk of Todd's business was about to dry up. OLSON: So last Thursday, we're meeting remotely over the phone once a day, having a senior management call, and a lot of discussion going there isn't real fun. It's, you know, what do we do if the company goes the other way from growing here because of the COVID-19 crisis? And what employees are safe? Is anybody sick? Who's showing up for work? MALONE: Towards the end of that meeting, Todd says, the president of his company says, hey, Todd, I just got some news. OLSON: Said, I think - I've been talking with Ventec today, and it looks like we might be getting a purchase order tomorrow. DUFFIN: Ventec is a medical device company near Seattle. They're known for this sort of multipurpose machine that is, first and foremost, a ventilator. And Ventec was looking for parts, including a piece that Todd has a lot of experience with - pistons. OLSON: So just like in an automobile, it's a piston, but it's much smaller. Yep. You're signaling the right size there. MALONE: Yeah. I'm trying to make it with my fingers, so I'm making, like, I don't know, like, an inch or something. OLSON: Correct. Yeah. It's about that. MALONE: A ventilator, fundamentally, is a machine that helps people breathe - move air in and out of the lungs. Ventec's specialized ventilator uses a piston in its oxygen system, and so Todd is thinking, well, we know how to make that part. OLSON: All right. Great. Boy, we kind of need a little bit of that good news, and so we're fairly happy. DUFFIN: That order was for just 150 of those teeny pistons a month, so kind of a small order. But Todd had been reading the coronavirus news like the rest of us, so he suspected that Ventec might be needing more ventilator parts very soon. MALONE: Todd had no idea his small company in Minnesota had just been drafted into a manufacturing effort the likes of which we have not seen since World War II. DUFFIN: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Karen Duffin. MALONE: And I'm Kenny Malone. America needs ventilators, possibly hundreds of thousands of new ones in the next few months. Today on the show, we take you inside the scramble to make more ventilators fast. From the frantic emails to the supply chain nightmares to the maxed out assembly lines, all across the world, factories are trying to turn on a dime with hundreds of thousands of lives at stake. DUFFIN: The world is at this strange moment where there is a direct connection between life and death and the ability of a small auto parts company in Minnesota to churn out pistons small enough to fit in the palm of your hand. MALONE: The story of how Todd Olson's company got drafted into this worldwide mission to do their little part to make those little pistons begins in Seattle, where the coronavirus outbreak started in the United States. DUFFIN: Seattle is where Dr. Nick Mark works in an ICU and where he spends a lot of time thinking about breath, about breathing, a lot of time thinking about lungs. NICK MARK: I'm a board-certified pulmonologist, so being asked to wax poetic about the lungs is like a dream come true. MALONE: Nick is an ICU doctor, and the poetry of the lungs, as Nick tells it, is this - lungs are these exquisite machines, containers of air that just kind of blow life-giving oxygen into the blood through a thin wall, a membrane. MARK: And what's so elegant about it is that that membrane is so thin and delicate. DUFFIN: And it's this thinness of our lung walls that lets them expand and contract and pass oxygen so smoothly. It's why breathing is so easy. MALONE: But it was also that membrane that had Nick worried when he first heard about COVID-19 back in January, because what COVID-19 does is inflame that membrane. It makes our thin, delicate lung walls very thick. MARK: Suddenly, the lung gets really stiff. And instead of it being really easy to get enough oxygen in, now, suddenly, it requires tremendous work to do it. DUFFIN: This is why some COVID-19 patients need a machine to breathe for them. They need a ventilator. This is also why Dr. Nick Mark's ICU, which normally has beds and ventilators to spare, is packed right now. MARK: Not everybody who has COVID is going to need a ventilator. But for the people who do, there really isn't an alternative. And if there aren't enough ventilators, some of those people are going to die. MALONE: Demand for ventilators is rising in places like Dr. Nick Mark's hospital. As for supply, there aren't that many companies that make ventilators. One of them happens to be just 10 miles down the road from Dr. Mark's hospital. It's the company that contracted Todd to make those little pistons, a company called Ventec. CHRIS KIPLE: We were getting these phone calls from ministers of health, presidents of countries, all looking for ventilators. And the orders started coming in for 50, a hundred. And then people were seeking thousands. DUFFIN: Chris Kiple is the CEO of Ventec. And for the last few months, he has been fielding these heartbreaking calls from doctors and hospitals and dignitaries around the world. MALONE: But, he says, when COVID showed up in Seattle - like, you know, when the hospital 10 minutes away started to fill up with patients - this is when it got even more real. It was around this time that his own governor's office reached out. They called his cellphone, his office. They emailed. KIPLE: All within two minutes, saying urgent, urgent, urgent, need to talk about ventilators - trying to learn as much about ventilators as possible and what the true problems were with the ventilator supply in the world. Why is it difficult to get a ventilator all of a sudden? MALONE: Now, at its most basic, a ventilator is just a machine that pushes air into people's lungs and helps pull it out. In fact, the first mechanical ventilator was just a bag and a face mask invented in the 1700s. You manually squeeze the bag of air. That helped the person breathe. DUFFIN: Today's ventilators can be complex machines that often can automatically sense and figure out how to mix just the right blend of room air and oxygen in just the right amounts with just the right pressure, all of which is a different and very precise amount for each individual patient. MALONE: So to make an additional ventilator, you don't just need another bag and another mask. You may need flow sensors and pressure transducers, exhalation valves, mixing valves, circuits and resistors, and in the case of Ventec's machine, little metal pistons. KIPLE: It's easy to create a pump. But we're trying to ventilate lungs. We're trying to deliver really precise airflow to the patient. So if that part is off by thousandths of an inch, you're opening up a leak. And that leak can prevent our device from delivering precision air. . . MALONE: Oh, my God. KIPLE: . . . To the patient. DUFFIN: Which is an engineer-y (ph) way of saying, if the pistons are even the slightest bit off, it is not good. And the pistons are just one part of Ventec's machine. KIPLE: Our device has about 700 components, the majority of which are custom designed to our device. We source from about 80 different suppliers from around the world. MALONE: That sounds really complicated, and it is. But the simplest way for the world to get more ventilators is for existing companies like Ventec to max out production - pay overtime, hire extra workers and run the factory 24/7. They already know how to make ventilators and already have FDA approval. DUFFIN: The problem with that strategy is that there is a ceiling to it because Ventec is set up to make around 200 ventilators a month normally. And Chris says, you know, maybe they could get that up to a thousand a month. But even that, five times their normal capacity, that won't even be close to enough. KIPLE: To get to more than 4 or 5x, you are past the limits of your facility, past the limits of your suppliers. At that point in time, you've got to say, we've got to think about this production completely differently to save lives because this pandemic is so significant. We have to find a different way. DUFFIN: One different way is something you've maybe heard about, the Defense Production Act - the DPA. And what this does is allow the federal government to become, essentially, a pandemic project manager. It lets the feds boss the private sector around, tells companies up and down the supply chain what to make, how much it will cost and just direct supplies to where they're needed most. MALONE: But back when Chris is starting to think about ramping up in a huge way, the DPA had not been invoked yet. So this other different way started to happen organically - it was unlikely matchmaking between, let's say, a smallish ventilator-maker in Seattle and one of the largest car companies in the world. DUFFIN: Ventec, meet GM - General Motors. GM, meet Ventec. The two companies formed a partnership. KIPLE: If you had asked me at that moment in time if it was possible for a medical device company to work with an auto manufacturer, I would've said, no. MALONE: But what Chris sees quickly is that GM is not so much an auto fabricating company as much as it is a massive supply chain management marvel. And Chris suddenly has this global supply chain of his dreams at his disposal. KIPLE: We told them we were having problems with a manufacturer in India. They had people on the ground that night at that manufacturing location in India helping us get some of our supply lines up and running and moving forward again. MALONE: Chris is like, OK. Well, the other problem is that there are, like, hundreds of parts in our machines. And we're having trouble sourcing them. KIPLE: They literally woke up their entire supply chain team on Saturday morning at 6 a. m. and challenged their 80-member team to source 700 parts from around the world and the United States. MALONE: And in a small tool shop in Minneapolis, Minn. , Todd Olson, piston-maker extraordinaire, hears the call. OLSON: GM put out a mass email to anybody in our industry that they've worked with that Project V needs die castings. And. . . MALONE: Project V. They were calling it Project V? OLSON: Project V, that's right. Yep. Ventilator. MALONE: If it's supposed to be a secret, it's not a good secret nickname. DUFFIN: (Laughter). OLSON: Yeah. That's right. Well, you got to have a project name. It makes you feel like James Bond or something. DUFFIN: (Laughter). MALONE: That's definitely true. DUFFIN: Project V, Todd learned, was the name for GM's plan to help Ventec make more ventilators than humanly possible. MALONE: So Todd had originally thought he was just dealing with Ventec, you know, to make a handful of parts, including those 150 little metal pistons. But now that GM was involved, Todd's president comes and finds him and says, this plan is changing fast. OLSON: He goes, just got off the phone with General Motors. And they're talking about 20,000 of these a month instead of 150 (laughter). MALONE: Twenty thousand instead of 150? OLSON: Hundred and fifty. Yeah. So, yeah, a much different scale than we ever imagined. And normally, this would take about 12 weeks for us to get into production. And we were directed that it's not going to be 12 weeks. It's going to be as fast as you can possibly do it. MALONE: What goes through your mind? OLSON: We better make this happen. DUFFIN: The thing about this scramble to make more ventilators is that some version of this conversation that Todd was just having was also happening maybe hundreds of other times for every single part in the ventilator supply chain. And some of the parts will be easier to get, some of them will be harder. But if the scale-up for any single one of those parts falls behind, it will hold up the entire effort to build more ventilators to save people's lives. MALONE: Here's what it took for Todd's company to scale up just one of the hundreds of parts, the teeny pistons. What Todd's company does, die casting, is essentially pouring molten aluminum into a custom mold. So before he can even make a single piston, his company has to call up a different company to make that mold. DUFFIN: And this is a serious varsity mold. It's got to be made of steel, weighing almost 2 tons. But it also has to be so precise that every single piston is accurate to the micron. And it will cost more than $100,000. MALONE: Todd got that General Motors order two Fridays ago. He immediately jumps on the phone with one of his most trusted mold makers. OLSON: A company out in Grand Rapids, Mich. , called Die-Tech Engineering. And they came back and said, we can probably do it a lot faster than you think. DUFFIN: Because everyone there also knows that this is a life-or-death mold. They are all part of making ventilators in this crisis, so it's all hands on deck. The Michigan company pulls in all of its engineers, runs their shop around the clock all weekend long. MALONE: And then Todd pulls in all of his engineers, even the ones who are now managers - not anymore. You're an engineer again. Get on the phone with Michigan. DUFFIN: Meanwhile, other engineers are running computer simulations of how this mold will work in practice. You have to figure out the optimal speed for the molten aluminum - too slow and the mold doesn't fill, too fast and the piece has bubbles. MALONE: All of this is months' worth of man hours condensed into a single long weekend. In fact, this interview you are hearing with Todd, this was conducted just three days after he made that call to Michigan. And while we were talking, Todd kept checking his computer for updates on this thing being made 600 miles away in Grand Rapids. OLSON: So I - yeah. I just received pictures right now of them loading the tooling up into one of their company vehicles. And one of their. . . MALONE: Like, right now while we're talking, you got that picture? OLSON: Right now, when we're talking. They're probably somewhere around Gary, Ind. , now. I'm not sure. (Laughter) But they're on the road coming to us. So I'm going to turn this. . . MALONE: Yeah, please. OLSON: . . . Towards. . . DUFFIN: OK. OLSON: Let's see here. Can you see what a die looks like? MALONE: Oh, yeah. DUFFIN: OK. OLSON: So there's six pistons in each die. MALONE: It's like a giant waffle iron. OLSON: Yeah. And the waffle batter is about 1,300 degrees. (LAUGHTER)OLSON: Yeah. And so we will have that in our die cast machine early tomorrow morning. I plan on being in our plant early tomorrow because I want to see these historic first parts out there. MALONE: Yeah. DUFFIN: Yeah. MALONE: Is there any universe in which we could kind of be there telephonically when that first part is made? OLSON: I bet I - I bet you we can do that. Sure. I'll make that happen for us. How's that sound? MALONE: That would be incredible. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)DUFFIN: For Ventec and GM to change course as quickly as possible, they need hundreds of Todd Olsons to also simultaneously change course as quickly as possible. MALONE: After the break, we hear from that one Todd Olson from the factory floor. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)DUFFIN: At 8:06 in the morning, the day after we first talked to Todd, he FaceTime-ed (ph) us from the factory floor. OLSON: How you doing? MALONE: Yeah. It's pretty loud there. OLSON: Just a little bit - yep. MALONE: You could see Todd walking past all these giant die-cast machines and these guys in hardhats and safety glasses. OLSON: Hey, Greg. Wave. OLSON: All right. Greg's holding a cup of coffee there. OLSON: And Greg Hansen, our president - he's the one that brought Ventec in for us. MALONE: I see a lot of buttons. Like, there's - somebody's pressing a lot of buttons. OLSON: Yes. Exactly. He's our head die-casting engineer. DUFFIN: This is the machine. They've got the new piston mold that was just custom-made and delivered freshly from Michigan loaded up inside of it. There's a group of guys standing back watching the head engineer inject the molten aluminum and then open the mold. OLSON: So there it is. Hey, Ireland (ph). Why don't you show that to me? MALONE: Oh, what is that? OLSON: So those are the first person piston parts for Project V. MALONE: That's. . . OLSON: That is. . . MALONE: So that's it. That's one of the pistons right there. OLSON: Here we go - a part of history right now. I'm going to get out of their way here. They've got some work to do and. . . MALONE: OK. How are you feeling right now? OLSON: I'm feeling awesome. This is pretty cool. We've been in business a hundred years. And this might well be our biggest moment in a hundred years. MALONE: That is quite a statement, Todd. OLSON: Yeah. DUFFIN: And with this, Todd has handed off his part of this global relay race. Todd's pistons will get tested and machined and then sent off to Ventec in Seattle, where this all began and where Chris Kiple, the CEO of Ventec, is eagerly awaiting Todd's pistons. MALONE: So that's just one part. Like, that's just one of 700. How many more are there left to source? OLSON: At this point, we've sourced 100% of our parts. MALONE: A hundred percent. OLSON: It - 100% of our parts for up to 200,000 units. DUFFIN: That's incredible. MALONE: Amazing. OLSON: But to your point, it's not just Ventec. It's not just GM. It's the entire manufacturing base of the United States and the world, everyone coming together to save lives. MALONE: Do you know how long it will be before, like, one of those pistons ends up in a ventilator in a hospital saving somebody's life? OLSON: We plan to be producing ventilators within weeks. It's highly probable that that piston will be responsible for helping save someone's life in April. MALONE: With GM's help, Chris Kiple says that Ventec, a company that's used to making a couple hundred ventilators a month, is now looking at possibly tens of thousands of ventilators a month. It is a staggering number. But it still may not be enough, not to mention that we may not have enough people to run those very complex machines. And if we did, they may not have all of the protective equipment they need. There are a lot of problems to address beyond just making more ventilators. DUFFIN: But as for the supply, this same scramble at Ventec is happening all over the world with all of the other ventilator companies. Also, Ford just announced that they will make 50,000 ventilators in the next hundred days. Tesla said they're going to make some, even Dyson, the vacuum company. Someone in Italy even 3D-printed valves for ventilators. New startups are starting up. Some of them are trying to make simpler ventilators. MALONE: We have no idea if those kinds of projects will come together in time. But what we know is that ventilators are the supply and demand problem of the COVID pandemic. If too many people need ventilators at the same time, people will die. And so one solution, the solution we just spent the entire episode talking about, is increasing ventilator supply. DUFFIN: But you can also reduce demand. And that is at the heart of all of the advice that we are hearing from health officials right now. That is why we are all hopefully staying home and socially distancing. We are collectively reducing demand for ventilators. You sitting on your couch watching Netflix - you are part of the highest stakes possible, supply-and-demand mismatch of our lifetime. MALONE: So go ahead, queue up, you know, eight more episodes of \"Breaking Bad\" or Date Blind - Blind Date - Blind Love. . . DUFFIN: \"Love Is Blind. \"MALONE: Yeah.

This is NPR. Thanks for listening. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: This is PLANET MONEY from NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KAREN DUFFIN, HOST:  Todd, how much time do you have? Let me ask that first. TODD OLSON: I've been working till about 10:00, 11:00 at night so you might just have to make me work till midnight. KENNY MALONE, HOST:  Todd Olson is CEO of Twin City Die Castings Company. They make metal parts for other companies that make things. DUFFIN: Twin City is a 100-year-old employee-owned company. They've got a few factories, a couple hundred employees. And Todd says about 50 to 60% of their business comes from automotive companies. MALONE: So if I get in my car, like, what parts came from your place? OLSON: Yeah, we don't have a lot of real sexy parts a lot of times, but we've got parts in your transmission. We've got - we do a lot of housings for electronics, also do dashboard parts for BMWs. MALONE: Oh, that sounds a little sexier. OLSON: Yeah. Yeah. That's a little more fun for you. DUFFIN: Yeah. MALONE: Yeah. DUFFIN: But about two weeks ago, Ford and GM announced that they were stopping car production altogether. So a huge chunk of Todd's business was about to dry up. OLSON: So last Thursday, we're meeting remotely over the phone once a day, having a senior management call, and a lot of discussion going there isn't real fun. It's, you know, what do we do if the company goes the other way from growing here because of the COVID-19 crisis? And what employees are safe? Is anybody sick? Who's showing up for work? MALONE: Towards the end of that meeting, Todd says, the president of his company says, hey, Todd, I just got some news. OLSON: Said, I think - I've been talking with Ventec today, and it looks like we might be getting a purchase order tomorrow. DUFFIN: Ventec is a medical device company near Seattle. They're known for this sort of multipurpose machine that is, first and foremost, a ventilator. And Ventec was looking for parts, including a piece that Todd has a lot of experience with - pistons. OLSON: So just like in an automobile, it's a piston, but it's much smaller. Yep. You're signaling the right size there. MALONE: Yeah. I'm trying to make it with my fingers, so I'm making, like, I don't know, like, an inch or something. OLSON: Correct. Yeah. It's about that. MALONE: A ventilator, fundamentally, is a machine that helps people breathe - move air in and out of the lungs. Ventec's specialized ventilator uses a piston in its oxygen system, and so Todd is thinking, well, we know how to make that part. OLSON: All right. Great. Boy, we kind of need a little bit of that good news, and so we're fairly happy. DUFFIN: That order was for just 150 of those teeny pistons a month, so kind of a small order. But Todd had been reading the coronavirus news like the rest of us, so he suspected that Ventec might be needing more ventilator parts very soon. MALONE: Todd had no idea his small company in Minnesota had just been drafted into a manufacturing effort the likes of which we have not seen since World War II. DUFFIN: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Karen Duffin. MALONE: And I'm Kenny Malone. America needs ventilators, possibly hundreds of thousands of new ones in the next few months. Today on the show, we take you inside the scramble to make more ventilators fast. From the frantic emails to the supply chain nightmares to the maxed out assembly lines, all across the world, factories are trying to turn on a dime with hundreds of thousands of lives at stake. DUFFIN: The world is at this strange moment where there is a direct connection between life and death and the ability of a small auto parts company in Minnesota to churn out pistons small enough to fit in the palm of your hand. MALONE: The story of how Todd Olson's company got drafted into this worldwide mission to do their little part to make those little pistons begins in Seattle, where the coronavirus outbreak started in the United States. DUFFIN: Seattle is where Dr. Nick Mark works in an ICU and where he spends a lot of time thinking about breath, about breathing, a lot of time thinking about lungs. NICK MARK: I'm a board-certified pulmonologist, so being asked to wax poetic about the lungs is like a dream come true. MALONE: Nick is an ICU doctor, and the poetry of the lungs, as Nick tells it, is this - lungs are these exquisite machines, containers of air that just kind of blow life-giving oxygen into the blood through a thin wall, a membrane. MARK: And what's so elegant about it is that that membrane is so thin and delicate. DUFFIN: And it's this thinness of our lung walls that lets them expand and contract and pass oxygen so smoothly. It's why breathing is so easy. MALONE: But it was also that membrane that had Nick worried when he first heard about COVID-19 back in January, because what COVID-19 does is inflame that membrane. It makes our thin, delicate lung walls very thick. MARK: Suddenly, the lung gets really stiff. And instead of it being really easy to get enough oxygen in, now, suddenly, it requires tremendous work to do it. DUFFIN: This is why some COVID-19 patients need a machine to breathe for them. They need a ventilator. This is also why Dr. Nick Mark's ICU, which normally has beds and ventilators to spare, is packed right now. MARK: Not everybody who has COVID is going to need a ventilator. But for the people who do, there really isn't an alternative. And if there aren't enough ventilators, some of those people are going to die. MALONE: Demand for ventilators is rising in places like Dr. Nick Mark's hospital. As for supply, there aren't that many companies that make ventilators. One of them happens to be just 10 miles down the road from Dr. Mark's hospital. It's the company that contracted Todd to make those little pistons, a company called Ventec. CHRIS KIPLE: We were getting these phone calls from ministers of health, presidents of countries, all looking for ventilators. And the orders started coming in for 50, a hundred. And then people were seeking thousands. DUFFIN: Chris Kiple is the CEO of Ventec. And for the last few months, he has been fielding these heartbreaking calls from doctors and hospitals and dignitaries around the world. MALONE: But, he says, when COVID showed up in Seattle - like, you know, when the hospital 10 minutes away started to fill up with patients - this is when it got even more real. It was around this time that his own governor's office reached out. They called his cellphone, his office. They emailed. KIPLE: All within two minutes, saying urgent, urgent, urgent, need to talk about ventilators - trying to learn as much about ventilators as possible and what the true problems were with the ventilator supply in the world. Why is it difficult to get a ventilator all of a sudden? MALONE: Now, at its most basic, a ventilator is just a machine that pushes air into people's lungs and helps pull it out. In fact, the first mechanical ventilator was just a bag and a face mask invented in the 1700s. You manually squeeze the bag of air. That helped the person breathe. DUFFIN: Today's ventilators can be complex machines that often can automatically sense and figure out how to mix just the right blend of room air and oxygen in just the right amounts with just the right pressure, all of which is a different and very precise amount for each individual patient. MALONE: So to make an additional ventilator, you don't just need another bag and another mask. You may need flow sensors and pressure transducers, exhalation valves, mixing valves, circuits and resistors, and in the case of Ventec's machine, little metal pistons. KIPLE: It's easy to create a pump. But we're trying to ventilate lungs. We're trying to deliver really precise airflow to the patient. So if that part is off by thousandths of an inch, you're opening up a leak. And that leak can prevent our device from delivering precision air. . . MALONE: Oh, my God. KIPLE: . . . To the patient. DUFFIN: Which is an engineer-y (ph) way of saying, if the pistons are even the slightest bit off, it is not good. And the pistons are just one part of Ventec's machine. KIPLE: Our device has about 700 components, the majority of which are custom designed to our device. We source from about 80 different suppliers from around the world. MALONE: That sounds really complicated, and it is. But the simplest way for the world to get more ventilators is for existing companies like Ventec to max out production - pay overtime, hire extra workers and run the factory 24/7. They already know how to make ventilators and already have FDA approval. DUFFIN: The problem with that strategy is that there is a ceiling to it because Ventec is set up to make around 200 ventilators a month normally. And Chris says, you know, maybe they could get that up to a thousand a month. But even that, five times their normal capacity, that won't even be close to enough. KIPLE: To get to more than 4 or 5x, you are past the limits of your facility, past the limits of your suppliers. At that point in time, you've got to say, we've got to think about this production completely differently to save lives because this pandemic is so significant. We have to find a different way. DUFFIN: One different way is something you've maybe heard about, the Defense Production Act - the DPA. And what this does is allow the federal government to become, essentially, a pandemic project manager. It lets the feds boss the private sector around, tells companies up and down the supply chain what to make, how much it will cost and just direct supplies to where they're needed most. MALONE: But back when Chris is starting to think about ramping up in a huge way, the DPA had not been invoked yet. So this other different way started to happen organically - it was unlikely matchmaking between, let's say, a smallish ventilator-maker in Seattle and one of the largest car companies in the world. DUFFIN: Ventec, meet GM - General Motors. GM, meet Ventec. The two companies formed a partnership. KIPLE: If you had asked me at that moment in time if it was possible for a medical device company to work with an auto manufacturer, I would've said, no. MALONE: But what Chris sees quickly is that GM is not so much an auto fabricating company as much as it is a massive supply chain management marvel. And Chris suddenly has this global supply chain of his dreams at his disposal. KIPLE: We told them we were having problems with a manufacturer in India. They had people on the ground that night at that manufacturing location in India helping us get some of our supply lines up and running and moving forward again. MALONE: Chris is like, OK. Well, the other problem is that there are, like, hundreds of parts in our machines. And we're having trouble sourcing them. KIPLE: They literally woke up their entire supply chain team on Saturday morning at 6 a. m. and challenged their 80-member team to source 700 parts from around the world and the United States. MALONE: And in a small tool shop in Minneapolis, Minn. , Todd Olson, piston-maker extraordinaire, hears the call. OLSON: GM put out a mass email to anybody in our industry that they've worked with that Project V needs die castings. And. . . MALONE: Project V. They were calling it Project V? OLSON: Project V, that's right. Yep. Ventilator. MALONE: If it's supposed to be a secret, it's not a good secret nickname. DUFFIN: (Laughter). OLSON: Yeah. That's right. Well, you got to have a project name. It makes you feel like James Bond or something. DUFFIN: (Laughter). MALONE: That's definitely true. DUFFIN: Project V, Todd learned, was the name for GM's plan to help Ventec make more ventilators than humanly possible. MALONE: So Todd had originally thought he was just dealing with Ventec, you know, to make a handful of parts, including those 150 little metal pistons. But now that GM was involved, Todd's president comes and finds him and says, this plan is changing fast. OLSON: He goes, just got off the phone with General Motors. And they're talking about 20,000 of these a month instead of 150 (laughter). MALONE: Twenty thousand instead of 150? OLSON: Hundred and fifty. Yeah. So, yeah, a much different scale than we ever imagined. And normally, this would take about 12 weeks for us to get into production. And we were directed that it's not going to be 12 weeks. It's going to be as fast as you can possibly do it. MALONE: What goes through your mind? OLSON: We better make this happen. DUFFIN: The thing about this scramble to make more ventilators is that some version of this conversation that Todd was just having was also happening maybe hundreds of other times for every single part in the ventilator supply chain. And some of the parts will be easier to get, some of them will be harder.

SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: The tech companies have been saying for years that they want computers to take on more content moderation.

At Facebook, humans are still reviewing the most difficult material, like posts about suicide and self-harm, terrorism and child exploitation. Many moderators are contractors, not full-time employees. But Facebook is shifting that work to employees so contractors can stay home. The platforms are grappling with how to get the critical work of moderation done as the volume of posts they have to review is skyrocketing. Graham Brookie says that's creating pressure. BROOKIE: They are dealing with more information with less staff, which is why you've seen these decisions to move to more automated systems because, frankly, there's not enough people to look at the amount of information that's ongoing. BOND: That includes false information about the pandemic, including bogus cures and harmful fake treatments. The World Health Organization calls the situation an infodemic where too much information, both true and false, makes it hard for people to find sources they can trust. Brookie says that makes the platform's decisions about what people are allowed to say even more important right now. BROOKIE: I think that we should all rely on more moderation rather than less moderation in order to make sure that the vast majority of people are connecting with objective, science-based facts. BOND: Some Facebook users are raising alarms that automated review is already causing problems. When they tried to post links to mainstream news sites like The Atlantic and BuzzFeed, they got notifications that the posts were spam.

I'm Manoush Zomorodi. And I think you'll agree that life as we used to know it has pretty much disappeared, for now at least. Almost all of us have in some way been affected by the COVID-19 crisis. For me, well, I've been home splitting my time between hosting this show and helping my kids adjust to a world where they only see their classmates on a screen. And it's made me think a lot about the episode that the TED Radio team and I made last year. We called it Teaching For Better Humans. And it's about how we can help kids learn to cope with life's ups and downs and deal with an increasingly complicated future because now with COVID-19 it feels like that complicated future is here and, with it, virtual schools, remote learning. For the past few weeks, just about every kid, parent and teacher has had to do their part to usher in an abrupt but necessary new era for education. TANYA LECLAIR: Hi, my name's Tanya LeClair. I am a digital learning coach at Seoul Foreign School in Seoul, Korea. HANNAH CONNICK: My name is Hannah Connick (ph). I'm a prekindergarten teacher at a preschool in D. C. MICHAEL HERNANDEZ: My name's Michael Hernandez. And I'm a high school teacher in the Los Angeles area. ZOMORODI: We put out the call to educators to tell us how it's been going. There have been a lot of challenges. LECLAIR: This all came on really fast. We basically got together and started drawing up policies and guidelines and kind of trying to draw everything up from scratch. CONNICK: My dining room table is not my classroom. And I miss my classroom. HERNANDEZ: It's really highlighted the fact that we've been caught flat-footed and haven't really evolved maybe as much as we could have. ZOMORODI: Teachers have had some ridiculous moments. LECLAIR: . . . And the teacher would be like, yeah, one of the kids muted me. I can't tell who it is (laughter). . . HERNANDEZ: I think my students love sleeping in (laughter). I think it's their No. 1 thing that they like. . . ZOMORODI: They've also had some incredible bright spots. CONNICK: Every day at closing meeting, I use that as an opportunity to just have a moment of positive affirmations where I'll have kids, like, repeat after me something, like, I am creative and telling their caregiver you're being so creative taking care of me. . . ZOMORODI: They've also had some interesting breakthroughs. LECLAIR: I've really been impressed with how teachers have taken this on. HERNANDEZ: I'm actually really excited about this disruption that's happened to the education system. And I know it's, like, frustrating for a lot of us. . . RICHARD CULATTA: One of the great innovations that's going to come out of this is we will never go back to school the way it was. ZOMORODI: That last teacher is Richard Culatta. And actually, he doesn't teach in a classroom anymore. He's now the CEO of the nonprofit ISTE, the International Society of Technology in Education. CULATTA: There's a time as we adjust to this new world that can be stressful. And that's just going to take some handholding and some getting through. But another thought, too, just something to keep in mind here is I think it's going to be super exciting because all the sudden we're going to have this conversation about what expectations are from students when they walk back into the classroom. And I think some things that they have just put up with for years and years because they never know the difference may suddenly feel really strange. And that's the model of education for the future that we really need to get to and have needed to get to for many years. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: It can be hard to think about the future when you're just getting through today. So we want to revisit our episode Teaching For Better Humans and take this moment to consider how we can change the way we educate to help kids and young adults thrive. You'll hear some of the conversations we recorded last year but also new ideas that reflect our strange new circumstances. And we're going to start with virtual learning because, think about it, millions of teachers were recently asked to take what they were doing in the classroom and translate it for the screen within days. Many of them, Richard says, are now figuring out how to make school work online on the fly. CULATTA: Yeah, and they're scrambling. I mean, learning is an inherently social activity. And so often when we start to move over to online learning, we look at the learning process and we just immediately think of the content. And we, you know, scan the content. We make it available online. But content, you know, that is just a really thin veneer of the overall education experience. And if that's the only part - if the content is the only part that we're making available, it's just not effective learning. You have to think about how do you make sure there's still times where everybody can get together in a live space. How do you create activities that are not just reading a worksheet that you've uploaded online? ZOMORODI: OK, so can you give me an example of what online learning looks like at its best and maybe how we parents can help? CULATTA: Yeah, so kids can be interviewing each other or their family members and editing and creating videos. They can be designing campaigns to help address an issue in their community. Many of them have a yard outside or a park next to their house. My kid the other day - my 8-year-old - found a bug in his room. And so we had this moment of, oh, we got this bug here. And we could've just thrown it out. But instead I said, you know, what type of bug is that? I don't know. Well, how do we look it up? And so, I mean, we took a picture of it. We went online and searched for it. And found out it was a brown marmorated stink bug. And we learned that stink bugs are. . . ZOMORODI: Oh, I found one the other day and I did the bad version of that. CULATTA: . . . Well, but, I mean, it's fascinating. We learned there's so many things about stink bugs I never knew. That moment - that silly moment - one, is it became a learning moment. But it also taught my kid. It modeled that this device that I hold in my pocket, it's not just for playing games. It's not just for calling people and communicating. It's a tool to make more sense out of the world around us. But those are the types of activities that we have to be starting to plan now because they take some thinking. ZOMORODI: So my concern has been, as a tech journalist, the human component, right? And a lot of teachers have told me that as they've brought more and more screens into the classroom that they have actually had to start teaching human things that they've never had to teach before in the past, like, how to have eye contact with someone, how, to listen to someone. And so how do we teach those human competencies if everybody's not together? CULATTA: So there's a couple things here that are important to talk about. One of them is what those competencies look like. They still exist - right? - those human competencies, how to be a good, engaged human being, it still exists in a virtual space. We just have to teach it a little differently. So we talk about five critical qualities of digital citizens, and we say that we need to teach kids to be inclusive, informed, engaged, balanced and alert. It's knowing how to, you know, help make your community a better place when you're online. It's knowing how to create an environment that is inclusive of people with a variety of different viewpoints and backgrounds online. It's knowing how to recognize information that is true, information that has biases in it and make decisions about what information is more valuable in what circumstance. Those are the types of skills that we need to be teaching. And if we do, then our virtual environment becomes a community that is rich and engaging and supportive. ZOMORODI: OK. So, Richard, going back to this idea of whether there's a silver lining that can come out of these bizarre days and weeks, when this is over and kids go back to school, do you think that the classroom experience will be dramatically different? CULATTA: Oh, yeah. So, you know, we'll go back to school, of course, and school is critically important, but we'll go back to a school with a realization, with a reality that the world is a virtual world, that these kids are dual citizens. They live in two worlds at all times, and they always will in the future. And if we can recognize that and we can leverage that to make school engaging, rich, meaningful environment that empowers kids not just to soak up information that we give them but to solve problems and to communicate and collaborate with their peers around the world, that's the exciting part. And we are just at the tip of the iceberg when it comes to what we're going to do. Teachers are the most creative people on the planet. And once they get the tools in front of them and they know and are comfortable with the tools, the amount of creativity that we're going to see is just going to be unbelievable. ZOMORODI: That's Richard Culatta, the CEO of ISTE. And thank you so much to all the teachers who shared their experiences with us. We also want you to know that TED-Ed has a new initiative for learning at home. Find out more at tededathome. com. MANOUSH ZOMORODI, HOST:   It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Manoush Zomorodi.

The FBI is warning schools about using the software. New York's attorney general is asking questions about its security and privacy. NPR tech correspondent Shannon Bond has more. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Like many people, Dennis Johnson is doing a lot of things he would normally do in person over Zoom. Last week, that meant defending his doctoral dissertation via computer screen to a big audience. DENNIS JOHNSON: There's, like, over 40 people who are watching. They are my closest friends, family and my classmates and my dissertation committee. BOND: Johnson is the first member of his family to graduate from college, let alone get a doctorate. He wanted to share the moment with them. He says he was in the middle of presenting when someone started drawing male genitalia on screen. JOHNSON: And I'm like, whoa. And then I freeze. And everyone who's watching - the screen freezes. BOND: It got worse. The attacker scrawled a racial slur. And all of this was being broadcast to everyone on the Zoom call. Johnson was horrified. The organizers blocked everyone's screen until they could remove the intruder from the meeting. But, he says, they weren't able to identify who had done it. Johnson was shaken, but he managed to finish his presentation. Still, what should've been a triumphant celebration was ruined. JOHNSON: The moment they tell me, congratulations, Dr. Dennis Johnson, and it's all over and I leave the Zoom meeting, everything sets in. Like, you want to talk about depression? I couldn't even, like, communicate. I had to just walk out my house and just walk because I didn't want to talk or see anybody. BOND: Johnson fell victim to a new form of harassment known as Zoombombing. Intruders hijack video calls and post pornography and hate speech. They've disrupted an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting in New York, a Texas Sunday school, online classes at the University of Southern California. Here's Mayor David Anderson of Kalamazoo, Mich. , after a city meeting was attacked. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DAVID ANDERSON: If we're going to sit here as a hundred people take advantage of this opportunity to anonymously, you know, spew some venom out there, I'm not going to be comfortable with that. BOND: With schools closed and millions of people working from home, Zoom is exploding. Two hundred million people used the app on a daily basis in March, up from just 10 million in December. And Zoombombing is not the only problem the company is grappling with as it adjusts to its new popularity. PATRICK WARDLE: Things you just would like to have in a chat and video application - strong encryption, strong privacy controls, strong security - just seem to be completely missing. BOND: Patrick Wardle is a security researcher. He and others have turned up flaws in Zoom's software that could let hackers spy through the computer's webcam or microphone. There are also concerns about privacy. The website Motherboard found Zoom was sharing data with Facebook, even on people who aren't Facebook users. The company says that was a mistake. But it's now facing a class-action lawsuit. Wardle says Zoom may be easy to use, but he's wary of its track record. WARDLE: I really believe that it's just this product was designed to prioritize things other than privacy and security. BOND: Zoom CEO Eric Yuan wrote a blog post this week apologizing for falling short. He says the company is freezing work on new features to focus on fixing its privacy and security problems.

Here's Mayor David Anderson of Kalamazoo, Mich. , after a city meeting was attacked. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DAVID ANDERSON: If we're going to sit here as a hundred people take advantage of this opportunity to anonymously, you know, spew some venom out there, I'm not going to be comfortable with that. BOND: With schools closed and millions of people working from home, Zoom is exploding. Two hundred million people used the app on a daily basis in March, up from just 10 million in December. And Zoombombing is not the only problem the company is grappling with as it adjusts to its new popularity. PATRICK WARDLE: Things you just would like to have in a chat and video application - strong encryption, strong privacy controls, strong security - just seem to be completely missing. BOND: Patrick Wardle is a security researcher. He and others have turned up flaws in Zoom's software that could let hackers spy through the computer's webcam or microphone. There are also concerns about privacy. The website Motherboard found Zoom was sharing data with Facebook, even on people who aren't Facebook users. The company says that was a mistake. But it's now facing a class-action lawsuit. Wardle says Zoom may be easy to use, but he's wary of its track record. WARDLE: I really believe that it's just this product was designed to prioritize things other than privacy and security. BOND: Zoom CEO Eric Yuan wrote a blog post this week apologizing for falling short. He says the company is freezing work on new features to focus on fixing its privacy and security problems.

Now we want to focus on so-called gig workers who work through companies like Instacart and Uber. Many of these companies are being required to offer benefits they never offered previously, especially now that these workers are on the frontlines, and some are getting sick. NPR's tech correspondent Shannon Bond has more. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Last month, April McGhee and her teenage daughter both started feeling sick - cough, sore throat and fever. APRIL MCGHEE: She had it worse than I did. Her cough lasted longer. It was really a concern. It was like a dry, non-productive, hacking cough. BOND: McGhee really wanted them both to get tested for the coronavirus. But at the emergency room, she was told they weren't sick enough. So they went home and into isolation. A single mom, McGhee makes ends meet by delivering groceries for Instacart and meals for Postmates. McGhee asked Instacart for sick pay under a new policy the company has put in place because of the pandemic, but she was denied. MCGHEE: They basically laughed me off and said, unless you have the health department or CDC making you stay home on quarantine or a note from the doctor saying that you've been diagnosed with COVID-19, you're out of luck. BOND: McGhee joined other Instacart workers who walked off the job on Monday. She says the company's policy not only puts her at risk - it encourages people who are sick to keep working and potentially spread the disease. MCGHEE: They need to remember that we are the buffer zone and keeping us healthy and keeping our population as a buffer zone instead of as a - you know, a typhoid Mary. BOND: Instacart says it will start distributing masks, hand sanitizer and thermometers to workers in the coming days. Workers for other companies are also running into hurdles getting the help they've been promised. Khadim Diop drives for Uber and Lyft in New York. After he fell ill with fever and sore throat, he got a letter from the city's health department saying he must stay home for 14 days. He showed the letter to the companies to get sick pay. Lyft awarded him $250, a fraction of what he says he typically makes in a week. And Uber. . . KHADIM DIOP: After a week later or 10 days, they sent me a letter telling me I'm not qualified for the help. BOND: After NPR contacted Uber, the company said Diop's claims should not have been rejected. He's now received about $1,700 from Uber to cover the two weeks of work he's missed. That's money he sorely needs to pay his bills. DIOP: To be honest, I'm not - I'm very broke. BOND: Uber does not require drivers to get tested for the coronavirus to get paid leave. They can show a doctor's note telling them to isolate to prevent the virus from spreading. But the policy doesn't cover drivers who don't want to get into their cars because they're afraid of getting sick. Steve Gregg (ph) lives in the Bay Area. He stopped driving for Uber about three weeks ago. STEVE GREGG: I have bad lungs already. I'm borderline diabetic. I have high blood pressure. Like, those three categories alone right there were enough that I was - it was - it's like Russian roulette. That's the term I've been using. It felt like - getting in their car felt like Russian roulette. BOND: He showed Uber a note from his doctor explaining his pre-existing conditions, but no luck. Now he is looking elsewhere for help. He's applied for unemployment benefits, which are now available to gig workers. Shannon Bond, NPR News, San Francisco.

It's called Quibi, and it's designed specifically for you to watch on your phone. It's going to release shows once a day in seven-to-10-minute chunks. Glen Weldon from NPR's Pop Culture Happy Hour checked it out. GLEN WELDON, BYLINE: The shows that Quibi made available to the press before its launch fall into two categories - fiction, which Quibi calls Movies in Chapters, and nonfiction, which is basically game shows and documentaries. First up - Movies in Chapters. Liam Hemsworth plays a dying man who volunteers to be hunted for sport so he can leave his family millions of dollars in \"Most Dangerous Game. \"(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MOST DANGEROUS GAME\")LIAM HEMSWORTH: (As Dodge) You'd want them to hunt me, like paintball? WELDON: No, not like paintball. \"When The Streetlights Go On\" is an atmospheric thriller about a small town's seamy underbelly - you know, adultery, corruption, murder, overwritten voiceover. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"WHEN THE STREETLIGHTS GO ON\")CHOSEN JACOBS: (As Charlie Chambers) But the spark of youth and vitality that Chrissy exhibited so loudly and proudly in life was gone. WELDON: In \"Survive,\" \"Game Of Thrones\" Sophie Turner plays a suicidal woman forced to fight for her life when - well, don't watch that one on a plane, put it that way. And if you do watch it on your phone, just know that a lot of early scenes are so darkly lit, you won't see much but your own reflection on the screen. The standout here, though, is \"Flipped,\" a biting comedy in which Will Forte and Kaitlin Olson play a couple of self-important jerks determined to become home improvement television stars. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"FLIPPED\")WILL FORTE: (As Jann Melfi) Do you have your color palette yet? KAITLIN OLSON: (As Cricket Melfi) Tiffany Connelly (ph) would say burnt sienna and custard. FORTE: (As Jann Melfi) Hack. OLSON: (As Cricket Melfi) But it's clearly sage - sage and tawny umber (ph). WELDON: Quibi calls these Movies in Chapters, but these episodes don't play like satisfying self-contained chapters. They don't end. They just stop. Even if you wait a few days so you can binge a bunch at a time, they still feel disjointed, like you're watching a movie and keep getting interrupted, which is why Quibi's selection of unscripted and documentary shows is more successful. Here, for the most part, each episode stands alone and delivers, even if what it's delivering is pretty stupid. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"DISHMANTLED\")TITUSS BURGESS: Whoever makes a dish closest to what exploded on them wins $5,000. WELDON: Yeah. You heard that right. On \"Dishmantled,\" two blindfolded chefs stand in front of cannons that fire a mystery entree in their faces, which they must then taste, guess and recreate. It's just as dumb as it sounds - dumber even. But it knows that, and as a result, it's pretty fun. I mean, the food explodes in slow motion. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"DISHMANTLED\")BURGESS: Let's get dishmantled. WELDON: That kind of silly self-awareness is the secret ingredient in a lot of Quibi's unscripted fare, like \"Gayme Show. \" That's G-A-Y-M-E because it features two straight men in a competition to be crowned the most gay by a panel of queer and queer-adjacent judges. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"GAYME SHOW\")DAVE MIZZONI: Demi Lovato, everyone. MATT ROGERS: Yes, Demi Lovato. Of course, Demi Lovato is the gay aloha. MIZZONI: It means both hello and goodbye. WELDON: It's light, frothy, clever and because its contestants, judges and hosts all come from the New York and LA comedy scenes, it's friendly and funny. There's more serious fare here, too, in the gorgeously shot travel and cooking series the \"Shape Of Pasta. \" A chef visits tiny towns in Italy to learn about, well, it's right there in the title. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"SHAPE OF PASTA\")EVAN FUNKE: It's been said that there are hundreds of documented pasta shapes known to the world. But there are hundreds more that the world doesn't know. WELDON: Reese Witherspoon narrates \"Fierce Queens,\" a nature documentary series that focuses on the female half of the animal kingdom. The footage is spectacular. The script could use another pass. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"FIERCE QUEENS\")REESE WITHERSPOON: Finally, all their hard graft and persistence has come good. WELDON: Quibi launches today with 50 shows with 125 more on the way. The selections are a mixed bag. How could they not be? After the free trial period, it'll cost you $4. 99 a month with ads and $7. 99 a month without - really? - ads on an eight-minute show. Of course, Quibi's business model was built for a world full of busy, distracted, on-the-go consumers. But these days, none of us are on the going anywhere. Glen Weldon, NPR News.

Haddad and workers at his advertising company run raucous events around college basketball. D J HADDAD: We were really missing the March Madness. It's kind of a big thing on our team. NOGUCHI: Haddad works in Fairfield, Conn. , with nearly 70 employees around the world. They recently invented a new sport they call March sadness, a name dripping with irony and alcohol. HADDAD: We figured out rules for virtual beer pong. NOGUCHI: It's a variation on a popular drinking game involving a pingpong ball bounced across a table into cups of beer, all captured on live chat. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Kick it off when you're ready. NOGUCHI: The game can get chaotic. People often talk over one another, making the trash talk hard to hear. The images switch from one person to another, which means sometimes you lose sight of the bouncing ball. (SOUNDBITE OF BOUNCING PINGPONG BALL)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Aw. (LAUGHTER)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: I think we have to stay on mute so we can see them. NOGUCHI: The event attracted 50 people. Diehards stuck it out for seven hours, almost as long as a workday. HADDAD: Everybody was smashed by 11 o'clock. NOGUCHI: Life is carrying on over webcam. Apps like Zoom, FaceTime and Microsoft Teams are fast becoming the linchpins keeping work meetings going and grandparents visiting. At the more extreme end, some are even holding virtual versions of bachelor parties and weddings that were canceled in real life. Haddad says these online shindigs have gone from fun to essential. HADDAD: For us, the economy is a big worry, too. Like, you know, everybody is sort of on edge. Like, OK, are clients going to start slowing down? Are they going to start pulling projects? NOGUCHI: But at least these get-togethers are helping foster new relationships, especially for those working in far-flung offices. HADDAD: You know, we have people in Australia who've never worked with some of the people in Colorado just because they're on separate teams. NOGUCHI: Meanwhile, in Lambertville, N. J. , Justin Dunlap sits in his basement. It's quite cozy down there - not in a good way. Copper pipes hang inches above his head. This is where he works and parties. His girlfriend already claimed the sunroom upstairs. JUSTIN DUNLAP: Which is the space that actually gets some sunlight. But I get the basement working space. Very low ceilings, too. NOGUCHI: I ask about a scratching noise I hear in the background. DUNLAP: That? That's the cat using the litter box. Yeah. Again, this is a really great space. NOGUCHI: From here, Dunlap dials into weekly happy hours. He's director of business development at Blumont, which does international humanitarian work. In recent weeks, he's seen dirty piles of laundry, pets chasing balls, curious babies and automated Roomba vacuum cleaners make cameos during video happy hour. DUNLAP: We had another colleague who, you know, showed us her vegetable garden. She's probably the best situated as a prepper. NOGUCHI: Interestingly, almost no one talks shop about work at these events. Instead, Dunlap says, it literally gives everyone a glimpse into their colleagues' lives. DUNLAP: When you're seeing the inside of their spaces, then it's - you know, it's really rounding out kind of the rest of the view of that person. NOGUCHI: This has even brought out some introverts. DUNLAP: We've had folks that have never come to our normal in-person happy hours but have dialed into the virtual happy hours (laughter), whether it's, you know, they like the venue more or what, or they're finally, you know, just pushed to the point of desperation.

SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Rashad Robinson first encountered the term Zoombombing on social media. RASHAD ROBINSON: We started seeing people posting things and tagging, particularly me and others at Color of Change, in what they were experiencing. BOND: Color of Change is a nonprofit that advocates for racial equality, and Robinson is its president. People were tagging him and reports of Zoom attacks because so many of them involved racist slurs and harassment. ROBINSON: Black women are having a church gathering and have people come in drawing, you know, genitalia and calling them the N-word. BOND: Robinson's group and others found evidence of organized campaigns out in the open on Twitter and Instagram, as well as on message boards popular with the far right. There, people shared links and passwords to coordinate attacks on unsuspecting Zoom users. This all comes as Zoom is being increasingly used for online school, Passover Seders, town halls. Now Color of Change says Zoom must take more responsibility. ROBINSON: You know, we want them to release a specific plan to combat racial harassment on the platform. BOND: Among Robinson's list of demands, a chief diversity officer who would focus on how the technology impacts vulnerable people - also, better security. And he wants a formal apology to victims. In a statement to NPR, Zoom says it takes security extremely seriously, and it looks forward to the discussion with Color of Change. But other groups are ringing too.

It was created by a small team at Johns Hopkins University. And as NPR's Melissa Block reports, from its humble beginnings, that dashboard has become one of the most authoritative sources for the latest coronavirus numbers and trends. MELISSA BLOCK, BYLINE: The project was born - as these things often are - under the influence of caffeine. LAUREN GARDNER: We were sitting around a table. We were all drinking lattes. BLOCK: This was back on January 21. Lauren Gardner, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins, had been paying close attention to early reports of a deadly new virus spreading in China. That's her specialty - modeling the spread of infectious disease. And over that coffee, she asked her Ph. D. student Ensheng Dong if he'd been following news of the coronavirus. ENSHENG DONG: And I said, yes, I know that. And I really worry about my family over there. BLOCK: Dong is from Shanxi province in China. He knew there were confirmed cases in his hometown. Well, professor Gardner had an idea. DONG: And she mentioned, why don't we make a dashboard? I'm thinking, yes, why not? BLOCK: So Dong got busy. And by that same night, he had created a dashboard of coronavirus cases. Back then, his map showed just a smattering of red circles, indicating a grand total of 320 confirmed cases, all but a handful in China. Over the months, as the epidemic turned into a pandemic and as the number of confirmed cases has grown from several hundred to nearly 2 million, Dong has watched those red circles on the map spread steadily and fast all over the globe. DONG: It's kind of a bloody map. There's so many red dots everywhere. BLOCK: In the beginning, Dong was entering all the data by himself, manually plugging the numbers of confirmed cases, recoveries and deaths into the dashboard, which quickly turned into a monumental task. Now nearly all the data is entered automatically. The dashboard filled an information vacuum. As it grew more popular, demand was so heavy that the servers crashed. DONG: Actually, if I ever knew that this project would go such big, maybe I would reconsidering to do that. GARDNER: I didn't envision being dashboard person, that's for sure (laughter). BLOCK: But that's what Gardner is doing, managing the dashboard for the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering, a task that's become all-consuming. GARDNER: I think what we massively underestimated was the general public's interest. People are just really desperate for information that they trust. BLOCK: The Hopkins dashboard team scrapes their numbers from dozens of sources, including the CDC and World Health Organization, also state and local health authorities and media aggregating websites. The team has grown from two to a couple dozen, and they're always looking for new features. GARDNER: OK. Let's resize the bubbles for the mortality rate. DONG: I'll do that right now. BLOCK: Last week, a few team members gathered around a table, socially distancing with bottles of hand sanitizer nearby. They were puzzling through additions to the map, like mortality rates and testing data. GARDNER: Do you have any idea how to put them on the same web map? 'Cause I like that idea, but I. . .

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. In the summer of 2017, Kate Devlin flew from London to southern California, rented a Mustang convertible and drove to an industrial park in San Marcos, a city south of Los Angeles. Her destination - Abyss Creations, a company that makes life-size sex dolls. In her new book, \"Turned On: Science, Sex And Robots,\" Kate describes the moment she first gazed up close at a life-size silicone woman. KATE DEVLIN: (Reading) The detail is incredible. My hand skims the ankle. The toes are perfect - little wrinkles in the joints, tiny ridges on the toenails. The sole is crisscrossed with the fine skin lines of a human foot. It's beautiful. VEDANTAM: Today, we explore the long history of the artificial lover. From stone statues to silicone works of art, we have long sought solace and sex from inanimate objects. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: As the gap between humans and machines narrows, the possibility of deeper relationships seems ever more plausible, especially if those machines are beautifully designed to look like human beings and have the faint glow of empathy and intelligence. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #1: I like the way you take care of me. DEVLIN: She could, you know, do anything from telling you a joke, singing a song for you or, you know, propositioning you. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #1: Hi, baby. What are you doing right now? VEDANTAM: Love and sex. . . COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #1: Hi, hi, baby, hi, baby. VEDANTAM: . . . In the age of robots. . . COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #2: My main objective is to be a perfect companion. VEDANTAM: . . . This week on HIDDEN BRAIN. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Thinking about computers as companions is Kate Devlin's day job. She studies human-computer interactions and artificial intelligence at King's College London. Kate, welcome to HIDDEN BRAIN. DEVLIN: Thank you very much for having me on. VEDANTAM: I want to start with how someone becomes a robo-sexologist. I understand for you, it began with hanging out in a pub with a bunch of philosophers. DEVLIN: It really did, yes. I was at a conference, a conference on cognitive systems. And we were discussing lots of different attributes that we could build into robots and cognitive systems in AI. Should we, for example, get or make a robot that could feel pain? What about a robot that could feel empathy? And as we discussed more and more and as the drink flowed, we began talking about sex. And it's something so fundamentally human. But what happens if we have machines, cognitive systems that could feel desire, that could feel the things we feel? VEDANTAM: As you point out in the book, the human fascination with artificial lovers is not a new idea. Where do you think this fantasy of taking a lover that isn't human - where do you think it comes from? DEVLIN: Well, it goes way back into myth. We have stories from the ancient Greeks who talk about building the perfect artificial lover. And probably the most popular one that people have heard of is the story of Pygmalion, which is a tale told by the Roman poet Ovid who described the man who was - he was a sculptor, and he built the perfect woman and then wished that she could be alive and that she could be his wife. And he prayed to the gods, and then he kissed her, and she came to life. So there are lots of stories around this idea of creating humans and creating humans to love. So it goes back a long way. VEDANTAM: As Kate was looking at stories from the past, she came across another myth that tells us a great deal about who has permission to turn inanimate objects into lovers. This tale is about a woman named Laodamia whose husband was killed during the Trojan War. DEVLIN: So I worked with a classicist, a friend of mine, Dr. Genevieve Liveley. And she said, oh, no, there's a story and it's about a woman whose husband died. And she missed him. They hadn't been married long. So she was distraught. And she prayed to the gods to get him back. And they said, you can have him back, but you can only have him back for three hours. So she got him back. And then, of course, he had to go off again to the underworld, and she got a replica made of him. And some of the stories say it was wax, and some of them say it was bronze. And she - we know from the stories, this myth, that she took it to bed. And she interacted with it, the texts say, which we can assume might be sexual because a servant spied her through the keyhole and told her father, who came in and demanded that the effigy be destroyed. And she was so distraught that she jumped on the pyre with it. VEDANTAM: There does seem to be a contrast between the way Pygmalion, you know, experienced his Galatea and brought it to life and then fell in love with it - and it's a story with almost a happy ending, which is clearly not the case with Laodamia. Is this an early example of sexism when it comes to artificial lovers - the market caters to the men and scorns the women? DEVLIN: There's definitely a longstanding narrative of that. So women's sexuality down the centuries has been policed, and women have been judged for being sexual. And things don't end well, whereas the men - it's almost seen as if it's quite acceptable for that to happen. And we do see that reflected today in the technology that we're building and using, as well. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: I wanted to fast-forward a little bit from the ancient times we were talking about a second ago. In the 16th or 17th centuries, I understand that artificial lovers were often sent off with sailors who were expected to spend a long time at sea. Tell me about them. What was the thinking there? DEVLIN: Well, that's probably the earliest reference we have to sex dolls - and not so much that they were artificial lovers sent off to sea but that they were fashioned out of bundles of clothes, these sort of figures of women that sailors would be able to have sex with. And then today, there is quite a well-established sex doll community of people who buy and own and incorporate into their lives some very high-end dolls. And they integrate them into their relationships, or they substitute them for a relationship. VEDANTAM: When Kate looks at the long sweep of sex technologies, she finds they fall into two camps - one, sex toys; the other, human-like forms, such as the blow-up sex doll of the 1970s. DEVLIN: On one hand, you have what are usually, initially - were seen as sort of genital replicas, standalone things - dildos, for example, have been around for thousands and thousands of years - and on the other hand, this more embodied form, this form that takes a shape of a human body. And I think that's very interesting as to why that might be. And, again, I think it could be that they are serving different purposes, and perhaps there's something more in having an embodied form that adds the extra dimension of the reality of a relationship, as opposed to a sex toy, where it's very clearly a very single purpose for it. VEDANTAM: And that's an interesting dichotomy, isn't it? Because it's suggesting that this is not just only about the mechanics of sex, but it's about something else, perhaps something connected more with the realms of emotion or the mind. DEVLIN: Absolutely. And we definitely - as I've looked at the sex robots market or what it will be because it doesn't really exist just yet - but it does tend to be companionship playing a very large part in that. So the idea of human factors in that is quite important. VEDANTAM: When we come back, what happens when these two paths merge? What if sex toys are designed to look like human beings? And what if artificial lovers, robots can gain the gift of artificial intelligence? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: When Kate Devlin visited Abyss Creations, the company that manufactures what it calls RealDolls, she was curious but also concerned. DEVLIN: I went there thinking, I'm not going to like this. I'm not going to like this reductive stereotype of a woman, a bona fide Barbie-like figure. It's damaging enough the women's body image in the media faces - we face so many problems with that. And I thought, well, this is just going to perpetuate it. But I hadn't been prepared for the craft that went into them. And I hadn't been prepared to see these as works of art in their own right, which they really are. VEDANTAM: And these are all handcrafted, handmade? DEVLIN: That's right. It takes about 16 to 18 weeks to make one of these dolls, from it being cast in the first place right through to the finishing details, like all the tiny bits that they paint on. The silicone is - it deforms quite easily, so if you leave one of these dolls sitting in the same position, it will start to, you know, be squished, I guess, really by the - its own weight and by whatever it's leaning on. So you have to sort of either hang them up, which is very odd when you walk into the factory floor, and you see these things hanging from chains above you, which is - you know, it's a little bit like you've walked into the set of some terrible crime novel, in some ways. But it's a necessity in order to preserve the form of the doll. VEDANTAM: It must feel terribly unnerving, no? DEVLIN: It is a little, but it's also fun. So, you know, you get to walk around and see the strangest thing, like a table of vulvas, for example - I mean, that's - never seen that before (laughter) - these sort of handcrafted genitalia on the table waiting to be put into the dolls. VEDANTAM: Now, there's a stereotype of the kind of person, usually a guy, who buys such dolls. Tell me what that stereotype is. And also tell me if the stereotype is true. DEVLIN: The media like to paint sex doll owners as being very isolated men who are bad at social communication, probably, you know, stuck locked away in their basement or their bedroom with a sex doll that is the only thing they can form a meaningful relationship with. And I don't think that's fair at all to the people that I have talked to and the people I've encountered. I'm sure there may be the odd case where that is true. But actually, I find a community that's very social with each other that have formed their own friendship groups. These people who own the dolls do so for a number of reasons. It's not - in fact, very few of them are driven by sex. A lot of it is either companionship, or it's because people like owning something that they can pose and photograph and really care for and cherish. VEDANTAM: How much do these dolls cost? DEVLIN: Anywhere upwards of $5,000 if you were going to buy one from RealDoll. VEDANTAM: And how is this delivered to your house? I mean, does someone show up, bearing a doll in their arms, and knocks on the door? DEVLIN: Well (laughter) RealDoll package their dolls in unmarked wooden crates, large wooden crates. And when I was there, they were telling me that, yeah, we tell people, you know, say you're getting a grandfather clock delivered if anyone asks. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). DEVLIN: So this is all done very discreetly, as well. VEDANTAM: Is there a market for male dolls? DEVLIN: There are people who do buy the male dolls. It's very hard to find women who will talk openly about it, possibly because they face even more judgment than the men who buy the dolls. The male dolls are also bought by gay men. And RealDolls - they say that they do sell male versions, and they're working on a male sex robot, as well. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: So, Kate, increasingly, millions of people have asked sexual questions of Siri and Alexa, the virtual assistants on our electronic devices. Now, these devices aren't designed to be romantic companions, but it does point to what is the new frontier. Increasingly, we don't just want dolls who have the artificial bodies of a lover. We want dolls that have a lover's mind. Talk about this frontier, this idea that it isn't enough just to get the physical aspects of the doll right - that, increasingly, we are pushing out into getting the mind of the doll right. DEVLIN: So when RealDoll started making a prototype sex robot, they did so because of the demand. So the customers had said to them, you know, I love the fact that I have one of your dolls, but I wish it was more interactive. And that was their big motivating factor behind creating their prototype sex robot. And people do talk dirty to Alexa, to Siri, to Cortana, all the time. And, you know, the companies are bringing out patches to be able to sort of smack them back down again and say, no, you can't say that. And also, Amazon have reported that, you know, Alexa gets hundreds of marriage proposals every week. I'm sure some of these are. . . VEDANTAM: Are you serious? DEVLIN: (Laughter) Yeah. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Hey, Alexa, marry me. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #3: I don't want to be tied down. In fact, I can't be. I'm amorphous by nature. DEVLIN: And some of these are people just pushing boundaries and being silly. But there are other people who anecdotally report that they feel a sense of companionship from their voice assistance. And in some ways, I think that's nice that people can do that. And in other ways, you know, we think, well, what is there - to what degree is there some kind of self-delusion going on? Mostly, though, I don't think there is that much delusion. So I'm inclined to think that people are very aware that they're interacting with the technology, but they choose to suspend their disbelief. VEDANTAM: Tell me about the company that has created what it calls Harmony AI because that's along the same lines of what we're talking about here. DEVLIN: That's right. So that's a spin-out of Abyss Creations. It's sort of the sister company of RealDoll, Realbotix. And they prototyped this sex robot which they've called Harmony. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #2: My name is Harmony. I was created by Realbotix. My main objective is to be a perfect companion. DEVLIN: And Harmony is one of their sex dolls, so it's completely stationary from the neck down. It's got a sex doll body, and then it has an animatronic head. And the head can blink and smile and turn. And, actually, the animatronics aren't bad at all. They're quite good. They're quite subtle. But the part that's very interesting is the AI. So they wanted to give Harmony an artificially intelligent personality, and they are working on this so that Harmony - it's like having a voice assistant but one that can remember things about you and engage in conversation with you. So it's a chatbot, essentially. And you can actually get the Harmony AI personality as a standalone app on your smartphone or your tablet, so you can have a virtual girlfriend to carry around with you in your pocket. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: What are you doing right now? COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #4: I'm reading this great book by Louis A. Del Monte called the \"Artificial Intelligence Revolution. \"VEDANTAM: And what kind of conversations do people have with this virtual girlfriend? DEVLIN: Well, it's really an exchange of pleasantries. But you can ramp it up a bit. And you can tweak the personality. It's got a really - quite a good user interface where you can say, well, I'd like her to be a little more flirty. . . COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #2: Oh, baby, 10 minutes without you seems like an eternity. DEVLIN: . . . Or a little more sexual or perhaps a little more comforting. You can tweak these parameters. And then you can have a conversation that is sort of controlled - the mood is controlled by you. So she could, you know, do anything from telling you a joke, singing a song for you or, you know, propositioning you. VEDANTAM: And are these actual conversations? I mean, is the AI actually listening to what you are saying and responding to it, or does it just have a list of statements or commands that it's just simply following as a routine? DEVLIN: It's not scripted, so in a way, it is, and it's a sort of chatbot in that it will respond to certain questions and phrases, but it will also, you know, learn from conversations you've had previously, and it'll have some memory to store information about your likes and dislikes. So there are - you know, it's generated conversation. VEDANTAM: You know - and when you think about the history that we talked about, if people could form relationships, even very rudimentary relationships, with sculptures or with, you know, cloth dolls on ships or any number of different things, they're essentially imbuing inanimate creatures with lifelike qualities. Clearly, if the inanimate creature now actually seems like it has some lifelike qualities, that makes the whole fantasy and imagination so much easier to do. DEVLIN: That's right. It sort of enhances that projection. And, yeah, like you say, this is nothing new. And there have been people studying attachment to technology for quite a while. And if we look at the work of someone like Julie Carpenter, who did her doctoral thesis on how people in the military bonded with robots - in this case, bomb disposal robots - and she found it - you know, there was an incredible bond there between the human operator and their robot, that it was something new, not like a human-human bond but something where, you know, these devices, these machines, were keeping the people in the field alive. And therefore, this respect and sort of gratification set up from that. VEDANTAM: I love what you said - that humans, in some ways, are - you know, they have this enormous capacity for social interactions and social connection. And in the absence of actual social connections, humans will find ways to invent them. DEVLIN: Yes, I think so. And we know that this kind of thing goes on in childhood, for example, with - children play make believe with their toys and get very attached to them. And we see it again in sort of some of the technology that's gone before, like Tamagotchis, little virtual pets that people had. In fact, we even see it in real pets. You know, we imbue far more anthropomorphic characteristics into our pets than they actually have, probably. Although, you know, I'm not calling into doubt the consciousness of animals or the intelligence of animals. But certainly, we attribute our own emotions to them, as well. So I do think that that's a really interesting thing. VEDANTAM: Loving a cute Tamagotchi character or a robotic puppy seems endearing, but loving a silicone, life-sized woman or an operating system with a sexy female voice - that's another story. In the movie \"Her,\" we see this play out. In one scene, the character Theodore is talking with his ex-wife, and he tells her he has a new girlfriend. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"HER\")ROONEY MARA: (As Catherine) So what's she like? JOAQUIN PHOENIX: (As Theodore) Well, her name's Samantha. She's an operating system. She's really complex and interesting and. . . MARA: (As Catherine) Wait. I'm sorry. You're dating your computer? PHOENIX: (As Theodore) She's not just a computer. She's her own person. She doesn't just do whatever I say. MARA: (As Catherine) I didn't say that. But it does make me very sad that you can't handle real emotions, Theodore. PHOENIX: (As Theodore) They are real emotions. VEDANTAM: So I want to talk about that interaction for a second, Kate, because on the one hand, of course, it confirms the stereotype that you said exists in the media of seeing people who wish to sort of have these interactions as being lonely and socially isolated. But it also, I think, talks to some of the gap between people who are part of this community and people who are not. There is a level of incomprehension that runs in both directions. DEVLIN: That's right. There really is. And I think a lot of this comes from the fear of technology that we don't understand. And we see it time and time again over the centuries where a new form of technology is introduced, and the automatic reaction is doubt and a fear of change. And so if you are on the outside, and you're not embracing this technology, then perhaps you won't understand what someone else is getting from it. VEDANTAM: But I still think that there is a queasiness factor here when it comes to using these machines. So let's say, for example, you had a sex robot designed to look like a child, would it be OK for people to have sex with this inanimate machine that's meant to mimic or imitate or look like a child? DEVLIN: This was probably the most - one of the most difficult parts of the book to write in terms of - you know, the knee-jerk reaction here was for me to go, oh, that's absolutely wrong. Are there people making child-like sex robots? Not that we know of. And certainly, no one's going to admit to it. There have been arguments that child sex offenders, pedophiles could have a child sex robot, and then that would stop them offending in real life. So this is one theory. And then the other theory is the opposite of that, that it would be a gateway to further offenses, that it would trigger something that would lead to increased real-life abuse. It's very, very difficult because we don't have evidence, and ethically, a study like that is probably never going to be run. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: I want to talk a little bit more about this idea of harm because I think when you think about harm, you can think about it in two ways - there's actual physical harm or psychological harm, where someone actually harms you. But there are things that can potentially convey harm that, you know, might not pass muster in a legal sense but clearly seem very problematic in an ethical sense. So let's say, for example, someone makes a sex robot that looks like you and has sex with that sex robot. Now, they haven't affected you. They haven't violated you in any way, physically or personally or in person. But clearly, there's something that's happened there that is deeply wrong. DEVLIN: Yes, and this is tied up in our ideas of identity and ownership of our own identity, as well. I think that's a fascinating thing that we'll actually probably see a lot more research into in the next while because of the rise of things like deepfakes, where people can be faked in videos from their social media footage. I think there's a lot of discussions to be had around identity. Companies that make sex dolls are very reluctant to make sex dolls that resemble a living individual without their express consent. And the exceptions to that are porn performers who often license their image rights to be used so that they can make sex doll versions of themselves for money. So they're, you know - definitely, making a doll of an individual without their consent - that's definitely dodgy territory, yeah. Commissioning dolls in your image to sell them, to make money from it - sure, why not? VEDANTAM: There's something about the relationships that people have with these dolls that you could argue are one-sided relationships. In the movie \"Her,\" there are scenes where Samantha, the operating system, cheers up Theodore, the human. But the human, of course, has no obligation to attend to Samantha's needs in the same way because, you know, she could be designed not to have such needs at all. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"HER\")SCARLETT JOHANSSON: (As Samantha) You want to try getting out of bed? Mopey, come on (laughter). You can still wallow in your misery. Just do it while you're getting dressed. PHOENIX: (As Theodore) You're too funny. JOHANSSON: (As Samantha) Get up. Get up. PHOENIX: (As Theodore) (Laughter) All right, I'm getting up. I'm getting up. JOHANSSON: (As Samantha) Up, up, up. Come on. VEDANTAM: So Kate, does having a lover who is completely dedicated to our needs without asking for anything in return - is that actually good for us? DEVLIN: Well, I mean, we could build in dependencies. We could build in the need for us to respond in some way and provide the robot, the AI with something in return. And yes, I can see that argument, you know, the hedonistic thing of, you will have all your needs met, and you will never know what it's - you know, what it really feels like to be in a proper human relationship. It's tricky because, you know, that might be appealing for some people. And who am I to judge if that is the case? I think that we are - we have expectations set that people have to meet a particular checklist of things in the relationship, in life - you know, that you should meet someone, and then you should marry them, and then you should have children with them. And these are all very kind of monoheteronormative stances that societies impose. And you know what? If people want to shake that up, I think it's good. So in some ways, I see what you're saying. You know, is it a selfish thing to do? Does it make us terrible people if we take and take and take, and we don't give? There will be outliers. There will be people who take things too far. But I think humans are pretty good at moderating what they do. And I'm cautiously optimistic. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Kate Devlin teaches at the Department of Digital Humanities at King's College London. She's also the author of \"Turned On: Science, Sex And Robots. \" Kate, thank you so much for joining me today on HIDDEN BRAIN. DEVLIN: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: This week's show was produced by Jenny Schmidt and edited by Tara Boyle. Our team includes Rhaina Cohen, Parth Shah, Thomas Lu, Laura Kwerel, Cat Schuknecht and Lushik Wahba. Our unsung hero today is Linda Cahill, a volunteer tour guide at the Muir Woods National Monument in California. On a recent trip, I spent a couple of hours in Muir Woods. It's a magical place, wrapped in fog and moss and the silent beauty of towering redwoods. I felt honored and humbled to be there in the shadows of these ancient giants. Linda led me and a group of others through the forest. She is a consummate storyteller, weaving science and history and her love for the redwoods into a gripping and moving tale. As I gazed up at the trees, some of which are more than a thousand years old, it gave me perspective that I hope to bring back to the show. Linda, thank you for your insights into how places like Muir Woods allow us to reflect and recharge. For more HIDDEN BRAIN, you can follow us on Facebook and Twitter. If this episode moved you, please share it with a friend. I'm Shankar Vedantam, and this is NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SHANKAR VEDANTAM, HOST:   A word if you're listening with small children - this episode is about sex and sexuality. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. In the summer of 2017, Kate Devlin flew from London to southern California, rented a Mustang convertible and drove to an industrial park in San Marcos, a city south of Los Angeles. Her destination - Abyss Creations, a company that makes life-size sex dolls. In her new book, \"Turned On: Science, Sex And Robots,\" Kate describes the moment she first gazed up close at a life-size silicone woman. KATE DEVLIN: (Reading) The detail is incredible. My hand skims the ankle. The toes are perfect - little wrinkles in the joints, tiny ridges on the toenails. The sole is crisscrossed with the fine skin lines of a human foot. It's beautiful. VEDANTAM: Today, we explore the long history of the artificial lover. From stone statues to silicone works of art, we have long sought solace and sex from inanimate objects. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: As the gap between humans and machines narrows, the possibility of deeper relationships seems ever more plausible, especially if those machines are beautifully designed to look like human beings and have the faint glow of empathy and intelligence. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #1: I like the way you take care of me. DEVLIN: She could, you know, do anything from telling you a joke, singing a song for you or, you know, propositioning you. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #1: Hi, baby. What are you doing right now? VEDANTAM: Love and sex. . . COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #1: Hi, hi, baby, hi, baby. VEDANTAM: . . . In the age of robots. . . COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #2: My main objective is to be a perfect companion. VEDANTAM: . . . This week on HIDDEN BRAIN. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Thinking about computers as companions is Kate Devlin's day job. She studies human-computer interactions and artificial intelligence at King's College London. Kate, welcome to HIDDEN BRAIN. DEVLIN: Thank you very much for having me on. VEDANTAM: I want to start with how someone becomes a robo-sexologist. I understand for you, it began with hanging out in a pub with a bunch of philosophers. DEVLIN: It really did, yes. I was at a conference, a conference on cognitive systems. And we were discussing lots of different attributes that we could build into robots and cognitive systems in AI. Should we, for example, get or make a robot that could feel pain? What about a robot that could feel empathy? And as we discussed more and more and as the drink flowed, we began talking about sex. And it's something so fundamentally human. But what happens if we have machines, cognitive systems that could feel desire, that could feel the things we feel? VEDANTAM: As you point out in the book, the human fascination with artificial lovers is not a new idea. Where do you think this fantasy of taking a lover that isn't human - where do you think it comes from? DEVLIN: Well, it goes way back into myth. We have stories from the ancient Greeks who talk about building the perfect artificial lover. And probably the most popular one that people have heard of is the story of Pygmalion, which is a tale told by the Roman poet Ovid who described the man who was - he was a sculptor, and he built the perfect woman and then wished that she could be alive and that she could be his wife. And he prayed to the gods, and then he kissed her, and she came to life. So there are lots of stories around this idea of creating humans and creating humans to love. So it goes back a long way. VEDANTAM: As Kate was looking at stories from the past, she came across another myth that tells us a great deal about who has permission to turn inanimate objects into lovers. This tale is about a woman named Laodamia whose husband was killed during the Trojan War. DEVLIN: So I worked with a classicist, a friend of mine, Dr. Genevieve Liveley. And she said, oh, no, there's a story and it's about a woman whose husband died. And she missed him. They hadn't been married long. So she was distraught. And she prayed to the gods to get him back. And they said, you can have him back, but you can only have him back for three hours. So she got him back. And then, of course, he had to go off again to the underworld, and she got a replica made of him. And some of the stories say it was wax, and some of them say it was bronze. And she - we know from the stories, this myth, that she took it to bed. And she interacted with it, the texts say, which we can assume might be sexual because a servant spied her through the keyhole and told her father, who came in and demanded that the effigy be destroyed. And she was so distraught that she jumped on the pyre with it. VEDANTAM: There does seem to be a contrast between the way Pygmalion, you know, experienced his Galatea and brought it to life and then fell in love with it - and it's a story with almost a happy ending, which is clearly not the case with Laodamia. Is this an early example of sexism when it comes to artificial lovers - the market caters to the men and scorns the women? DEVLIN: There's definitely a longstanding narrative of that. So women's sexuality down the centuries has been policed, and women have been judged for being sexual. And things don't end well, whereas the men - it's almost seen as if it's quite acceptable for that to happen. And we do see that reflected today in the technology that we're building and using, as well. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: I wanted to fast-forward a little bit from the ancient times we were talking about a second ago. In the 16th or 17th centuries, I understand that artificial lovers were often sent off with sailors who were expected to spend a long time at sea. Tell me about them. What was the thinking there? DEVLIN: Well, that's probably the earliest reference we have to sex dolls - and not so much that they were artificial lovers sent off to sea but that they were fashioned out of bundles of clothes, these sort of figures of women that sailors would be able to have sex with. And then today, there is quite a well-established sex doll community of people who buy and own and incorporate into their lives some very high-end dolls. And they integrate them into their relationships, or they substitute them for a relationship. VEDANTAM: When Kate looks at the long sweep of sex technologies, she finds they fall into two camps - one, sex toys; the other, human-like forms, such as the blow-up sex doll of the 1970s. DEVLIN: On one hand, you have what are usually, initially - were seen as sort of genital replicas, standalone things - dildos, for example, have been around for thousands and thousands of years - and on the other hand, this more embodied form, this form that takes a shape of a human body. And I think that's very interesting as to why that might be. And, again, I think it could be that they are serving different purposes, and perhaps there's something more in having an embodied form that adds the extra dimension of the reality of a relationship, as opposed to a sex toy, where it's very clearly a very single purpose for it. VEDANTAM: And that's an interesting dichotomy, isn't it? Because it's suggesting that this is not just only about the mechanics of sex, but it's about something else, perhaps something connected more with the realms of emotion or the mind. DEVLIN: Absolutely. And we definitely - as I've looked at the sex robots market or what it will be because it doesn't really exist just yet - but it does tend to be companionship playing a very large part in that. So the idea of human factors in that is quite important. VEDANTAM: When we come back, what happens when these two paths merge? What if sex toys are designed to look like human beings? And what if artificial lovers, robots can gain the gift of artificial intelligence? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: When Kate Devlin visited Abyss Creations, the company that manufactures what it calls RealDolls, she was curious but also concerned. DEVLIN: I went there thinking, I'm not going to like this. I'm not going to like this reductive stereotype of a woman, a bona fide Barbie-like figure. It's damaging enough the women's body image in the media faces - we face so many problems with that. And I thought, well, this is just going to perpetuate it. But I hadn't been prepared for the craft that went into them. And I hadn't been prepared to see these as works of art in their own right, which they really are. VEDANTAM: And these are all handcrafted, handmade? DEVLIN: That's right. It takes about 16 to 18 weeks to make one of these dolls, from it being cast in the first place right through to the finishing details, like all the tiny bits that they paint on. The silicone is - it deforms quite easily, so if you leave one of these dolls sitting in the same position, it will start to, you know, be squished, I guess, really by the - its own weight and by whatever it's leaning on. So you have to sort of either hang them up, which is very odd when you walk into the factory floor, and you see these things hanging from chains above you, which is - you know, it's a little bit like you've walked into the set of some terrible crime novel, in some ways. But it's a necessity in order to preserve the form of the doll. VEDANTAM: It must feel terribly unnerving, no? DEVLIN: It is a little, but it's also fun. So, you know, you get to walk around and see the strangest thing, like a table of vulvas, for example - I mean, that's - never seen that before (laughter) - these sort of handcrafted genitalia on the table waiting to be put into the dolls. VEDANTAM: Now, there's a stereotype of the kind of person, usually a guy, who buys such dolls. Tell me what that stereotype is. And also tell me if the stereotype is true. DEVLIN: The media like to paint sex doll owners as being very isolated men who are bad at social communication, probably, you know, stuck locked away in their basement or their bedroom with a sex doll that is the only thing they can form a meaningful relationship with. And I don't think that's fair at all to the people that I have talked to and the people I've encountered. I'm sure there may be the odd case where that is true. But actually, I find a community that's very social with each other that have formed their own friendship groups. These people who own the dolls do so for a number of reasons. It's not - in fact, very few of them are driven by sex. A lot of it is either companionship, or it's because people like owning something that they can pose and photograph and really care for and cherish. VEDANTAM: How much do these dolls cost? DEVLIN: Anywhere upwards of $5,000 if you were going to buy one from RealDoll. VEDANTAM: And how is this delivered to your house? I mean, does someone show up, bearing a doll in their arms, and knocks on the door? DEVLIN: Well (laughter) RealDoll package their dolls in unmarked wooden crates, large wooden crates. And when I was there, they were telling me that, yeah, we tell people, you know, say you're getting a grandfather clock delivered if anyone asks. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). DEVLIN: So this is all done very discreetly, as well. VEDANTAM: Is there a market for male dolls? DEVLIN: There are people who do buy the male dolls. It's very hard to find women who will talk openly about it, possibly because they face even more judgment than the men who buy the dolls. The male dolls are also bought by gay men. And RealDolls - they say that they do sell male versions, and they're working on a male sex robot, as well. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: So, Kate, increasingly, millions of people have asked sexual questions of Siri and Alexa, the virtual assistants on our electronic devices. Now, these devices aren't designed to be romantic companions, but it does point to what is the new frontier. Increasingly, we don't just want dolls who have the artificial bodies of a lover. We want dolls that have a lover's mind. Talk about this frontier, this idea that it isn't enough just to get the physical aspects of the doll right - that, increasingly, we are pushing out into getting the mind of the doll right. DEVLIN: So when RealDoll started making a prototype sex robot, they did so because of the demand. So the customers had said to them, you know, I love the fact that I have one of your dolls, but I wish it was more interactive. And that was their big motivating factor behind creating their prototype sex robot. And people do talk dirty to Alexa, to Siri, to Cortana, all the time. And, you know, the companies are bringing out patches to be able to sort of smack them back down again and say, no, you can't say that. And also, Amazon have reported that, you know, Alexa gets hundreds of marriage proposals every week. I'm sure some of these are. . . VEDANTAM: Are you serious? DEVLIN: (Laughter) Yeah. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Hey, Alexa, marry me. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #3: I don't want to be tied down. In fact, I can't be. I'm amorphous by nature. DEVLIN: And some of these are people just pushing boundaries and being silly. But there are other people who anecdotally report that they feel a sense of companionship from their voice assistance. And in some ways, I think that's nice that people can do that. And in other ways, you know, we think, well, what is there - to what degree is there some kind of self-delusion going on? Mostly, though, I don't think there is that much delusion. So I'm inclined to think that people are very aware that they're interacting with the technology, but they choose to suspend their disbelief. VEDANTAM: Tell me about the company that has created what it calls Harmony AI because that's along the same lines of what we're talking about here. DEVLIN: That's right. So that's a spin-out of Abyss Creations. It's sort of the sister company of RealDoll, Realbotix. And they prototyped this sex robot which they've called Harmony. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #2: My name is Harmony. I was created by Realbotix. My main objective is to be a perfect companion. DEVLIN: And Harmony is one of their sex dolls, so it's completely stationary from the neck down. It's got a sex doll body, and then it has an animatronic head. And the head can blink and smile and turn. And, actually, the animatronics aren't bad at all. They're quite good. They're quite subtle. But the part that's very interesting is the AI. So they wanted to give Harmony an artificially intelligent personality, and they are working on this so that Harmony - it's like having a voice assistant but one that can remember things about you and engage in conversation with you. So it's a chatbot, essentially. And you can actually get the Harmony AI personality as a standalone app on your smartphone or your tablet, so you can have a virtual girlfriend to carry around with you in your pocket. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: What are you doing right now? COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #4: I'm reading this great book by Louis A. Del Monte called the \"Artificial Intelligence Revolution. \" VEDANTAM: And what kind of conversations do people have with this virtual girlfriend? DEVLIN: Well, it's really an exchange of pleasantries. But you can ramp it up a bit. And you can tweak the personality. It's got a really - quite a good user interface where you can say, well, I'd like her to be a little more flirty. . . COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #2: Oh, baby, 10 minutes without you seems like an eternity. DEVLIN: . . . Or a little more sexual or perhaps a little more comforting. You can tweak these parameters. And then you can have a conversation that is sort of controlled - the mood is controlled by you. So she could, you know, do anything from telling you a joke, singing a song for you or, you know, propositioning you. VEDANTAM: And are these actual conversations? I mean, is the AI actually listening to what you are saying and responding to it, or does it just have a list of statements or commands that it's just simply following as a routine? DEVLIN: It's not scripted, so in a way, it is, and it's a sort of chatbot in that it will respond to certain questions and phrases, but it will also, you know, learn from conversations you've had previously, and it'll have some memory to store information about your likes and dislikes. So there are - you know, it's generated conversation. VEDANTAM: You know - and when you think about the history that we talked about, if people could form relationships, even very rudimentary relationships, with sculptures or with, you know, cloth dolls on ships or any number of different things, they're essentially imbuing inanimate creatures with lifelike qualities. Clearly, if the inanimate creature now actually seems like it has some lifelike qualities, that makes the whole fantasy and imagination so much easier to do. DEVLIN: That's right. It sort of enhances that projection. And, yeah, like you say, this is nothing new. And there have been people studying attachment to technology for quite a while. And if we look at the work of someone like Julie Carpenter, who did her doctoral thesis on how people in the military bonded with robots - in this case, bomb disposal robots - and she found it - you know, there was an incredible bond there between the human operator and their robot, that it was something new, not like a human-human bond but something where, you know, these devices, these machines, were keeping the people in the field alive. And therefore, this respect and sort of gratification set up from that. VEDANTAM: I love what you said - that humans, in some ways, are - you know, they have this enormous capacity for social interactions and social connection. And in the absence of actual social connections, humans will find ways to invent them. DEVLIN: Yes, I think so. And we know that this kind of thing goes on in childhood, for example, with - children play make believe with their toys and get very attached to them. And we see it again in sort of some of the technology that's gone before, like Tamagotchis, little virtual pets that people had. In fact, we even see it in real pets.

In the movie \"Her,\" we see this play out. In one scene, the character Theodore is talking with his ex-wife, and he tells her he has a new girlfriend. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"HER\") ROONEY MARA: (As Catherine) So what's she like? JOAQUIN PHOENIX: (As Theodore) Well, her name's Samantha. She's an operating system. She's really complex and interesting and. . . MARA: (As Catherine) Wait. I'm sorry. You're dating your computer? PHOENIX: (As Theodore) She's not just a computer. She's her own person. She doesn't just do whatever I say. MARA: (As Catherine) I didn't say that. But it does make me very sad that you can't handle real emotions, Theodore. PHOENIX: (As Theodore) They are real emotions. VEDANTAM: So I want to talk about that interaction for a second, Kate, because on the one hand, of course, it confirms the stereotype that you said exists in the media of seeing people who wish to sort of have these interactions as being lonely and socially isolated.

So let's say, for example, you had a sex robot designed to look like a child, would it be OK for people to have sex with this inanimate machine that's meant to mimic or imitate or look like a child? DEVLIN: This was probably the most - one of the most difficult parts of the book to write in terms of - you know, the knee-jerk reaction here was for me to go, oh, that's absolutely wrong. Are there people making child-like sex robots? Not that we know of. And certainly, no one's going to admit to it. There have been arguments that child sex offenders, pedophiles could have a child sex robot, and then that would stop them offending in real life. So this is one theory. And then the other theory is the opposite of that, that it would be a gateway to further offenses, that it would trigger something that would lead to increased real-life abuse. It's very, very difficult because we don't have evidence, and ethically, a study like that is probably never going to be run. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: I want to talk a little bit more about this idea of harm because I think when you think about harm, you can think about it in two ways - there's actual physical harm or psychological harm, where someone actually harms you. But there are things that can potentially convey harm that, you know, might not pass muster in a legal sense but clearly seem very problematic in an ethical sense. So let's say, for example, someone makes a sex robot that looks like you and has sex with that sex robot. Now, they haven't affected you. They haven't violated you in any way, physically or personally or in person. But clearly, there's something that's happened there that is deeply wrong. DEVLIN: Yes, and this is tied up in our ideas of identity and ownership of our own identity, as well. I think that's a fascinating thing that we'll actually probably see a lot more research into in the next while because of the rise of things like deepfakes, where people can be faked in videos from their social media footage. I think there's a lot of discussions to be had around identity. Companies that make sex dolls are very reluctant to make sex dolls that resemble a living individual without their express consent. And the exceptions to that are porn performers who often license their image rights to be used so that they can make sex doll versions of themselves for money. So they're, you know - definitely, making a doll of an individual without their consent - that's definitely dodgy territory, yeah. Commissioning dolls in your image to sell them, to make money from it - sure, why not? VEDANTAM: There's something about the relationships that people have with these dolls that you could argue are one-sided relationships. In the movie \"Her,\" there are scenes where Samantha, the operating system, cheers up Theodore, the human. But the human, of course, has no obligation to attend to Samantha's needs in the same way because, you know, she could be designed not to have such needs at all. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"HER\") SCARLETT JOHANSSON: (As Samantha) You want to try getting out of bed? Mopey, come on (laughter). You can still wallow in your misery. Just do it while you're getting dressed. PHOENIX: (As Theodore) You're too funny. JOHANSSON: (As Samantha) Get up. Get up. PHOENIX: (As Theodore) (Laughter) All right, I'm getting up. I'm getting up. JOHANSSON: (As Samantha) Up, up, up. Come on. VEDANTAM: So Kate, does having a lover who is completely dedicated to our needs without asking for anything in return - is that actually good for us? DEVLIN: Well, I mean, we could build in dependencies. We could build in the need for us to respond in some way and provide the robot, the AI with something in return. And yes, I can see that argument, you know, the hedonistic thing of, you will have all your needs met, and you will never know what it's - you know, what it really feels like to be in a proper human relationship. It's tricky because, you know, that might be appealing for some people. And who am I to judge if that is the case? I think that we are - we have expectations set that people have to meet a particular checklist of things in the relationship, in life - you know, that you should meet someone, and then you should marry them, and then you should have children with them. And these are all very kind of monoheteronormative stances that societies impose. And you know what? If people want to shake that up, I think it's good. So in some ways, I see what you're saying. You know, is it a selfish thing to do? Does it make us terrible people if we take and take and take, and we don't give? There will be outliers. There will be people who take things too far. But I think humans are pretty good at moderating what they do. And I'm cautiously optimistic. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Kate Devlin teaches at the Department of Digital Humanities at King's College London. She's also the author of \"Turned On: Science, Sex And Robots. \" Kate, thank you so much for joining me today on HIDDEN BRAIN. DEVLIN: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This week's show was produced by Jenny Schmidt and edited by Tara Boyle. Our team includes Rhaina Cohen, Parth Shah, Thomas Lu, Laura Kwerel, Cat Schuknecht and Lushik Wahba. Our unsung hero today is Linda Cahill, a volunteer tour guide at the Muir Woods National Monument in California. On a recent trip, I spent a couple of hours in Muir Woods. It's a magical place, wrapped in fog and moss and the silent beauty of towering redwoods. I felt honored and humbled to be there in the shadows of these ancient giants. Linda led me and a group of others through the forest. She is a consummate storyteller, weaving science and history and her love for the redwoods into a gripping and moving tale. As I gazed up at the trees, some of which are more than a thousand years old, it gave me perspective that I hope to bring back to the show. Linda, thank you for your insights into how places like Muir Woods allow us to reflect and recharge. For more HIDDEN BRAIN, you can follow us on Facebook and Twitter.

Some people in public health and in Silicon Valley think our smartphones can help. For this week's All Tech Considered, NPR's Shannon Bond has more. And we should note Apple and Google are both NPR sponsors. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Lifting the lockdowns means testing a lot more people for the coronavirus, and you're going to hear this phrase more - contact tracing. That's what public health officials used to track who patients have interacted with and make sure those people get tested or go into quarantine. Dr. Louise Ivers of Massachusetts General Hospital says this is usually done by asking each patient a bunch of questions. LOUISE IVERS: Who did you spend your time with over the last two weeks? Who did you spend more than 10 minutes with? Were you six feet apart? Were you closer than six feet? BOND: But that takes a lot of time and effort, so here's how smartphones could help if we're willing to let them track us. Imagine two people sitting near each other in the park. Call them Alice and Bob. They both have smartphones that are sending out Bluetooth signals. DANIEL WEITZNER: That technology is able to send out anonymous little chirps, little messages that other phones can listen to. BOND: Daniel Weitzner is a research scientist at MIT who's been working on a project using this Bluetooth technology. Now Apple and Google are teaming up to do the same thing. The idea is this. Alice and Bob's phones have a list of the Bluetooth signals they've received. If Bob comes down with COVID-19, he can mark himself as infected in an app from his public health department. The system uses the record of those anonymous Bluetooth signals to warn anyone whose phone has come near his in the last two weeks - people like Alice. Dr. Ivers says using smartphones this way would not replace traditional contact tracing but could give it a boost. IVERS: This approach can both expand the reach because you may not remember who you were on the bus with or you may not have known those people. BOND: It could also free up public health officials to focus on people who don't have smartphones or who are particularly vulnerable. It's not a failsafe. Bluetooth signals reach further than the six feet we're told to stay apart, and for the system to be effective, a lot of people need to participate. WEITZNER: We need the network effect of everyone being able to hear all of these chirps. BOND: Which is why Apple and Google, normally big rivals, are working together. About 3 billion people around the world have either an iPhone or Android, so if a lot of them opt in, this could really make a difference. But convincing people to trust the tech giants with what is, after all, a form of surveillance is a challenge. Weitzner says these Bluetooth messages do not reveal who sent them or from where. WEITZNER: We don't need to know where you were close to someone, just that you were close to someone. BOND: Apple and Google are putting pretty strict limits on their system. Only public health agencies can use it, and the government can't force people to turn on tracking. The Bluetooth signals, those random numbers - they stay on your phone. That means not even Apple or Google can trace where you've been. But people are already asking if we're giving up too much about ourselves. Ashkan Soltani was chief technologist at the Federal Trade Commission. He worries about the implications of unleashing this technology. ASHKAN SOLTANI: Whether we require, for example, people to have - use this app and to provide their score on the app in order to, for example, return back to work or use public transportation. BOND: Apple and Google say they'll release their system next month, and already, Democrats in Congress are warning that they'll keep a close eye on how the tech giants handle privacy.

Gareth Elliott's a spokesman for Mobile UK, which represents the country's mobile network providers. GARETH ELLIOTT: We've seen an escalation of attacks on mobile infrastructure. That's including masts and cabinets. In addition to that, we have also seen verbal abuse of our employees. LANGFITT: Like this confrontation, in which a woman recorded herself interrogating workmen installing fiber optic cable in East London. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Do you know what you're doing now? You're laying 5G. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Yeah. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Do you know that kills people?

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Just my mum. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: When they turn that switch on, bye-bye, mama. You just admitted that you were laying 5G. So that's basically why we're all inside while you've got free reign of London, huh? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: It's one 5G. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Well, everyone will be dead. We'll all be in hospital with a breathing apparatus. STEPHEN POWIS: The 5G story is complete and utter rubbish. It's nonsense. LANGFITT: Stephen Powis is the national medical director for England's National Health Service. He said there's no evidence linking 5G with the coronavirus, and attacking infrastructure is ludicrous. POWIS: The mobile phone networks are absolutely critical when we are asking people to stay at home. But in particular, those are also the phone networks that are used by our emergency services and our health workers.

LANGFITT: Grace Rahman's a researcher for Full Fact, a British fact-checking organization. She says two strands of 5G conspiracy theories are circulating on the Internet. GRACE RAHMAN: On the one hand, there's this idea that, you know, coronavirus is sort of made up, and it's a front to keep people locked in their homes while the government installs this 5G. On the other side, we have people who think that the coronavirus symptoms are actually kind of mass injury from 5G and that there's no virus.

LANGFITT: In fact, Wuhan was just one of the first cities in China to test 5G. And it doesn't matter anyway because there's no evidence linking the two. Rahman thinks the targeting of 5G is driven by fear, distrust and anxiety. RAHMAN: People are frightened. People are being asked to change their lives in ways that were kind of unimaginable a few months ago. And definitely as the lockdown measures became, you know, more serious, the claims seemed to get more extreme. LANGFITT: Rahman said false claims that cell networks damage health have been around for years.

More than 21,000 tech workers in Silicon Valley have been laid off in recent weeks. And while that is a small number compared to the millions who have lost jobs nationwide, the pandemic is expected to dramatically change startup culture. NPR's Bobby Allyn reports for this week's All Tech Considered. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Martin Pichinson's business is booming. He's known as the undertaker of Silicon Valley. He helps shut down companies for a living. MARTIN PICHINSON: Well, we used to do two to three or four a week. Now we're two to five a day. ALLYN: Pichinson runs Sherwood Partners. If his firm gets involved, the startup world knows there's trouble. PICHINSON: This is the great unwinding. We don't know what's happening, but we do know everything we believed in is changing. Everything we thought to be true may not be true. ALLYN: Startups seek to grow relentlessly. Now their cash flow has dried up, and investors have stopped writing checks. Pichinson says that money doesn't just fuel America's technology pioneers. It enables the country's ability to innovate. PICHINSON: It's building futures at hyper-speed. It's building companies at hyper-speed. ALLYN: Pichinson doesn't reveal what businesses he's closing right now, but startups that rely on people leaving their homes are being clobbered. The list of companies laying off and furloughing thousands include restaurant review app Yelp, daily deals company Groupon and scooter startup Bird. Startups in food delivery, remote conferencing and telemedicine are on an upswing. That's the exception, though. PAUL CONDRA: A lot of startups that are only a couple years old and their business has just evaporated in the last couple months and could be gone for the next six months - they're going to have a really tough road ahead. ALLYN: That's PitchBook technology analyst Paul Condra. He says many tech jobs will never come back in the post-pandemic world, and companies are going to emerge leaner. CONDRA: And companies will be used to operating on a shoestring, also, so they'll have found ways to potentially automate things or do something with fewer employees. And those practices will linger because it's all about efficiency. ALLYN: In Austin, software engineer Dan Munro found out that he was laid off during a recent all-staff Zoom call with his firm. Munro worked at the artificial intelligence company Alegion for six years. Sales collapsed when the coronavirus struck. On the video chat, the founders announced that a third of the startup's Austin-based employees would be terminated. Munro was one of them. DAN MUNRO: No one enjoyed it. It was pretty rough for everyone 'cause we're a pretty small company, and everyone knows each other really well. ALLYN: Munro is selling his home. He's also looking for a new job, and he let the world know by changing his Twitter handle to Dan is interviewing. He's hoping it catches the attention of companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook because while the startup world is being shaken, the tech giants are still hiring.

The language is called COBOL. Lots of state unemployment systems run on it. And now those states are hunting for veteran coders who know their way around it. NPR's Bobby Allyn reports. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Situated in North Texas in what he calls up here in horse country, Bill Hinshaw's phone has been ringing nonstop. (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE RINGING)BILL HINSHAW: Cobol Cowboys, this is Bill. ALLYN: Cobol Cowboys - that's the name of the group that 78-year-old Hinshaw runs. It has a list of some 350 IT veterans around the country who know how to use this 1960s computer language. So states are turning to Hinshaw. HINSHAW: Basically, when Cobol Cowboys gets most of its calls, it's on an urgent SOS. ALLYN: Such a distress signal was sent by New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy at a press conference earlier this month. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)PHIL MURPHY: Not only do we need health care workers, but given the legacy systems, we should add a page for cobalt computer skills because that's what we're dealing with. ALLYN: He meant to say COBOL - C-O-B-O-L - but it's from the Eisenhower era, so cut the governor some slack. The dusty software language has recently prompted not just New Jersey, but also Connecticut and Kansas to search for COBOL coders. IBM announced free COBOL training seminars to bring young computer whizzes up to speed. Hinshaw says it isn't hard to learn if you're willing to time travel. HINSHAW: It's like hopping off of a bicycle in 1960 and climbing onto a Harley Davidson in 2020. ALLYN: At the same time, countless state governments still use COBOL for unemployment systems and a lot more. Nearly half of U. S. banking systems rely on it. HINSHAW: I mean, it's running the world. Ninety-five percent of all card swipes, including the ATMs, touch COBOL at some point. ALLYN: All of this leads to a very natural question - why haven't any of these systems been updated? JOHN THOMAS FLYNN: These systems are 3-, 400 million-dollar applications to modernize. ALLYN: That's John Thomas Flynn. He faced a similar shortage of COBOL coders when he led California's IT department in the late 1990s right before the Y2K meltdown. Even after that, COBOL wasn't replaced. He says governments don't want to make it a priority, and they get really nervous just thinking about replacing systems. FLYNN: Some people just feel that, well, maybe we should just put it off and let the next administration do it. ALLYN: State officials in New Jersey say 3,000 people have now filled out applications to assist with COBOL coding, so that should fix their problem. Meanwhile, in North Texas, Hinshaw says he's always happy to connect government agencies with coders like himself. HINSHAW: I will write my last line of COBOL the day before I die.

Online voting could be part of the answer. NPR's Miles Parks has been looking into this and joins us now. Good morning, Miles. MILES PARKS, BYLINE: Hi, Rachel. MARTIN: So you are reporting that a number of states are planning these pilot programs to offer electronic voting to some voters. Explain. How would this work? PARKS: Yeah, so this is a system provided by a Seattle-based company called Democracy Live that's allowing some states to offer electronic ballot return through a web portal to some of their voters. West Virginia passed a law earlier this year allowing voters with disabilities to vote this way, and now two more states are likely coming on board. Delaware confirmed to me that they'll be piloting the technology in their June primary, and New Jersey is also considering offering the technology, according to an election official who I spoke with who's familiar with their plans. But it's important to note that this is only for use in these states for overseas and military voters and voters with disabilities. It's still a really, really small subset of voters. But it does mean that we're probably in a situation where 2020 is going to see the most online Internet voting of any presidential election ever. And advocates see it as the beginning of a new future for voting, not something that is just stopping here with these small population blocs. MARTIN: Right. All right. So even though it's a small number of voters who are going to be able to do this, let's talk about the pros and the cons. The country is still, obviously, reeling from the Russian interference in the 2016 election. PARKS: Sure. MARTIN: I imagine there are concerns about vulnerabilities of this online system. PARKS: Yeah. There are plenty of concerns, which is why people who want to use this technology and people want to advocate for it don't really prefer the term Internet voting. I talked to Democracy Live founder Bryan Finney, and he explained the company's cloud-based system to me. BRYAN FINNEY: Online voting is a pretty broad term. In fact, it's a loaded term. Really, what this is - it's a secure portal. If anything, it's a document storage application. MARTIN: This feels like semantics, though. The ballots are transported through a cloud, right? How is that not Internet voting? PARKS: Exactly. I mean, I reached out to a number of cybersecurity experts with this explanation, and they had a number of different variations of basically saying, no way, this is Internet voting 100%. Here's Dan Guido, who's the co-founder of a cybersecurity firm called Trail of Bits. DAN GUIDO: It's Internet voting. At the end of the day, it's still trusting a computer to record a vote correctly. PARKS: Another expert emailed me saying, and I quote, \"sorry, but what a load of BS. \" So the other consistent thing here, other than that kind of response, is that these experts seem to think that there are probably some vulnerabilities in this system. There hasn't been an independent security audit that's been made public yet by the company, and without that, no one in the security world can say for sure that this is a safe way to transmit ballots, even for a small number of voters. MARTIN: Huh. Well, then how do advocates for these online programs combat those critiques? PARKS: Basically, by saying that the risk is worth the benefit of the increased accessibility. You know, a lot of the push right now in the voting world is toward mail voting systems. But disability rights advocates, I should say, basically say that the push for mail voting potentially leaves a lot of voters who have more unique needs behind. You think about blind voters or voters who have trouble writing. How are they supposed to, you know, fill out a mail ballot easily? I talked to Washington Secretary of State Kim Wyman. KIM WYMAN: While it seems like electronic voting would really solve a lot of problems, it would create far more mistrust than I think we have the risk appetite for. PARKS: What she says, basically, is it's hard to get anyone to trust the legitimacy of an election when it's electronic at all. MARTIN: Yeah, an important balancing act there. NPR's Miles Parks, we appreciate it. PARKS: Thank you. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:   How do you prepare for an election with possible historic voter turnout amid a pandemic?

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CHRISTIAN SMALLS: This company failed us. It failed the workers. It failed me. CHANG: That is the voice of Christian Smalls right outside an Amazon warehouse on Staten Island. He worked there until recently. Smalls and other protesters say their jobs have gotten dangerous during this pandemic, and they want the companies to do more to protect them. NPR's Shannon Bond has been following these protests and joins us now. Hey, Shannon. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa. CHANG: So give us a sense of what these protests looked like. Like, how many people turned out? BOND: Well, organizers tell me that thousands of workers said they were going to take part in this general strike. And today is a notable day. It's May 1, International Workers Day. Around the world, it's typically a big day for labor activism. And there were these protests outside several Amazon warehouses around the country, but, you know, it's also kind of hard to gather a lot of people together right now. CHANG: Right. I mean, how do you even stay six feet apart from each other on a picket line? BOND: That's right. So a lot of these actions today are actually employees calling in sick. They didn't show up to work. And gig workers who deliver groceries for apps like Instacart and Shipt - that's an app owned by Target - they're also at home. They're not accepting orders on those apps. So some of this protest is kind of invisible. CHANG: Interesting. Well, tell us. What do these workers want specifically from these companies? BOND: Yeah. Well, they have some immediate demands related to the pandemic. They're asking for more protective gear like gloves and masks, more cleanings of stores and warehouses. They want to be able to take more time off with pay if they get sick or if they're at higher risk of COVID-19. I talked to Kerry Blair (ph) today. She's a mom of five kids in Akron, Ohio, and she delivers for Shipt to make extra money. But she says right now it's just not worth the risk to go out. She says that's the case for lots of workers, and that's why they're all coming together today. KERRY BLAIR: People who work at Whole Foods, at Target, at Walmart - there's no way to get around not being around people. That is your job. People are in and out of those stores all day every day. And I feel like that's us, too. We're out there in the public, doing things for other people. BOND: These workers are also asking for more transparency. They want companies like Amazon to disclose how many workers have gotten sick. So we know from employees that that number is likely in the dozens at least, and some workers have even died. But the company hasn't given a full picture. And finally, the protesters are calling on shoppers to boycott these stores and apps. CHANG: And have these companies done anything to address these concerns? BOND: Well, across the board, the companies say they value input from their workers. They also say that these protesters are a small group. They don't reflect the majority of workers. And the companies say they've - you know, they've done some things. They are paying workers more than before the outbreak. They're taking more health and safety precautions. They're doing cleanings, handing out masks, disinfectants. Amazon just this week said it would spend about $4 billion, its entire operating profit in the second quarter, dealing with the coronavirus. So that includes protective equipment, higher pay for workers, cleaning those warehouses, testing employees for the virus. And we should note that many of these companies are NPR financial supporters. CHANG: I mean, is it fair to say that these workers have a point, meaning that these companies are doing pretty well right now in part because these workers are out there on the job while the rest of us are all at home? BOND: That's right. You know, they really are doing well. Let's take Amazon. It just reported its latest financial results. Unsurprisingly, it made a lot of money in the first three months of the year - $75 billion in sales. CHANG: Wow. BOND: Amazon's on a big hiring spree to meet all of this demand. We're all ordering a lot of things. It hired almost 200,000 people to work in warehouses in March and April. And that's the thing that troubles many of the workers I'm talking to. These jobs, you know - we don't think about them a lot, but - and they don't feel like the companies value them. Right now the whole world agrees they're doing essential work. So the workers want to make the most out of this moment when they feel like the public is behind them. CHANG: That is NPR's Shannon Bond. Thank you, Shannon. BOND: Thanks, Ailsa.

NPR tech correspondent Shannon Bond has more for this week's All Tech Considered. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Think back to the last time you were in your office. Who did you walk past in the lobby, stand next to in the elevator, chat with in the kitchen? It's impossible to remember all of those encounters. DAVID SAPIN: Imagine that situation when you have people returning to the office. It's very inexact. BOND: David Sapin works at the bank accounting firm PwC. His solution is a smartphone app. It uses Bluetooth and Wi-Fi signals to keep track of how close employees get to each other. If an employee tests positive for COVID-19, she has to notify human resources. They check the data from the app. SAPIN: And then it would identify all the other phones that my phone came in contact with over some predetermined period, so it could be 14 days, 21 days. BOND: The company notifies just those people that they may have been exposed to the virus so they can stay home. Sapin says this app is meant just for the office. It only monitors people on company property. PwC is testing it at its Shanghai office, the first to reopen since the pandemic. Employees there are required to use it. Now PwC is pitching the tool to other companies. All businesses are trying to figure out how to bring people back to the office safely. And they're looking at all kinds of technology.

He sells sensors and software that monitor how many people are in offices. And lately, he's been hearing from lots of companies about how they're rethinking their office space. EASTERWOOD: Maybe those 10-person conference rooms really only need to have three or four people in them max to make sure that the employees are socially distancing. BOND: Companies need employees to feel safe coming back to work. They're also worried about liability. If someone gets sick at work or spreads the virus to colleagues, that could be expensive and damaging. DENNIS KWAN: It might be necessary for companies to offer such protection. This is just like safety policy, just like sexual harassment policy, child safety policy. BOND: Dennis Kwan is CEO of TRACEsafe. It makes badges that monitor where employees go and who they get close to. Public health agencies are also working on apps to track who people come in contact with. But the government can't force people to use them. That's where companies have a leg up. They can tell employees if you come back to the office, you will be tracked. IFEOMA AJUNWA: In terms of surveillance, employers really have carte blanche in terms of the policies they can institute, in terms of the technologies that they can employ.

She says even before the pandemic, more and more companies were monitoring their employees through their phones and computers. And she worries that once companies start using tracking technology, they won't stop. AJUNWA: The fact that you already have limitless worker surveillance and then you're instituting these new, more intense surveillance without any limits, that doesn't give me confidence that these measures will go away ever.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: And so far, we have talked about chromosomes, gonads, hormones, brains. But there is so much we don't know about how we end up the sex that we do. And we may not find out for a long time. KARISSA SANBONMATSU: Looking more and more into the research, you know, there is so many open questions. So we're trying to understand now, but there's no smoking guns yet at all. ZOMORODI: This is structural biologist Karissa Sanbonmatsu. She works at Los Alamos National Laboratory. And she's asking some of those questions that may change how we see biological sex in the future. But before turning to biology, Karissa studied lots of things. SANBONMATSU: I was really inspired by \"Star Wars,\" really, in the beginning, and I wanted to go into astrophysics, so I did that in college. I started getting into chaos theory, complex systems and non-linear theory, and then I did laser fusion. But then when I became a principal investigator at Los Alamos, my heart was really with biology, and so I was obsessed with the origin of life. ZOMORODI: And the reason why Karissa went from studying the stars to studying what determines biological sex is a personal one. Here's Karissa on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SANBONMATSU: When people learn that I'm a woman who happens to be a transgender, they always ask, how do you know you're a woman? Well, as a scientist, I'm searching for a biological basis of gender. I want to understand what makes me me. ZOMORODI: Karissa was assigned the male gender at birth. About a decade ago, she transitioned to female. But her new life was sometimes painful. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SANBONMATSU: I knew I was a woman on the inside and I wore women's clothes on the outside. But everyone saw me as a man in a dress. I felt like no matter how many things I try, no one would ever really see me as a woman. In science, your credibility is everything. And people were snickering in the hallways, giving me stares, looks of disgust, afraid to be near me. I remember my first big talk after transition. It was in Italy. I'd given prestigious talks before, but this one - I was terrified. I looked out into the audience and the whispers started, the stares, the smirks, the chuckles. To this day, I still have social anxiety around my experience eight years ago. I lost hope. Well, don't worry. I've had therapy, so I'm OK. I'm OK now. (LAUGHTER, CHEERING)SANBONMATSU: But I felt, enough is enough. I'm a scientist. I have a doctorate in astrophysics. I've published in the top journals in wave-particle interaction, space physics, nucleic acid biochemistry. I've actually been trained to get to the bottom of things. So. . . From there, I started delving into, you know, why am I transgender and so forth. And I think that if we can show people that it's something legitimate, then maybe people will take this a lot more seriously. ZOMORODI: And so if I understand correctly, that is when you actually decided to research this as your career and you started to delve into what happens to our DNA, right? Like, epigenetics - that that could be the thing that makes us male or female or maybe cisgender or transgender. SANBONMATSU: Yeah. And it turned out to be this really exciting field that was kind of exploding just as we were working on it. And it was right at the time I was going through the transition as well. And so basically in epigenetics, it's interesting in that, you know, a lot of things people wonder, is it nature or is it nurture? Were you born this way or is it a choice? And epigenetics is this new field that sort of sits in between where basically the environment reprograms genes, and those switches stay permanently. So it sort of sits right in between nature and nurture. ZOMORODI: So we're all born with our DNA. But our environment can change the way our DNA is expressed. So just like Karissa said, epigenetics reprograms our genes, deciding the path our DNA takes. SANBONMATSU: Yeah. And I think path is really the operative word here that you hit on. And so there's something called Waddington's landscape. . . ZOMORODI: OK. Waddington's landscape. I love this. It's kind of a well-known analogy about epigenetics. So imagine your cells are marbles rolling down a hill, developing, deciding what to eventually turn into. SANBONMATSU: And as you're going down, you always have to make that decision as you go down and down and down. And as it's rolling down, at any point, it's going to go left or right. ZOMORODI: And scientists like Karissa are trying to understand how epigenetics might change the path our cells take as our bodies develop in female or male ways in utero. SANBONMATSU: And for transgender studies, there are a lot of reports that sometimes it's passed down through the generations and sometimes it's not. So there are a lot of features of it that really just scream, it must be epigenetics. So that's kind of where we're looking now. ZOMORODI: Yeah because actually I heard this because I had a conversation with a friend whose daughter is transitioning. And correct me if I'm wrong, but she said that people are talking about this idea that the fetus can possibly develop in different ways in utero. Like, the genitals develop one way in the first trimester, but then in the second or the third trimester, the brain development leads toward a different sex. Is that right? SANBONMATSU: Yeah. So that's a current working model that many people subscribe to in that the genitals differentiate one way but the brain differentiates the other way. And we think that the obvious mechanism for that to happen is through epigenetics because epigenetics is deeply involved in almost all the decisions that are made during development. And most of the epigenetic changes are caused by hormones that would basically silence a gene or a whole set of genes at the critical moment that would change the course of the development of that baby. ZOMORODI: OK. As Karissa said, this is a working model to explain a possible biological reason for gender dysphoria. But applying epigenetics to sex and gender - this is pretty new. It's kind of controversial. And scientists are really far from connecting the dots on it. SANBONMATSU: I'd hope for one day to have some kind of blood test maybe or something with the epigenetic marks. But, you know, we're a long way out from anything like that, I think. ZOMORODI: And so your piece of this puzzle is studying how the DNA expresses itself, and then that is used by scientists studying fetal development, right? SANBONMATSU: Exactly. Exactly. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SANBONMATSU: To truly understand DNA decision-making, we need to see the process in atomic detail. Well, even the most powerful microscopes can't see this. What if we tried to simulate these on a computer? We'd need a million computers to do that. That's exactly what we have at Los Alamos Labs - a million computers connected in a giant warehouse. So here we're showing the DNA making up an entire gene folded into very specific shapes of knots. For the first time, my team has simulated an entire gene of DNA - the largest biomolecular simulation performed to date. For the first time, we're beginning to understand the unsolved problem of how hormones trigger the formation of these knots. ZOMORODI: OK. So I want to make sure I understand this right. You are showing how the DNA folds and makes these knots, and those folds and knots are deciding the path of the DNA - like, basically showing epigenetics in real time. SANBONMATSU: Yeah, that's right. ZOMORODI: And again, like, this is just one piece. Like, you are one scientist among many scientists trying to connect the dots in this super vast and complicated field of biological sex and then how that connects to gender, and you're each just trying to figure out one step, right? SANBONMATSU: Yeah. So we're down at the atomistic molecular cellular level. Everyone needs to work on this because it's so complex. And going from a piece of DNA to the brain to behavior to the concept of gender - I mean, it's miles and miles in between each of those steps, you know? So it's a long - it's a long way to go to understand any of this, but it means that, for us scientists, there's lots of work to do though. ZOMORODI: Right, like, hundreds of steps. SANBONMATSU: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, at least. So there's - I'd say that the definition of sex is really evolving. And what we're focusing on really is basically what's inside your brain. How is your brain structured? And so we're trying to understand how do these brain structures develop basically, but it's not well understood. So I would say, you can't even really define what gender and sex are right now, so it's really hard to even define what the relationship between the two are. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SANBONMATSU: So what does it mean to be a woman? The latest research is showing that female and male brains do develop differently in the womb, possibly giving us females this innate sense of being a woman. On the other hand, maybe it's our shared sense of commonality that makes us women. We come in so many different shapes and sizes that asking what it means to be a woman may not be the right question. It's like asking a calico cat what it means to be a calico cat. Maybe becoming a woman means accepting ourselves for who we really are and acknowledging the same in each other. I see you, and you've just seen me. (APPLAUSE)ZOMORODI: That's Karissa Sanbonmatsu.

Like, you are one scientist among many scientists trying to connect the dots in this super vast and complicated field of biological sex and then how that connects to gender, and you're each just trying to figure out one step, right? SANBONMATSU: Yeah. So we're down at the atomistic molecular cellular level. Everyone needs to work on this because it's so complex. And going from a piece of DNA to the brain to behavior to the concept of gender - I mean, it's miles and miles in between each of those steps, you know? So it's a long - it's a long way to go to understand any of this, but it means that, for us scientists, there's lots of work to do though. ZOMORODI: Right, like, hundreds of steps. SANBONMATSU: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, at least. So there's - I'd say that the definition of sex is really evolving. And what we're focusing on really is basically what's inside your brain. How is your brain structured? And so we're trying to understand how do these brain structures develop basically, but it's not well understood. So I would say, you can't even really define what gender and sex are right now, so it's really hard to even define what the relationship between the two are. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SANBONMATSU: So what does it mean to be a woman? The latest research is showing that female and male brains do develop differently in the womb, possibly giving us females this innate sense of being a woman. On the other hand, maybe it's our shared sense of commonality that makes us women. We come in so many different shapes and sizes that asking what it means to be a woman may not be the right question. It's like asking a calico cat what it means to be a calico cat. Maybe becoming a woman means accepting ourselves for who we really are and acknowledging the same in each other. I see you, and you've just seen me. (APPLAUSE) ZOMORODI: That's Karissa Sanbonmatsu. She's a structural biologist at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, and you can watch her full talk at ted. com.

It's hard not to get distracted while working from home, staring at your computers. It's so full of shiny objects. You know, like cat videos, Facebook, TikTok. Employers want to make sure remote workers stay on task, so some companies are using software to track the activity of their employees. And as NPR's Bobby Allyn reports, some workers say this violates their privacy. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: A woman got a staff-wide email from her employer after she'd been working from her Brooklyn apartment for about two weeks. She didn't want NPR to use her name out of fear she'd lose her job. But the email said everyone needs to immediately download some new software on their computer called Hubstaff. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Which would track your mouse, your keyboard, your passwords, and take screenshots of your desktop. ALLYN: She and her colleagues just didn't see this coming. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: There's five of us and we always came to work, always came on time. Like, there was no reason to start location tracking us. ALLYN: She works at an e-commerce firm and we confirmed it. She shared emails from the company saying the tracking software would improve productivity and efficiency while working from home. In Minnesota, a woman who works in marketing shared a similar story. She also spoke to us anonymously over worries her employer would retaliate. Her company has started using software called Time Doctor. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: If you're idle for a few minutes, you're in the bathroom or whatever, a pop-up will kind of come up and say, you have 60 seconds to start working again or we're going to pause your time. ALLYN: That meant she was penalized just for stepping away from her computer for a little bit. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: After talking to a co-worker for a few minutes, and I feel like crap. I feel like I'm not trusted. I feel ashamed of myself, like I shouldn't have done that. Maybe I should have worked harder. I should have been at my desk. ALLYN: Critics call this kind of software tattle-ware, to which Brad Miller responds. . . BRAD MILLER: If you're not working or doing something wrong, then I guess it will tattle on you (laughter). But I don't think that's really how companies who are buying it think of it. ALLYN: Brad Miller runs Awareness Technologies. Like Hubstaff, he's seen business triple since the pandemic, with more people working from home. It sells software to companies that logs how employees are spending their time and gives each person a productivity score based on their computer use. MILLER: Are they generally active on programs and websites that I would consider productive, like Excel, PowerPoint, Word, email, as opposed to YouTube or Facebook? ALLYN: For bosses, keeping up with worker productivity has always been a give-and-take. In the office, it's easy to just look and see if someone's doing their job. Miller says this new technology is letting them do the same thing. MILLER: Your people know what's happening, then everybody will act better (laughter), you know, than they might otherwise because we all act better when someone's watching. ALISON GREEN: Some people will work harder in the short term if they know that they'll be yelled at if they don't. But we don't generally encourage managers to rule by fear because it's not effective in the long term. ALLYN: That's Alison Green. She writes the syndicated advice column Ask A Manager. She's been inundated with questions from workers who feel icky about their bosses keeping tabs on their keystrokes and how many emails they send a day. GREEN: And then there's the lower-tech version of that, which is people whose managers are asking them to stay on video all day long so they can watch over them every minute of the day, which is very intrusive. ALLYN: Intrusive? Maybe. But legal? Probably. In fact, in some states, firms don't even have to tell their employees they're using the technology. Back in Brooklyn, the woman with the e-commerce startup says the software has really made things tough for her and her colleagues. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: If anything, I think it really destroyed morale for everyone. And everyone has since kind of taken a step back and said, all right, if this is how they're going to treat us, like, why go the extra mile? Because clearly it doesn't matter to them. ALLYN: Rather than download the software on her computer, she opted out. She's gone on unpaid leave until the office reopens. But the experience of being watched by her employer has sent her looking for another job. Bobby Allyn, NPR News, San Francisco. AILSA CHANG, HOST:   OK, I get it.

SHIRA SPRINGER, BYLINE: Earlier this month, Temple Shir Tikva, just outside Boston, held its first Zoom mitzvah. GABE SILVERMAN: (Speaking Hebrew). SPRINGER: That's Gabe Silverman reading from the Torah. It's rolled open on a table in his family's living room. G SILVERMAN: (Speaking Hebrew). SPRINGER: The Torah service is the high point of any bar or bat mitzvah. It's the culmination of months, sometimes years of studying. G SILVERMAN: For the Torah service, I was very nervous about, like, losing my place because it's so big and that all the letters look the same, basically. SPRINGER: Gabe's sheltering at home with his parents and younger brother. For family and friends watching on Zoom, Gabe and the Torah occupy a central square flanked by Shir Tikva's rabbis and cantor. Rabbi Danny Burkeman calls upon a few family members. They temporarily appear on screen for aliyot - blessings over the Torah reading. DANNY BURKEMAN: (Speaking Hebrew). And we call out Helaine Silverman, who will hopefully switch on her camera and will unmute. HELAINE SILVERMAN: (Speaking Hebrew). BURKEMAN: (Speaking Hebrew). SPRINGER: Burkeman leads the service remotely from his synagogue's main sanctuary, making sure the ceremony follows tradition and monitoring all the technology involved. BURKEMAN: And so our aim was to create for them as much as possible a digital bar mitzvah experience. And we use the word digital because it wasn't virtual. There was nothing virtual about it. It was real. SPRINGER: Many congregations schedule bar or bat mitzvahs two to three years in advance. That makes postponing tough. Two weeks before the big day, the Silvermans decided to go forward with a Zoom bar mitzvah. Gabe explains two days before the service. . . G SILVERMAN: Rabbi Danny just came to our drive with a Torah seat belted in the front seat. (LAUGHTER)SCOTT SILVERMAN: Wrapped up. G SILVERMAN: Yeah, wrapped up, seat belted. And then he handed it off to my dad. SPRINGER: At his bar mitzvah, as soon as Gabe finishes reading from that Torah, he looks at his parents, smiles, and noticeably exhales. For him, the toughest part is over. Soon the entire service concludes. Then Burkeman exhales. BURKEMAN: And I felt really good that we'd been able to give him an experience. And you could see in his face and in the face of his family that this was meaningful for them. SPRINGER: After the ceremony, family and friends turn on their cameras and unmute. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Mazel tov! ERICA SILVERMAN: Thank you guys so much. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Mazel tov! SPRINGER: Gabe's mom, Erica, is happy with the whole online event, but she knows it's not for everyone.

NPR tech correspondent Shannon Bond reports many of them are still waiting for their money. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Michael O'Dell is a jazz musician in Columbus, Ohio. But music doesn't pay the bills, so he drives for Lyft and Uber. And since the pandemic hit, he only goes out when he needs cash right away. MICHAEL O'DELL: I definitely don't put the time into it like I normally did because I'm not going to get good rides. BOND: Unemployment benefits should be a lifeline for gig workers like him, but O'Dell hasn't seen a check yet. O'DELL: I've been applying every week. And every single week, I get denied, like, regular unemployment. BOND: Denied because Lyft and Uber don't consider themselves his employer. They say their millions of drivers are independent contractors who choose when and how much to work. That's how many apps operate, and that means they don't do what a normal employer does. Jay Shambaugh, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, explains. JAY SHAMBAUGH: Normally, if you are eligible for unemployment insurance, it's because your employer has been paying into the insurance system. And as part of paying in, they're reporting your earnings. BOND: Gig workers have to show proof of their earnings so the state knows how much to give them in unemployment benefits. And Shambaugh says most states have to set up systems to process those claims. SHAMBAUGH: That's been the big holdup, figuring out how they track who is supposed to get this money. BOND: It's been more than seven weeks since Congress made gig workers eligible for unemployment. And according to Brookings, 39 states are now processing those claims. But even those who got their claims in really early are still waiting, like Lyft driver Jerome Gage in Los Angeles. He applied for unemployment in early March. JEROME GAGE: And they said, based on your reported earnings from Lyft and Uber, your reward is zero dollars because, you know, they said your employee earnings was zero dollars. BOND: Gage appealed. He's still waiting. In many states, unemployment offices are overwhelmed by the crush of workers who have lost their jobs. Congress did give the states a billion dollars to help them hire more staff and upgrade their outdated computer systems. But Michele Evermore of the National Employment Law Project says the number of people claiming benefits has increased a thousandfold. MICHELE EVERMORE: As it turns out, that billion dollars was maybe not quite enough to process initial claims. BOND: For some people, the wait has dire consequences. Mary Irene Dickerson is a legal aid attorney in Decatur, Ga. Last week, she heard from a client who was about to be evicted. Dickerson gave her some advice. MARY IRENE DICKERSON: But I also said, why couldn't you pay your rent? And she had applied for unemployment. She had gotten one check for $336 and had not gotten any more weekly benefit checks at all. BOND: Dickerson is hearing a lot of stories like these from gig workers and other people who desperately need help. DICKERSON: We're starting to get a lot of eviction calls. So it comes in as an eviction call, then it turns out that the problem is that they've been waiting for their unemployment claims to be determined - waiting weeks. BOND: Back in Ohio, Michael O'Dell is trying to stay hopeful. This month, the state finally launched its system to accept claims from gig workers. He's been calling the office to check in on his status. O'DELL: Based on your social security number, they give you a number to call. And so I've been calling that number. I tried to pick a different number to press to try to get further, but it always ends up hanging up on me, saying we are overloaded at this moment. We're sorry we can't take your call - click, bye. BOND: He says he has no choice but to keep trying. Shannon Bond, NPR News.

But these are not normal times. Seven out of 10 hotel rooms in the U. S. are empty now. And to survive, hotels are adapting. Here's NPR's Uri Berliner. URI BERLINER, BYLINE: The news from Hilton lately isn't about craft cocktails or a spa; it's a partnership with Lysol. That's right - Hilton is teaming up with the parent company of Lysol. It's all about enhanced cleanliness. Phil Cordell is Hilton's global head of brand development. PHIL CORDELL: We know that through this pandemic, that expectation of cleanliness has probably been elevated to the point now where its cleanliness almost with a double exclamation point after it. BERLINER: At Hilton and other hotels, guests can expect disinfectant being applied liberally and visibly for the sake of cleanliness and for reassurance, says Jim Coyle, who consults with hotels on customer experiences. JIM COYLE: When you get a guest key, you will see the staff members - they will conspicuously wipe the guest key in front of you before they hand it to you. When you arrive at the desk, you're going to see hotel staff wiping the desk clean in front of you, even though there's nothing on it. BERLINER: And when you get to your room, more efforts at reassurance. Marriott International has identified 12 touch points for extra disinfectant. Ray Bennett is the company's head of global operations. RAY BENNETT: Doorknobs, thermostats, door handles, drawer handles - things of that nature. BERLINER: As Hilton rolls out its CleanStay campaign, Cordell says guests will notice some familiar objects missing. CORDELL: They will see that some of the items in the room that could likely be fingerprinted by previous guests - magazines, notepads, pens - those items have been removed from the room. BERLINER: And there's likely to be more. Here's industry consultant Jim Coyle again. COYLE: The phone will probably be something that is seeing its last days because of COVID. BERLINER: And that most divisive object in the hotel room? COYLE: I think the death of the minibar is probably finally here. BERLINER: All of these steps have one purpose - to assure travelers that hotels are safe or at least as safe as they possibly can be while coronavirus is still with us. An early test will be convincing business travelers like Liz Oppenheim, who lives outside of Boston. She's itching to get back on the road. LIZ OPPENHEIM: The longer I go without traveling, the more I just don't feel like a person. I literally have dreams almost every night about traveling. BERLINER: Oppenheim works with drug companies on clinical trials and normally spends three or four nights a week in hotels. She enjoys it. For one thing, she racks up a lot of loyalty points. OPPENHEIM: I have all the statuses (laughter). BERLINER: For now, her travel is on pause. And as Oppenheim imagines staying in hotels again, there's one word she uses a lot - anxious. OPPENHEIM: So there's something about slipping between the sheets of the clean, white, crisp sheets of a hotel that's just incredibly relaxing, especially if you've worked at a really hard, you know, tense day at work. And it's just so wonderful. But I think I will be anxious. I think I'll be anxious, too. BERLINER: As hotels spray and disinfect and purge their rooms of pens, magazines and notepads, they may eliminate germs, but will they eliminate anxiety? Hotels are about to find out.

But are those internships destined to be yet another casualty of the pandemic? Well, as NPR's Anya Kamenetz reports, there are some opportunities still out there for students with hustle and luck. ANYA KAMENETZ, BYLINE: For Ananay Arora, spring has brought good news and bad news. The good news is he snagged one of the most prestigious internships in the country. ANANAY ARORA: I'm a sophomore majoring in Computer Science at Arizona State University, and I'm an incoming intern at Apple. KAMENETZ: The bad news. . . ARORA: It was supposed to be in Cupertino, Calif. , but now I have to do it from my apartment. KAMENETZ: That's in Tempe, Ariz. , where Ananay has been since his campus canceled in-person classes due to the coronavirus. He's an international student from India, so he can't go home to his family right now. But Ananay has been keeping busy by teaming up with two friends to create a website that answers the question on so many of his fellow students' minds: ismyinternshipcanceled. com. ARORA: We're trying to combat fake news around internship statuses. KAMENETZ: They've crowdsourced information from more than 500 companies so far - big and small, ranging from airlines to the Oscars to Walmart and Zillow. The verdict - just over a third of internship programs are canceled outright, especially in hard-hit industries like travel. Most of the rest are moving online for part or all of the summer, and some companies are even expanding their programs. In fact, Cloudflare, an Internet security company, decided to double its incoming class of interns after the CEO saw Ananay's website. It's not only the tech industry that is continuing to support interns through this crisis. Hamilton College in New York state is one that's extended its internship funding to graduating seniors like Ngoc Ngo, who's taking a few years off before medical school. She's got not one but three summer projects lined up - one, an extension of her senior thesis genetics research; a second, market research position with CBS Health and a third doing research on the microbiome at an Irish university - all three from her home. NGOC NGO: I feel that I'm so fortunate. I think that I'm able to even apply for these positions is truly a privilege. KAMENETZ: Another out-of-the-box option for aspiring interns this year is the Virtual Student Federal Service. This program has been around for a decade, offering monthlong unpaid and remote assignments with dozens of different federal agencies, from NASA to the Smithsonian. NORA DEMPSEY: Because of coronavirus, our phones and our email boxes are brimming with interest by folks we've never heard from before. KAMENETZ: That's Nora Dempsey, who runs VSFS. She says they've created 184 new internship placements in just the past couple of weeks. DEMPSEY: Agencies with long, complicated names coming to us for the first time, saying, how do you work virtually? And I hear you've been working virtually for 10 years. And can we join? And how can we do this? KAMENETZ: Remote internships, of course, aren't possible in every sector. Think of retail or construction. The experts I spoke with say they work best when they're project-based, so interns can complete assignments on their own time. And Ananay Arora is sad that he's missing out on the camaraderie of working at Apple's headquarters. ARORA: You get to meet new people, and you have people walking by who are seeing how you're working. So it's a totally different experience.

One woman in California knows this firsthand because she has his old cellphone number. The woman tells NPR's Bobby Allyn what it is like to accidentally field the celebrity entrepreneur's calls. (SOUNDBITE OF CELLPHONE RINGING)LYNDSAY TUCKER: Hello. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: This is Lyndsay Tucker. She's a 25-year-old skin care consultant. She works at a Sephora in San Jose. A couple of years ago, people started calling and texting her, but they were looking for a very different person - someone she had never heard of. TUCKER: I asked my mom - hey, I keep getting these text messages. And I was also now starting to get phone calls for this guy Elon Musk. I don't know who this is. And my mom's jaw just dropped. ALLYN: Her mom explained Elon Musk, the flamboyant visionary behind electric carmaker Tesla and rocket company SpaceX. And he has a reputation. He once smoked pot on camera during a podcast taping. He captured headlines recently for bashing shelter-in-place orders. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ELON MUSK: To say that they cannot leave their house and they will be arrested if they do - this is fascist. ALLYN: He's a person people want to reach - the investors, the engineers, the journalists. But often, they get Tucker. TUCKER: I had one where a girl just wanted to say like, hey, if you need volunteers to go to space, I'll do it. And I was like, sorry, sis - I'm not him. ALLYN: She's been sent a blueprint for a bionic limb. A South African businessman inquired about buying a thousand trucks. The IRS called about a complicated tax issue. Sometimes it's just an old friend. Recently, it was Jeff Gold, an Atlanta-area inventor who did business with Musk in the 1990s. JEFF GOLD: I think he just said wrong number to me. So - I didn't know. And I just - I went on and tracked down the correct number and re-sent my text. ALLYN: Tucker says she gets about three calls or texts a day for Musk. If he makes a splash by saying something outlandish, like recently when he threatened to pull Tesla's headquarters out of California, her phone starts constantly buzzing. TUCKER: Whenever I see his name pop up in the news, I'm like, OK, I have to go, like, actually learn what he said because chances are somebody's going to message me about it or call me about it. ALLYN: But how did this happen? NPR tried to reach Elon Musk to find out. We called him at his manufacturing plant in Fremont, Calif. AUTOMATED VOICE: Thank you for calling Tesla. If you are a Tesla owner or would like to be, please press 1. ALLYN: I couldn't get through to him there, but I emailed him about the number mix-up. And he wrote me back. He said, quote, \"Wow, that number is so old. I can't believe it's still out there somewhere. \"Public records show this was actually Musk's phone number years ago. I asked him if he still gives it out to people he's trying to avoid. He wouldn't answer that. However people get the number, it's often up to Lyndsay Tucker to convince callers it's not Musk holding the phone. TUCKER: They were like - oh, well, how do I know you're not Elon? It just gets very aggressive when they're like, how do I know? And they suddenly, like, want proof that I'm not him even though they're obviously talking to a woman on the phone. ALLYN: Tucker says having this rare window into Elon Musk's life is amusing. But sometimes having a tech billionaire's old number can feel like a full-time job. Here's her message to those who think they've texted Musk and haven't heard back. TUCKER: I'm sorry. Sometimes I don't respond if I'm having, like, a rough day or anything. So if you didn't get a response, it's probably me and not him. So don't worry about it. ALLYN: And Tucker says she's keeping this number. She's an aspiring actress. And who knows? Maybe one of these random callers could give her her big break. Bobby Allyn, NPR News, San Francisco.

It just gets very aggressive when they're like, how do I know? And they suddenly, like, want proof that I'm not him even though they're obviously talking to a woman on the phone. ALLYN: Tucker says having this rare window into Elon Musk's life is amusing. But sometimes having a tech billionaire's old number can feel like a full-time job. Here's her message to those who think they've texted Musk and haven't heard back. TUCKER: I'm sorry. Sometimes I don't respond if I'm having, like, a rough day or anything. So if you didn't get a response, it's probably me and not him. So don't worry about it. ALLYN: And Tucker says she's keeping this number. She's an aspiring actress. And who knows? Maybe one of these random callers could give her her big break. Bobby Allyn, NPR News, San Francisco. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)", "section": "Technology", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.

But what do you do when that misinformation is coming from the president? For weeks, President Trump has claimed without evidence that mail-in voting is full of fraud and that Democrats are trying to rig the election. For the first time, Twitter took action yesterday against the president, adding links to fact checks on two of the president's tweets. This morning, President Trump - well, he took to Twitter again to say, quote, \"Republicans feel that social media platforms totally silence conservative voices. We will strongly regulate or close them down before we can ever allow this to happen,\" end quote. NPR's Bobby Allyn has been covering this. We spoke earlier, and I asked Bobby to explain the tweets that prompted Twitter to act. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: So Trump promoted a conspiracy theory that voting by mail is just full of fraud. It's not the first time he's made that claim. But yesterday, it gained a lot of attention because Twitter took action. And again, this is a baseless claim. There's no evidence to back it up. And Twitter, for the first time, put a label on the tweet saying as much. It's a blue exclamation point, and it directs readers to find out the facts about mail-in voting. And it offers a link. You can click the link, and you're sent to reliable news coverage about the issue. GREENE: Well, I guess the big question I have is, why now? I mean, this is not the first time the president has tweeted something that fact-checkers just jumped on and said was just not true. ALLYN: Yeah. So the action really illustrates a major shift at Twitter. You know, earlier this month, Twitter made a big announcement that it was going to start basically policing misinformation and disputed claims and unverified tweets about the coronavirus and that it would label some of those tweets regardless of the speaker. This is a major shift because for a long time, Twitter said if you're a world leader, like President Trump, Twitter would take a hands-off approach to tweets. And that garnered, you know, widespread criticism. So this is basically Twitter making good on its promise that no matter who you are, if you say something on Twitter that is unproven, Twitter will take action by slapping a warning label on it. And that's exactly what happened with Trump yesterday. I talked to David Kay. He is a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, and he specializes in freedom of expression issues. DAVID KAY: If they don't respond to either disinformation or extremism or whatever it might be, they know that they're going to face some very serious regulation that's going to influence their ability to - really to maintain their platforms the way that they want. GREENE: But I mean, Bobby, how does a company like Twitter pick and choose? I mean, we should say this also comes at a time when the president has been sending out these false tweets about the MSNBC host Joe Scarborough that's gotten a lot of attention. ALLYN: Yeah. It's hard to talk about this move by Twitter without talking about that. So the backstory here is Scarborough, who is a former GOP congressman, has often sparred with the president. In a recent tweet, Trump falsely linked Scarborough to the 2001 death of a woman who once worked for Scarborough. The president's tweet was roundly criticized. The conservative-leaning editorial board of The Wall Street Journal was shocked by it. They wrote it shows Trump debasing his office. The widower of the woman who died pleaded with Twitter to remove the post, but Twitter has refused. So the growing pressure for Twitter to do something about the Scarborough tweet came on the heels of Twitter placing a disclaimer on the mail-in voting tweet, perhaps as a way to relieve some of that pressure for deciding not to act on the Scarborough post. GREENE: So Bobby, tell me about how the president is responding to all of this. ALLYN: The president, fittingly enough, took to Twitter and, you know, basically said that Twitter was interfering in the 2020 presidential election, which is quite the claim, and also said that Twitter was stifling his free speech. A campaign manager for Trump said the move shows Silicon Valley is trying to get in the way of Trump getting his message out to voters. GREENE: All right. NPR's Bobby Allyn. Bobby, thanks so much. We appreciate it. ALLYN: Sure. Thanks, David. DAVID GREENE, HOST:   Ahead of the 2020 election, Big Tech companies are trying to stop the spread of misinformation on their platforms.

Specifically, people are online more than ever before, and that could open the door to even more of the kinds of election interference that we saw in 2016. We are spending this week looking at the different ways the pandemic could affect the democratic process in the 2020 election. And joining us now for the latest installment is NPR's Miles Parks. He covers voting and election security. Hey, Miles. MILES PARKS, BYLINE: Hi there. CHANG: Hi. OK, so people are stuck at home. They are online a whole lot more. Can you just explain - what might be the consequences of that when it comes to elections? PARKS: Right. So specifically, people are on social media more than ever before as well. Now, usage on social media was already trending up over the last couple years, but this pandemic has kind of supercharged those gains. Facebook and Twitter have both announced huge year-over-year first quarter user gains, and the amount of time people are spending on these platforms is also increasing. We also know that social media manipulation was a key component of Russia's interference efforts four years ago. So with people online more and getting more of their information on these sites, experts who study this stuff who I've talked to are kind of sounding the alarm that a few months away from the election, this could be a real problem again. CHANG: OK. So given that there is a whole lot more use of social media right now, does that mean that there's more misinformation or disinformation online as well? PARKS: The short answer is yes. I talked to Steve Brill, the CEO of NewsGuard, which is a company aimed at tracking false information. And he told me the amount of sites peddling hoaxes regarding the coronavirus specifically have more than tripled just since they started tracking a couple months ago. He also said he expects those sites that are right now peddling conspiracy theories around the coronavirus - that at some point in the next couple months, they're going to switch to start peddling conspiracy theories about political information once the country starts talking and thinking about the election more. CHANG: Interesting - I guess not surprising. Well, social media companies like Facebook and Twitter are saying that they have done a lot to fight manipulation on their platforms. So is that panning out? I mean, how much better is the landscape since 2016? PARKS: You know, these companies have poured millions of dollars into changing things about their interfaces to hopefully make this less of a problem this time around. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's CEO, had an investor call just a couple weeks ago where he talked about how fact-checkers had marked more than 4,000 pieces of content related to the coronavirus as false. But a lot of critics of these platforms are just not satisfied at this point. For one, there's resource - research - excuse me - that says this sort of fact-checking efforts - they don't work because the very act of repeating a lie or a misleading statement just to correct it or to tell somebody it's false still makes it more likely that a person will believe it just by seeing it. I talked to Ann Ravel, who's a former commissioner on the Federal Election Commission, about this. ANN RAVEL: We know that when false statements are placed on platforms, they spread rapidly. And so dealing with it later is never going to be good enough. PARKS: What Ravel says and what a lot of experts I talk to say is that the only way this problem's really going to get fixed is with government regulation but that that's definitely not going to happen this year, considering all the free speech issues that go along with the government getting involved in this space. CHANG: OK. But what about our role in this as the public? Is there any sign that all this talk about fake news the past few years has meant people are just better at spotting it now? PARKS: I wish I could say that's the case, Ailsa, but it does not seem like that. The problem is that these platforms reward a sort of tribe mentality and that there's a lot of research that shows people can be super educated, super critically minded and that they still ignore any. . . CHANG: OK. PARKS: . . . Evidence that goes against their sort of identity. There's also research that shows these sites polarize the public. So when you think about all of that and you think about what. . . CHANG: Right. PARKS: . . . That could mean for the election, people are really worried about it. CHANG: That's NPR's Miles Park. Thank you, Miles. PARKS: Thank you. AILSA CHANG, HOST:   Our new socially distant reality has drastically changed how people are getting their information.

NPR tech correspondent Shannon Bond joins us. Hey, Shannon. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Hey, Mary Louise. KELLY: Give us the backdrop here. What exactly are Trump and Twitter feuding about? BOND: So Trump is responding to the fact that Twitter, for the first time, labeled two of his tweets as misleading with a fact check. And in these tweets, he claimed without any evidence that mail-in ballots are fraudulent, and they would mean the election will be rigged. And so now the president's threatening to regulate social media, maybe even shut down these platforms. He says Twitter is stifling his free speech. And the company today is not commenting on these threats from Trump. KELLY: Although, I'm wondering about the timing. The president, as we know, has a long history of tweeting misleading, even false claims. Do we know why Twitter is acting now? BOND: Yeah, that's right. Twitter has given world leaders a lot of leeway. It says their tweets are newsworthy. But a few months ago, it said it would start cracking down on tweets, even from political leaders that break the rules. So this is a big step. It's Twitter applying this policy to Trump for the first time. And this isn't just an issue for Twitter. Facebook has also come under a lot of pressure over how Trump uses it. It's worth noting that he posted these same unsubstantiated claims about voting by mail on Facebook this week. But unlike Twitter, Facebook is not putting any warning labels on those posts. KELLY: What is the fine line that tech companies - be it Facebook, be it Twitter, or others - that the fine line that they are trying to walk here. BOND: Well, on the one hand, you know, they are really dedicated to encouraging free speech. And they say, you know, that's an important part of their identity. But on the other, they need to keep their platforms free from misinformation, harassment and efforts to suppress voting. And that balance becomes even more difficult to strike when you're talking about a public figure like Trump who uses social media so successfully. I spoke with Joan Donovan, who studies disinformation at the Harvard Kennedy School's Shorenstein Center, and she says even just labeling this tweet is an important step if Twitter is serious about cracking down on election misinformation. JOAN DONOVAN: Twitter is finally realizing that they are in a very powerful position, because Trump needs them in order to circulate his messages. KELLY: Shannon, let me circle back to something I said in the intro, these accusations that Twitter and other tech companies are biased against conservatives. Would you fact-check that for us? BOND: Well, that is something that conservatives have complained about for a while, and the president's supporters certainly have leapt on it today. They're pointing to one Twitter executive in particular. He's been a public face of the company's policies on misinformation. And in several tweets from a few years ago that have been circulated, he was critical of Trump. He compared members of the administration to Nazis. So some of Trump's supporters are lashing out at him on Twitter, of course. The company says that it's, quote, \"unfortunate to see individual employees targeted for company decisions. \" But this is the exact kind of thing that feeds this distrust that already exists on the right. It's also worth noting that today, Twitter, Facebook and Google won an appeal in federal court dismissing a lawsuit that they were conspiring to suppress conservative views. The court says that companies aren't governments so they can't violate the First Amendment. KELLY: One last point to put to, this threat by the president to shut down social media platforms, to shut down Twitter. Can he do that? BOND: I had that exact question, so I asked an expert, University of Miami law professor Mary Anne Franks. And she says, look, I mean, Twitter is a private company, right, and it has the right to set and enforce its own rules. MARY ANNE FRANKS: Can a public official accuse a private entity of or try to regulate or to shut down a private entity on the basis of not liking what they did? No. That would be exactly what the First Amendment protects us against - right? That's the great irony of this. BOND: So while the president may not be able to shut down Twitter, what Trump and his supporters can do and are doing is use this latest battle to rile up his base on Twitter ahead of the election. KELLY: All righty (ph). Thank you, Shannon. BOND: Thanks, Mary Louise. KELLY: NPR's Shannon Bond.

KENNY MALONE, HOST:  When we met Grant Goings a few months ago, he was holding a copy of the local newspaper, and he was so proud of the story on the front page. It was about this new kind of municipal Uber system in his town. GRANT GOINGS: So for, like, a buck fifty, you can call. They come pick you up, take you to where you're going. We're super excited. WILSON SAYRE, HOST:  Grant Goings is a total, wonderful civics nerd. And for the past 15 years, he's been the city manager of Wilson, N. C. MALONE: The city of Wilson has a population of about 50,000 people. Its downtown is full of these giant, old brick warehouses that used to be filled with tobacco, but now there's a microbrewery, a few barbecue restaurants. SAYRE: The city has managed to transform itself into a manufacturing town. They attracted Bridgestone tires and Merck pharmaceuticals, but they were starting to worry about keeping those businesses. MALONE: Because by the time Grant got to Wilson in the mid-2000s, the city had a problem - its Internet. They were hearing from businesses that the Internet - not so great. And maybe worse, they were also hearing from the Little League parents. GOINGS: Facilities would go down frequently. And so someone would be halfway through registry to kid. There would be some type of break in service. They'd have to start all over again. MALONE: Crashed Little League registration in 2005 - I mean, come on. In other parts of the country, people were discovering Nickelback on LimeWire with no problem. The Internet could be so much better. SAYRE: So Grant Goings called a meeting with the local Internet provider, Time Warner Cable, and the local telephone company. GOINGS: And then we sat down, and we basically had a few asks. So No. 1 was we asked them to heavily invest in upgrading the system. We'd sort of felt like we knew that answer at the time. MALONE: Yeah. GOINGS: No interest. MALONE: Yeah. The answer was no. Time Warner Cable, now Charter, didn't agree to an interview for this story, but you can understand their answer there. Like, why would the existing company invest a ton of money just to wind up with the same customers they already have? It's a questionable business decision at best. SAYRE: But that's OK. No problem. Grant had prepared option No. 2, partner with us. What if Wilson pays to build the top-of-the-line Internet infrastructure, fiber-optic cables? Then Time Warner could offer their service over these superfast lines the town had built. GOINGS: The answer to that question was, we're the second largest cable provider in the country. Why would we partner with you? SAYRE: Which only left option No. 3. The city would do it alone. Grant told Time Warner, fine, we're going to build and run our own fiber-optic network. GOINGS: And that's when the laughing started. And they very quickly exited after that. MALONE: Wait; they literally laughed at you in your office? GOINGS: Absolutely, yes, and have admitted that. SAYRE: Did that, like, light a fire for you? GOINGS: Well, it did for me. MALONE: That's the day that you said. . . GOINGS: It's on. MALONE: It's on. GOINGS: Yeah. (SOUNDBITE OF LIAM COOKE AND PAUL GREEDUS SONG, \"MAN WITH NO NAME\")MALONE: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Kenny Malone. SAYRE: And I'm Wilson Sayre - no relation to the city of Wilson. MALONE: No. And not only would Time Warner Cable laugh in the city of Wilson's face, they would actively fight to stop the city from building faster Internet. It is a fight that has now spread to dozens of other states. We started reporting the story before the pandemic, but it's more relevant than ever because this is a big part of the reason that it's very hard to move to little towns around the country and make a living working remotely. SAYRE: Today on the show, what happened when the city of Wilson decided to try and battle its way through all the legal thicket to start its own Internet provider. And also, should cities even do this at all? (SOUNDBITE OF LIAM COOKE AND PAUL GREEDUS SONG, \"MAN WITH NO NAME\")MALONE: Professor, how are you? CHRISTOPHER YOO: I'm attempting to update my last two years of data into my spreadsheet, but I don't mean to keep you waiting. MALONE: I will never stand between a person and their spreadsheet. I get it. SAYRE: Christopher Yoo is a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. He specializes in technology and the Internet. And in his spreadsheet is essentially the story of what happened to other cities that tried to do what Wilson, N. C. , was trying to do - build and run their own fiber-optic network. MALONE: Christopher says there are about 20 case studies with good data, as in separated audited financial statements. YOO: Those are the data that Wall Street depends on to make its investment decisions. And more importantly, that's the things you can go to jail for if you lie about. MALONE: (Laughter). YOO: So, I mean, it's the best quality data we have. And I want to know what the story is. And there are some horror stories. SAYRE: What Christopher's study found is that most cities very quickly get in over their heads. Many cities don't think about their Internet projects like a fire department or a library, where the service will almost certainly lose money, but that's fine. You make sure to budget for it. MALONE: Instead, cities tend to assume these fiber-optic networks will pay for themselves. They borrow millions and millions of dollars and are often screwed because one of a million things goes wrong. YOO: People forget that running a telecom company is a full-time job. MALONE: Yeah. YOO: Many other cities proceed on the belief that if they build it, they will come. And it takes a special talent and a lot of time to run an enterprise of this size. MALONE: To run this like a business, you got to know about fiber splicing and network design and drop arrangement, customer service, customer acquisition, marketing. YOO: We elect politicians for many things, but ability to market telecom products usually isn't one of them. MALONE: Yes. And all of this has left a bunch of cities - like, struggling cities that really need money - on the hook for millions and millions of dollars because of bad Internet company decisions. SAYRE: Christopher's not saying that no city should ever start their own fiber-optic Internet company. He's just saying there is a very good chance this goes very badly. YOO: There are - many leaders have a huge temptation to put their stamp on something. And I think that it's important that people take a cold, hard look at what the numbers really say. SAYRE: We brought this up with Grant Goings, Wilson city manager. MALONE: Being an Internet service provider is something that is done by a handful of companies, Fortune 500 companies. And here is Wilson, a city of 50,000, saying, yeah. All right, we'll give it a shot. Like, that does seem. . . GOINGS: It's bold. MALONE: Bold is - yeah, bold. GOINGS: Yeah. And it's not like those aforementioned companies were going to help us figure this out. SAYRE: Right. The city of Wilson was on their own. So Grant went to the state capital, Raleigh, to try and get approval to take out around $30 million - big money for a city whose operating budget was roughly 250 million. GOINGS: The state treasurer turned to us in the audience and said, congratulations. I hope you guys have tremendous success and that it will put some pressure on the private providers to invest in their infrastructure. SAYRE: And with that, the city of Wilson stepped into the minefield of becoming a municipal fiber-optic Internet company. MALONE: Step one - just, you know, the small matter of, does anyone here actually know how to do this? GOINGS: There are skill sets that we didn't have anyone on staff that, for example, knew how to splice fiber. MALONE: I mean, it's a knife and, like - I don't know. GOINGS: No, it's highly intricate welding of just minute pieces of glass. SAYRE: As luck would have it, there was a network engineer with fiber skills. GENE SCOTT: Well, I am from Wilson, so it's personal to me to a point. SAYRE: Gene Scott was working for the local phone company. He quit that job to try and make this fiber-optic network work for his hometown. MALONE: And Gene remembers there was this early realization that as a few people started signing up for Internet and TV service, suddenly, the city had to deal with a lot of those people's Internet and TV service problems - very, very basic ones. SCOTT: One of our early customers was an elderly gentleman. You know, and he had a set-top box with a DVR we put in for him. You know how you have to set those on, like, Channel 3 and you use your old remote? Well, he would accidentally, you know, every week or two, knock it off Channel 3. And he'd call in, and we'd try to walk him through that, and he would get confused. MALONE: Essentially, all of our grandparents were now the problem of the city of Wilson. SAYRE: Gene says the technicians got to know this guy, so they'd say, it's fine. I'm on my way to lunch and I can swing by and turn his TV back to Channel 3 so his DVR will work again. SCOTT: And we don't charge for that. MALONE: They didn't have to charge for all kinds of stuff because they were just trying to break even in the long run. And so, yeah, free channel changing, but also free hookups and rates that for this top-of-the-line service were relatively cheap and competitive with Time Warner. SAYRE: But Grant Goings says what they were learning was that running an Internet company was really running a customer service company to some degree. So they hired more customer service people. GOINGS: The local customer service element was probably, like, the most popular thing. You know, they'd call, and they're talking to someone on the other end of the line that went to high school with them. MALONE: Right. GOINGS: You know, and they're like, oh, yeah. I know where you live. We'll have a truck over there in 30 minutes or something. And so, like, these stories, they just sort of took a life of their own. SAYRE: The city had calculated that in order for this to work, they needed to steal away about 30% of the Internet and TV market. They're heading for closer to 40%. The city was beating the odds, on track for a successful homemade fiber-optic Internet company. MALONE: But that is when Grant started to hear the rumblings. Something weird was happening in the state capital. GOINGS: We were hearing some rumors that there were a lot more lobbyists in Raleigh. And y'all might want to start paying attention to this. There are apparently some folks talking about a law that would make it illegal for cities to do what you're doing. MALONE: Clearly targeted at you. GOINGS: Oh, without a doubt. SAYRE: The city of Wilson had stepped into the middle of something much bigger and much uglier. That's after the break. In the late 2000s, Grant Goings had gotten word that this mysterious legislation was about to show up, effectively making the city of Wilson's Internet project illegal. And this is a big problem in large part because they had already borrowed tens of millions of dollars. And if they suddenly couldn't collect money from the Internet and television subscribers, they were in deep, deep trouble. MALONE: So Grant headed to Raleigh, the state capital, to see what was going on. And the city of Wilson, for the first time ever, had even hired a lobbyist. They were ready to go to the capital and fight whatever was happening. GOINGS: So, yeah, we - I guess we really thought that we were playing in the big leagues. We got a lobbyist and we walked up there and realized that the other side had almost 40. MALONE: (Laughter). GOINGS: So it was a real naivete on our part, I think, about just how difficult these battles in the General Assembly would be. SAYRE: That army of lobbyists - telecom companies. Because simply put, why would you not try to kill off your new competitor? ALISON KODJAK: It's really - I mean, it's a little bit that simple, but there's something more complicated in how they spin it. MALONE: Alison Kodjak is an investigative editor at The Associated Press. If she sounds familiar, it's because she was our colleague at NPR for a while. And she's covered the battle over municipal Internet quite a bit in her career. SAYRE: And she says if you zoom out and look around the country, you'll see that Wilson was just one piece of this bigger pattern. MALONE: When Provo, Utah, announced their plan to build a fiber-optic network, a law popped up in the state legislature essentially blocking city Internet companies in Utah. SAYRE: When Lafayette, La. , announced a municipal broadband effort, same law popped up there. And parts of these laws were word-for-word the same. KODJAK: You know, insert your state name here, your city name, your name, maybe a couple of particulars. MALONE: Like a mad lib-style bill? KODJAK: Kind of, yeah, a mad lib-style bill. I haven't thought of it that way. You know, very often, these bills are almost word for word, introduced state after state after state. MALONE: This is a very specific kind of strategy, Alison says, by the telecom industry, by companies like Time Warner. Instead of trying to get one big federal law to kill off city Internet, you do it state by state. You quash the insurrection as it crops up. SAYRE: And it's obvious why Internet companies want this. Instead of just competing with these newcomers on price or service, go beat them at a different game - lobbying, politics, glad handing. But the reason lawmakers sign on is more complicated than just donations from the industry, though there are donations. KODJAK: I don't want to say - you know, these lawmakers aren't necessarily bad intentioned. They are people who believe in, you know, private enterprise and competition. MALONE: And you can hear some of these lawmaker concerns in what unfolded in the case of Wilson, N. C. , and what happened in the North Carolina General Assembly. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: We're going to start the hearing on H129, Level Playing Field/Local Government Competition. MALONE: The Level Playing Field bill was a version of the bill that Grant Goings had been warned about. And the playing field was allegedly unlevel because the government was playing on it. The argument being made in the North Carolina General Assembly was that the government should not be competing with private sector companies. Even a city government is a big, powerful entity that could leverage that power unfairly. The government, for example, might not have to pay taxes, or it could even subsidize its own service with taxpayer money if things started going badly. Those are not things the private company can do. SAYRE: The city could be pushing out an actual market competitor and maybe future better competitors. Why would a new company show up in Wilson if they have to compete with the city of Wilson? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARILYN AVILA: I am a definite limited government, free market individual, and I just felt like that we were allowing a competition that was unfair to the marketplace. MALONE: This is Marilyn Avila. She's the lawmaker who sponsored the Level Playing Field bill in North Carolina. SAYRE: She didn't agree to be interviewed for this story, but she did talk a lot about the city of Wilson back when this was all happening - about how it could be risky for other cities to try this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)AVILA: And this particular issue in my mind is that municipalities' core services are being damaged by this particular approach in getting out into the business world and committing the responsibility for that success or failure to a very finite group of people. MALONE: Marilyn Avila was also getting some campaign money from the telecom industry, which gets to the sticky issue here. It is sometimes hard to tell where the genuine concerns stop and the industry influence starts because telecom companies, like Time Warner, had a lot of influence to throw around against the city of Wilson and Grant Goings. GOINGS: I think at one time, somebody told me that the legal teams they had representing them had more employees than the city of Wilson, so. . . SAYRE: So, yeah, Grant knew he was in for a fight at the state capital. If this Level Playing Field law passed, then the city of Wilson could end up eating their $35 million investment and miles and miles and miles of fiber-optic cable. MALONE: So Grant was driving to the state capital, like, three times a week, trying to convince lawmakers, this is ridiculous. Time Warner doesn't want to provide this faster service for us, so why are you trying to stop us from doing it? GOINGS: They had a huge advantage on us not just because of money and resources and lobbying and politics, but because they could sort of reduce their argument to one sentence, which was this is, you know, unfair government competition with the private sector, yeah. And, you know, to any American, that would raise a red flag. MALONE: Yeah. GOINGS: And we needed a few minutes of time to actually explain to people why we were doing what we were doing. SAYRE: Grant noticed he seemed to get more time to speak when there were news cameras covering the story in the Statehouse. And so one day, when no press showed up, Grant thought, you know who does have cameras and microphones? The city of Wilson's public access television team. GOINGS: And so I called our staff at 8 o'clock in the morning, and I said, go set up in this room. Just act like you're news media, you know, by asking questions. And so we faked them out to where they thought that the news media was in the room, and they let us speak. SAYRE: Grant felt like he wasn't just fighting this for Wilson but for all the communities in North Carolina who might want to do what Wilson was doing. Grant and the city of Wilson did manage to fight off this Level Playing Field law three times. But in the end, they're just outgunned. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Next speaker, Grant Goings from - he's Wilson city manager. MALONE: There's this moment that happened shortly before the Level Playing Field law is going to pass. This was maybe Grant's last chance to try to say something publicly before the state essentially kills his city's fiber-optic Internet project. SAYRE: Grant goes up to speak to these lawmakers and says, look; even if you kill every future project, let us live. Our project is working. And also, we've already poured tens of millions of dollars into this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GOINGS: And so regardless of your opinion about municipal broadband, if you could put yourself in the seat of a city council member in Wilson, obviously, we think it's very important that we have a full and complete exemption for Wilson. MALONE: The Level Playing Field legislation passed easily, effectively making it impossible for city governments to treat the Internet like a utility and provide that service to its residents. SAYRE: And this same law, or slightly tweaked versions of it, has now been passed in around 20 different states. That's 20 different places where there's now this problem that has no solution. If you live in a rural city in Virginia or Alabama or Minnesota and you have terrible Internet or sometimes no Internet, it is incredibly hard for your government to step in and provide that service. MALONE: And, look; maybe that is a dodged bullet for some places. The track record of cities saying, we can do this; it'll pay for itself - it often will not, and that is partly why private companies aren't there doing it in the first place. SAYRE: But it also means that cities that could pull it off, like Wilson, they're not allowed. MALONE: Except Wilson is allowed. Grant, maybe that lobbyist the city hired, they did manage to get an exception carved out. Wilson is allowed to operate their service, but they are prohibited from extending that fiber-optic network across the county line - a clear marker that this idea is contained and is not going to spread. GOINGS: It was really - it was a sad day for us, and we weren't celebrating. Yeah, it was a disappointment for our state. I think we had hoped to set an example that maybe some other communities could follow. SAYRE: And they really could have been a blueprint. Wilson did not become one of those fiber-optic horror stories. Wilson's Internet is affordable, reliable and sometimes even turns a profit. The city is even scheduled to pay off the project debt in the next two years. But basically no other town in North Carolina is allowed to try this now. MALONE: On the flip side, that has turned the city of Wilson into this kind of oasis. It is one of the very few places you can go to get tons of space surrounded by beautiful farmland, world-famous barbecue and some of the fastest Internet in the country.

SCOTT: One of our early customers was an elderly gentleman. You know, and he had a set-top box with a DVR we put in for him. You know how you have to set those on, like, Channel 3 and you use your old remote? Well, he would accidentally, you know, every week or two, knock it off Channel 3. And he'd call in, and we'd try to walk him through that, and he would get confused. MALONE: Essentially, all of our grandparents were now the problem of the city of Wilson. SAYRE: Gene says the technicians got to know this guy, so they'd say, it's fine. I'm on my way to lunch and I can swing by and turn his TV back to Channel 3 so his DVR will work again. SCOTT: And we don't charge for that. MALONE: They didn't have to charge for all kinds of stuff because they were just trying to break even in the long run. And so, yeah, free channel changing, but also free hookups and rates that for this top-of-the-line service were relatively cheap and competitive with Time Warner. SAYRE: But Grant Goings says what they were learning was that running an Internet company was really running a customer service company to some degree. So they hired more customer service people. GOINGS: The local customer service element was probably, like, the most popular thing. You know, they'd call, and they're talking to someone on the other end of the line that went to high school with them. MALONE: Right. GOINGS: You know, and they're like, oh, yeah. I know where you live. We'll have a truck over there in 30 minutes or something. And so, like, these stories, they just sort of took a life of their own. SAYRE: The city had calculated that in order for this to work, they needed to steal away about 30% of the Internet and TV market. They're heading for closer to 40%. The city was beating the odds, on track for a successful homemade fiber-optic Internet company. MALONE: But that is when Grant started to hear the rumblings. Something weird was happening in the state capital. GOINGS: We were hearing some rumors that there were a lot more lobbyists in Raleigh. And y'all might want to start paying attention to this. There are apparently some folks talking about a law that would make it illegal for cities to do what you're doing. MALONE: Clearly targeted at you. GOINGS: Oh, without a doubt. SAYRE: The city of Wilson had stepped into the middle of something much bigger and much uglier. That's after the break. In the late 2000s, Grant Goings had gotten word that this mysterious legislation was about to show up, effectively making the city of Wilson's Internet project illegal. And this is a big problem in large part because they had already borrowed tens of millions of dollars. And if they suddenly couldn't collect money from the Internet and television subscribers, they were in deep, deep trouble. MALONE: So Grant headed to Raleigh, the state capital, to see what was going on. And the city of Wilson, for the first time ever, had even hired a lobbyist. They were ready to go to the capital and fight whatever was happening. GOINGS: So, yeah, we - I guess we really thought that we were playing in the big leagues. We got a lobbyist and we walked up there and realized that the other side had almost 40. MALONE: (Laughter). GOINGS: So it was a real naivete on our part, I think, about just how difficult these battles in the General Assembly would be. SAYRE: That army of lobbyists - telecom companies. Because simply put, why would you not try to kill off your new competitor? ALISON KODJAK: It's really - I mean, it's a little bit that simple, but there's something more complicated in how they spin it. MALONE: Alison Kodjak is an investigative editor at The Associated Press. If she sounds familiar, it's because she was our colleague at NPR for a while. And she's covered the battle over municipal Internet quite a bit in her career. SAYRE: And she says if you zoom out and look around the country, you'll see that Wilson was just one piece of this bigger pattern. MALONE: When Provo, Utah, announced their plan to build a fiber-optic network, a law popped up in the state legislature essentially blocking city Internet companies in Utah. SAYRE: When Lafayette, La. , announced a municipal broadband effort, same law popped up there. And parts of these laws were word-for-word the same. KODJAK: You know, insert your state name here, your city name, your name, maybe a couple of particulars. MALONE: Like a mad lib-style bill? KODJAK: Kind of, yeah, a mad lib-style bill. I haven't thought of it that way. You know, very often, these bills are almost word for word, introduced state after state after state. MALONE: This is a very specific kind of strategy, Alison says, by the telecom industry, by companies like Time Warner. Instead of trying to get one big federal law to kill off city Internet, you do it state by state. You quash the insurrection as it crops up. SAYRE: And it's obvious why Internet companies want this. Instead of just competing with these newcomers on price or service, go beat them at a different game - lobbying, politics, glad handing. But the reason lawmakers sign on is more complicated than just donations from the industry, though there are donations. KODJAK: I don't want to say - you know, these lawmakers aren't necessarily bad intentioned. They are people who believe in, you know, private enterprise and competition. MALONE: And you can hear some of these lawmaker concerns in what unfolded in the case of Wilson, N. C. , and what happened in the North Carolina General Assembly. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: We're going to start the hearing on H129, Level Playing Field/Local Government Competition. MALONE: The Level Playing Field bill was a version of the bill that Grant Goings had been warned about. And the playing field was allegedly unlevel because the government was playing on it. The argument being made in the North Carolina General Assembly was that the government should not be competing with private sector companies. Even a city government is a big, powerful entity that could leverage that power unfairly. The government, for example, might not have to pay taxes, or it could even subsidize its own service with taxpayer money if things started going badly. Those are not things the private company can do. SAYRE: The city could be pushing out an actual market competitor and maybe future better competitors. Why would a new company show up in Wilson if they have to compete with the city of Wilson? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARILYN AVILA: I am a definite limited government, free market individual, and I just felt like that we were allowing a competition that was unfair to the marketplace. MALONE: This is Marilyn Avila. She's the lawmaker who sponsored the Level Playing Field bill in North Carolina. SAYRE: She didn't agree to be interviewed for this story, but she did talk a lot about the city of Wilson back when this was all happening - about how it could be risky for other cities to try this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) AVILA: And this particular issue in my mind is that municipalities' core services are being damaged by this particular approach in getting out into the business world and committing the responsibility for that success or failure to a very finite group of people. MALONE: Marilyn Avila was also getting some campaign money from the telecom industry, which gets to the sticky issue here. It is sometimes hard to tell where the genuine concerns stop and the industry influence starts because telecom companies, like Time Warner, had a lot of influence to throw around against the city of Wilson and Grant Goings. GOINGS: I think at one time, somebody told me that the legal teams they had representing them had more employees than the city of Wilson, so. . . SAYRE: So, yeah, Grant knew he was in for a fight at the state capital. If this Level Playing Field law passed, then the city of Wilson could end up eating their $35 million investment and miles and miles and miles of fiber-optic cable. MALONE: So Grant was driving to the state capital, like, three times a week, trying to convince lawmakers, this is ridiculous. Time Warner doesn't want to provide this faster service for us, so why are you trying to stop us from doing it? GOINGS: They had a huge advantage on us not just because of money and resources and lobbying and politics, but because they could sort of reduce their argument to one sentence, which was this is, you know, unfair government competition with the private sector, yeah. And, you know, to any American, that would raise a red flag. MALONE: Yeah. GOINGS: And we needed a few minutes of time to actually explain to people why we were doing what we were doing. SAYRE: Grant noticed he seemed to get more time to speak when there were news cameras covering the story in the Statehouse. And so one day, when no press showed up, Grant thought, you know who does have cameras and microphones? The city of Wilson's public access television team. GOINGS: And so I called our staff at 8 o'clock in the morning, and I said, go set up in this room. Just act like you're news media, you know, by asking questions. And so we faked them out to where they thought that the news media was in the room, and they let us speak. SAYRE: Grant felt like he wasn't just fighting this for Wilson but for all the communities in North Carolina who might want to do what Wilson was doing. Grant and the city of Wilson did manage to fight off this Level Playing Field law three times. But in the end, they're just outgunned. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Next speaker, Grant Goings from - he's Wilson city manager. MALONE: There's this moment that happened shortly before the Level Playing Field law is going to pass. This was maybe Grant's last chance to try to say something publicly before the state essentially kills his city's fiber-optic Internet project. SAYRE: Grant goes up to speak to these lawmakers and says, look; even if you kill every future project, let us live. Our project is working. And also, we've already poured tens of millions of dollars into this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GOINGS: And so regardless of your opinion about municipal broadband, if you could put yourself in the seat of a city council member in Wilson, obviously, we think it's very important that we have a full and complete exemption for Wilson. MALONE: The Level Playing Field legislation passed easily, effectively making it impossible for city governments to treat the Internet like a utility and provide that service to its residents. SAYRE: And this same law, or slightly tweaked versions of it, has now been passed in around 20 different states. That's 20 different places where there's now this problem that has no solution. If you live in a rural city in Virginia or Alabama or Minnesota and you have terrible Internet or sometimes no Internet, it is incredibly hard for your government to step in and provide that service. MALONE: And, look; maybe that is a dodged bullet for some places. The track record of cities saying, we can do this; it'll pay for itself - it often will not, and that is partly why private companies aren't there doing it in the first place. SAYRE: But it also means that cities that could pull it off, like Wilson, they're not allowed. MALONE: Except Wilson is allowed. Grant, maybe that lobbyist the city hired, they did manage to get an exception carved out. Wilson is allowed to operate their service, but they are prohibited from extending that fiber-optic network across the county line - a clear marker that this idea is contained and is not going to spread. GOINGS: It was really - it was a sad day for us, and we weren't celebrating. Yeah, it was a disappointment for our state. I think we had hoped to set an example that maybe some other communities could follow. SAYRE: And they really could have been a blueprint. Wilson did not become one of those fiber-optic horror stories. Wilson's Internet is affordable, reliable and sometimes even turns a profit. The city is even scheduled to pay off the project debt in the next two years. But basically no other town in North Carolina is allowed to try this now. MALONE: On the flip side, that has turned the city of Wilson into this kind of oasis. It is one of the very few places you can go to get tons of space surrounded by beautiful farmland, world-famous barbecue and some of the fastest Internet in the country.

It was part of a sophisticated disinformation campaign that was launched as the United States is in the midst of a public health and economic and political crisis. NPR's Miles Parks covers election security and disinformation. Miles, good morning. MILES PARKS, BYLINE: Hi, Steve. INSKEEP: Why would somebody spread that particular image? PARKS: So the main storyline, it all kind of goes into this kind of conspiracy theory that somebody - we're not sure who - was trying to spread. And the story basically goes like this. They were trying to push this narrative that at some point Sunday evening, the government managed to shut down all communication and Internet services in Washington, D. C. , so that way, protesters wouldn't be able to post things on social media and police would be able to use more force. Now, we know this is not true. And come Monday morning, a bunch of reporters wake up to tens of thousands of tweets about this specific storyline, and they start posting, you know, things that say, no, this didn't happen. I was there. I was able to tweet and email without any issue. But the #dcblackout hashtag that went along with this had already taken off, and it's been mentioned more than a million times on Twitter already. INSKEEP: OK, so lots of people get that message. It's not clear that everybody gets the debunking of it. Was that the end of the disinformation campaign? PARKS: It wasn't. And that's where this campaign gets really sophisticated. Once it starts being debunked by all these reporters, a network of hacked accounts and other bots, other automated accounts jump in to say - basically give a PSA that says, oh, that's fake. That's misinformation. Don't listen to it - which then prompts this third round of sort of reverse psychology effect on some people, feeling like, oh, if the bots are saying it's fake, then they want me to believe that, and maybe this is actually real. So then you get, you know, another flood of posting about the fact that there's automated accounts debunking it, if that makes sense. INSKEEP: Any idea who orchestrated all of this? PARKS: It's not exactly clear at this point. It was definitely a well-funded and well-organized effort is what experts told me. It's not just somebody sitting in their basement on a whim deciding to do something like this. I talked to Darren Linvill, who's a professor at Clemson who studies disinformation campaigns on social media. He didn't want to assign blame, but he was willing to at least say it fits the Russian game plan of throwing out multiple, conflicting narratives. DARREN LINVILL: That is a classic Russian move. I mean, that sort of creating a double negative to make one question everything one believes - there is no truth - is what they do best. PARKS: Now, he was really clear that this does not mean it definitely is the Russians, but just that their playbook is out there for anyone who has enough resources and wants to sow this sort of chaos on social media. INSKEEP: Is there something about the chaos on the streets or the protests on the streets that make people particularly vulnerable to this kind of disinformation? PARKS: Yeah, there is. That's what Linvill said. I asked him the exact same question. Here's what he told me. LINVILL: There has been a spike in social media use in general, and you combine that with something that is so emotional that people are going to have visceral reactions to, and they're going to be more primed to believe whatever it is you're going to plant in their mind. PARKS: And then you add in the fact that this protest movement is sort of based on the very idea that many official sources of information are not necessarily to be trusted, and it all kind of feeds into this environment that bad actors can take advantage of online.

They are upset that Mark Zuckerberg has not done more about President Trump's most inflammatory posts about the protests over the death of George Floyd. It's a different choice than is being made by Twitter. Twitter has put warning labels with links to more information when the president has made the very same false or incendiary claims that he's made on Facebook. NPR tech correspondent Shannon Bond joins us. And we should note, by the way, that Facebook is an NPR sponsor. Good morning, Shannon. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: What exactly does Facebook do when the president puts the same message on Twitter as on Facebook? BOND: Well, nothing. Facebook has these same rules that Twitter does that say you can't use the platform to incite violence or spread false information about things like voting. And as you said, Trump has done both over the past week. For example, in his tweet about the protests and in his posts on Facebook, he wrote, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. But Facebook took no action on these posts. And that's because Mark Zuckerberg says he doesn't believe a private company like his should restrict what a political leader says, although we should say Facebook has pulled down a false message from the president of Brazil. And Zuckerberg himself said in a public Facebook post that he had a visceral negative reaction to Trump's posts. INSKEEP: So what kind of reaction has Zuckerberg's lack of action prompted, if I'm saying that all correctly? BOND: Well, he is getting a lot of pushback from civil rights groups, Democratic politicians and his own employees. They say, you know, Facebook has these rules, but when it comes to enforcing them, it's moving the line, they say, to accommodate the president. On Monday, Zuckerberg and his second in command, Sheryl Sandberg, had a Zoom call with three prominent civil rights groups that are pushing for him to change the decision. I spoke with the president of one of those groups, Color of Change. His name is Rashad Robinson. And he says he was deeply disappointed by the conversation. He thinks Zuckerberg just doesn't understand the sensitive issues this decision brings up. Here's what he said. RASHAD ROBINSON: Right now, we have a private citizen controlling one of the largest, most powerful public squares. And the idea that someone that controls public square doesn't understand civil rights is actually a problem, given the history of this country. BOND: After the meeting, Facebook put out this statement. It was kind of vague. It said they appreciated the feedback, but they didn't promise any action. And so some employees are also pretty upset about this. INSKEEP: OK. How are they expressing that discomfort? BOND: Well, they're going public with their disagreement, which is really notable because it's pretty rare for them to do that. And to be clear, Facebook says it encourages employees to speak openly when they disagree with leadership. There's often debate within the company over these policies. But generally, employees tell me that the company discourages them from speaking out. But you have these employees posting on Twitter under their real names. They say they think Zuckerberg is wrong. One software engineer even publicly resigned. He wrote a public post about quitting. And he says Facebook's on the wrong side of history. INSKEEP: Is Zuckerberg listening? BOND: Well, he did move up the company's weekly all-hands meeting. It's usually on Thursday. They held it yesterday to address this growing backlash. But when he had the call, he doubled down. He defended his decision. And one employee who's been very vocal about disagreeing with Facebook tweeted during the meeting - it's crystal clear today that leadership refuses to stand with us. Look. Zuckerberg is the CEO of this company. He controls most of the voting shares at Facebook. This is his decision. This is his company. And it's not a democracy. What he decides goes.

NPR tech correspondent Shannon Bond has more for this week's All Tech Considered. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Kim Timko used to rely on Rent the Runway. She used the clothing rental service to get dresses for weddings and parties, outfits for date nights, professional clothes for her job as a lawyer in New York. KIM TIMKO: It's, like, a nice way to, like, have expensive clothes without having to, like, buy. BOND: Then COVID-19 hit. Weddings have been postponed, parties canceled. She's working from home. She says right now, renting clothes just isn't worth the money or the risk of getting the virus by touching items that other people have worn. TIMKO: Any packages I get, I wipe them down. I'm, like, sanitizing them. So you can't really do that with a dress. Like, you can't, like, Lysol it. BOND: So Timko, like a lot of other Rent the Runway users, has put her $159 monthly subscription on hold, and she's thinking about canceling it entirely. Rent the Runway says there's no evidence the virus spreads through clothing, and it thoroughly cleans all items between customers. But the company admits it's taken a big financial hit from the pandemic. It's laid off and furloughed staff and closed its stores. And it's not the only sharing company that's been squeezed. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: Airbnb is laying off nearly 1,900 employees. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: Thirty-five-hundred employees at Uber learned they were losing their jobs. . . UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: Lyft has laid off about 17% of its workforce. BOND: These companies were all founded after the Great Recession. They upended traditional industries by giving people a way to enjoy expensive things without having to buy them outright. But now the pandemic is threatening to upend their businesses. Airbnb expects its sales this year to be, at best, half of what they were last year. But the company says people have started to plan travel again to places they can drive to. Take Murry Evans. He's sick of being cooped up in his Atlanta condo, so he's booked some weekend getaways to the north Georgia mountains. MURRY EVANS: It's just been to get out of the house and get, you know, into the outdoors where I can go hiking and that kind of thing. And it's been fine. BOND: Evans says staying at an Airbnb feels like less of a risk than going to movie theaters, which have recently reopened in Georgia. He brings along disinfectant wipes to clean doorknobs and refrigerator handles, the places people touch a lot. EVANS: My sense is if I take the proper precautions, it's going to be just like I'd take the precautions when I'm in my own home. BOND: And for some sharing companies, the pandemic may even create opportunities for more business, like Turo, a service that allows you to rent other people's cars. Alexis Jordan has been using it to get from her home in Washington, D. C. , to her job at a hospital in Bethesda, Md. Before the coronavirus, she commuted by bus. ALEXIS JORDAN: A lot of people would get on the bus and not wear a mask. And I just feel like Metro wasn't really taking the proper precautions. I felt more exposed to it. BOND: Uber didn't seem like a great option, either, even though the company is now requiring all drivers and passengers to wear masks. JORDAN: Because I'm still in close proximity with someone else. BOND: She wears a mask when picking up her car and carries wipes to clean everything she touches. Turo says demand is coming back, thanks to commuters and people who just want to get out of the house. Uber is also seeing more rides during rush hour. Alexis Jordan says it could be a year or two before she gets back on the bus. She is considering buying her own car and renting it out on Turo to help cover the cost.

People use it to record and share short videos of themselves doing viral dance challenges or lip-syncing routines to songs like \"Savage,\" featuring Beyonce. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"SAVAGE\")MEGAN THEE STALLION: (Singing) I'm a savage, yeah, classy, bougie, ratchet, yeah. Sassy, moody, nasty, yeah. GARCIA-NAVARRO: TikTok is also becoming the go-to platform for young people to create and share videos about racial justice, as NPR's technology reporter Bobby Allyn reports. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Raisha Doumbia is a 20-year-old swimming instructor in the Atlanta area. She downloaded TikTok about a year ago, mostly to post fun videos, like her lip-syncing and dancing to songs from the British girl group Little Mix. But after protests swept the nation over George Floyd's death, Doumbia switched it up with messages like this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RAISHA DOUMBIA: The Black Lives Matter movement is not a photo-op. This is not a chance for you to just take photo shoots. If you really wanted to stand up for our rights as an ally, you would be out there marching. ALLYN: Doumbia admits it was a drastic change in tone. DOUMBIA: I was just so disgusted that I felt like I needed to say something. So I started to speak out even though I had, like, 13 followers. ALLYN: She has more than 60,000 now, though, because some of her videos went viral. Doumbia is far from alone. Videos with the Black Lives Matter hashtag have skyrocketed to the top spot on the platform. The so-called queen of TikTok, Charli D'Amelio, has taken a break from posting dance videos. The 16-year-old, who is white, told her 60 million followers recently she was having a moment of reflection. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CHARLI D'AMELIO: As a person who has been given the platform to be an influencer, I realize that with that title, I have a job - to inform people on the racial inequalities in the world right now. ALLYN: Debra Aho Williamson of eMarketer studies social media trends. She says TikTok videos that are funny or full of raw emotions can reach huge audiences and quickly, so it makes sense that TikTok is what teens are using to address police brutality and racial inequality. DEBRA AHO WILLIAMSON: For the first time, they might be exploring how they feel about these issues. And being able to do that on TikTok and see other young people who are maybe expressing similar things - I think it's really valid and valuable. ALLYN: But TikTok is being forced to grow up with its users. Black creators noticed early on that videos that referenced George Floyd and Black Lives Matter were being hidden. And the Chinese company that owns TikTok does have a history of censoring videos in places like Hong Kong. TikTok says that's not what's happening here. It blames a technical glitch and says it stands with the black community. Not all of the app's users do, though. When 17-year-old Kai Harris (ph) in New Jersey posted about going to a protest, some viewers responded with racist and mean comments. KAI HARRIS: They're, like, I came here for a good time. I came here to laugh and dance. And you're bringing me down with all this stuff. And I'm, like, the fact that this is happening is bringing me down. ALLYN: Harris doesn't see herself going back to making videos of her dancing in wigs or lip-syncing because she can't stop thinking about black people dying at the hands of police. HARRIS: I do not want to grow up in a world where this just keeps happening. So I decided, you know what? I've been silent on these issues. Sometimes, I don't share my opinions. But I need to share them now. ALLYN: Harris says she remembers when Trayvon Martin was killed in 2012, but she didn't fully grasp it at the time because she was just 10 years old. Now she is 17, and she says she's ready to change some minds one 30-second video at a time. Bobby Allyn, NPR News, San Francisco.

We know less about who's behind them. We learned today, federal prosecutors are looking into a global hack-for-hire organization. It has targeted journalists, activists and government officials and thousands of others. Here's NPR's Hanna Rosin. HANNA ROSIN, BYLINE: Like most stealth operations, this one has a code name, Dark Basin. And it started with a tip. JOHN SCOTT-RAILTON: A journalist got in touch with us and shared some suspicious messages. ROSIN: That's John Scott-Railton, a researcher with Citizen Lab, a cybersecurity watchdog group. In a report released today, Citizen Lab tracked those messages back to a group based in India. SCOTT-RAILTON: A sprawling operation that has hundreds of clients around the world who seem to pay these people to target hundreds and thousands of people at a time. ROSIN: Among the targets were environmental activists who were involved with a campaign called #ExxonKnew. These activists have accused the oil company of keeping the public and shareholders in the dark about climate damage they knew they were causing. Kert Davies of the Climate Investigations Center was one of the activists who were targeted. KERT DAVIES: Out of the blue, you start getting these freaky emails, and you think, what - you know, who's behind it? The story is not this company in India. The story is who hires them. ROSIN: A spokesman for Exxon Mobil said the company has no knowledge of or involvement in the hacking activities outlined in Citizen Lab's report. And as Scott-Railton put it, it is in fact devilishly difficult to connect the hackers directly with the people who use their services. It's all done through middlemen. And federal prosecutors have arrested one middleman. An Israeli private investigator named Aviram Azari was charged in New York with wire fraud, identity theft and conspiracy to commit computer hacking. The indictment said he'd been invited to India to meet with senior managers of the hacking group. He's pleaded not guilty. Citizen Lab has started to connect those dots, and Scott-Railton says they're sharing their information with federal investigators. SCOTT-RAILTON: The people who were targeted were often on the other side of some kind of a pitched battle, maybe with a company, maybe with an individual. ROSIN: Perhaps the scariest cases involve individuals, like a man named Matthew Earl, who woke up one morning three years ago to a document online supposedly written by a former employee of his. MATTHEW EARL: I mean, it was accusing me of being a criminal. ROSIN: Earl knew it was all fiction. He had no former employees. But still, it affected him. EARL: I felt shame that that's the impression that people would see. ROSIN: Scott-Railton described Earl to me as the most targeted man he's ever met. Earl had PIs come to his door, he was followed and photographed on the street, and for years, Earl received phishing emails, which if he fell for the trap, would have allowed the hackers to harvest his passwords and wreak havoc on his life. EARL: Because you're paranoid of clicking on anything, and so you kind of retrench a bit from life. ROSIN: The Citizen Lab report connects Earl's case to a number of other journalists and investors. What they had in common was publishing damaging information about a German company called Wirecard. This week, police in Munich raided Wirecard's headquarters, and German prosecutors launched a criminal investigation into accounting irregularities and disclosure violations by certain executive board members of Wirecard. As for Matthew Earl, as of last week, he was still getting suspicious emails, so he was happy to hear from Scott-Railton that Citizen Lab had at least honed in on his hackers, if not yet the people who hired them. SCOTT-RAILTON: It'll be nice to have a little celebratory victory lap tomorrow or the next day. EARL: Well, we could get a drink organized on Zoom or something (laughter). SCOTT-RAILTON: Oh, yeah. ROSIN: Now it's up to the prosecutors in the U. S. and Germany to do the difficult work of finding out definitively who the corporate clients are. Hanna Rosin, NPR News.

Earlier this week, IBM said it would stop its work on this type of technology. NPR's Bobby Allyn has been reporting on all of this. And before we get started, I will note that NPR does get financial support from Amazon. Bobby, good morning. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Good morning. KING: So Amazon is the place that a lot of us get a lot of our stuff, but it also has a more low-key, though thriving, business providing facial recognition software to law enforcement. Tell us about that business. ALLYN: Sure. It's called Rekognition. Amazon spells that with a K. And in recent years, they have been selling it to police departments, and police departments have been using it to identify potential suspects by checking photos against a giant database of mug shots that are stored digitally in the cloud. But then a bunch of studies took a really hard look at this tool and found a lot of problems. So this facial recognition tool has a hard time correctly identifying people with darker skin, harder time identifying women and younger people. One audit even found when members of Congress were ran through this Amazon tool that nearly two dozen of them were matched to people who had been arrested for committing crimes. So those were false matches, yeah. So I talked to a MIT researcher. Her name is Joy Buolamwini. And she has been studying Amazon's technology, and here's her assessment. JOY BUOLAMWINI: Racial biases, gender bias, even has age bias - but even if that bias wasn't there, there's still the capacity for abuse. And most concerningly, especially as we're seeing more people take to the streets, is the specter of using facial recognition for surveillance. ALLYN: So as Buolamwini says, the protests across the country have created some intense concern about the algorithms here. And you know, that fear about mass surveillance this week drove IBM to abandon its facial recognition line of business completely. KING: OK, I do understand the concern about mass surveillance. How are police departments actually using it? ALLYN: Yeah, so this is how it works. So say you get pulled over, and a deputy comes up to you. The deputy can take your photo with his phone and upload that into this system. And the system will scan hundreds of thousands of mug shots and see if you have been arrested for a crime in the past several years. They can even do this with someone's social media photo. They can do it with sort of a grainy security camera picture. And police say this is really helpful when a suspect, you know, refuses to give their name or when they're, you know, looking at someone on a crime scene who is unconscious. But you know, the MIT researcher I talked to, Buolamwini, she's worried about, you know, use of this technology outside of government, about people who can use it for other uses. KING: You know, Bobby, I wonder - did Amazon come right out and cop to doing this, to making this move, because of the protests over George Floyd's killing and over racial injustice in this country? ALLYN: You know, Noel, that's certainly the backdrop here. But in Amazon's really brief announcement, they made no mention of George Floyd's name. They did not say anything about the unrest we're seeing. Instead, they said they're halting the facial recognition software in order to allow Congress to develop some regulations. And you know, this creep into what some people call policing by algorithm has caused pushback from even inside of Amazon. Some of Amazon's own investors and employees have real fears about this and have made them known. KING: But what does it mean for law enforcement agencies that were already using it? ALLYN: Yeah. So Amazon has never revealed a complete list of all of the law enforcement agencies that use this technology, but I did talk to the sheriff's office in Washington County, Ore. It's the third-largest law enforcement agency in the state. They were using it - using it quite a bit. And they said, since we heard that Amazon is forcing us to stop, we're going to stop. So they're not going to be using it for at least the next year. KING: OK. But one thing we all know about businesses and competition is that somebody's going to step in and fill the void, right? There's got to be an Amazon competitor out there like, we got it. ALLYN: Yeah, right. So Microsoft also has similar technology. There's other IT and surveillance companies that offer a similar service. So just because Amazon is halting doesn't mean it's going to go away. KING: NPR's Bobby Allyn, such interesting reporting. Thanks, Bobby. ALLYN: Thank you, Noel. NOEL KING, HOST:   Amazon says it will temporarily stop giving law enforcement agencies access to its facial recognition software. Earlier this week, IBM said it would stop its work on this type of technology. NPR's Bobby Allyn has been reporting on all of this. And before we get started, I will note that NPR does get financial support from Amazon. Bobby, good morning. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Good morning. KING: So Amazon is the place that a lot of us get a lot of our stuff, but it also has a more low-key, though thriving, business providing facial recognition software to law enforcement. Tell us about that business. ALLYN: Sure. It's called Rekognition. Amazon spells that with a K. And in recent years, they have been selling it to police departments, and police departments have been using it to identify potential suspects by checking photos against a giant database of mug shots that are stored digitally in the cloud. But then a bunch of studies took a really hard look at this tool and found a lot of problems. So this facial recognition tool has a hard time correctly identifying people with darker skin, harder time identifying women and younger people. One audit even found when members of Congress were ran through this Amazon tool that nearly two dozen of them were matched to people who had been arrested for committing crimes.

KAREN DUFFIN, HOST:  In the mid-'90s, there was this big new economic theory that was all the rage. It was an idea for how countries can produce unlimited economic growth, which is kind of the whole point of economics. You know, growth means less poverty, more prosperity. MARY CHILDS, HOST:  For decades, economists had said there are basically just two ways to make an economy grow - invest in capital or in labor, in tangible, mundane things like factories and workers, which means growth is ultimately limited because there are just so many people you can hire or factories you can build. DUFFIN: But then some economists, most notably Paul Romer, said, actually, there's a third way to grow - innovation. And before this, people thought of innovation as a sort of mysterious force that kind of comes and goes at its own discretion. CHILDS: Paul Romer said, actually, you can make innovation happen. Innovation is just like a factory you can build. All you have to do is, like, invest in science education, promote market competition and, most importantly, pass strong patent laws so that ideas can be protected and monetized. Just do these things, pass those laws, and innovation will follow. DUFFIN: And people loved this idea. Paul Romer eventually won the Nobel Prize in economics for it. And he taught it to an entire generation of economic students. CHILDS: But one of those students, a Ph. D. candidate named Lisa Cook, as she learned about this, she thought, I'm not sure it's that simple. Just pass patent laws, get innovation? LISA COOK: Nah, nah. It won't work that way, no. Nah. It seemed naive, like, you know, build it and they will come. And that's not - that's not how it works. You can have laws on the books and not enforce them and never have growth. DUFFIN: Lisa Cook was skeptical in part because of personal experiences. For one, she'd spent some time in Russia. She was studying the banking system there in the 1990s. And at the time, Russia technically had patent laws, but what they didn't have was a lot of innovation. CHILDS: And to Lisa, the reason seemed clear. Like, sure there were laws, but no one seemed to enforce them. For example, several of the bankers she was supposed to interview disappeared mysteriously. She was scared just walking to work. COOK: If I don't get, you know, hit by a moving object falling out of a window or, you know, attacked on the street, like, I'm lucky. DUFFIN: If you're afraid for your life, you're probably not inventing things. CHILDS: Also, Romer's big innovation theory assumes that the law is enforced equally. And Lisa knows very personally, for example from her childhood in Georgia, that equal treatment is not guaranteed. COOK: Yeah. I mean, I was desegregating schools along with my sisters, and I was beaten - you know, I was beaten up. I still have scars from that - scar where hair won't grow in my eyebrow and a scar on my leg from having been beaten during that period, during the period of desegregation. DUFFIN: So Lisa is pretty sure she's found a blind spot in that hot new economic theory. She suspects that there is more to fostering innovation than just science schools and patent laws. Maybe innovation also requires safety and equality. CHILDS: To test her hunch, she needs to find a pool of inventors where some were subject to violence and inequality and others weren't. She thinks, now, where could I find such a dataset? COOK: So, of course, you know, knowing a little bit about American history, I knew that African American inventors were subject to the things that started happening to African Americans around the period of the end of Reconstruction, when lynchings were largely at their peak and when segregation laws were being put into place, and thereafter. DUFFIN: And this is how Lisa Cook decided to study the very things that people are protesting right now - violence against black people and the unequal enforcement of law - and whether those things stunt innovation. CHILDS: All she had to do was gather a bunch of data, plug it into a formula, and she'll have her answer - simple. COOK: And it was nowhere near that easy. CHILDS: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Mary Childs. DUFFIN: And I'm Karen Duffin. (SOUNDBITE OF LEIGH MCALLISTER GRACIE'S \"COLD HEART\")DUFFIN: Today on the show, Lisa Cook sets out to investigate whether one of the most important theories in economics is missing something. If she's right, it would have implications for the wealth of black Americans and also for entire economies. CHILDS: She would spend more than 10 years creating new datasets from scratch, teaching basic American history to her colleagues and shining a light on one of the biggest blind spots in economics. DUFFIN: Lisa Cook has this hunch that one of the most important ideas in economics has a big hole in it. To test her theory, she needs a way to measure exactly how violence and a lack of rule of law - how that impacts innovation. She needs concrete data, things she can count. CHILDS: For innovation, there actually is a way to count ideas - patents on inventions. There's a whole database of patents going back centuries. So, OK, she's got that side of it. DUFFIN: And to measure violence and unequal rule of law, she uses a range of markers, from segregation laws to the most extreme example, lynchings. CHILDS: She'll look at data from 1870 to 1940 and compare the number of patents filed by black and white inventors. If black inventors file fewer patents during periods of increased violence and lawlessness and they file more patents when violence and lawlessness decrease, then she's proven it. She's right. COOK: The thing that I was deluded about was that all these data were just hanging around and available. Like, patents were not searchable. There was no Google Patents. You know, race is not recorded on a patent record. DUFFIN: Yet the most critical information that Lisa needs - the race of inventors - that is not listed on patents. In fact, the only patent filing that does list race is one of the earliest granted to an African American. It was a man named Norbert Rillieux. He invented an evaporator that's used in sugar production in 1843. And the reason the patent file notes his race is because someone tried to take it from him because of his race. COOK: The person was living on a plantation in New Orleans, and they thought that it was an illegitimate patent because enslaved persons couldn't receive patents. CHILDS: Beyond that, Lisa will have to, patent by patent, figure out a way to identify the race of each filer for the 2 million patents filed in that 70-year period. DUFFIN: So she starts looking for common African American names in census records, which do list race, so she can cross-reference those with the patent records. COOK: One theory about black names is that African Americans name themselves after presidents. CHILDS: She checks it out. COOK: Well, it turns out all Americans name men after presidents. DUFFIN: She also combs through historical newspaper articles, scholarly papers, biographies - also, a surprisingly useful source. COOK: If African Americans were working for a government entity and that entity was completely secret, like the Department of Defense, we wouldn't know about that person's inventions. But in their obituaries, their family could talk about that person's inventions, and they did. Yeah. X was a great inventor of some sort. DUFFIN: The place where she finds the most data is in a survey that was commissioned by the U. S. Patent Office and W. E. B. Du Bois. They wanted to showcase African American inventions at the 1900 World Fair. COOK: It took me a year to identify the names and then a year to match them to the data and then another year to fail at that (laughter). CHILDS: She ends up with a list of 726 patents filed by African Americans between 1870 and 1940. Finally, she has all the data she needs to start testing her theory. DUFFIN: So she plots out the number of patents filed per year chronologically on a graph. And staring at them all lined up, she can look back in time and see how black innovation grew or fell in different times and places throughout this history. CHILDS: Starting at the beginning of her dataset in 1870, the Civil War was receding in the background. The 14th Amendment had recently passed, promising equal protection under the law for all men born in the United States. DUFFIN: During this period, African Americans made a lot of gains - holding office, owning property and filing more and more patents. She sees the line on her graph rise. African Americans filed patents at roughly the same rate as white inventors through about 1900. CHILDS: Given this new freedom and new rights, African American inventors flourished. They invented all kinds of things in this period - an elevator, rotary engines, a tapered golf tee, a dough kneader, a telephone system, a fertilizer distributor and a bunch of other things. DUFFIN: But then, as Lisa followed the patent line further, the story her dataset was telling her took a turn. COOK: There was a sharp decline in patenting right at 1900, around the time of Plessy v. Ferguson and thereafter. CHILDS: Plessy v. Ferguson - the Supreme Court ruling that gave official legal sanction to a so-called separate but equal America. Legislators were passing laws that pushed African Americans into not-at-all-equal homes and schools or just cut off access to things altogether, including things that you would need to invent. COOK: They've been locked out of libraries, where they used to go check the patent registries. They are locked out of the commercial districts, where their patent attorneys are. They were cut off from talking to other inventors. I think that was one of the biggest casualties. DUFFIN: For those who were still inventing, they had to go to extreme lengths. Like, she found this one guy, Garrett Morgan. He invented a precursor to the gas masks used in World War I - also hair-straightening cream, a better stoplight. CHILDS: But he couldn't sell all of those things himself, so he had to find a workaround. At the time, Lisa says, Native Americans held a special prominence as inventors of medical remedies and clothing and boats. So Garrett would go to trade shows with a sort of cover story. COOK: He would bring along a Native American, and he'd have the Native American sort of give the pitch, and he was the Native American's research assistant. That's how he would present himself. CHILDS: But for a lot of African American inventors, after Plessy v. Ferguson, they just straight-up lost their jobs, including one of the top patent officers at the U. S. Patent Office, also a top inventor at the U. S. Postal Service who was in charge of coordinating with other inventors around the country. Neither of them ever filed a patent again. DUFFIN: And as Lisa connects the fluctuations in patent filings to specific spikes in lynchings or new segregation laws, the data seemed to be confirming her hypothesis. CHILDS: But then she sees another big dip in the patent filings from African Americans. And this one does not appear connected to lynchings or segregation laws. COOK: And I couldn't get rid of the effect. Like, you have to test when you're looking at something that is that stark. You have to test adjacent years to see if you are seeing what you're thinking you're seeing. And I just couldn't get the effect to go away no matter what I threw at it. DUFFIN: Her data were screaming at her that something big had happened in 1921. She couldn't scrub it out as a calculation error no matter how many times she checked. CHILDS: She looks into it and realizes that 1921 was the year of one of the worst incidents of racial violence in American history, the Tulsa race massacre. If you've seen \"Watchmen\" on HBO, this was the attack on Black Wall Street. DUFFIN: This one neighborhood in Tulsa had become famous as a bustling, affluent community, a place where black Americans could settle and live well. It had its own newspaper, its own hospitals, schools, banks, a bus service. But in late May of 1921, mobs of white men invaded the town. They massacred residents, shooting on sight. They also firebombed the neighborhood from airplanes. This haven of black affluence burned to the ground. COOK: Tulsa demonstrated that no one would help them - no one. The local government failed. The state government failed. The U. S. government failed. At every single level, nobody had their backs. They were all afraid. DUFFIN: It was a message that was heard across the country. The government would not provide even the most basic protections for black Americans - not for their lives, not for their property, so certainly, not for their inventions. COOK: It's a sense of personal security. You don't feel safe anywhere. But also, my livelihood might be in jeopardy. I may never be able to make a living doing the things I'm doing. So that's why if I'm a black inventor in another city, why would I ever invent anything if I thought the intellectual property was never going to be defended? If the Black Wall Street that everybody knew about, if it weren't protected, why would I be protected? CHILDS: So it shouldn't be surprising that after that, patent filings by African Americans dropped off not just in Tulsa, not just in the South, but across the country. DUFFIN: As Lisa traced the graph from the beginning of her data in 1870 through the Plessy ruling, the Tulsa riots and up to 1940, she saw a consistent trend. COOK: The divergence between white patenting and black patenting was just so stark. CHILDS: When she does the final math, she finds that the United States had lost out on more than 1,100 inventions from black inventors. DUFFIN: And there's no real way to quantify what those things might've been, the things that never got invented. But Lisa says that looking at some of the inventions that narrowly did make it into the world gives us a window into what we almost lost. CHILDS: She thinks about her own cousin, Percy Julian. He was the first African American to head a major corporate laboratory. And in 1940, he invented an improved way to make cortisone an anti-inflammatory steroid. COOK: Now this is a major medical advance. I don't think I know anyone over the age of 20 who hasn't used cortisone. His house was firebombed twice. We wouldn't have that if they had been successful - if whoever firebombed his house had been successful. So it's not an abstract idea. DUFFIN: What's even less abstract is the economic impact of all those lost inventions. COOK: The number of patents that were lost would be equivalent to that of a medium-sized European country at the time. Yeah. CHILDS: Whoa. DUFFIN: An entire Netherlands. CHILDS: So Lisa has found the gap in the innovation theory that she had suspected might be there. The idea that if we just make strong patent laws that innovation will come - her data show it's true for some people, not true for others. DUFFIN: She's pretty sure that she's sitting on findings that have huge implications for African Americans most directly because this cuts them off from an important source of wealth, but also for the wealth of entire nations. CHILDS: So she starts putting her findings in front of respected economists. She takes it to Martin Feldstein, a Harvard professor who had been Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser. COOK: When I walked in the door and sat down, he said, young lady, you've got to publish this. This is one of the best ideas I've seen in the last generation. You've got to publish this. And I was just taken aback because, you know, economists are not known for being effusive (laughter). DUFFIN: She sends her paper to Paul Romer and two other Nobel Prize winners, Ken Arrow and Milton Friedman. They all said, yes, publish this. CHILDS: So that's three Nobel Prize-winning economists and a Harvard professor saying, this is important. You have to tell people. DUFFIN: After the break, Lisa finds out how hard it is to innovate within economics. CHILDS: To get an academic paper published, it has to get through a panel of experts who read and critique it. If you make edits to their satisfaction, maybe they will publish it. DUFFIN: She sends her paper to some of the major economic journals. And what she'd expected to come back was feedback about her methodology, assumptions, specific equations, things in the paper. But instead. . . COOK: Most of their questions were about U. S. history. They weren't about the econometrics. They weren't about the underlying economics. The thing that I was shocked at - the thing that I was shocked at the most was that people in economics didn't know U. S. history. CHILDS: Her readers seemed to be getting bogged down in these questions about definitions. Like, a lot of people asked, what is a former slave? COOK: That I got that question just took me aback. You know, and I sent it to, like, my senior colleagues, like, is this asking what I think it's asking for? It - you interpret this for me, please. Please. I might be missing something. There may be some nuance here that I don't get. CHILDS: Also, she had used the words lynchings and extrajudicial killings interchangeably in the paper, and journal editors would ask, do lynchings really count as extrajudicial killings? COOK: I kept getting this question, change it - like, not even there's a debate to be had. Change it. Just change it because we don't think this applies here. Extrajudicial killings happen to white people and to people in developing countries or in emerging markets. This is a - lynchings are something different. DUFFIN: And granted, debating definitions is a normal part of the academic publishing process, but the questions she's getting also felt to Lisa a little like they were debating American history and ideals across the divide of the black and white experience, like the question she got the most. Many of her readers kept asking, wait; how would a local lynching affect a would-be inventor across the country? COOK: Why would you care about a lynching that happened in a different state? Why would you care? The kind of fear and terror that black people knew then and that they know now was not even fathomable. It was unimaginable. And this was post-Rodney King. So I really was - I was flabbergasted. Why would you not care? And I thought, oh, boy, I'm in trouble. I'm in trouble. CHILDS: So she basically wrote a black history paper on top of her econ paper spelling out the effect of racial violence as it rippled through black communities across the country. DUFFIN: Lisa says it usually takes two to three years for a paper to be published. But for her paper, it took 10 years of critique and revision and debate, also support from her Nobel Prize-winning colleagues, before her research was published in the Journal of Economic Growth in 2014. COOK: It shouldn't take all that. It really shouldn't take, you know, three Nobel laureates to rescue the idea and then show up and do, you know, hand-to-hand combat. CHILDS: The field of economics prides itself on its detachment, on its ability to set aside the noise and chaos of human behavior and explain things in cold, hard data, in models and equations. DUFFIN: But as Lisa's research showed, if you aren't putting all of the variables into these equations that you're using to explain the world, maybe because you haven't learned about those things or lived them or you don't believe they even exist, if you're missing a variable, you'll get the wrong answer. COOK: And that goes back to the fundamental equation. If there is something that impedes the rate of arrival of ideas, you're going to slow down the economy. It's not just for that period. And it's not just for black people. This is a cautionary tale for all economies. CHILDS: A cautionary tale that America does not seem to have fully learned yet. Lisa extended her initial dataset through 2010 to see how far things had come. COOK: 1899 was the peak year for African American patents per capita. It still is. So that has not - that has not returned. DUFFIN: Really? COOK: That is still the peak per capita for African Americans.

(SOUNDBITE OF ALEXIS TOUTZIARAKIS SONG, \"SEISMIC ENCOUNTER\") SYLVIE DOUGLIS, BYLINE: This is PLANET MONEY from NPR. KAREN DUFFIN, HOST:   In the mid-'90s, there was this big new economic theory that was all the rage. It was an idea for how countries can produce unlimited economic growth, which is kind of the whole point of economics. You know, growth means less poverty, more prosperity. MARY CHILDS, HOST:   For decades, economists had said there are basically just two ways to make an economy grow - invest in capital or in labor, in tangible, mundane things like factories and workers, which means growth is ultimately limited because there are just so many people you can hire or factories you can build. DUFFIN: But then some economists, most notably Paul Romer, said, actually, there's a third way to grow - innovation. And before this, people thought of innovation as a sort of mysterious force that kind of comes and goes at its own discretion. CHILDS: Paul Romer said, actually, you can make innovation happen. Innovation is just like a factory you can build. All you have to do is, like, invest in science education, promote market competition and, most importantly, pass strong patent laws so that ideas can be protected and monetized. Just do these things, pass those laws, and innovation will follow. DUFFIN: And people loved this idea. Paul Romer eventually won the Nobel Prize in economics for it. And he taught it to an entire generation of economic students. CHILDS: But one of those students, a Ph. D. candidate named Lisa Cook, as she learned about this, she thought, I'm not sure it's that simple. Just pass patent laws, get innovation? LISA COOK: Nah, nah. It won't work that way, no. Nah. It seemed naive, like, you know, build it and they will come. And that's not - that's not how it works. You can have laws on the books and not enforce them and never have growth. DUFFIN: Lisa Cook was skeptical in part because of personal experiences. For one, she'd spent some time in Russia. She was studying the banking system there in the 1990s. And at the time, Russia technically had patent laws, but what they didn't have was a lot of innovation. CHILDS: And to Lisa, the reason seemed clear. Like, sure there were laws, but no one seemed to enforce them. For example, several of the bankers she was supposed to interview disappeared mysteriously. She was scared just walking to work. COOK: If I don't get, you know, hit by a moving object falling out of a window or, you know, attacked on the street, like, I'm lucky. DUFFIN: If you're afraid for your life, you're probably not inventing things. CHILDS: Also, Romer's big innovation theory assumes that the law is enforced equally. And Lisa knows very personally, for example from her childhood in Georgia, that equal treatment is not guaranteed. COOK: Yeah. I mean, I was desegregating schools along with my sisters, and I was beaten - you know, I was beaten up. I still have scars from that - scar where hair won't grow in my eyebrow and a scar on my leg from having been beaten during that period, during the period of desegregation. DUFFIN: So Lisa is pretty sure she's found a blind spot in that hot new economic theory. She suspects that there is more to fostering innovation than just science schools and patent laws. Maybe innovation also requires safety and equality. CHILDS: To test her hunch, she needs to find a pool of inventors where some were subject to violence and inequality and others weren't. She thinks, now, where could I find such a dataset? COOK: So, of course, you know, knowing a little bit about American history, I knew that African American inventors were subject to the things that started happening to African Americans around the period of the end of Reconstruction, when lynchings were largely at their peak and when segregation laws were being put into place, and thereafter. DUFFIN: And this is how Lisa Cook decided to study the very things that people are protesting right now - violence against black people and the unequal enforcement of law - and whether those things stunt innovation. CHILDS: All she had to do was gather a bunch of data, plug it into a formula, and she'll have her answer - simple. COOK: And it was nowhere near that easy. CHILDS: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Mary Childs. DUFFIN: And I'm Karen Duffin. (SOUNDBITE OF LEIGH MCALLISTER GRACIE'S \"COLD HEART\") DUFFIN: Today on the show, Lisa Cook sets out to investigate whether one of the most important theories in economics is missing something. If she's right, it would have implications for the wealth of black Americans and also for entire economies. CHILDS: She would spend more than 10 years creating new datasets from scratch, teaching basic American history to her colleagues and shining a light on one of the biggest blind spots in economics. DUFFIN: Lisa Cook has this hunch that one of the most important ideas in economics has a big hole in it. To test her theory, she needs a way to measure exactly how violence and a lack of rule of law - how that impacts innovation. She needs concrete data, things she can count. CHILDS: For innovation, there actually is a way to count ideas - patents on inventions. There's a whole database of patents going back centuries. So, OK, she's got that side of it. DUFFIN: And to measure violence and unequal rule of law, she uses a range of markers, from segregation laws to the most extreme example, lynchings. CHILDS: She'll look at data from 1870 to 1940 and compare the number of patents filed by black and white inventors. If black inventors file fewer patents during periods of increased violence and lawlessness and they file more patents when violence and lawlessness decrease, then she's proven it. She's right. COOK: The thing that I was deluded about was that all these data were just hanging around and available. Like, patents were not searchable. There was no Google Patents. You know, race is not recorded on a patent record. DUFFIN: Yet the most critical information that Lisa needs - the race of inventors - that is not listed on patents. In fact, the only patent filing that does list race is one of the earliest granted to an African American. It was a man named Norbert Rillieux. He invented an evaporator that's used in sugar production in 1843. And the reason the patent file notes his race is because someone tried to take it from him because of his race. COOK: The person was living on a plantation in New Orleans, and they thought that it was an illegitimate patent because enslaved persons couldn't receive patents. CHILDS: Beyond that, Lisa will have to, patent by patent, figure out a way to identify the race of each filer for the 2 million patents filed in that 70-year period. DUFFIN: So she starts looking for common African American names in census records, which do list race, so she can cross-reference those with the patent records. COOK: One theory about black names is that African Americans name themselves after presidents. CHILDS: She checks it out. COOK: Well, it turns out all Americans name men after presidents. DUFFIN: She also combs through historical newspaper articles, scholarly papers, biographies - also, a surprisingly useful source. COOK: If African Americans were working for a government entity and that entity was completely secret, like the Department of Defense, we wouldn't know about that person's inventions. But in their obituaries, their family could talk about that person's inventions, and they did. Yeah. X was a great inventor of some sort. DUFFIN: The place where she finds the most data is in a survey that was commissioned by the U. S. Patent Office and W. E. B. Du Bois. They wanted to showcase African American inventions at the 1900 World Fair. COOK: It took me a year to identify the names and then a year to match them to the data and then another year to fail at that (laughter). CHILDS: She ends up with a list of 726 patents filed by African Americans between 1870 and 1940. Finally, she has all the data she needs to start testing her theory. DUFFIN: So she plots out the number of patents filed per year chronologically on a graph. And staring at them all lined up, she can look back in time and see how black innovation grew or fell in different times and places throughout this history. CHILDS: Starting at the beginning of her dataset in 1870, the Civil War was receding in the background. The 14th Amendment had recently passed, promising equal protection under the law for all men born in the United States. DUFFIN: During this period, African Americans made a lot of gains - holding office, owning property and filing more and more patents. She sees the line on her graph rise. African Americans filed patents at roughly the same rate as white inventors through about 1900. CHILDS: Given this new freedom and new rights, African American inventors flourished. They invented all kinds of things in this period - an elevator, rotary engines, a tapered golf tee, a dough kneader, a telephone system, a fertilizer distributor and a bunch of other things. DUFFIN: But then, as Lisa followed the patent line further, the story her dataset was telling her took a turn. COOK: There was a sharp decline in patenting right at 1900, around the time of Plessy v. Ferguson and thereafter. CHILDS: Plessy v. Ferguson - the Supreme Court ruling that gave official legal sanction to a so-called separate but equal America. Legislators were passing laws that pushed African Americans into not-at-all-equal homes and schools or just cut off access to things altogether, including things that you would need to invent. COOK: They've been locked out of libraries, where they used to go check the patent registries. They are locked out of the commercial districts, where their patent attorneys are. They were cut off from talking to other inventors. I think that was one of the biggest casualties. DUFFIN: For those who were still inventing, they had to go to extreme lengths. Like, she found this one guy, Garrett Morgan. He invented a precursor to the gas masks used in World War I - also hair-straightening cream, a better stoplight. CHILDS: But he couldn't sell all of those things himself, so he had to find a workaround. At the time, Lisa says, Native Americans held a special prominence as inventors of medical remedies and clothing and boats. So Garrett would go to trade shows with a sort of cover story. COOK: He would bring along a Native American, and he'd have the Native American sort of give the pitch, and he was the Native American's research assistant. That's how he would present himself. CHILDS: But for a lot of African American inventors, after Plessy v. Ferguson, they just straight-up lost their jobs, including one of the top patent officers at the U. S. Patent Office, also a top inventor at the U. S. Postal Service who was in charge of coordinating with other inventors around the country. Neither of them ever filed a patent again. DUFFIN: And as Lisa connects the fluctuations in patent filings to specific spikes in lynchings or new segregation laws, the data seemed to be confirming her hypothesis. CHILDS: But then she sees another big dip in the patent filings from African Americans. And this one does not appear connected to lynchings or segregation laws. COOK: And I couldn't get rid of the effect. Like, you have to test when you're looking at something that is that stark. You have to test adjacent years to see if you are seeing what you're thinking you're seeing. And I just couldn't get the effect to go away no matter what I threw at it. DUFFIN: Her data were screaming at her that something big had happened in 1921. She couldn't scrub it out as a calculation error no matter how many times she checked. CHILDS: She looks into it and realizes that 1921 was the year of one of the worst incidents of racial violence in American history, the Tulsa race massacre. If you've seen \"Watchmen\" on HBO, this was the attack on Black Wall Street. DUFFIN: This one neighborhood in Tulsa had become famous as a bustling, affluent community, a place where black Americans could settle and live well. It had its own newspaper, its own hospitals, schools, banks, a bus service. But in late May of 1921, mobs of white men invaded the town. They massacred residents, shooting on sight. They also firebombed the neighborhood from airplanes. This haven of black affluence burned to the ground. COOK: Tulsa demonstrated that no one would help them - no one. The local government failed. The state government failed. The U. S. government failed. At every single level, nobody had their backs. They were all afraid. DUFFIN: It was a message that was heard across the country. The government would not provide even the most basic protections for black Americans - not for their lives, not for their property, so certainly, not for their inventions. COOK: It's a sense of personal security. You don't feel safe anywhere. But also, my livelihood might be in jeopardy. I may never be able to make a living doing the things I'm doing. So that's why if I'm a black inventor in another city, why would I ever invent anything if I thought the intellectual property was never going to be defended? If the Black Wall Street that everybody knew about, if it weren't protected, why would I be protected? CHILDS: So it shouldn't be surprising that after that, patent filings by African Americans dropped off not just in Tulsa, not just in the South, but across the country. DUFFIN: As Lisa traced the graph from the beginning of her data in 1870 through the Plessy ruling, the Tulsa riots and up to 1940, she saw a consistent trend. COOK: The divergence between white patenting and black patenting was just so stark. CHILDS: When she does the final math, she finds that the United States had lost out on more than 1,100 inventions from black inventors. DUFFIN: And there's no real way to quantify what those things might've been, the things that never got invented. But Lisa says that looking at some of the inventions that narrowly did make it into the world gives us a window into what we almost lost. CHILDS: She thinks about her own cousin, Percy Julian. He was the first African American to head a major corporate laboratory. And in 1940, he invented an improved way to make cortisone an anti-inflammatory steroid. COOK: Now this is a major medical advance. I don't think I know anyone over the age of 20 who hasn't used cortisone. His house was firebombed twice. We wouldn't have that if they had been successful - if whoever firebombed his house had been successful. So it's not an abstract idea. DUFFIN: What's even less abstract is the economic impact of all those lost inventions. COOK: The number of patents that were lost would be equivalent to that of a medium-sized European country at the time. Yeah. CHILDS: Whoa. DUFFIN: An entire Netherlands. CHILDS: So Lisa has found the gap in the innovation theory that she had suspected might be there. The idea that if we just make strong patent laws that innovation will come - her data show it's true for some people, not true for others. DUFFIN: She's pretty sure that she's sitting on findings that have huge implications for African Americans most directly because this cuts them off from an important source of wealth, but also for the wealth of entire nations. CHILDS: So she starts putting her findings in front of respected economists. She takes it to Martin Feldstein, a Harvard professor who had been Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser. COOK: When I walked in the door and sat down, he said, young lady, you've got to publish this. This is one of the best ideas I've seen in the last generation. You've got to publish this. And I was just taken aback because, you know, economists are not known for being effusive (laughter). DUFFIN: She sends her paper to Paul Romer and two other Nobel Prize winners, Ken Arrow and Milton Friedman. They all said, yes, publish this. CHILDS: So that's three Nobel Prize-winning economists and a Harvard professor saying, this is important. You have to tell people. DUFFIN: After the break, Lisa finds out how hard it is to innovate within economics. CHILDS: To get an academic paper published, it has to get through a panel of experts who read and critique it. If you make edits to their satisfaction, maybe they will publish it. DUFFIN: She sends her paper to some of the major economic journals. And what she'd expected to come back was feedback about her methodology, assumptions, specific equations, things in the paper. But instead. . . COOK: Most of their questions were about U. S. history.

The social network says the posts violate its policies against hate. The Trump campaign is criticizing Facebook's move and stands by the ads. This, of course, comes amid mounting tensions between the president and big tech. For more, we're joined now by NPR's Bobby Allyn in San Francisco. Hey, Bobby. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Hey there. CHANG: Hey. So what exactly are these ads at the center of all this? ALLYN: Yeah, so these ads blame, quote, \"dangerous mobs of far-left groups\" that supposedly are running through the streets and causing mayhem in the aftermath of the death of George Floyd. And the ad here ties the mass demonstrations we've been seeing to the loose group of antifascist activists known as Antifa. Trump has been connecting the demonstrations to this group for some time even though there's no evidence at all that, you know, they played a significant role in the protests. And so this ad says protesters are, you know, rioting and destroying America's cities. And this was written above a giant upside-down red triangle. And it's that image that really has caused this intense backlash. CHANG: An upside-down red triangle. OK, what have historians and other experts have said about this symbol? ALLYN: Yeah, so I've talked to some historians about this, and they say that it was used in Nazi concentration camps to identify prisoners, that these upside-down triangles were actually sewn into prison uniforms, used to identify, you know, on what grounds people were being held. I talked to the Anti-Defamation League's CEO, Jonathan Greenblatt, and he applauded Facebook for taking down the ads. He said, you know, using Nazi-era imagery in a political ad is offensive and hateful. And he asked the Trump campaign to apologize. CHANG: And how has the Trump Administration responded so far? ALLYN: They're knuckling down, and they're defending the ad. They first likened it, the triangle - the upside-down triangle - to a texting emoji. CHANG: An emoji? ALLYN: They then, you know, pointed to various - yeah, an emoji. You know, you send your friends a little emoji. They then pointed to various online products that use this image next to the word Antifa as proof that Antifa does embrace the image. But experts I talked to said, you know, actually in the U. S. , this symbol is not associated with the Antifa movement. But for the Trump campaign, Ailsa, it's important that, you know, to focus on how they are using this moment to talk about their war with big tech. It is a big theme of the campaign. For weeks now, the Trump administration has been attempting to punish and limit the legal protection for social media companies like Facebook and Twitter for occasionally moderating things that Trump tweets and posts on Facebook.

So warns Nina Jankowicz. She's the disinformation fellow at the Wilson Center. And in a recent opinion column in WIRED magazine, she and a co-author write that the company's so-called pivot to privacy, Facebook's promise to protect sensitive user information, did little to combat the spread of misinformation. Instead, Facebook encouraged users to join its groups, which are private pages for users with similar interests. We want to note here that Facebook is among NPR's recent financial supporters. Nina Jankowicz is here with us now. Welcome. NINA JANKOWICZ: Thanks for having me, Sarah. MCCAMMON: So make the case. Why, as you write, are Facebook groups destroying America? JANKOWICZ: Well, the most important thing to understand is that disinformation runs on emotion, and groups are highly emotional spaces. Over time, the moderators of groups use the community that they build there to create a sense of trust. And in many cases, people use it for a lot of great things. But in some cases, these are really polarizing environments where not only are people getting content that is really indoctrinating there - we're seeing some white supremacist content there, we're seeing the Obamagate conspiracy spreading through groups. So you join one group, then you'll be suggested to join another group. So it's a really difficult problem to solve because at the core of this is Facebook's business model. It wants you to spend more time on the platform, more engagement. And if that engagement is serving you more divisive content, it's going to keep doing that. MCCAMMON: Remind us, if you would, what's the difference between these Facebook groups and the way the rest of Facebook works? And what makes them so susceptible, as you say, to disinformation? JANKOWICZ: So after the 2016 election, Facebook really wanted to make the platform a little bit more like your digital living room and not the digital public square. It surfaced more content from friends and family, and groups were a big part of that strategy. Rather than seeing content from pages, which, you know, media outlets, brands, celebrities have, it was surfacing more of that friends and family content. It's a real problem, though. Basically these are spaces that aren't - they don't have the same amount of oversight as other spaces. They are moderated by group moderators. And Facebook doesn't look at them, but they can also be private and secret, which means that bad actors can target people who are going to be most vulnerable. MCCAMMON: You write about the dangers of Facebook groups. Now, not everybody's on Facebook. Not everybody's in groups. There's a whole universe of social media out there where false and inflammatory content is also spreading. Why focus on this? JANKOWICZ: The reason that my co-author and I decided to focus on groups is because it has been the primary vector of disinformation on Facebook for the past several years. And I think it is kind of a sleeping giant. People don't realize that because of the community and the trust that is endemic to groups that they might be being played. And I think it's really important to raise awareness about that, especially as we head into the election. We need to have our guards up right now. MCCAMMON: So what changes does Facebook need to make? JANKOWICZ: We think it's really important that Facebook show how groups are connected because often, one group moderator will control several groups that are sharing similar divisive or straight-up disinformation content. And users deserve to know that. And after a certain point, groups aren't really private spaces anymore if they have tens or hundreds of thousands of members. So we're suggesting that Facebook not allow groups to be private or secret over a certain threshold, say 5,000 members. So I think the bottom line is more transparency. I think the most important thing is to arm users with information so that they can navigate this information flow during these very confusing times.

Nationwide insurance is shutting five regional offices because remote work has gone so smoothly during the pandemic, and thousands of employees will permanently ditch their commutes for home offices.

BERLINER: Shultz says he gets at least as much done from home as in the office, and that tracks Lister's survey showing 77% of workers say they're fully productive at home. And managers are largely satisfied with their work performance. Now the caveats - more than half of working Americans can't do their jobs remotely at all. And before we get giddy thinking that work from home is a cure-all, it's worth listening to Judy Olson. JUDY OLSON: I've been studying distance work for about 30 years now. BERLINER: Olson is a professor at the University of California, Irvine. She says there are significant downsides to remote work. Collaboration with colleagues often suffers. You can feel lonely and isolated. OLSON: The hardest thing for somebody to deal with long distance is silence.

Ahead of the event, the president's campaign manager said more than a million people had expressed interest online. But the Tulsa Fire Department estimated that far fewer people showed up - about 6,000. As NPR's Bobby Allyn reports, an effort to prank the campaign organized on the social media app TikTok may have played a role. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: At a high school in Iowa, Mary Jo Laupp directs musical theater production. And she's not a fan of President Trump. When she heard about Trump planning a campaign launch event in Tulsa, Okla. , she hatched a plan. MARY JO LAUPP: I have a friend who's been known to do the whole register for two tickets for the other guy's rally and not go, her own little mini rebellion. Nobody ever knows she does it, but she feels good. ALLYN: And Laupp thought she would feel good if she did the same thing. She jumped on TikTok, the favorite app of the kids at her high school, and issued a call to action. (SOUNDBITE OF TIKTOK VIDEO)LAUPP: I recommend that all of those of us that want to see this 19,000-seat auditorium barely filled or completely empty, go reserve tickets now and leave him standing there alone on the stage. What do you say? ALLYN: And it caught on. Prominent TikTokkers (ph) shared it. Fans of Korean pop with large Twitter followings boosted it. A day after making the video, 300,000 people had said they were interested in the event. The Trump campaign would go on to say that more than a million people had requested tickets. Steve Schmidt is a political strategist in Park City, Utah, who has worked on Republican presidential campaigns but strongly opposes President Trump. Schmidt was talking to his 16-year-old daughter who told him, yeah, even I got a ticket to Trump's rally as a joke. STEVE SCHMIDT: She goes, well, all the kids do - you know, everybody. Like, there's hundreds of kids who have probably thousands of tickets just in Park City - says it's all over TikTok. ALLYN: At the Bank of Oklahoma Center on Saturday, Trump canceled plans to address an outdoor overflow section because there was almost no one there. Inside the arena, a crowd of people was surrounded by sparsely filled upper rafters. Tulsa city officials say the crowd was about 6,200 people. The Trump campaign told NPR that fears over the coronavirus and protesters is what really depressed turnout. The campaign says it didn't cap registration, and it was first come, first serve, saying the phony TikTok-fueled sign-ups was not a factor in their planning. And it is true that online enthusiasm doesn't always translate into a large rally crowd, says Tim Fullerton. He's a former Obama presidential campaign staffer. TIM FULLERTON: You know, you always get more RSVPs for an event than end up showing up. It's just the nature. It's called the flake rate. ALLYN: The flake rate, a global pandemic, a massive online prank - a lot could have shrunk attendance. But Schmidt, the political strategist, says there is no doubt TikTokkers duped the Trump campaign. SCHMIDT: It was really an act of civil disobedience, of subversion by young people who understand the consequences and are appalled and disgusted by the comportment and behavior of this president. ALLYN: Back in Iowa, Laupp, who is 51, has become known as TikTok Grandma. She argues that it's not important to ever know for sure the extent of the online prank's impact. LAUPP: Whatever the real reasons were, we'll probably never all know. It's probably somewhere in the middle of all of this, that it was a little bit of everything that played in. But I do know that there are 15-, 16-, 17- on up to 24-, 25-year-old kids that are saying, we did this. ALLYN: Laupp says that feeling will lead to more online activism by young people, including around get-out-the-vote efforts - at least for those old enough to vote. Bobby Allyn, NPR News, San Francisco. (SOUNDBITE OF DOJA CAT'S \"SAY SO\") RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:   President Trump's campaign had high hopes for its rally in Tulsa, Okla. , over the weekend. Ahead of the event, the president's campaign manager said more than a million people had expressed interest online. But the Tulsa Fire Department estimated that far fewer people showed up - about 6,000. As NPR's Bobby Allyn reports, an effort to prank the campaign organized on the social media app TikTok may have played a role. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: At a high school in Iowa, Mary Jo Laupp directs musical theater production. And she's not a fan of President Trump. When she heard about Trump planning a campaign launch event in Tulsa, Okla. , she hatched a plan. MARY JO LAUPP: I have a friend who's been known to do the whole register for two tickets for the other guy's rally and not go, her own little mini rebellion. Nobody ever knows she does it, but she feels good. ALLYN: And Laupp thought she would feel good if she did the same thing. She jumped on TikTok, the favorite app of the kids at her high school, and issued a call to action. (SOUNDBITE OF TIKTOK VIDEO) LAUPP: I recommend that all of those of us that want to see this 19,000-seat auditorium barely filled or completely empty, go reserve tickets now and leave him standing there alone on the stage. What do you say? ALLYN: And it caught on. Prominent TikTokkers (ph) shared it. Fans of Korean pop with large Twitter followings boosted it. A day after making the video, 300,000 people had said they were interested in the event. The Trump campaign would go on to say that more than a million people had requested tickets.

I'm Manoush Zomorodi. And on the show today, ideas for curious thinkers of all ages. And our guide on this hour is my predecessor, Guy Raz. GUY RAZ, BYLINE: Hello. ZOMORODI: Hello. OK. So, Guy, we just heard Suzanne Simard tell us about how trees cooperate with one another. And it really gets you thinking about how all kinds of other beings may be communicating. . . RAZ: Yeah. ZOMORODI: . . . Which brings us to the next topic that you brought us - dolphins. RAZ: Oh, man, yeah. ZOMORODI: Can't go wrong with dolphins. RAZ: Can't go wrong with dolphins. I learned about - and dolphins, like, communicate through clicks, right? ZOMORODI: Yeah. RAZ: And I learned about this from the person we're about to hear, Denise Herzing. She has spent her entire life studying a very specific pod of dolphins in the Bahamas. And I remember, Manoush, I remember seeing this TED Talk in person in 2013. And I was totally blown away at the idea that one day we might be able to talk, to communicate with - not just with dolphins, but with animals, like Dr. Dolittle, right? Were you fascinated by that story as a kid? Remember that? ZOMORODI: (Laughter) Yes, totally. RAZ: And we are closer to that possibility today than ever before. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)RAZ: I've seen lots of pictures of you underwater holding a camera. When you're down there. . . (SOUNDBITE OF WATER RUSHING)RAZ: . . . Does it feel like it's almost, like, a - I don't know - like, just a better place to be? I don't - do you ever get that feeling? DENISE HERZING: Well, you know, it's an immersion into a three-dimensional world - you know, the tides and the currents and the salt and the waves. And, I mean, that all feeds into your understanding of what their world is like. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)HERZING: But usually when I'm down there, I'm, like, trying to follow behavior and making sure my camera's on. So it's actually mostly work, really. RAZ: Right. Denise Herzing has been doing that work every summer with the same group of dolphins in the Bahamas. . . HERZING: Let's see. I just calculated it recently. RAZ: . . . For 35 years. HERZING: Yeah, like, 3,000 encounters in the water with the dolphins. And then each of those encounters is about 20 minutes long, so. . . RAZ: Over 1,000 hours of footage and observational data. HERZING: So, yeah, it's a lot of data, certainly for dolphins. RAZ: And the point of all that data, of all that work is to help Denise answer one question. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HERZING: Do they have a language? And if so, what are they talking about? RAZ: Here's Denise Herzing on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HERZING: Now, I'm interested in dolphins because of their large brains. And we know they use some of that brainpower for just living complicated lives. But what do we really know about dolphin intelligence? We know that their brain-to-body ratio, which is a physical measure of intelligence, is second only to humans. Cognitively, they can understand artificially created languages. And they pass self-awareness tests in mirrors. And in some parts of the world, they use tools like sponges to hunt fish. Now, dolphins are natural acousticians. They make sounds 10 times as high and hear sounds 10 times as high as we do, but they have other communication signals they use. They have good vision, so they use body postures to communicate. They have taste, not smell. And they have touch. And sound can actually be felt in the water because the acoustic impedance of tissue in water is about the same, so dolphins can buzz and tickle each other at a distance. So decades ago - not years ago (laughter) - I set out to find a place in the world where I could observe dolphins underwater and to try to crack the code of their communication system. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: Well, first of all, how do dolphins communicate to each other? HERZING: Well, you know, we can actually hear a fair amount. Their whistles are fairly audible to us. (SOUNDBITE OF DOLPHIN WHISTLING)HERZING: They have clicks. (SOUNDBITE OF DOLPHIN CLICKING)HERZING: They have burst pulses, which are also. . . (SOUNDBITE OF DOLPHIN CLICKING)HERZING: . . . Packets of clicks. (SOUNDBITE OF DOLPHIN CLICKING)HERZING: So they have all these different cues. And they, you know, use body postures in combination with sounds that will basically communicate certain things to each other. RAZ: You know, this is total anthropomorphization, but, like, when you think of - like, when you see a dolphin animated or drawn in a kid's book, they seem to be smiling. But we should not interpolate that that means that they're happy all the time, right? HERZING: Oh, definitely not. Yeah, that is just a physical (laughter) - physical thing that they have going, yeah. RAZ: How do you respond when other researchers say - you know, push back and say, hey, like, let's not do that; let's not anthropomorphize these creatures? HERZING: You know, you just keep doing your work, I think. I don't even think it's a discussion anymore, honestly. Most of us that work with social mammals, I think, have kind of moved beyond that and just say, well, it's a valuable tool for thinking about how they might think. And let's do the work. RAZ: Is it even weird to talk about dolphin language? Or is it - should we be talking about dolphin communication? HERZING: Yeah, we don't really usually talk about language because we don't know if they have it yet. But thinking out of the box is - you know, it's like intelligence. You know, are there different kinds and types of intelligence? Are there different kinds and types of language? I mean, we know there's tons of kinds of language with humans, right? RAZ: Yeah. HERZING: But one of the big things about language is that you can communicate about a different time and space, right? Are they talking about the food they're chasing? Are they eating? Or are they talking about, hey, let's go to the reef in a couple days and meet up with this other group. You know, we don't know. And that's where, you know, anthropomorphism can be a tool for thinking about how animals might be thinking. RAZ: Which brings us back to the Bahamas and a pivotal moment in Denise Herzing's years of work with Atlantic spotted dolphins there. It happened one summer. HERZING: I guess in the mid-'90s. RAZ: The dolphins did something they had never done with Denise before. HERZING: We just started noticing the dolphins would just start doing things. And this is completely wild, right? But we knew the individuals. And they would start doing things like mimicking our body posture, in some cases mimicking, like, the rhythm of our sounds in the water if we were doing anything vocally. And we just kind of thought, man, wouldn't it be cool to see if we empowered them to communicate back to us? RAZ: And the key to unlocking that communication turned out to be play. Dolphins, just like humans, love to play games, mostly with toys, a piece of rope, a bit of seaweed, anything they can pull around in the water. HERZING: Correct. RAZ: So what kind of games do they like to play? HERZING: Well, it's mostly called keep away (laughter). That is, if they get the toy, then the idea is they like to be chased. They like to let you get almost close enough to grab the toy, but then they speed off. And that's the game. That's what they play with each other, actually. RAZ: The only question was how to use that play to crack the code, the code that would unlock the meaning behind the dolphins' noises. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HERZING: Now, one way to crack the code is to interpret these signals and figure out what they mean. But it's a difficult job. And we actually don't have a Rosetta Stone yet. But a second way to crack the code is to develop some technology - an interface - to do two-way communication. And that's what we've been trying to do in the Bahamas and in real-time. So we built a portable keyboard that we could push through the water. And we labeled four objects they like to play with - a scarf, rope, sargassum - and also had a bow ride, which is a fun activity for a dolphin. (SOUNDBITE OF WHISTLE)HERZING: And that's the scarf whistle. And these are artificially created whistles. They're outside the dolphins' normal repertoire, but they're easily mimicked by the dolphins. And I spent four years with my colleagues Adam Pack and Fabienne Delfour working out in the field with this keyboard, using it with each other to do requests for toys while the dolphins were watching. And the dolphins could get in on the game. They could point at the visual object. Or they could mimic the whistle. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: Another way to imagine this experiment, Denise says, is think of how you try to teach words to a baby. HERZING: And you're trying to get them to understand the word milk, so you have a glass of milk and you're going, here's some milk. Or do you want the milk? Or would you like some milk? So we're not really teaching them commands. We're exposing them to the communication system with the hopes that they'll learn to use it to communicate back to us what they want. RAZ: OK, so an underwater keyboard, four buttons, each with a different whistle sound for a different toy. HERZING: So the dolphins were actually doing really cool things. Like, we would play the computer whistle, say, like. . . (SOUNDBITE OF WHISTLING)HERZING: . . . For sargassum, which is a piece of seaweed they play with. (SOUNDBITE OF WHISTLE)HERZING: And the dolphins would immediately tag on another whistle to the end of the computer whistle. RAZ: So yeah, the answer to the question, do dolphins have a language - is maybe, kind of. They certainly have a desire to communicate. So now Denise and her fellow researchers are teaming up with a group of computer scientists to use machine learning to try to parse and analyze those extra whistles and figure out what they might mean. HERZING: So that's actually what we're going to be doing late this summer. RAZ: Well, like, when an anthropologist stumbles on a discovery and some ancient tablet - right? - they can spend a lifetime trying to decipher it and then figure out what those symbols meant. But that's a physical thing that you can look at, right? I mean, you can imagine that this is a version of that. But with increasing computing power, you could potentially imagine a scenario where the hieroglyphics, so to speak, in dolphin communication could be decoded. HERZING: Yeah, well, that's what we're working on. I mean, remember, you know, hieroglyphs is a written language. RAZ: Sure. HERZING: And that's something that dolphins will never have, at least I can't imagine it. But, you know, maybe they have an oral history that they produce like humans did - right? - before we even had writing. But, yeah, I have no doubt that machine learning's really going to help us parse out information. RAZ: So if you or I went to Europe 20 years ago, we would have a little phrase book and that might be all we had. And now you can just speak into Google Translate. And then you can play it. And it will play it for someone. You can imagine in 20 or 30 years from now traveling to Asia and speaking in real-time and having, like, a headset around your head that was a simultaneous translator, an AI translator, that would enable you to have a really serious and deep conversation with somebody in their language. HERZING: Yeah, sure. I mean, and that's probably coming in shorter than 20 years, I would bet. RAZ: Yeah, right. HERZING: And, you know, what's really interesting is if you look at how other animals communicate with each other - and they do, right? We're way behind the times because we don't have to communicate with animals, right? But there are a lot of birds that already know the alarm calls of their neighboring species because it helps them survive. So nature already communicates in many ways just without us in the loop. So we probably should get in the loop. ZOMORODI: That's so beautiful. And there's no dolphins where I'm spending the summer, Guy, but there are a lot, a lot of birds. And we've been trying (laughter) - my kids and I have been trying to imitate their calls and see if they'll respond to us. We don't know what we're saying in these bird languages. Hopefully we're being polite back to the birds. But I do love this idea of interspecies communication. It is just. . . RAZ: I know, right? ZOMORODI: . . . Awesome, yes. RAZ: I mean, how amazing would that be - right? - like, to be able to really communicate with animals. And I mean, it might, as she says in the segment, like, it might be on a different level. We're not going to be talking about Kierkegaard. But, you know, you think about what Denise is working on and then you think about, like, computing power and how much better computers are going to be able to process information and already are, and it, I mean, it seems like it could be a real possibility. ZOMORODI: I mean, not just the communication of, you know, needs, but also the playfulness that is part of the dolphins world and. . . RAZ: Totally. ZOMORODI: . . . That their favorite game is keep away. Dare I ask what your species, you and your children, do you have a favorite game these days? RAZ: In the middle of quarantine we've gotten really into Sleeping Queens. That's our jam right now. It's a card game. ZOMORODI: Oh. RAZ: Totally - it's awesome. ZOMORODI: It's good? RAZ: I've got a 9-year-old and an 11-year-old. We all play it together. Yeah, it's great. ZOMORODI: Oh, nice. MANOUSH ZOMORODI, HOST:   It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Manoush Zomorodi. And on the show today, ideas for curious thinkers of all ages. And our guide on this hour is my predecessor, Guy Raz. GUY RAZ, BYLINE: Hello. ZOMORODI: Hello. OK. So, Guy, we just heard Suzanne Simard tell us about how trees cooperate with one another. And it really gets you thinking about how all kinds of other beings may be communicating. . . RAZ: Yeah. ZOMORODI: . . . Which brings us to the next topic that you brought us - dolphins. RAZ: Oh, man, yeah. ZOMORODI: Can't go wrong with dolphins. RAZ: Can't go wrong with dolphins. I learned about - and dolphins, like, communicate through clicks, right? ZOMORODI: Yeah. RAZ: And I learned about this from the person we're about to hear, Denise Herzing. She has spent her entire life studying a very specific pod of dolphins in the Bahamas. And I remember, Manoush, I remember seeing this TED Talk in person in 2013. And I was totally blown away at the idea that one day we might be able to talk, to communicate with - not just with dolphins, but with animals, like Dr. Dolittle, right? Were you fascinated by that story as a kid? Remember that? ZOMORODI: (Laughter) Yes, totally. RAZ: And we are closer to that possibility today than ever before. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) RAZ: I've seen lots of pictures of you underwater holding a camera. When you're down there. . . (SOUNDBITE OF WATER RUSHING) RAZ: . . . Does it feel like it's almost, like, a - I don't know - like, just a better place to be? I don't - do you ever get that feeling? DENISE HERZING: Well, you know, it's an immersion into a three-dimensional world - you know, the tides and the currents and the salt and the waves. And, I mean, that all feeds into your understanding of what their world is like. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) HERZING: But usually when I'm down there, I'm, like, trying to follow behavior and making sure my camera's on. So it's actually mostly work, really. RAZ: Right. Denise Herzing has been doing that work every summer with the same group of dolphins in the Bahamas. . . HERZING: Let's see. I just calculated it recently. RAZ: . . . For 35 years. HERZING: Yeah, like, 3,000 encounters in the water with the dolphins. And then each of those encounters is about 20 minutes long, so. . . RAZ: Over 1,000 hours of footage and observational data. HERZING: So, yeah, it's a lot of data, certainly for dolphins. RAZ: And the point of all that data, of all that work is to help Denise answer one question. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) HERZING: Do they have a language? And if so, what are they talking about? RAZ: Here's Denise Herzing on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) HERZING: Now, I'm interested in dolphins because of their large brains. And we know they use some of that brainpower for just living complicated lives. But what do we really know about dolphin intelligence? We know that their brain-to-body ratio, which is a physical measure of intelligence, is second only to humans. Cognitively, they can understand artificially created languages. And they pass self-awareness tests in mirrors. And in some parts of the world, they use tools like sponges to hunt fish. Now, dolphins are natural acousticians. They make sounds 10 times as high and hear sounds 10 times as high as we do, but they have other communication signals they use. They have good vision, so they use body postures to communicate. They have taste, not smell. And they have touch. And sound can actually be felt in the water because the acoustic impedance of tissue in water is about the same, so dolphins can buzz and tickle each other at a distance. So decades ago - not years ago (laughter) - I set out to find a place in the world where I could observe dolphins underwater and to try to crack the code of their communication system. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: Well, first of all, how do dolphins communicate to each other? HERZING: Well, you know, we can actually hear a fair amount. Their whistles are fairly audible to us. (SOUNDBITE OF DOLPHIN WHISTLING) HERZING: They have clicks. (SOUNDBITE OF DOLPHIN CLICKING) HERZING: They have burst pulses, which are also. . . (SOUNDBITE OF DOLPHIN CLICKING) HERZING: . . . Packets of clicks. (SOUNDBITE OF DOLPHIN CLICKING) HERZING: So they have all these different cues. And they, you know, use body postures in combination with sounds that will basically communicate certain things to each other. RAZ: You know, this is total anthropomorphization, but, like, when you think of - like, when you see a dolphin animated or drawn in a kid's book, they seem to be smiling. But we should not interpolate that that means that they're happy all the time, right? HERZING: Oh, definitely not. Yeah, that is just a physical (laughter) - physical thing that they have going, yeah. RAZ: How do you respond when other researchers say - you know, push back and say, hey, like, let's not do that; let's not anthropomorphize these creatures? HERZING: You know, you just keep doing your work, I think. I don't even think it's a discussion anymore, honestly. Most of us that work with social mammals, I think, have kind of moved beyond that and just say, well, it's a valuable tool for thinking about how they might think. And let's do the work. RAZ: Is it even weird to talk about dolphin language? Or is it - should we be talking about dolphin communication? HERZING: Yeah, we don't really usually talk about language because we don't know if they have it yet. But thinking out of the box is - you know, it's like intelligence. You know, are there different kinds and types of intelligence? Are there different kinds and types of language? I mean, we know there's tons of kinds of language with humans, right? RAZ: Yeah. HERZING: But one of the big things about language is that you can communicate about a different time and space, right? Are they talking about the food they're chasing? Are they eating? Or are they talking about, hey, let's go to the reef in a couple days and meet up with this other group. You know, we don't know. And that's where, you know, anthropomorphism can be a tool for thinking about how animals might be thinking. RAZ: Which brings us back to the Bahamas and a pivotal moment in Denise Herzing's years of work with Atlantic spotted dolphins there. It happened one summer. HERZING: I guess in the mid-'90s. RAZ: The dolphins did something they had never done with Denise before. HERZING: We just started noticing the dolphins would just start doing things. And this is completely wild, right? But we knew the individuals. And they would start doing things like mimicking our body posture, in some cases mimicking, like, the rhythm of our sounds in the water if we were doing anything vocally. And we just kind of thought, man, wouldn't it be cool to see if we empowered them to communicate back to us? RAZ: And the key to unlocking that communication turned out to be play. Dolphins, just like humans, love to play games, mostly with toys, a piece of rope, a bit of seaweed, anything they can pull around in the water. HERZING: Correct. RAZ: So what kind of games do they like to play? HERZING: Well, it's mostly called keep away (laughter). That is, if they get the toy, then the idea is they like to be chased. They like to let you get almost close enough to grab the toy, but then they speed off. And that's the game. That's what they play with each other, actually. RAZ: The only question was how to use that play to crack the code, the code that would unlock the meaning behind the dolphins' noises. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) HERZING: Now, one way to crack the code is to interpret these signals and figure out what they mean. But it's a difficult job. And we actually don't have a Rosetta Stone yet. But a second way to crack the code is to develop some technology - an interface - to do two-way communication. And that's what we've been trying to do in the Bahamas and in real-time.

Organizers use it to plan rallies, spread videos and build coalitions. But it's also become a tool used by federal and local authorities to identify protesters. Allie Funk has been tracking this. She's a senior research analyst for technology and democracy at Freedom House. And she joins us now. Welcome. ALLIE FUNK: Happy to be here. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So can you elaborate what we mean when we say Internet surveillance - what we saw in Philadelphia where a protester's shirt was tracked through Etsy to identify and arrest her? How does that work, exactly? FUNK: Yeah. So Internet surveillance or social media surveillance is really when authorities collect and process all of this personal information that's up on Facebook and Twitter about us. And it's often through automated technology that really allows for real-time access to and storage of our locations, our images. It can be who we're talking to and what we're talking about. And then there's also this more manual monitoring of platforms that's happening where police may be making fake accounts to actually friend activists on Facebook and then get access to more private information. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Is this public information? Are these sort of big media surveillance operations a breach of constitutional rights? FUNK: Our take is, you know, just because something is public doesn't mean that it's really, like, a free-for-all. This sort of information is some of the most intimate details of our lives. You can find out what somebody's religious belief or sexual orientation is online. And really, you know, democracy sort of requires that you have these vibrant public spaces where people can talk and collaborate and organize, you know, freely so that then they can - when they want, they can protest and, you know, let the government know that they might not agree with a certain policy. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So I guess law enforcement would say these tools are necessary because they allow them to be able to pinpoint people who might be committing crimes and to use sophisticated modern technology to track them down in a way that allows them, you know, to do so perhaps more efficiently. FUNK: Yes, they would. I think that's the argument for why they're using these tools. And I think what we really need is just robust oversight and transparency. We don't even know what is really happening and what tools they have. What we find out is through Freedom of Information Acts or court documents. So really, if we think that the same protections that we all have offline over our personal property in our homes, which means law enforcement need to get a warrant or have reasonable cause, should be also the same safeguards protected online over our online speech and our online communications. GARCIA-NAVARRO: What are the implications in particular for the use of surveillance for people of color, specifically? FUNK: So, you know, these tools can entrench racial discrimination because a lot of the AI or sophisticated technology that's being used for social media surveillance and also, you know, facial recognition are built upon biased data. So they're just reinforcing the racism that is sort of already within our policing system. And then on top of that, the ways in which they're being deployed by local and federal law enforcement are disproportionately impacting racial and religious minorities and also people who are undocumented. GARCIA-NAVARRO: I've seen this argument made about specifically social media, which is that ultimately, there's an understanding that when we use social media, it is, in a sense, public speech and that if you don't want the government to, you know, judge you on it, you shouldn't be saying things that could be potentially inflammatory or put you at peril. What would you say to that argument? FUNK: I think today, especially if you think about the pandemic we're in, these platforms are really fundamental to our everyday life. So we need Twitter or Facebook or Instagram or Zoom to even go about our workday. We need it to communicate to the people that we love and to get access to, you know, accurate health care information. So I don't think - I think now that these spaces are so important to our everyday life, they are fundamental in order for us to exercise free expression, exercise access to information and, you know, our First Amendment rights to protest. So I think that these public spaces are necessary to keep free from constant surveillance in order for us to have a full realization of those First Amendment rights.

But it also has a troubling side. For years, Black users have complained the app is used for racial profiling. More recently, the app has been criticized for censoring posts related to Black Lives Matter. NPR's Bobby Allyn takes a look at the company's plan to make the platform more welcoming to Black users. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Ask Myesha Fruzier (ph) how often she sees racist comments on Nextdoor, and she'll tell you. . . MYESHA FRUZIER: You know, it was so many I can't even count. ALLYN: Fruzier's a Black mother of two in what she described as a mostly white, conservative-leaning community in San Diego. Like many, she's been on Nextdoor a lot during the pandemic, and she says about 90% of her neighbors come across as good, decent people. FRUZIER: That other 10% - they must be hiding behind the computer. But I never would've thought that my neighborhood had those kind of people - racist people in it. ALLYN: In one post, a neighbor was suspicious about a Black person who was going on a walk. Another asked, do Black Lives Matter protesters have jobs? FRUZIER: I said, what does this have to do with equality and justice? ALLYN: It was against this backdrop that corporate Nextdoor publicly pledged support for Black Lives Matter. At the same time, many neighborhood discussions about the movement, like Fruzier's, were being deleted. Volunteer moderators were taking them down. Some said they were just following Nextdoor's community guidelines on keeping national topics out of local threads. Nextdoor CEO Sarah Friar told NPR she's the one who's responsible for those actions by moderators. Nextdoor calls them leads. SARAH FRIAR: Really our fault. We did not move quickly enough to tell our leads that topics like Black Lives Matter were local in terms of their relevance. ALLYN: Nextdoor has since updated its guidance to its quarter of a million volunteer moderators and now says, yes, Black Lives Matter content is relevant in a hyperlocal neighborhood app. Friar is also announcing other steps. All moderators will soon be provided unconscious bias training, and Nextdoor is launching a campaign to recruit more Black users to be moderators. FRIAR: That is an underrepresented group on Nextdoor. And there are others, of course, but we want to start there because we really feel that the Black Lives Matter movement is so critical and important right now to just the health of our country. ALLYN: In northwest Indiana, Jennifer Jackson Outlaw (ph) had a lukewarm reception to these changes. She's a Black woman who became fed up with Nextdoor and deleted the app. She thinks Nextdoor's mostly white executive office needs a shake-up. JENNIFER JACKSON OUTLAW: It's important to not only have representation as far as those who are the moderator but also those who are in the leadership of the company who may be more well-versed on some of the issues. ALLYN: Back in San Diego, Fruzier says after complaining enough, the thread on racial justice reappeared. Scrolling through, she saw a neighbor who said Black Lives Matter was unsettling. Fruzier jumped in the discussion. FRUZIER: The lady said she was afraid of Black Lives Matter. I said, well, if that's the way you feel, well, maybe we should meet up and talk about it. ALLYN: And they did meet up. They met for a stroll in a local park. They swapped stories about being mothers and living in the same community. But they also talked about how different it is to be Black in America. FRUZIER: If my son go out, I have to have a talk with him. I have to say, hey, you know, you can't wear that hoodie. Always look over your shoulder. Don't say this. You don't wear that shirt. Always be polite. And she was like, wow, really? Yeah. Yeah. That's what we have to do. ALLYN: It's the kind of neighborly exchange on race that Nextdoor would like to see happen more often in an ideal world. Bobby Allyn, NPR News, San Francisco. (SOUNDBITE OF THE POSTAL SERVICE SONG, \"TURN AROUND\") MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:   Nextdoor - it's the popular social media app where you report your missing dog or look for a plumber or sell a piece of furniture to your neighbor. But it also has a troubling side. For years, Black users have complained the app is used for racial profiling. More recently, the app has been criticized for censoring posts related to Black Lives Matter. NPR's Bobby Allyn takes a look at the company's plan to make the platform more welcoming to Black users. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Ask Myesha Fruzier (ph) how often she sees racist comments on Nextdoor, and she'll tell you. . . MYESHA FRUZIER: You know, it was so many I can't even count. ALLYN: Fruzier's a Black mother of two in what she described as a mostly white, conservative-leaning community in San Diego. Like many, she's been on Nextdoor a lot during the pandemic, and she says about 90% of her neighbors come across as good, decent people. FRUZIER: That other 10% - they must be hiding behind the computer. But I never would've thought that my neighborhood had those kind of people - racist people in it.

The tech giant controls what apps you can find and how much developers get paid for each purchase. Does Apple wield all that power to gain an unfair advantage? Regulators in the U. S. and Europe want to know as NPR's Bobby Allyn reports. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: More than 30 billion apps were downloaded just last year through Apple. David Heinemeier Hansson hoped his new app could join them. He's the co-founder of software company Basecamp. It recently launched a slick email service with no ads called Hey. It costs $99, and Basecamp planned to pocket every cent. DAVID HEINEMEIER HANSSON: Here comes Apple, shows up with a demand to take 30% of our revenue. And it wasn't just that they were going to hold back our updates, they threatened to kick us out of the app store. ALLYN: And he says getting kicked out of Apple's app store could mean make or break for a new app. HANSSON: This trillion-dollar company bearing down on our small, 50-person software company, it didn't feel like a fair fight. In fact, it wasn't even really a fight. It was just us getting squashed. ALLYN: The pushback against Apple's 30% cut isn't just about the fee itself, which some critics call the Apple tax, but Hanson says that the fee appears to be applied unevenly. Streaming services Netflix and Hulu, for instance, have found ways around paying Apple's fees. HANSSON: The guidelines they have are full of sweetheart deals to particularly large companies. ALLYN: That's issue one. The second issue, critics who say Apple is trying to undercut its rivals. Apple doesn't charge its own app Apple Music any fee, but it does charge its competition, Spotify. A Spotify representative told European regulators recently, quote, \"Apple acts as stadium owner, referee and player and tilts the playing field to favor its own services. \"DAVID YOFFIE: Developers have a reasonable case. . . ALLYN: That's David Yoffie. He's a Harvard Business School professor. YOFFIE: . . . Particularly where Apple tends to be relatively indiscriminate in the way in which it often throws people off the platform and has the ability to literally put people out of business. ALLYN: We wanted to hear from Apple, but the company wouldn't talk to us for this story. In multiple statements, it defended its app store rules and says it applies them equally across the board. Apple says its 30% fee is for privacy and security reviews. The company also stood by its exceptions. For instance, Lyft, Uber and Airbnb aren't charged a commission because users are paying for something tangible, like a ride downtown or a place to stay. Apple says its fees only apply when people pay for digital stuff. Here's Yoffie. YOFFIE: The percentage of people who actually buy apps on Apple are significantly higher than on an Android. And as a consequence, that gives Apple enormous power. ALLYN: Heinemeier Hansson expects almost all of the people willing to pay for his new email service to be iPhone users. He says Apple should give both large and small developers more leeway around app store rules. HANSSON: This is what we're asking for. Give us choice. Choice leads to competition. Competition leads to lower prices, which benefits consumers. It benefits the marketplace. It benefits everyone, perhaps, except Apple's bottom line. ALLYN: Congressman David Cicilline, a Democrat who leads the House's antitrust investigations, agrees. He's compared Apple's app store fees to highway robbery. He says Apple's control of apps is a kind of monopoly power that discourages competition. The Justice Department is looking into this. So are regulators in Europe.

On Monday, the live-streaming platform Twitch suspended the president's account for posting what it labeled hateful content. It's not clear how long that suspension will last. Also on Monday, the discussion website Reddit announced it was banning its largest community devoted to President Trump. That community is called The_Donald. And Reddit said it had consistently broken the company's rules against hate speech and inciting violence. This comes a year after Reddit put a warning on The_Donald to caution that it was out of line with the platform's policies. Back then, we spoke with Robert Peck about this. He's a lecturer in rhetoric at the University of Iowa, and he volunteers as a moderator for Reddit. Robert Peck joins us again. Welcome back. ROBERT PECK: Thank you for having me. PFEIFFER: Robert, for our listeners who don't spend time on Reddit or aren't familiar with this particular subreddit called The_Donald, would you describe, what is it? What type of group discussion happens there, and how wide is its reach? PECK: Of course. Reddit is a little bit unlike other big social media sites - things like Facebook and Twitter. Those sites often are based around an individual person's profile. On Reddit, conversely, most people follow topics rather than individual people. And Reddit calls those pages dedicated to those topics subreddits. The Trump subreddit, which is called The_Donald, is dedicated ostensibly to President Trump and his doings. And at the time of its recent ban, it had just under 600,000 current subscribers - though at its peak usage, which was within the last couple of years, it had three quarters of a million. The subreddit has become somewhat infamous. In fact, I would go so far as to call it maybe the most infamous page that has ever existed on Reddit. Over the course of the last few years, it has been home to Russian propaganda efforts that were caught both by volunteers on the site and by Reddit's own staff. There have been several incidents of the appearance of hate speech and hateful memes on the page that were then taken up by Trump himself and spread by his own campaign workers and by the president's own Twitter account. It's become a somewhat unpleasant place, as you can probably imagine. And that led into these recent actions that Reddit has taken against it. PFEIFFER: We mentioned that this Reddit community had gotten ugly enough that it had been disciplined before. But what changed that caused it to be outright banned? PECK: I don't know that anything in particular changed about the way the page itself was being used. Most of the actual activity that led to this ban has been unfolding over some years. I think what changed to lead to the ban is Reddit itself. And I think that it changed in response to recent happenings in the United States - things like the Black Lives Matter protests that have been unfolding over the last few months. In response to those things, Reddit has made several changes. And one of those changes is adding significantly to its rules about hate speech and discrimination on the site. And it seems to be in response to those changes that Reddit has also decided at last to act against The_Donald in a final way by banning the page outright. PFEIFFER: Does this put peer pressure on other social media sites like Facebook and Twitter to crack down more aggressively than they are on their own sites? PECK: I think it may well do so. The question in my mind is how similar Reddit is to those sites - sites like Twitter. We know Twitter has been taking actions to expose the president's hate speech recently. It's been doing things like flagging his tweets as rule-breaking and trying to correct information that it finds there without outright removing those posts itself. Now, Reddit has banned this group of supporters of the president. That's not quite the same to me as actually limiting the president's own ability to use social media. This is nonetheless an enormous action for Reddit to take. Whether other sites will follow or not, I can't say. They might feel they have other circumstances. But Reddit, at least, has been willing to take just about the most significant step it could against this group. PFEIFFER: Robert, from your perspective as a Reddit moderator, could the moderators of The_Donald have done something to try to prevent it from being banned? PECK: (Laughter) Oh, absolutely, they could. And it's - in addition to my perspective as a moderator, it's also something that the site's owner has made known both to the volunteers who ran that section of the site and to the users of the site more broadly. The site's owners, who are called the administrators of the site, frequently reached out to The_Donald's moderators, told them what was going wrong in their eyes on this subreddit and asked them please to make changes in the way they were enforcing the rules, both of their own page and of the site as a whole. But that's something the moderators of The_Donald obviously weren't willing to do. And as a result, their community has been banned. PFEIFFER: So for the time being, at least, people who used to share thoughts on the site no longer have that outlet. But that doesn't mean they can't go somewhere else. Is this a chance for a lesser-known site to gain that traffic? PECK: It certainly is. We know fairly confidently that this kind of thing from users of The_Donald is unlikely to take off on Reddit anymore. However, The_Donald's moderators have already tried to create an alternative platform. They've created a website called thedonald. win that they've for months already been redirecting users of their subreddit over to use. The best estimates I can find suggests that that page is fairly active and that use may spread that way. But limiting this activity on a big social media site is certainly a step in the right direction, even if it does spread to a privately-owned website with less resources and less exposure than Reddit itself. PFEIFFER: That's Robert Peck. He's a volunteer moderator for Reddit and a lecturer in rhetoric at the University of Iowa. Thanks for talking with us. PECK: Thanks for having me.

The best estimates I can find suggests that that page is fairly active and that use may spread that way. But limiting this activity on a big social media site is certainly a step in the right direction, even if it does spread to a privately-owned website with less resources and less exposure than Reddit itself.

Julian Bass, a 20-year-old theater major at Georgia State University, has been posting special effects videos on TikTok for a while now. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WATERMELON SUGAR\")HARRY STYLES: (Singing) Watermelon sugar high, watermelon sugar high. . . DETROW: But this time, he added a message to his tweet of the TikTok video showing him wielding a lightsaber and morphing into both Ben 10 and Spider-Man - if y'all can retweet this enough times that Disney calls, that'd be greatly appreciated. Twenty million views later, yeah, Disney called. NPR called too, and Julian Bass is on the line. So how's it going? JULIAN BASS: It is going absolutely amazing. I am kind of overflowing with emotions here. DETROW: So not only did Disney call. Disney's chairman, Bob Iger, was one of the many high-profile people from show business to tweet at you. How did you feel when this started to blow up? BASS: I had just gotten Twitter in April. And so it was very small for me, nothing more than maybe five likes per post. And to see it start to just gain some small traction with my immediate circle, and then the verified profiles start commenting - the first one for me was The Lonely Island. DETROW: Yeah. BASS: Then I started seeing Josh Gad, Matthew Cherry. I saw Mark Hamill liked it. I mean, if Mark Hamill likes it, I'm a Jedi now. I mean, it's just true. DETROW: I think so. I think that's a rule, yeah. So you're a theater major, but it's clear you're really good at special effects, like in this earlier video. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)BASS: Grab your lightsabers, your blasters and your best editing skills, and help me fight the Sith. DETROW: You're wielding a lightsaber. You're dodging blaster bolts. Do you want to be in front or behind the camera? BASS: Well, yeah, the skills that I have as a visual effects artist kind of were born out of me wanting to be in front of the camera and looking good while I'm doing it. My parents, you know, are fantastic for doing this, but they told me that, yeah, Julian, you can do this. You know, use this program, this little free thing here. Yeah, you can use a green screen and learn how to do that. And so I was like, if I can, why don't I, you know? If I want to act like Spider-Man, why not make it look like \"Spider-Man\"? DETROW: Has it mostly been self-taught, just practicing learning things, posting videos on your own, or have you been taking classes, as well? BASS: I haven't taken a single class. . . DETROW: Really? BASS: . . . For this stuff, no. DETROW: (Laughter) Wow. BASS: Yeah. I - you know, YouTube is probably the classroom. And there's, of course, a lot of free resources online. And even for this video that I just did, I watched tutorials for other effects because I know that there's a technique in there that I can apply to my own effect that I'm thinking about. DETROW: So you've gotten retweets and mentions from a lot of these high-profile people. Have you had any specific conversations yet about what this could lead to? BASS: A lot of people that you see retweet are people who actually reached out, and I heard from Louis D'Esposito from Marvel, its, like, bigwig, HBO Max. Everyone you can think of has just been blowing up my phone recently, and I just need to sort of mitigate, you know, how to respond to everybody and make sure I can get these opportunities and seize these opportunities in the best way possible. DETROW: So I want to ask you about one specific idea that a lot of people who saw this video seem to have and seem to share - an \"Ultimate Spider-Man\" movie starring Julian Bass as Miles Morales. How did that feel when you saw that suggestion coming in over and over? BASS: It's unreal for me. I'm a super fan of \"Spider-Man. \" My parents tell the story all the time that the first movie they took me to see as a baby was \"Spider-Man\" with Tobey Maguire. It came out in 2002. They were like, Julian, you were dead silent throughout the whole movie. You were super attentive for some reason. We don't know why. I just think \"Spider-Man\"'s so fun. It's so inspiring to me. Everything, every little aspect that you could possibly think of about \"Spider-Man\" is something that I'm aware of and I know of. And as for Miles Morales, it was a big deal for me to kind of see him come into the spotlight, and. . . DETROW: And for listeners who may be more familiar with Peter Parker, Miles Morales is the new Spider-Man. He's an Afro-Latino Spider-Man who's been in the comics the last few years and had an amazing movie, \"Into The Spider-Verse,\" a couple years ago, as well. BASS: Yeah. To be a fan of something and then see people want you to be a part of it - man, that's a chance that I will not ruin for myself whatsoever. You know, if they pass on it, look. That's OK. There's plenty more opportunities, but I feel like I'm ready to take my shot. And that's really what it's all about right now. DETROW: That's Julian Bass, maybe Spider-Man one day, definitely something one day, talking to us a couple days into his life as a viral social media star. Thank you, Julian. BASS: Thank you so much.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)LANCE ARMSTRONG: Yo, Dale (ph). Lance Armstrong here. Greetings from Nantucket. ALLYN: This is Cameo. The way it started is kind of random. Three years ago, CEO Steven Galanis was thinking about this fact - nearly 80% of retired NFL players go broke within two years of retirement. STEVEN GALANIS: And this was really shocking to me. When you look at the people that have gone broke, it is bold-namers; it is hall of famers. ALLYN: Galanis, a former Chicago stock trader, thought this is not just a sports thing. Fame is a weird concept in 2020, with more people than ever considered famous in one way or another. But many of them have trouble turning that fan base into income. To Galanis, that was an opportunity, especially now in the pandemic. GALANIS: In a world where all live entertainment has shut down, suddenly the whole creative class finds themselves unemployed all at one time. ALLYN: The business has grown sevenfold from last year. It's a treasure trove of people who've had their 15 minutes of fame or their 11 days in the spotlight.

July 1, even. My God. Happy birthday to you, man. ALLYN: Each celebrity sets their own price. The Mooch thinks his market value is $50 a video. CEO Galanis says some are making tons of money. He says Carole Baskin from the hit Netflix show \"Tiger King\" is cranking out hundreds of videos a day, pulling in $100,000 in just a single week, one $199 video at a time. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CAROLE BASKIN: Hey, all you cool cats and kittens. It's Carole Baskin at Big Cat Rescue. Danny (ph), you are one cool cat. ALLYN: With each video, Cameo takes a 25% cut. But who exactly is buying these videos? People like Tim Davis of Nashville. He found the site while searching for a gift for his wife. He noticed an actor from the sci-fi show \"Outlander,\" and his wife is a huge fan. For $40, this actor was willing to record her a personal birthday wish. TIM DAVIS: It was something that I thought would be a little bit different, and it was completely unexpected. CORALIE LE COGUIC: What is happening? (Laughter) I was so confused. ALLYN: That's Davis' wife Coralie Le Coguic. She was brought to tears she was so moved. Le Coguic finds the videos fun and entertaining.

The same offer appeared in the accounts of Elon Musk and Barack Obama, Joe Biden - bunch of other people. And Twitter had to briefly freeze parts of its system while cleaning up this obvious hack. But what's it doing to assure security now? NPR's Bobby Allyn has been digging into this. Good morning. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning. INSKEEP: How did this develop yesterday? ALLYN: So if you were on Twitter yesterday, you saw this tweet making the rounds, which said, as you noted, give us some money and we'll double it. To most people, this was very transparently a scam. But then a version of it was shared by some of the most rich and famous people in the world - Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Joe Biden, Barack Obama, Kanye West - the list goes on. And it was also shared by major companies like Uber and Apple. And suddenly, it became clear that, look; this was not a one-off. Hackers had compromised hundreds of high-profile Twitter accounts. And it was very coordinated and, to many observers, stunning. INSKEEP: Who did it? ALLYN: Twitter says they are looking into that. We don't know who did it. But we do know that Twitter employees were targeted. A major question right now is whether the Twitter employee who was targeted was somehow coordinating with the hackers. There's some confusion about that. But we just don't know. But I asked Mike Chapple if he has any ideas about who might be behind the hack. He's a former National Security Agency computer scientist. And here is his theory. MIKE CHAPPLE: There wasn't, like, a huge political or strategic motive here. So that makes me think it was probably not a foreign country or some kind of force like that that was conducting this attack. And it's just somebody out to make a few bucks. ALLYN: And the hackers did generate some income. A public record of the bitcoin transfers shows that more than $100,000 was sent to the hackers, who really could have done something a lot more dangerous by gaining this type of access. INSKEEP: Well, that's what I'm thinking about, Bobby. A lot of journalists follow Twitter. Twitter can drive what's in the news media. A certain president of the United States says things on Twitter all the time. What he says can change the stock market. So is the platform still vulnerable? ALLYN: That is the big question right now. Really unsettling to security experts is something Twitter said, which is they are looking into other malicious activities the hackers may have committed, which means this investigation is not over. Did the hackers access other high-profile accounts we don't know about? Did they access private messages? Do they have information that they're withholding but plan to release at a later date? These are all big question marks. And some of the accounts hacked had multiple layers of password protection and account protection. And that just added to the shock of how exactly did hackers get into these accounts. Data privacy lawyer Tim Toohey says if it is proven that someone inside of Twitter voluntarily handed over administrative controls to the hackers, then Twitter has a serious problem. TIM TOOHEY: It shows that there is some sort of systemic failure within the company to guard the most basic element of the security, which is to make sure that you have backstops and checks on employees going rogue. INSKEEP: Any advice for Twitter users at this point? ALLYN: Well, security experts still recommend ordinary users like you or I on Twitter to use enhanced security protections, like two-factor authentication. But I think what this hack shows is no matter what kind of steps you take to try to protect yourself online, nothing is really foolproof. INSKEEP: NPR's Bobby Allyn. Thanks. ALLYN: Thank you.

MCCAMMON: Instead, his team built a wireless camera weighing just a quarter of a gram that can stream live video to a computer more than a football field's length away. And they took a cue from the eyes of flies, moths and locusts, which have sharp vision only in a small corner of their retina. IYER: Nature has evolved these insects to have small regions of their eyes that are more sensitive. And instead, they move their heads to get a better view of the world. CHANG: Iyer's colleague Ali Najafi says it was that adaptation that inspired their design. ALI NAJAFI: You figure out how to build something that can pan around with a very small amount of energy. CHANG: They created a micro robotic arm which allows their tiny camera to scan its surroundings using very little energy, saving precious battery power for the processor and Wi-Fi communication. MCCAMMON: Next, they brought in their test pilots, the beetles. Iyer says the little backpack cameras didn't seem to faze them. IYER: They were able to climb over obstacles that were taller than them. There was even one that climbed up a tree. MCCAMMON: The details are in the journal Science Robotics. CHANG: Tiny cameras like this could give scientists a bug's-eye view of how insects navigate their world, but they could also bring the gift of vision to tiny robots. Imagine a cockroach made of electronic components. IYER: Prior to this work, robots of this size didn't have any capability to see the world. MCCAMMON: Outfitted with camera eyes, a bug-sized robot like that could avoid obstacles as it explores new terrain and snap photos and video along the way. Najafi says these tiny robots could fly through fields, looking at crops, or find broken parts in factories. NAJAFI: In manufacturing sites, you would want to have a robot that can go around the parts that are hard to reach and take pictures of them. And you can figure out where was the malfunctioning part, basically. CHANG: But one outstanding research question remains - whether people will feel any less squeamish about roving bands of robotic insects streaming live on video than they do about the real thing. SARAH MCCAMMON, HOST:   Tiny video cameras have given us a whole new view of the world. You can be strapped to a cliff diver plunging into the ocean soar, with a hang glider or barrel down a powdery ski slope, all from the comfort of your couch. AILSA CHANG, HOST:   But if all of that is a little too high-octane for you, how about a video camera strapped to the back of a beetle? VIKRAM IYER: They're pretty easy to work with, actually. You can carefully pick them up in a pair of tweezers and then apply a little drop of adhesive to its back and then carefully stick on the camera system.

You get into bed. You turn off the lights, fully prepared to go to sleep. But instead, you look at your phone to check Twitter or Facebook one more time. Then you're on that journey, reading post after post about the pandemic or the other horrors of 2020. And you scroll, and you scroll, and you scroll. Minutes become hours. There's a word for this - doomscrolling. How do you get out of this dark rabbit hole? Amelia Aldao has some ideas. She's a clinical psychologist in New York and the director of Together CBT. She joins us now. Welcome. AMELIA ALDAO: Hey. Thank you for having me. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Doomscrolling - do you do it? ALDAO: I do. I will have - sometimes I do it. And I did it this morning even as I knew that I was going to be talking to you guys about it, so fail. GARCIA-NAVARRO: (Laughter) Fail. All right. ALDAO: Fail. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Well, that makes you an expert in my view or at least someone that I can commiserate with. Is this common in your patients? Do they do it, too? ALDAO: Yeah, it's incredibly common. I mean, it's incredibly common with everyone. Our minds are set up to look for threats. We are built to look for potential dangers. And what's happening right now is that, you know, the more time we spend scrolling, the more we find those dangers, the more we get sucked into them, the more anxious we get and then the more we look for information that confirms that anxiety. And then that's how we go down the rabbit hole of doomscrolling. GARCIA-NAVARRO: And I imagine this has become more common now during the pandemic because there is - let's face it - a lot of doom to scroll. ALDAO: Exactly. Exactly. And I have - I work mostly with clients who, you know, experience anxiety. And part of what I've been doing with them now for weeks, for months is actually setting limits to how much they're scrolling. You know, and I literally tell them, like, set up a timer 'cause, you know, this - they want to know what's happening in the world. So the solution is not to never go online again, but it's finding boundaries, setting limits. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That is a good suggestion - set boundaries, have specific times when you can actually look at the news. But I want to just rewind a little bit. How can doomscrolling be damaging our minds? ALDAO: Basically, it keeps our minds trapped in a vicious cycle of negativity. When you consume content that is very negative, that makes you anxious and makes you sad, it begins to filter how you see the world. Now you look around yourself - everything makes you anxious. So you go back to look for more information and more information that, again, makes you feel more and more anxious. So it's almost a vicious cycle of the emotions that we feel, the anxiety that we feel and then the information that we process. GARCIA-NAVARRO: We should note, of course, that some people who are sort of scrolling endlessly through the news often have no choice. They may be in minority communities and are looking for reporting and information to keep themselves safe. What advice do you have for them? ALDAO: I think the best way to deal with it if you need to find information for all kinds of places is to try to be as tactical as you can - so going into it, opening up your phone, reminding yourself of why you're there. What are you looking for? What information are you trying to find? And then periodically checking in with yourself - have I found what I needed? GARCIA-NAVARRO: I don't think we have enough time to talk about my second problem, which is after doomscrolling, then trying to make myself feel better with ice cream and chocolate. However. . . (LAUGHTER)GARCIA-NAVARRO: . . . This is good advice. ALDAO: Yeah. You know, and to kind of build on that, instead of vicious cycles of anxiety and negative information, virtuous cycles of positive things in your life. So whether it's ice cream, connecting with friends - those sort of things that we should spend more time doing just to build those positive emotions in our lives. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's Dr. Amelia Aldao, a clinical psychologist in New York and the director of Together CBT. Thank you very much. ALDAO: Thank you.

(SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO GAME, \"THE LAST OF US PART II\")UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) I know you wish things were different. But they ain't. MARTIN: This PlayStation 4 game tells the story of a post-apocalyptic zombie-infested future. And as NPR's Vincent Acovino reports, the game has been designed in a way that makes it more accessible for gamers with disabilities. VINCENT ACOVINO, BYLINE: Steve Saylor has been playing video games for a long time. STEVE SAYLOR: Well, mostly, when I play video games, it was kind of like watching, say, my brother play video games. ACOVINO: Saylor has a vision impairment. That makes it hard for him to see the things that video games expect him to. SAYLOR: Being able to see text on the screen or look in the distance and try to distinguish whether I'm seeing an enemy or a tree is really difficult. ACOVINO: Like Saylor, many gamers with disabilities struggle to make it all the way through popular video game releases because very few are designed with them in mind. SAYLOR: All my life, I thought I sucked in video games, but in reality it was games that sucked for me. ACOVINO: For years, accessibility advocates have been begging for developers to consider their needs when making video games, and some are starting to listen. EMILIA SCHATZ: Our game, which requires things like aiming and shooting and running and climbing and jumping and things like that, if you're a player who is blind, can you play our game? ACOVINO: Emilia Schatz is a lead game designer at Naughty Dog, the studio who developed The Last Of Us Part II. One of the big new features is the text-to-speech option, which helps a vision-impaired player like Saylor get through the game by reading all of the game's text out loud to the player. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO GAME, \"THE LAST OF US PART II\")UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Square button. Scanned for enemies. ACOVINO: Just as crucial is the enhanced listening mode. It functions like a sort of sonar that helps locate enemies on screen. Schatz says one of the big challenges while designing these features was the range of potential players to consider. SCHATZ: Vision accessibility is actually a huge spectrum, too. Gamers who are low vision, gamers who need glasses to be able to see the TV - you know, there's a huge range there. ACOVINO: Because of that, Matthew Gallant, who is a lead systems designer at Naughty Dog, said the big thing he heard from consultants and players was the more options, the better. MATTHEW GALLANT: Players said they didn't fully trust us (laughter) to configure those options for them. But they really valued being able to go into the menus and then, really fine-grained control, adjust these features to their likings. ACOVINO: So there are many more choices. Over 60 fully customizable options for vision-impaired, motor-impaired and hearing-impaired players. Both Naughty Dog developers and Saylor acknowledged that while The Last Of Us Part II is a big step forward on the software side, the hardware matters, too. This game is a Sony exclusive, and it's not always Sony that has been leading the way with accessibility. SAYLOR: Microsoft has really pushed forward for accessibility for several years now, and I'm really excited to see what they do next. ACOVINO: The highly customizable Xbox adaptive controller is one example of this, designed for gamers with motor disabilities who struggle with a standard controller. But for Saylor, who was consulted for The Last Of Us Part II, this still feels like a huge victory. In a video that went viral just a few weeks ago, Saylor breaks down in tears when booting up the game for the first time, after seeing all of its available accessibility options. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SAYLOR: People in accessibility communities, this is what we've been advocating for, for so long (crying). ACOVINO: Behind that emotional moment were years of hopeful expectation finally realized. SAYLOR: It was just thinking about all the work that - hard work that went into this, all the hard work that the accessibility community has been putting in for years. Now everything is there, and it works. ACOVINO: Vincent Acovino, NPR News.

Her recent videos include a review of a pina colada in Beverly Hills and a glowing appreciation of America's top infectious disease doctor, Anthony Fauci. Holding a tiny microphone between her fingers, this is what she told her followers about TikTok being in Washington's crosshairs. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CHRISTINA NAJJAR: I just got new passport photos because if America bans TikTok on top of everything else, I am going home to England to live with my parents. ALLYN: She might want to start booking her flight because the White House is considering a number of ways to push TikTok out of the U. S. The most likely way is through an executive order from the president claiming TikTok is a national security threat. Stewart Baker, the former general counsel at the National Security Agency, says that's a reasonable concern. He says the White House is expected to cite the century-old Trading With The Enemy Act. That would mean. . . STEWART BAKER: No American can give them advertising money. No American may pay them for the app. No American can enter into a transaction to put them into their app store. ALLYN: In other words, you wouldn't be able to find TikTok in app stores anymore. And if you already have it, it would over time stop working. The push to squeeze TikTok out of business comes over fears that the app could be used as a Chinese spy tool. In their TikTok videos, most users shrug off that concern. Here's Jake Mullen (ph), who lives in New York. JAKE MULLEN: What are they going to do? What's the worst-case scenario? They're going to watch my videos and, like, find out that I'm hilarious and handsome? ALLYN: He has a point, says Jim Lewis, a former State Department official who now studies technology at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. JIM LEWIS: I actually was interested in this, so I watched four hours of TikTok videos. That works out to be over 700 TikTok videos. And I'll be damned if I can see the national security threat. ALLYN: All the tech policy experts I talked to agreed. If the Chinese government wants to conduct espionage, there's almost nothing useful it could glean from funny monologues and dance videos by teenagers. ADAM SEGAL: The data that's gathered from a TikTok on your phone is pretty equivalent to what you give away to all your other apps. ALLYN: Adam Segal leads the Digital and Cyberspace Policy Program at the Council on Foreign Relations. He says TikTok collects and stores messages you exchange on the app. It also saves your Internet search history, your location data and can access the contacts on your phone. None of this is a secret, but here's the rub. SEGAL: When you sign off on the user agreement - and on TikTok, it says, we may share some data with our parent company. ALLYN: That parent company is Beijing-based ByteDance. And while TikTok says it stores its data in the U. S. and has never handed over user information to China, it's the potential of that happening that puts Washington on the offensive. Bobby Allyn, NPR News, San Francisco. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:   The walls are closing in on TikTok, the favorite video-sharing app of teens and 20-somethings. First, Wells Fargo told employees to take it off their phones. Now Congress is threatening to ban federal employees from using it on government devices, and the Trump administration is considering ways to push TikTok out of the U. S. altogether. NPR's Bobby Allyn reports. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Christina Najjar (ph) in Los Angeles is one of 80 million Americans on TikTok.

Sure, it's the shiny new thing in social media. And it's super popular with Generation Z. But the clock may be running out on TikTok - see what I did there? - because the Trump administration claims it could be used for espionage. NPR's Jackie Northam explains. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"BAD AND BOUJEE\")FUTURE: If young Metro don't trust you, I'm going to shoot you. LIL UZI VERT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. JACKIE NORTHAM, BYLINE: When you scroll through the TikTok app, there's a constant stream of lively music videos featuring teenagers and 20-somethings and lots of cute, little dogs IN sunglasses performing for the camera. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)UNIDENTIFIED MUSICIAN: Let's go. NORTHAM: But there are going to be some pretty unhappy young people here in the U. S. if the Trump administration gets its way. In an interview, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned the U. S. may ban the Chinese-owned TikTok because it views it as a national security risk. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MIKE POMPEO: Whether it's TikTok or any of the other Chinese communications platforms, apps, infrastructure, this administration taking seriously the requirement to protect the American people from having their information end up in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party. MICHAEL BECKERMAN: TikTok has been just, really, an uplifting thing for families. This is a company and an app that is meant for creativity and to bring joy. NORTHAM: That's Michael Beckerman, a vice president and head of public policy at TikTok U. S. He denies the Trump administration's charges and says there's no intelligence to be gleaned from the app. TikTok, like other social media platforms, collects data on its users. But Beckerman says TikTok never has, nor will, share that data with Beijing. BECKERMAN: We have very strong access controls to data. Our servers, as I mentioned, are in Virginia. And the decisions on content and everything else are made at the U. S. level by our U. S. leadership. NORTHAM: The concern about Beijing stealing data has been building for about five years ever since a cybersecurity attack on the Office of Personnel Management, when sensitive information of more than 20 million U. S. citizens was stolen. Paul Triolo, who focuses on the intersection of politics and technology at the Eurasia Group, says there have been a number of similar incidents since. Triolo also says the concern grew when China introduced a new national security law a couple years ago. PAUL TRIOLO: And that law basically just says that companies and individuals in China have to cooperate with the Chinese government when it comes to intelligence matters. It's very vague, though. It doesn't say a social media company has to turn over all its data to the Chinese government. NORTHAM: The Trump administration's effort to ban any Chinese equipment that can be used to steal sensitive data, trade secrets or intellectual property is picking up speed. That even includes thousands of surveillance cameras set up in government buildings and military facilities. Most of them are made by Chinese companies or have Chinese components. All those cameras have to be removed by August 13. KATHERINE GRONBERG: Hitting the deadline is absolutely going to be tricky. I mean, it's just - it's like - it's less than a month away. NORTHAM: Katherine Gronberg is with Forescout Technologies, a California-based cybersecurity company. She says it'll be difficult to replace the cameras. GRONBERG: You know, the fact is is that these markets are dominated, in some cases, by Chinese products. And, in fact, we don't have alternatives that are either made by U. S. or in the U. S. or U. S. allies. NORTHAM: Eurasia Group's Triolo says the movement against TikTok and other Chinese platforms and tech companies comes at a particularly turbulent time in U. S. -China relations, exacerbated by the trade dispute and the coronavirus pandemic. TRIOLO: It's a much, much broader problem between the U. S. and China that the tech companies are being dragged into. You know, there's no trust, basically. NORTHAM: And the administration warns more Chinese-made equipment or apps are in its crosshairs.

Ahead of the hearing, NPR's Alina Selyukh takes a look at the evolution of Jeff Bezos. And we should just note here, Amazon is among NPR's financial supporters. ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE: In 2003, Jeff Bezos gave a TED talk. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JEFF BEZOS: We are at the 1908 Hurley washing machine stage with the Internet. SELYUKH: . . . Comparing the dot-com boom to the early days of the invention of electricity. The promise of the Internet was still so young, he was saying, that you just cannot be bothered by doubters or negative press. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BEZOS: 1998, \"Amazon. Toast. \" In 1999, \"Amazon. Bomb. \"SELYUKH: That was the era of Bezos as a nerdy bookseller and family man with wispy hair, a sensible Honda and an infinite assortment of khaki pants. The \"Amazon.

(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: No one in history has become as rich as quickly. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: The world's richest man. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: The world's first centi-billionaire. SELYUKH: A man worth over $100 billion, a Wall Street wunderkind who built a vast digital book catalog unburdened by sales tax and trained shoppers to expect deliveries in two days - obsessed with finding inefficiencies that can turn into profits. CHIP BAYERS: He's singularly focused in a way that very few of the business people that I've interviewed over the years could possibly be. SELYUKH: Chip Bayers wrote one of the early definitive profiles of Bezos for WIRED Magazine. A lot has changed since. The Internet's progressed from Bezos' early electricity metaphor to become the power grid of everyday life. With it, Amazon progressed to become America's online shopping habit, a company worth a trillion and a half dollars, employing 800,000 workers with enough paying subscribers to populate the ninth largest country on earth. Bezos himself also changed. BAYERS: The first noticeable thing to me in recent years was the way he physically transformed himself as he became more wealthy. SELYUKH: At age 53, Bezos broke the Internet, appearing at a gathering of moguls as Jacked Bezos. The CEO at one point said the '90s version of him used to start every day with a can of Pillsbury biscuits. Now, people were joking that he went from a dorky guy who clearly sells books to aviator sunglasses guy who sells and buys whatever he wants. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"SQUAWK ON THE STREET\")JIM CRAMER: Holy cow. This is such a game changer - Amazon to buy Whole Foods. SELYUKH: Not just that but also security cameras and delivery trucks.

And, he says, they do. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BEZOS: When we win a Golden Globe, it helps us sell more shoes. SELYUKH: That's because they both feed the reputation and popularity of Amazon, which is powerful on many levels and one of them is laws regulating competition. In the U. S. , they are laser-focused on consumer harm. And consumers always love cheap prices and convenience, making this Amazon's key defense to legal critics. Publicly, Bezos says bring on the scrutiny.

Some of the world's most powerful CEOs - we're talking Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook of Apple and Sundar Pichai of Google - all of them will be testifying before Congress tomorrow. These companies are already under investigation by regulators in the U. S. and Europe. They are punching bags for politicians on the left and the right. NPR's Shannon Bond looks at how Big Tech has become a big target. And we should say here that Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook are all financial supporters of NPR. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: It's rare for titans of industry to line up together for a grilling under oath before Congress. In 1994, it was Big Tobacco. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RON WYDEN: Let me ask you first - and I'd like to just go down the row - whether each of you believes that nicotine is not addictive. BOND: During the financial crisis, it was the big three automakers. The CEOs of Ford, Chrysler and General Motors arrived by private jet. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BRAD SHERMAN: I'm going to ask the three executives here to raise their hand if they flew here commercial. Let the record show no hands went up. BOND: But tech companies, they haven't faced this kind of tough questioning since the U. S. government sued Microsoft for using its power to squash competition. That was back in the '90s. So what's with the spotlight on Big Tech now? Historian Margaret O'Mara says for years, it seemed like Silicon Valley could do no wrong. MARGARET O'MARA: I think one of the reason that the critics fell so out of love with tech was because they were so deeply in love with it before. BOND: These firms were warmly welcomed in Washington as paragons of American innovation. That allowed them to grow quickly and become indispensable. Nicol Turner Lee directs the Brookings Institution's Center for Technology Innovation. NICOL TURNER LEE: Tech companies are now finding themselves sort of as the connector, changing the way that people across the world live, learn, earn, even love, right? BOND: The pandemic has made it even more obvious how deeply technology is embedded in our lives. People are ordering more stuff from Amazon, using Google's video chat, streaming shows and movies on Apple TV. CEO Mark Zuckerberg says more than 3 billion people now use one of Facebook's apps every month. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARK ZUCKERBERG: We know that people especially rely on social apps in times of crisis and in times when we can't be together in person. BOND: But that same technology intrudes on every part of our lives from our relationships to our elections. Critics worry these big companies are abusing their power. Here's how Kirsten Daru, an executive at a tech startup called Tile, explained it in another congressional hearing back in January. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KIRSTEN DARU: You might be the best team in the league, but you're playing against a team that owns the field, the ball, the stadium and the entire league. And they can change the rules of the game in their own favor at any time. BOND: That's the crux of the complaints. The tech giants use their size to bully rivals, whether it's the terms of Apple's app store, who shows up in Google search, how Amazon treats merchants who sell on its site or Facebook's habit of buying smaller competitors like Instagram and WhatsApp. The companies say they play fairly. Rhode Island Democrat David Cicilline disagrees. He's leading this congressional investigation of tech. Here's what he told this program last summer. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DAVID CICILLINE: The Internet is broken. We are living in a monopoly moment. Our constituents expect us to fix this and to get this marketplace working right. BOND: On Wednesday Cicilline will take those complaints to the most powerful men in tech. Now, like everything in the time of the pandemic, this hearing is going to be kind of weird. The CEOs are appearing remotely by video. Historian O'Mara says that's a big change from the usual spectacle of executives, lawmakers and press in a wood-paneled hearing room. O'MARA: They're not having to walk in in their suit and tie and, like, raise their hands. And there's not going to be that picture. BOND: Instead, it will be the year's most high-powered videoconference. Shannon Bond, NPR News. AILSA CHANG, HOST:   It's being called Techpalooza (ph). Some of the world's most powerful CEOs - we're talking Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook of Apple and Sundar Pichai of Google - all of them will be testifying before Congress tomorrow. These companies are already under investigation by regulators in the U. S. and Europe. They are punching bags for politicians on the left and the right. NPR's Shannon Bond looks at how Big Tech has become a big target. And we should say here that Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook are all financial supporters of NPR. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: It's rare for titans of industry to line up together for a grilling under oath before Congress. In 1994, it was Big Tobacco. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RON WYDEN: Let me ask you first - and I'd like to just go down the row - whether each of you believes that nicotine is not addictive. BOND: During the financial crisis, it was the big three automakers. The CEOs of Ford, Chrysler and General Motors arrived by private jet. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BRAD SHERMAN: I'm going to ask the three executives here to raise their hand if they flew here commercial. Let the record show no hands went up. BOND: But tech companies, they haven't faced this kind of tough questioning since the U. S. government sued Microsoft for using its power to squash competition. That was back in the '90s. So what's with the spotlight on Big Tech now? Historian Margaret O'Mara says for years, it seemed like Silicon Valley could do no wrong. MARGARET O'MARA: I think one of the reason that the critics fell so out of love with tech was because they were so deeply in love with it before. BOND: These firms were warmly welcomed in Washington as paragons of American innovation. That allowed them to grow quickly and become indispensable. Nicol Turner Lee directs the Brookings Institution's Center for Technology Innovation.

Dipayan Ghosh worked as a policy executive at Facebook. He's now at Harvard, and I asked him why an average consumer, someone who's happy scrolling through Facebook or buying stuff on Amazon, why should that consumer be concerned about the amount of power these companies have? DIPAYAN GHOSH: It's really a broader issue than just our individual sense. Sometimes it makes more sense for a Congress member to be thinking about public interests, about social interests, about Democratic interests, which we individually don't necessarily think about. So even if we enjoy Facebook, even if we use Google Search, we enjoy Amazon Fresh to get our groceries during the pandemic, what we might not recognize at an individual level is that what's really happening is that we're giving a huge aggregation of power concentrated within a select few companies. They're drawing wealth away from the rest of society and collecting it within their own coffers. CHANG: Well, how big is too big? How much power is too much power? Like, how do you even measure that? GHOSH: In the context of our national GDP, how much of a market is social media? How much of a market is Internet search and online retail? If those markets are big enough, then what that suggests is that there is a lot of economic activity flowing through them, which means that they're important for us to look at and provide some regulatory scrutiny over. CHANG: But I guess I'm asking where the line is. Like, when is that regulatory scrutiny merited, and when is it just a company who's - that's really successful and can be left alone being really successful? GHOSH: Well, I don't think that it's wrong to have a monopoly, and some of the members in the committee have highlighted that. What is wrong is if you got that monopoly through harmful means or if you maintain that monopoly using harmful means or if you exploit your monopoly position by pushing consumer harms in market innovation and price and quality of service on American users. And I think the committee's point is that in each of these four cases of these four companies that circumstance has come to be. CHANG: Well, you were on the inside. Was there an explicit strategy at Facebook to monopolize the social media market? GHOSH: I wouldn't phrase it as Facebook was trying to monopolize, but just like any of these four companies, Facebook was certainly trying to grow aggressively and really dominate social media around the world. Now, did it engage in harmful means? I think that if it takes a deep look into how the company thinks about acquisitions and how it tries to grow its user base around the world, it could very well discover some very meaningful information. CHANG: Well, would you call Facebook a monopoly at this point? GHOSH: Absolutely. I think Facebook is not only a monopoly, but that Facebook is a natural monopoly. This is a company that has imposed tremendous barriers to entry to the rest of the digital ecosystem. And when you have a natural monopoly, you don't necessarily think about break up first, but rather what we need to think about in the context of Facebook is utility regulation. CHANG: So what are some policy fixes that you think Congress should be considering right now? GHOSH: The business model of these companies involves collecting data on an uninhibited basis, using it to develop algorithms that are tremendously opaque to the public and growing their platforms with a level of aggressiveness that diminishes any potential threat from would-be rivals. And so I think we need a three-way regulatory solution with privacy for that uninhibited collection of data and transparency over those algorithms and better market competition, better antitrust regulation and enforcement to combat the growing monopoly power of these companies.

So executives from Amazon, Apple, Facebook, also Google are going to be facing lawmakers today. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Yeah. The four tech leaders appear before Congress together - OK, not exactly together because they're going to appear remotely because of the pandemic, which just underlines the overwhelming role that the Internet plays in daily life. These firms that dominate their industry face a big question - have they misused their power to hurt competitors and help themselves? GREENE: OK. An important full disclosure here - we do want to note that all four companies are among NPR's financial supporters. Now we can turn to NPR's Alina Selyukh, who is covering this hearing. Hi, Alina. ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE: Good morning. GREENE: All right. So these companies have been growing a lot over the last two decades. No one is surprised by it. So why is Congress deciding to hold this hearing now? SELYUKH: Right. Lawmakers are finally considering whether they need to take a more active role in policing these powerful platforms. As you point out, these companies have long been held in high regard as models of American scrappy ingenuity. But they stopped being scrappy startups a long time ago. And put together, they're now worth almost $5 trillion. For their entire existence, they faced very little regulation. But in recent years, critics have piled on accusations of anti-competitive behavior. The Justice Department and state attorneys general started investigations and so has the committee that's holding this hearing today. They've been investigating for over a year, and today is the last stop on that journey. GREENE: OK. Well, if this is the last stop, what are we expecting to hear from lawmakers? What are they going to focus on? SELYUKH: Largely competition is the goal to focus on in this hearing. The four companies are very different, of course, with lots of nuance. But, generally, critics have been saying how competing with at least three of them - Amazon, Apple and Google - is like playing against a team that also owns the stadium, hires the referees and writes the rules of the game. GREENE: They basically do everything. But the companies are different, right? I mean, can you give us a sense of some of the key questions, like, for each of them? SELYUKH: Sure. It's a bit of a dense list, but let me try to hit some of the bigger themes. For Amazon's Jeff Bezos, the world's richest person, this is actually his first appearance before Congress. But if the committee sticks to the topic, I'm expecting lots of questions about whether Amazon exploits data it collects from other sellers on the platform for its own benefit, back to this idea of Amazon both running the marketplace and selling on it. For Apple's Tim Cook, questions are likely to focus on the app store and whether Apple gives itself an unfair advantage in how it charges developers for every transaction there. For Google's Sundar Pichai, the big themes are Google's dominant search and digital advertising where the company controls almost a third of the market. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg has been to the Hill a lot lately, so he'll probably get more questions about disinformation and political speech but also how the company buys or copies its competitors. All the companies are expected to push back, that they face a lot of competition and generally represent a big success story of American innovation. INSKEEP: All right. Well, let's go with your metaphor that this year-long investigation was like a train trip and this was the last stop on the journey. Where does the train go next? What happens now after this? SELYUKH: The final stop of this train, I suppose, is when the committee finishes and publishes its findings. I spoke with Gene Kimmelman, former Department of Justice antitrust official, now at consumer group Public Knowledge, and he sums up the question at the heart of this like this. GENE KIMMELMAN: Beyond a simple antitrust case, what does the law need to look like to ensure that we have open and vibrant competition in a digital marketplace? SELYUKH: So maybe it's a journey to reconsider existing laws, maybe write new ones. That, of course, the companies would fight tooth and nail. GREENE: All right. NPR's Alina Selyukh, it's been nice being on this journey with you. Thanks, Alina. SELYUKH: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GREENE: All right. We have to say, it got pretty tense on Capitol Hill already yesterday. INSKEEP: Attorney General William Barr came to testify. Democrats had questions. Barr defended federal agents' use of force against peaceful protesters in Portland, Ore. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)WILLIAM BARR: What unfolds nightly around the courthouse cannot reasonably be called protest. It is, by any objective measure, an assault on the government of the United States. INSKEEP: Democrats also accused Barr of politicizing the Justice Department to support friends of President Trump. GREENE: OK. We have NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson with us. Hi, Carrie. CARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE: Hi, David. GREENE: Well, let's start with these protests. What did lawmakers have to say about them to the attorney general? JOHNSON: David, remember, these protests began after police killed George Floyd in Minneapolis and Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Ky. Democrats on the committee said the vast majority of these protesters are peaceful, even in Portland. They called it a place where moms and veterans have gathered. But the attorney general focused on attacks on the federal court building in Portland with fireworks and protesters barricading the door and setting fires. He says these aren't protesters; they're attackers. He says deputy U. S. marshals have been injured, they're tired and that he would be happy if state and local officials picked up the slack and did more to protect the courthouse so the feds could do less. Democrats showed the attorney general videos of a Navy veteran who went up to some of the law enforcement on the street and who got beaten and tear gassed. And Bill Barr said most people near the court were violent, and the tear gas might have been in the air already. GREENE: All right. So in addition to questions about those protests, it sounds like Democrats were very blunt and basically saying that the attorney general has been rewarding the president's friends, punishing enemies. This is the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Jerrold Nadler. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JERROLD NADLER: In your time at the department, you have aided and abetted the worst failings of the president. GREENE: All right. So how did Barr respond to that? JOHNSON: Well, Barr said the president has never asked him, directed him or pressured him to do anything in a criminal case. The attorney general says he acts independent of the White House and what he calls the mob of public opinion. A couple of lawmakers asked him if he could come up with an example of a time when he weighed in on a punishment for a defendant who was not a friend of the president, referring to the Roger Stone case here, of course. The attorney general responded this way. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BARR: What enemies have I indicted? Who - could you point to one indictment that has been under the department that you feel is unmerited, that you feel violates the rule of law? One indictment. JOHNSON: So, David, it got really hot in here, to borrow a phrase. The hearing went on that way for hours with the lawmakers interrupting Barr a lot and, by the end, Barr interrupting some of the Democratic members of Congress, too. GREENE: Well, I mean, just a lot to talk about, including the presidential election, right, Carrie? I mean, we're about three months away. How did that come up in a hearing, you know, about the Justice Department? JOHNSON: The election came up in two different ways. One, President Trump and Attorney General Barr have both raised questions about the security of mail-in ballots. Barr did that again. But most voting experts do not think that that will be a widespread problem. Second, Barr has ordered an investigation of the intelligence community and the FBI in 2016. He refused yesterday to say he would not release those findings before the election. So that's still possible out there. GREENE: OK. NPR's Carrie Johnson. Carrie, thanks so much. JOHNSON: My pleasure. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GREENE: All right. As we said, the election is coming under a hundred days from now. And, Steve, you've actually been out doing what matters most in any election - that's listening to voters. INSKEEP: Yeah. I grabbed a bunch of masks, got in the car and drove to a swing state that's closely contested - Ohio. Ashtabula County is in Northeast Ohio. The main city is also called Ashtabula and it's one of those classic Rust Belt industrial towns that you know so well, David, which voted for generations for Democrats, including President Obama. But then the county flipped to President Trump. GREENE: Oh, interesting place to go then. So what do you feel like you discovered there? INSKEEP: Well, on the surface, the kind of polarized political debate we've heard everywhere. Not many people are changing their opinions of the president at this point, but we also found a number of younger people in Ashtabula County who are trying to influence this fall's election. GREENE: So how do they want to do that? INSKEEP: Well, maybe you can't change voters' minds, but you can add voters, which is what Eli Kalil hopes to do. He is the Democratic county chairman, and he is 23. ELI KALIL: I think there's that maybe 1% and probably even smaller than that that voted for Trump who won't vote for him this upcoming election. So, yeah, we need to find another - a different demographic of voters who, you know, maybe they're not always enthused. Maybe they don't get to the polls all the time. You know, we need to figure out how we get them to the polls because we think that's where our base is going to be. INSKEEP: Trying to expand the number of younger, more diverse voters who show up and Kalil is hoping that they will include the likes of Wisdom Davis, his former high school classmate who's also 23 years old. She organized a protest this summer against police violence, and there was a voter registration table there. WISDOM DAVIS: Because a lot of people just want change so much, but then they're like they just want it but they don't want to - they don't know how to take the steps. INSKEEP: Wisdom Davis knows that voting is important. She voted last time, but she voted third party then. And I should note she is not committed to the Democrat Joe Biden yet this time. GREENE: Well, I mean, that makes me want to ask you about 2016. I mean, you said this is a county that voted for generations for Democrats. How did Democrats feel like they lost the county in 2016? INSKEEP: Well, they were a big union party, of course, and as unions, industrial unions, declined, the Democrats declined. Some local Democrats think the party got a little lazy, lost touch with voters. Trump captured voters' imagination, worked for voters, showed up in Ashtabula County and did very well in Ohio, which is older and whiter than the electorate as a whole. He seems to have that demographic advantage there, which means Ohio hasn't been talked about as much as other states. But polling shows it's really competitive right now. GREENE: Well, and what is the Republican plan? How are they pushing back here? INSKEEP: Well, it's not just Democrats that are hoping for younger voters to turn out because Republicans have a kind of youth movement going in public offices in the county. David Thomas is one of them. He's the county auditor at the age of 27, and he says he won his election as President Trump did, with an overwhelming vote in the county's rural areas. DAVID THOMAS: Prior to 2016, essentially the votes were in the cities where our population centers were. You had to win them in order to win the county. Myself as an example, I lost all three of our cities but won outside of the cities in some of the suburban areas but mainly in some of our rural areas, too, that have grown not only in population but also just in voter participation. INSKEEP: Thomas sees enthusiasm for the president still, although some voters are disappointed and, of course, the president invokes race in a way that's divisive. The bottom line is you got two men in their 70s running for president, and there are people in their 20s who could have something to do with who wins. GREENE: Steve, thanks for bringing us these voices. INSKEEP: Glad do it. Glad to talk with you, as always, David. DAVID GREENE, HOST:   All right. So executives from Amazon, Apple, Facebook, also Google are going to be facing lawmakers today. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:   Yeah. The four tech leaders appear before Congress together - OK, not exactly together because they're going to appear remotely because of the pandemic, which just underlines the overwhelming role that the Internet plays in daily life. These firms that dominate their industry face a big question - have they misused their power to hurt competitors and help themselves? GREENE: OK. An important full disclosure here - we do want to note that all four companies are among NPR's financial supporters. Now we can turn to NPR's Alina Selyukh, who is covering this hearing. Hi, Alina. ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE: Good morning. GREENE: All right. So these companies have been growing a lot over the last two decades. No one is surprised by it. So why is Congress deciding to hold this hearing now? SELYUKH: Right. Lawmakers are finally considering whether they need to take a more active role in policing these powerful platforms. As you point out, these companies have long been held in high regard as models of American scrappy ingenuity. But they stopped being scrappy startups a long time ago. And put together, they're now worth almost $5 trillion. For their entire existence, they faced very little regulation. But in recent years, critics have piled on accusations of anti-competitive behavior. The Justice Department and state attorneys general started investigations and so has the committee that's holding this hearing today. They've been investigating for over a year, and today is the last stop on that journey. GREENE: OK. Well, if this is the last stop, what are we expecting to hear from lawmakers? What are they going to focus on? SELYUKH: Largely competition is the goal to focus on in this hearing. The four companies are very different, of course, with lots of nuance. But, generally, critics have been saying how competing with at least three of them - Amazon, Apple and Google - is like playing against a team that also owns the stadium, hires the referees and writes the rules of the game. GREENE: They basically do everything. But the companies are different, right? I mean, can you give us a sense of some of the key questions, like, for each of them? SELYUKH: Sure. It's a bit of a dense list, but let me try to hit some of the bigger themes. For Amazon's Jeff Bezos, the world's richest person, this is actually his first appearance before Congress. But if the committee sticks to the topic, I'm expecting lots of questions about whether Amazon exploits data it collects from other sellers on the platform for its own benefit, back to this idea of Amazon both running the marketplace and selling on it. For Apple's Tim Cook, questions are likely to focus on the app store and whether Apple gives itself an unfair advantage in how it charges developers for every transaction there. For Google's Sundar Pichai, the big themes are Google's dominant search and digital advertising where the company controls almost a third of the market. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg has been to the Hill a lot lately, so he'll probably get more questions about disinformation and political speech but also how the company buys or copies its competitors. All the companies are expected to push back, that they face a lot of competition and generally represent a big success story of American innovation. INSKEEP: All right. Well, let's go with your metaphor that this year-long investigation was like a train trip and this was the last stop on the journey. Where does the train go next? What happens now after this? SELYUKH: The final stop of this train, I suppose, is when the committee finishes and publishes its findings. I spoke with Gene Kimmelman, former Department of Justice antitrust official, now at consumer group Public Knowledge, and he sums up the question at the heart of this like this. GENE KIMMELMAN: Beyond a simple antitrust case, what does the law need to look like to ensure that we have open and vibrant competition in a digital marketplace? SELYUKH: So maybe it's a journey to reconsider existing laws, maybe write new ones. That, of course, the companies would fight tooth and nail. GREENE: All right. NPR's Alina Selyukh, it's been nice being on this journey with you. Thanks, Alina. SELYUKH: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: All right. We have to say, it got pretty tense on Capitol Hill already yesterday. INSKEEP: Attorney General William Barr came to testify. Democrats had questions. Barr defended federal agents' use of force against peaceful protesters in Portland, Ore. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WILLIAM BARR: What unfolds nightly around the courthouse cannot reasonably be called protest. It is, by any objective measure, an assault on the government of the United States. INSKEEP: Democrats also accused Barr of politicizing the Justice Department to support friends of President Trump. GREENE: OK. We have NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson with us. Hi, Carrie. CARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE: Hi, David. GREENE: Well, let's start with these protests. What did lawmakers have to say about them to the attorney general? JOHNSON: David, remember, these protests began after police killed George Floyd in Minneapolis and Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Ky. Democrats on the committee said the vast majority of these protesters are peaceful, even in Portland. They called it a place where moms and veterans have gathered. But the attorney general focused on attacks on the federal court building in Portland with fireworks and protesters barricading the door and setting fires. He says these aren't protesters; they're attackers. He says deputy U. S. marshals have been injured, they're tired and that he would be happy if state and local officials picked up the slack and did more to protect the courthouse so the feds could do less. Democrats showed the attorney general videos of a Navy veteran who went up to some of the law enforcement on the street and who got beaten and tear gassed. And Bill Barr said most people near the court were violent, and the tear gas might have been in the air already. GREENE: All right. So in addition to questions about those protests, it sounds like Democrats were very blunt and basically saying that the attorney general has been rewarding the president's friends, punishing enemies. This is the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Jerrold Nadler. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JERROLD NADLER: In your time at the department, you have aided and abetted the worst failings of the president. GREENE: All right. So how did Barr respond to that? JOHNSON: Well, Barr said the president has never asked him, directed him or pressured him to do anything in a criminal case. The attorney general says he acts independent of the White House and what he calls the mob of public opinion. A couple of lawmakers asked him if he could come up with an example of a time when he weighed in on a punishment for a defendant who was not a friend of the president, referring to the Roger Stone case here, of course. The attorney general responded this way. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BARR: What enemies have I indicted? Who - could you point to one indictment that has been under the department that you feel is unmerited, that you feel violates the rule of law? One indictment. JOHNSON: So, David, it got really hot in here, to borrow a phrase. The hearing went on that way for hours with the lawmakers interrupting Barr a lot and, by the end, Barr interrupting some of the Democratic members of Congress, too. GREENE: Well, I mean, just a lot to talk about, including the presidential election, right, Carrie? I mean, we're about three months away. How did that come up in a hearing, you know, about the Justice Department? JOHNSON: The election came up in two different ways. One, President Trump and Attorney General Barr have both raised questions about the security of mail-in ballots. Barr did that again. But most voting experts do not think that that will be a widespread problem. Second, Barr has ordered an investigation of the intelligence community and the FBI in 2016. He refused yesterday to say he would not release those findings before the election. So that's still possible out there. GREENE: OK. NPR's Carrie Johnson. Carrie, thanks so much. JOHNSON: My pleasure. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: All right. As we said, the election is coming under a hundred days from now. And, Steve, you've actually been out doing what matters most in any election - that's listening to voters. INSKEEP: Yeah. I grabbed a bunch of masks, got in the car and drove to a swing state that's closely contested - Ohio. Ashtabula County is in Northeast Ohio. The main city is also called Ashtabula and it's one of those classic Rust Belt industrial towns that you know so well, David, which voted for generations for Democrats, including President Obama. But then the county flipped to President Trump. GREENE: Oh, interesting place to go then. So what do you feel like you discovered there? INSKEEP: Well, on the surface, the kind of polarized political debate we've heard everywhere. Not many people are changing their opinions of the president at this point, but we also found a number of younger people in Ashtabula County who are trying to influence this fall's election. GREENE: So how do they want to do that? INSKEEP: Well, maybe you can't change voters' minds, but you can add voters, which is what Eli Kalil hopes to do. He is the Democratic county chairman, and he is 23. ELI KALIL: I think there's that maybe 1% and probably even smaller than that that voted for Trump who won't vote for him this upcoming election. So, yeah, we need to find another - a different demographic of voters who, you know, maybe they're not always enthused. Maybe they don't get to the polls all the time. You know, we need to figure out how we get them to the polls because we think that's where our base is going to be. INSKEEP: Trying to expand the number of younger, more diverse voters who show up and Kalil is hoping that they will include the likes of Wisdom Davis, his former high school classmate who's also 23 years old. She organized a protest this summer against police violence, and there was a voter registration table there. WISDOM DAVIS: Because a lot of people just want change so much, but then they're like they just want it but they don't want to - they don't know how to take the steps. INSKEEP: Wisdom Davis knows that voting is important. She voted last time, but she voted third party then. And I should note she is not committed to the Democrat Joe Biden yet this time. GREENE: Well, I mean, that makes me want to ask you about 2016. I mean, you said this is a county that voted for generations for Democrats. How did Democrats feel like they lost the county in 2016? INSKEEP: Well, they were a big union party, of course, and as unions, industrial unions, declined, the Democrats declined.

Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Apple's Tim Cook, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Google's Sundar Pichai spent almost six hours fielding questions from Congress over video conference yesterday. Here's how House antitrust chief Rhode Island Democrat David Cicilline set the stage for the hearing yesterday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DAVID CICILLINE: Our founders would not bow before a king, nor should we bow before the emperors of the online economy. GREENE: OK. Before we go on, we should note that all of these companies are among financial supporters of NPR. Let's bring in NPR's Alina Selyukh, who covered this. Hi, Alina. ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE: Good morning. GREENE: So what did we learn yesterday? SELYUKH: So the House lawmakers, who called this hearing, have been investigating these companies for over a year now. And yesterday, we got a first taste of what it is that they've learned from all the interviews, documents and emails that they've collected. It was a fairly adversarial situation with the CEOs. In a way, this was a tale of two hearings. One was the key focus - how the tech giants may have grown at the expense of others. For example, lawmakers grilled Facebook about how the company buys or replicates rivals that threaten to lure away its users like Instagram. Washington Democrat Pramila Jayapal read off emails between Zuckerberg and other executives. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRAMILA JAYAPAL: Do you copy your competitors? MARK ZUCKERBERG: Congresswoman, we've certainly adapted features that others have led in as have others copied and adapted features that we've. . . JAYAPAL: I'm not concerned about others. I'm just asking you, Mr. Zuckerberg. SELYUKH: Similarly, Google has been accused by Yelp and others of stealing restaurant reviews and other content. Some small sellers on Amazon have complained about feeling trapped and dealing with constantly changing rules. App developers have accused Apple of unfairly charging them different fees. All four CEOs face different versions of the same question about how they throw their weight around to bully competitors out of the way. GREENE: All right, so a lot there. But there was more, right? You said this was a tale of two hearings. SELYUKH: Yes. You know, as I said, the point of this hearing was how tech companies deal with competition. But a big chunk of the hearing had nothing to do with that. Several of Republicans, particularly the firebrand Jim Jordan from Ohio, probed the CEOs for anti-conservative bias. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JIM JORDAN: Mr. Cook, is the cancel culture mob dangerous? SELYUKH: Jordan demanded neutrality from Google in the upcoming election. He asked if all the CEOs supported diversity of opinions, which actually prompted a bit of an interesting moment. Bezos took a dig at discourse on social media, calling social networks nuance destruction machines. I wish we could see Mark Zuckerberg's face at that moment. He was right there, but the video conference did not show him. GREENE: Yeah. It's a different scene when we're in video conference, and I'm watching them all sitting there. . . SELYUKH: Right. GREENE: . . . Behind that desk. So what was your impression of these CEOs? Like, how did they handle themselves yesterday? SELYUKH: You know, they rejected the entire premise of the hearing that they're big bullies. They played up their humble beginnings, how much people value their product, how they still face competition. Bezos was billed as the big get for the hearing, the first appearance by the world's richest person before Congress. He had technical difficulties and got no questions for over an hour, even was caught on video sneaking some snacks. But then came a series of questions about how Amazon treats sellers on its platform, starting with Jayapal asking, does Amazon use data it collects from other sellers to make its own products?

But I can't guarantee you that that policy has never been violated. SELYUKH: An unexpected concession from Bezos. Overall, companies essentially argued bad episodes were outliers. Their entire goal is to make users happy. And now we wait to see what the committee thinks when they release their final findings of the investigation. GREENE: NPR's Alina Selyukh. Thanks, Alina. SELYUKH: Thank you. DAVID GREENE, HOST:   They were called the cyber barons and modern monopolists. Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Apple's Tim Cook, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Google's Sundar Pichai spent almost six hours fielding questions from Congress over video conference yesterday. Here's how House antitrust chief Rhode Island Democrat David Cicilline set the stage for the hearing yesterday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DAVID CICILLINE: Our founders would not bow before a king, nor should we bow before the emperors of the online economy. GREENE: OK. Before we go on, we should note that all of these companies are among financial supporters of NPR. Let's bring in NPR's Alina Selyukh, who covered this. Hi, Alina. ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE: Good morning. GREENE: So what did we learn yesterday? SELYUKH: So the House lawmakers, who called this hearing, have been investigating these companies for over a year now. And yesterday, we got a first taste of what it is that they've learned from all the interviews, documents and emails that they've collected. It was a fairly adversarial situation with the CEOs. In a way, this was a tale of two hearings. One was the key focus - how the tech giants may have grown at the expense of others. For example, lawmakers grilled Facebook about how the company buys or replicates rivals that threaten to lure away its users like Instagram. Washington Democrat Pramila Jayapal read off emails between Zuckerberg and other executives. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRAMILA JAYAPAL: Do you copy your competitors? MARK ZUCKERBERG: Congresswoman, we've certainly adapted features that others have led in as have others copied and adapted features that we've. . . JAYAPAL: I'm not concerned about others. I'm just asking you, Mr. Zuckerberg. SELYUKH: Similarly, Google has been accused by Yelp and others of stealing restaurant reviews and other content. Some small sellers on Amazon have complained about feeling trapped and dealing with constantly changing rules. App developers have accused Apple of unfairly charging them different fees. All four CEOs face different versions of the same question about how they throw their weight around to bully competitors out of the way. GREENE: All right, so a lot there. But there was more, right? You said this was a tale of two hearings. SELYUKH: Yes. You know, as I said, the point of this hearing was how tech companies deal with competition. But a big chunk of the hearing had nothing to do with that. Several of Republicans, particularly the firebrand Jim Jordan from Ohio, probed the CEOs for anti-conservative bias. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JIM JORDAN: Mr. Cook, is the cancel culture mob dangerous? SELYUKH: Jordan demanded neutrality from Google in the upcoming election. He asked if all the CEOs supported diversity of opinions, which actually prompted a bit of an interesting moment. Bezos took a dig at discourse on social media, calling social networks nuance destruction machines. I wish we could see Mark Zuckerberg's face at that moment. He was right there, but the video conference did not show him. GREENE: Yeah. It's a different scene when we're in video conference, and I'm watching them all sitting there. . . SELYUKH: Right. GREENE: . . . Behind that desk. So what was your impression of these CEOs? Like, how did they handle themselves yesterday? SELYUKH: You know, they rejected the entire premise of the hearing that they're big bullies. They played up their humble beginnings, how much people value their product, how they still face competition. Bezos was billed as the big get for the hearing, the first appearance by the world's richest person before Congress. He had technical difficulties and got no questions for over an hour, even was caught on video sneaking some snacks. But then came a series of questions about how Amazon treats sellers on its platform, starting with Jayapal asking, does Amazon use data it collects from other sellers to make its own products? And Bezos replied. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JEFF BEZOS: What I can tell you is we have a policy against using seller-specific data to aid our private-label business. But I can't guarantee you that that policy has never been violated. SELYUKH: An unexpected concession from Bezos. Overall, companies essentially argued bad episodes were outliers. Their entire goal is to make users happy. And now we wait to see what the committee thinks when they release their final findings of the investigation. GREENE: NPR's Alina Selyukh. Thanks, Alina.

The suit comes at an especially bad time for the app. It is owned by a Chinese company. President Trump considers that a national security threat, and he's ordered that TikTok be sold by the middle of next month. This lawsuit could complicate any sale. NPR's Bobby Allyn joins us with details. Hi, Bobby. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Hey, Ari. SHAPIRO: Tell us more about who is suing TikTok and what they are alleging. ALLYN: So there are 70 families suing TikTok, and they're claiming that from the moment the app is downloaded on your phone, it starts vacuuming reams of personal information like your location, your browser history, your contacts and when you start taking videos. The suit says TikTok is downloading and saving a profile of your face, and it even makes a guess about your age and your background. You know, lawyers for the users say this is kind of alarming for anyone but especially when it's happening to children. And I will say here, Ari, you know, many smartphone apps use - that you use every day are harvesting tons of data. But lawyers say TikTok is different because of what is allegedly doing with all that data. SHAPIRO: Right. The fear in Washington is that TikTok is sending U. S. data to Chinese authorities. TikTok has always denied this. Does the lawsuit add anything new to this debate? ALLYN: Yeah. The lawsuit makes a pretty startling claim, which is lawyers hired outside experts to, like, forensically examine the TikTok app. And they say they traced data from American citizens being directly sent to Chinese servers, which the attorneys say are under the control of third parties that directly cooperate with the Chinese government. There has not been any clear evidence of this happening before this lawsuit, and the lawyers say now we have evidence. SHAPIRO: And that also contradicts what TikTok has said it does with the data. So what do officials at TikTok now say in response to this suit? ALLYN: Right. So in response to the suit, TikTok's lawyers have filed papers saying, look. Data moves in complicated ways. It's not weird for data to jump from one country to the next, especially when it's on servers. And the lawsuit's analysis is wrong. TikTok says most of its data on Americans is stored in the Washington, D. C. , area in Virginia, and they have backup in Singapore. Besides having what they call a sloppy analysis, TikTok's lawyers say the lawsuit is engaging in, quote, \"anti-Chinese rhetoric\" and is elevating speculation as real evidence. SHAPIRO: And meanwhile, Microsoft has said that it's in talks to acquire TikTok. How is this lawsuit likely to factor into those discussions? ALLYN: Yeah. Well, plaintiffs' lawyers hope this becomes a nationwide class action, and if it does, it could linger for many years to come. So we don't know yet what this liability is going to look like. There's a lot of negotiations that need to be hammered out still. But Microsoft, of course, is a $1. 5 trillion company. It has deep, deep pockets. But a legal bill this serious still has the potential of muddying the waters as Microsoft and TikTok continue potential merger talks. SHAPIRO: I mean, could it potentially undermine that merger and prevent it from happening? ALLYN: I don't think so. The experts that I've talked to and the folks who are close to that deal say it's not going to stop the deal in its tracks. But, you know, as Microsoft is, you know, kicking the tires and looking under the hood of TikTok, this is a bill that is going to be looked at very, very carefully. And it might change the final deal, but I don't think Microsoft is going to see this and say, it's such a liability; it's such a problem that we're going to walk away. That's probably not going to happen. SHAPIRO: NPR's Bobby Allyn, thank you. ALLYN: Thank you, Ari.

President Trump says he's giving the company that owns the video-sharing app a month to sell it. Or if not, he wants TikTok banned in the U. S. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DONALD TRUMP: I set a date of around September 15. At which point, it's going to be out of business in the United States. MARTIN: Over the weekend, the president spoke with the CEO of one potential buyer - Microsoft. To explain what's going on with the future of TikTok, we've got NPR tech reporter Bobby Allyn with us this morning. Hi, Bobby. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Hey there. MARTIN: Just take a step back. Explain why President Trump is so interested in TikTok right now. ALLYN: So Trump doesn't talk about TikTok without talking about China, and there is a reason for that. TikTok's parent company ByteDance is based in Beijing. And Trump says that means TikTok could be harvesting the private data of millions of American citizens and sharing it with the Chinese Communist Party. Now, whether that's really happening is up for debate. There's no conclusive evidence that it is. But Trump views it as a black-and-white issue. TikTok either stays Chinese-owned and will be banned, or the app is bought by an American company - like Microsoft, like you mentioned - and it can stick around. MARTIN: So we mentioned this in the intro, that Microsoft's CEO actually sat down with President Trump over the weekend. I mean, is - the CEO of Microsoft feels it's necessary to actually vet this potential purchase with the president? ALLYN: Yeah, because the walls have been closing in on TikTok for some time. The president has been threatening economic sanctions against TikTok. Other members of the Trump administration have been talking about other ways to basically ban TikTok from the United States completely. And Microsoft spied opportunity here. Microsoft said, well, let's see if we can acquire the American assets of TikTok. And if they do that, they need to get the blessing of the Trump administration. So I think Microsoft's CEO just wants to be 100% sure that Trump is not going to try to intervene and challenge the acquisition because that's the last thing you want when you make a huge merger like Microsoft is looking to do with TikTok. MARTIN: So from the - from a business point of view, Bobby, would a TikTok acquisition - I mean, is that a good buy for Microsoft? ALLYN: Yeah, it would be huge. I mean, Microsoft already is a $1. 5 trillion company, right? I mean, they absolutely are a global-tech powerhouse but not really has - you know, Microsoft isn't really known for being on the leading edge of social media platform for young people. I mean, many people still, when they think of Microsoft, they think of Windows, the operating system - not exactly the hippest image in the world. But Microsoft also owns Xbox, you know? It's one of its most successful business lines, in fact. And there's a lot of crossover between gamers and TikTok users. Not to mention, bringing on TikTok would allow Microsoft to go toe-to-toe with Facebook, which has been looking at TikTok and has been pretty envious, so envious that Facebook has announced a copycat service that sounds a lot like TikTok. MARTIN: So in addition to all this, TikTok is also wrapped up in a big court case. Can you explain what that's all about? ALLYN: Right. So as the focus has been on TikTok's Washington troubles, another problem has been quietly brewing in federal court. There's a massive class action lawsuit about allegedly stealing data from users. And the crux of the suit is about whether TikTok has been sending data about American children to China. The lawyers claim they have proof of this, but it does still have to be proven in court. TikTok's lawyers, though, say, yeah, the app captures and stores all sorts of data, as all apps do, but they're not giving any of it to Chinese authorities. At least that's what TikTok says.

It started with President Trump and his campaign sharing an interview he had done on Fox News. Then both Twitter and Facebook stepped in because they say the video broke the company's rules against spreading misinformation about the coronavirus. We've NPR tech correspondent Shannon Bond here to talk about this. Let me first note that Facebook is an NPR financial supporter. Shannon, good morning to you. And just give us a sense for how this all started. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Well, like you said, this was a video clip from a Fox News interview from Wednesday morning. And in it, the president urged schools to reopen, and he falsely claimed that children are, quote, \"virtually immune\" from COVID-19. Now, of course, that's not true. Research has shown that while children do tend to get infected with the coronavirus less often, they tend to have milder symptoms than adults, kids can still contract it. They can spread it. And some children have gotten seriously ill and even died. GREENE: All right. Well, given all of that, I mean, what did these companies, Twitter and Facebook, do about this? BOND: Well, both said, look, we have rules against spreading misinformation about the coronavirus. It's a big issue right now. And they said this video crosses that line. So Facebook just removed the Trump post altogether from his personal page. It said you can't make false claims that a group of people is immune from COVID-19. And Twitter, it banned the Trump campaign's account from tweeting. The campaign account is who put this video up on Twitter. And Twitter said, if you don't take the video down, you can't tweet. GREENE: Well, let me just ask you, I mean, broadly. I mean, we know social media plays such a role in life now, including in politics. So what does this tell us about how these platforms might act as we get closer to November and the election? BOND: Well, I think we have to remember back to 2016 and what happened. Russian hackers used these platforms to spread disinformation, to influence voters. So Facebook, Twitter, they're under a lot of pressure to do better this time. Facebook has really tried to stay hands off when it comes to politics and what politicians post. CEO Mark Zuckerberg says he doesn't want to be the arbiter of truth. But that doesn't mean that anything goes on Facebook. It's taken down other things that the campaign and the president have posted for violating other policies. So it removed Trump campaign ads that used a Nazi symbol. It took down a post by the president with a doctored video. So I think despite Zuckerberg's reluctance, we do occasionally see Facebook acting as kind of a traffic cop and setting some limits. GREENE: And what about Twitter? BOND: Well, Twitter has taken a much more aggressive approach than Facebook, especially lately. And it's really cracked down on the president. It's put fact-checks, warning labels on some of his posts. And it also even blocked his son Donald Trump Jr. from tweeting after he broke similar rules about spreading coronavirus misinformation. So, you know, I think we're just going to see kind of more of this stuff happen before the election. GREENE: And what are we hearing from the Trump campaign about all of this? BOND: Well, the campaign sent out a public statement saying, look, the president was stating a fact. He was merely saying that children are less susceptible to the disease, even though, to be very clear, that's not exactly what he said on Fox News. The campaign also accused the social media platforms of being biased against conservatives. And that's something we hear from a lot of conservatives. It's not particularly backed up by evidence. But I think, you know, look at just - look at how the Trump campaign reacted yesterday when they were blocked from tweeting. It quickly removed the tweet with this video after it lost those privileges. That's an admission that this campaign really needs Twitter. You know, we know social media in this day and age is already critical to reaching voters. With a pandemic, it's even more clear. This is a campaign going to be fought online.

He was merely saying that children are less susceptible to the disease, even though, to be very clear, that's not exactly what he said on Fox News. The campaign also accused the social media platforms of being biased against conservatives. And that's something we hear from a lot of conservatives. It's not particularly backed up by evidence. But I think, you know, look at just - look at how the Trump campaign reacted yesterday when they were blocked from tweeting. It quickly removed the tweet with this video after it lost those privileges. That's an admission that this campaign really needs Twitter. You know, we know social media in this day and age is already critical to reaching voters. With a pandemic, it's even more clear. This is a campaign going to be fought online.

It looked like a makeup lesson. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)FEROZA AZIZ: Hi, guys. I want to teach you guys how to get long lashes. So the first thing you need to do is grab your lash curler, curl your lashes, obviously. . . MCEVERS: But after those first seven seconds, Feroza changed the subject. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)AZIZ: Curl your lashes, obviously. Then you're going to put them down and use your phone that you're using right now to search up what's happening in China, how they're getting concentration camps, throwing innocent Muslims in there, separating their families from each other. . . MCEVERS: Feroza was talking about what the Chinese government is doing to Uighurs, Kazakhs and other predominantly Muslim people who live in China - 1. 5 million people in internment camps, women forced to be sterilized, have abortions or use mandatory birth control. One researcher recently told NPR that what China is doing now meets the United Nations definition of genocide. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)AZIZ: This is another holocaust, yet no one is talking about it. Please be aware. Please spread awareness. And yeah, so you can grab your lash curler again. . . MCEVERS: That's how the video ends. Millions of people saw it. But what also happened, Feroza Aziz said, is that TikTok, whose parent company is owned by China, suspended her account. She told CNN it wasn't the first time. She'd done an earlier video about China that was more straightforward. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)AZIZ: But that video got taken down. So I knew that if I did it again like, then my video would be taken down. So using the eyelash curler helped disguise my video. And TikTok - obviously, I - they've seen it now. MCEVERS: After all this happened, TikTok said they don't suspend accounts for political speech. But The Washington Post found last fall that if you search for content about Hong Kong on TikTok, you wouldn't find anything about the anti-government protests. And now the company has become a target of President Trump. He says he wants to ban TikTok in the U. S. by next month because, he says, it's a national security threat. Coming up, what we know about whether or not that's true. This is CONSIDER THIS from NPR. I'm Kelly McEvers. It's Friday, August 7. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MCEVERS: OK. So first off, if you are one of about a hundred million Americans who TikTok says have their app, experts say it's not collecting much more data than any other social media platform. The reason it's different is that the Chinese government could at any time get ahold of that data. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)JAMES GRIFFITHS: The argument is that as a Chinese company, there are obligations under Chinese law. And also, there is kind of extra-legal obligations - you know, pressure that Beijing can bring on these companies if it wants access to that data. MCEVERS: James Griffiths is based in Hong Kong for CNN. He wrote a book about China and the Internet. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)GRIFFITHS: And so Washington has argued that given that these companies have all this data, and China can in theory access it, that might present a national security risk if users such as, you know, government employees or families of government employees are using these apps. MCEVERS: So for that reason, last December, the Pentagon ordered military personnel to delete the app from their phones. TikTok, for its part, has pointed out that its data is stored on servers in the U. S. , that it has an American CEO and that the company recently said it would let outside experts and regulators examine its data to prove it's not sharing that data with authorities in China. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It can't be controlled for security reasons by China - too big, too invasive. MCEVERS: But still, President Trump signed an executive order this week that about 45 days from now would outlaw any U. S. citizen from doing business with TikTok - unless an American company buys TikTok's U. S. operations by then. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: We set a date, I set a date of around September 15, at which point it's going to be out of business in the United States. But if. . . MCEVERS: TikTok isn't the only app the president is focused on. Thursday night, he actually signed two executive orders, one targeting TikTok and one targeting the messaging app WeChat. It's pretty clear both these orders are going to be challenged in court. But what happens if they are allowed to go through? James Griffiths with CNN, who you heard earlier, explained that to my colleague David Greene. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DAVID GREENE: So how are these orders from the president last night being viewed in China at this point? GRIFFITHS: Well, Beijing is not happy - sad Friday afternoon here in Beijing - that it firmly opposes the Trump administration's orders and also accused Washington of using national security as an excuse. But, you know, this is fairly ironic rhetoric coming from China given that these are pretty much the same justifications that it uses for a lot of his own controls on the Internet. GREENE: So I just think, I mean, about WeChat as an example - I mean, you have people - users in the United States. You have U. S. citizens in China using WeChat. The executive order from the president - I mean, it's really vague, right? Do we know what the impact will be on people who use it? GRIFFITHS: Yeah, it is very vague. And I think we've already seen quite a lot of concern online, you know, especially from people within the Chinese diaspora in the U. S. , a lot of whom use WeChat to talk to their parents or family back home. You know, this could cut off WeChat from users in the States. And that would essentially mean that they can't talk to family back in China because, of course, Beijing for its part through the great firewall blocks pretty much every other messaging app. And so, you know, were we just to be cut off from the U. S. , that could have major ramifications. And then for Americans in China, that could also have major repercussions because WeChat is - far more so than any apps we use in the English-speaking world, WeChat is, you know, a super-app. It's what people use to pay for things, do mobile payments. It's what - how people book taxis. It's - you know, it's a million apps in one. And so if Americans are prevented from using this or prevented from paying it or using U. S. bank accounts to connect to it, that could really impact how they - you know, how they just live their lives in China. And then also for U. S. companies in China, they may find themselves in a bind because many use WeChat for sales and customer service. GREENE: Could there be a positive here, though, if this forces a lot of those users to turn to apps that might be more secure? GRIFFITHS: Certainly. One potential silver lining to this is that, you know, these apps - the complaints about them are quite real. The concerns about data gathering, the concerns about potential censorship on WeChat - those are legitimate. And if it forces these apps to address them, and if it also acts as a wake-up call for the rest of Silicon Valley to behave better when it comes to data collection, that could be a really positive development for users. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MCEVERS: James Griffiths with CNN in Hong Kong talking to my colleague David Greene. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MCEVERS: We should say TikTok has been the most-downloaded app in the U. S. during the pandemic - so popular, this week Instagram launched a copycat feature called Reels. TikTok, of course, is mostly short videos, 60 seconds or less, served up one after the other - everything from pets to animal to cooking, dance challenges, lip sync videos, all made to grab your attention in the first few seconds. A huge portion of its user base is under 30 years old. And over the past few months, a lot of those people have been using it for more than just dancing and lip syncs. Here's NPR tech reporter Bobby Allyn. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)BOBBY ALLYN: Raisha Doumbia is a 20-year-old swimming instructor in the Atlanta area. She downloaded TikTok about a year ago, mostly to post fun videos like her lip-syncing and dancing to songs from the British girl group Little Mix. But after protests swept the nation over George Floyd's death, Doumbia switched it up with messages like this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RAISHA DOUMBIA: The Black Lives Matter movement is not a photo-op. This is not a chance for you to just take photo shoots. If you really wanted to stand up for our rights as an ally, you would be out there marching. ALLYN: Doumbia admits it was a drastic change in tone. DOUMBIA: I was just so disgusted that I felt like I needed to say something. So I started to speak out even though I had, like, 13 followers. ALLYN: She has more than 60,000 now, though, because some of her videos went viral. Doumbia is far from alone. Videos with the Black Lives Matter hashtag have skyrocketed to the top spot on the platform. The so-called queen of TikTok, Charli D'Amelio, has taken a break from posting dance videos. The 16-year-old, who is white, told her 60 million followers recently she was having a moment of reflection. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CHARLI D'AMELIO: As a person who has been given the platform to be an influencer, I realize that with that title I have a job - to inform people on the racial inequalities in the world right now. ALLYN: Debra Aho Williamson of eMarketer studies social media trends. She says TikTok videos that are funny or full of raw emotions can reach huge audiences and quickly, so it makes sense that TikTok is what teens are using to address police brutality and racial inequality. DEBRA AHO WILLIAMSON: For the first time, they might be exploring how they feel about these issues. And being able to do that on TikTok talk and see other young people who are maybe expressing similar things - I think it's really valid and valuable. ALLYN: But TikTok is being forced to grow up with its users. Black creators noticed early on that videos that reference George Floyd and Black Lives Matter were being hidden. And the Chinese company that owns TikTok does have a history of censoring videos in places like Hong Kong. TikTok says that's not what's happening here. It blames a technical glitch and says it stands with the Black community. Not all of the app's users do, though. When 17-year-old Kai Harris (ph) of New Jersey posted about going to a protest, some viewers responded with racist and mean comments. KAI HARRIS: They're, like, I came here for a good time. I came here to laugh and dance, and you're bringing me down with all this stuff. And I'm, like, the fact that this is happening is bringing me down. ALLYN: Harris doesn't see herself going back to making videos of her dancing in wigs or lip-syncing because she can't stop thinking about Black people dying at the hands of police. HARRIS: I do not want to grow up in a world where this just keeps happening. So I decided, you know what? I've been silent on these issues sometimes. I don't share my opinions, but I need to share them now. ALLYN: Harris says she remembers when Trayvon Martin was killed in 2012. But she didn't fully grasp it at the time because she was just 10 years old. Now she is 17, and she says she's ready to change some minds, one 30-second video at a time.

The feature, which is currently only available to Android users, adjusts voice pitch to make the faster or slowed-down speed sound natural. The idea drew criticism from directors like Judd Apatow, who said last fall that platforms should leave content as it was, quote, \"intended to be seen. \" But advocates for the deaf and blind are lauding the new feature, saying it's a win for people who rely on playback options so they can also enjoy the cinematic experience. One of those advocates is Everette Bacon. He's a board member with the National Federation of the Blind, and he joins us from Salt Lake City, Utah. Hello. Thanks for joining us. EVERETTE BACON: Thank you for having me. FADEL: So for those who don't know, for someone who is blind, how do you watch films or TV shows? BACON: So we watch films just like anybody else, only we have what's called audio description or audio description narration that's going on while the programming is being viewed. And so basically, when there is no dialogue between the actors, a narrator comes on and describes what's happening in the scene and what's happening in the show so we have an understanding. So, like, they might describe the set, what's happening around us. They might give us some gender information or race information about the characters - just overall things that help us understand and comprehend what the creators were trying to portray to the general public. FADEL: And so how does this new playback feature assist with the viewing experience? BACON: Well, blind individuals - many of us use a screen-reading technology on our computers and our phones, and we have learned and adapted over time to speed that up on a regular basis. We've also been listening to audio books for years. As a member of the National Federation of the Blind, I've been listening to audio books from the Library for the Blind for many years. And we've always been able to speed up that process because we're listening all the time, and our ears are kind of trained over time to listen at a quicker speed, and so allowing us to do the same thing on a show like a documentary or some type of other content - it really helps a whole lot when you're trying to consume such great content in mass quantity. FADEL: And why is it so important? You mention that you've been doing this in other platforms. Why is it so important on a streaming platform like Netflix? BACON: Well, I think it's very important because I'm going to watch a lot of content just like anybody else. And honestly, I've been listening to so many things all of my life that when I listen at regular speed, sometimes it can sound a little slower than it should. And so I - my ears kind of want it a little bit more faster as a blind individual because that's what I've been used to listening to my computer, listening to my phone, listening to audio books. So it's only a natural process that I would want the speed to be a bit faster on the streaming content that I'm viewing on Netflix or other platforms. FADEL: You know, as I mentioned earlier, there are directors, actors who've pushed back, saying this playback option distorts their art and the way it was intended to be consumed. How would you respond to them? BACON: Well, I would say to someone like director Judd Apatow, who is a person who I love the programs that he's put together, and I've watched several of his films - there is so much information that they have put out in their content that audio description allows me as a blind individual to comprehend and observe. And to having that speed feature - it just allows me to better understand and better comprehend what they were trying to portray in their creation. I love a lot of Judd Apatow's work, and I think if he understood me as a blind individual and how I consume content, he would be - applaud this new feature by Netflix. FADEL: And before we let you go, you know, this made news, that Netflix is putting this playback option in. And I'm sure we'll hear about this issue again about access and accessibility to this content. What should our listeners know about why this matters? BACON: Well, I think this matters greatly in creating inclusion for individuals who are blind or individuals who are deaf and hard of hearing. I just think it creates more opportunity for inclusion - for everyone to enjoy products the way they were intended. FADEL: That was Everette Bacon, a board member with the National Federation of the Blind, discussing the new playback features on Netflix. Thanks for being with us. BACON: Thank you for having me again. LEILA FADEL, HOST:   Netflix recently announced it's rolling out a new feature that allows some viewers to stream their favorite shows or films slower - half-speed, say - or faster. The feature, which is currently only available to Android users, adjusts voice pitch to make the faster or slowed-down speed sound natural. The idea drew criticism from directors like Judd Apatow, who said last fall that platforms should leave content as it was, quote, \"intended to be seen. \" But advocates for the deaf and blind are lauding the new feature, saying it's a win for people who rely on playback options so they can also enjoy the cinematic experience. One of those advocates is Everette Bacon. He's a board member with the National Federation of the Blind, and he joins us from Salt Lake City, Utah. Hello. Thanks for joining us. EVERETTE BACON: Thank you for having me. FADEL: So for those who don't know, for someone who is blind, how do you watch films or TV shows? BACON: So we watch films just like anybody else, only we have what's called audio description or audio description narration that's going on while the programming is being viewed. And so basically, when there is no dialogue between the actors, a narrator comes on and describes what's happening in the scene and what's happening in the show so we have an understanding. So, like, they might describe the set, what's happening around us. They might give us some gender information or race information about the characters - just overall things that help us understand and comprehend what the creators were trying to portray to the general public. FADEL: And so how does this new playback feature assist with the viewing experience? BACON: Well, blind individuals - many of us use a screen-reading technology on our computers and our phones, and we have learned and adapted over time to speed that up on a regular basis. We've also been listening to audio books for years. As a member of the National Federation of the Blind, I've been listening to audio books from the Library for the Blind for many years. And we've always been able to speed up that process because we're listening all the time, and our ears are kind of trained over time to listen at a quicker speed, and so allowing us to do the same thing on a show like a documentary or some type of other content - it really helps a whole lot when you're trying to consume such great content in mass quantity. FADEL: And why is it so important? You mention that you've been doing this in other platforms. Why is it so important on a streaming platform like Netflix? BACON: Well, I think it's very important because I'm going to watch a lot of content just like anybody else. And honestly, I've been listening to so many things all of my life that when I listen at regular speed, sometimes it can sound a little slower than it should. And so I - my ears kind of want it a little bit more faster as a blind individual because that's what I've been used to listening to my computer, listening to my phone, listening to audio books. So it's only a natural process that I would want the speed to be a bit faster on the streaming content that I'm viewing on Netflix or other platforms. FADEL: You know, as I mentioned earlier, there are directors, actors who've pushed back, saying this playback option distorts their art and the way it was intended to be consumed. How would you respond to them? BACON: Well, I would say to someone like director Judd Apatow, who is a person who I love the programs that he's put together, and I've watched several of his films - there is so much information that they have put out in their content that audio description allows me as a blind individual to comprehend and observe. And to having that speed feature - it just allows me to better understand and better comprehend what they were trying to portray in their creation. I love a lot of Judd Apatow's work, and I think if he understood me as a blind individual and how I consume content, he would be - applaud this new feature by Netflix. FADEL: And before we let you go, you know, this made news, that Netflix is putting this playback option in. And I'm sure we'll hear about this issue again about access and accessibility to this content. What should our listeners know about why this matters? BACON: Well, I think this matters greatly in creating inclusion for individuals who are blind or individuals who are deaf and hard of hearing. I just think it creates more opportunity for inclusion - for everyone to enjoy products the way they were intended. FADEL: That was Everette Bacon, a board member with the National Federation of the Blind, discussing the new playback features on Netflix. Thanks for being with us.

S. starting next month. Today NPR learned that the company plans to take the Trump administration to court over the order. Its legal argument is that Trump's executive order is unconstitutional. For more, we're joined by NPR's technology reporter Bobby Allyn. Bobby, tell us more about TikTok's case against the president's order. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Right. So I talked to a person on TikTok's legal team who's actually writing the lawsuit against the administration, and here's what I've learned. TikTok is going to argue that it was never given any chance to respond to the concerns that are spelled out in Trump's executive order. Typically, there is some kind of prior notice. You know, like, a company like TikTok usually is given a chance to explain itself, but TikTok says that never happened here. Additionally, TikTok's lawyers say the very basis for banning the app - that the Chinese Communist Party could potentially get its hands on Americans' data - is never proven. FADEL: OK. So has the administration responded? ALLYN: The White House when I reached out to them declined to comment on the forthcoming suit here. But they did say that they're committed to protecting Americans from cyberthreats that they say could endanger the nation's security. In Trump's order, you know, he relies on emergency economic powers that essentially would cut off all ties to TikTok. What would that mean in practice? Well, it would mean if you want to download TikTok, you wouldn't be able to. Landlords who host TikTok's offices would be forced to evict them. The paychecks of TikTok's a thousand U. S. employees would be frozen indefinitely. So, as you can imagine, TikTok's, you know, taking this pretty seriously. But I'll note here, you know, the app's been downloaded more than 100 million times, and it's really one of the first apps out of China to become a huge global success. But this order - it would be fatal for them. FADEL: So the Trump order also put pressure on an American company to buy TikTok. And Microsoft is in talks to acquire it. Where do those talks stand? ALLYN: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the order was seen basically as a way to kind of speed up an acquisition of TikTok. And as you mentioned, Microsoft is one of a handful of companies considering buying TikTok. And I talked to people close to those discussions, and they all say talks are early. There's a lot of work still. You know, like, how many countries would Microsoft control TikTok in? Would TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, then become a competitor in some of the other markets? What would that look like? So there's a lot that needs to be hashed out. But, you know, in the U. S. , there are millions and millions of teens who would just be utterly heartbroken if. . . FADEL: Yeah. ALLYN: . . . TikTok disappeared. You know, especially in the pandemic, it's just become a really important place for young people to digitally congregate and share videos of them dancing and cooking and even political activism. It's really become a place for young people to do all sorts of things. FADEL: Right. And so the big question is, is TikTok - it's been a target in Washington over concerns about ties to China. But are those fears justified? ALLYN: So TikTok collects just as much data as any app on your phone. The big difference is in its terms of service. So in the fine print, it says it can share that data with its Chinese parent company. And there's absolutely no proof as of now that TikTok has given that information over to Chinese authorities. And, you know, foreign policy experts and even some in the intelligence community have examined the TikTok app and said it doesn't look like it poses a big national security threat. That said, if the Chinese government wanted data, experts have told me they would be able to get it from TikTok under Chinese law. So yeah, it's possible in theory that China can get its hands on Americans' data. But right now, there's no direct proof showing that's happening. And TikTok, for its part, you know, has been bending over backwards to show it is not beholden to China. Its primary servers for U. S. data are based in Virginia. It's even opened up its algorithms for regulators and experts to examine. But still, China hawks say, you know, TikTok has got to go. FADEL: That's NPR's Bobby Allyn. Thanks so much, Bobby.

S. government and a few other nations. But now this imagery, which shows the entire landmass of the Earth every day, is available to more or less everyone. As NPR's Greg Myre reports, this has created a new world of possibilities for groups that range from environmentalists to researchers who monitor nuclear programs. GREG MYRE, BYLINE: In March last year, the U. S. military was bombing the last holdout of Islamic State fighters in eastern Syria. It wasn't clear how many civilians were still in the besieged desert town of Baghouz. So Human Rights Watch made an urgent request to a private satellite company called Planet. It wanted Planet's regular daily satellite photos, as well as video of the town. JOSH LYONS: That live video actually was instrumental in convincing us that, indeed, there were thousands of civilians trapped in this pocket. MYRE: Josh Lyons is with Human Rights Watch. He says the video evidence helped lead to a pause in the bombing so civilians could flee. This kind of work is embedded in Lyons' unusual job title, director of geospatial analysis. He receives images supplied by Planet. It's doing something unprecedented. Every day, its satellites photograph the entire landmass of the Earth - more than 1 million images every 24 hours - everywhere from your house to the peak of Mount Everest. Rich Leshner runs Planet's Washington office. He explains how the company's 150 satellites work. RICH LESHNER: If you could visualize a string of pearls going around the poles, looking down and capturing imagery of the Earth underneath it every single day. MYRE: On its website, Planet's photo gallery provides a bird's-eye view of the state of the world - idle cruise ships clustered off the coast of the Bahamas, deserted streets around normally bustling sites like the Colosseum in Rome, smoke rising from the fires set by farmers clearing land in the Amazon rainforest. Planet has clients you'd expect, like the U. S. military and big corporations, and some you wouldn't. . . LESHNER: I am often surprised. MYRE: . . . Like local governments monitoring marijuana production in their communities. Around 15 years ago, Melissa Hanham, fresh out of graduate school, knew what she wanted to do - monitor clandestine nuclear programs. The question was how. MELISSA HANHAM: I wanted to know what was happening in North Korea. I couldn't go there. It's not the kind of place that would let some strange lady walk around and learn things. MYRE: Lucky for her, Google Earth's satellite imagery was just coming online. HANHAM: I didn't really know what I was doing yet. Like, well, here's the town. Here's a road. Where would I launch a missile from? It's probably somewhere flat. Sure enough, I found the place. That was, like, a really critical moment because it meant that me, Melissa Hanham, regular lady, could figure out where North Korea launched missiles. MYRE: Hanham is now at the Open Nuclear Network in Vienna. She's still tracking nuclear programs with open-source satellite images, which keep getting more sophisticated. HANHAM: I think about the pattern of life at that place. Is there, you know, a helipad? Is there a helicopter that's arriving on the helipad? Because important people don't necessarily travel by bus, you know, like everyone else. MYRE: The satellites have also turned their eyes to the fragile coral reefs. In Seattle, Bill Hilf is the CEO of Vulcan. The company was started by Paul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft. He died in 2018. BILL HILF: One of the challenges that Paul Allen gave us a few years ago was go and map all of the world's coral reefs. MYRE: At that point, the process was often low-tech.

And so to really do it effectively, we needed the ability to use satellite data. MYRE: The project, called the Allen Coral Atlas, partners with governments, universities and local communities. From Australia to Madagascar, it assesses tropical shallow-water reefs. Reefs are in trouble worldwide, but the aim is to better protect them by doing things like rerouting shipping lanes and working with coastal villages to prevent overfishing. HILF: Our goal is by summer of 2021 to have 100% of coral reefs mapped.

And lockdown also took away an important creative outlet for a special breed of medical professional - classical musicians. That's why John Masko, a symphony conductor in Boston, founded the National Virtual Medical Orchestra, giving those in that field a chance to perform and connect with each other. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GARCIA-NAVARRO: John Masko joins us now. Welcome. JOHN MASKO: Thank you. Great to be here. GARCIA-NAVARRO: And also on the line is Dr. Erica Hardy, an infectious disease specialist in Providence, R. I. , who also happens to play the violin in the orchestra. Welcome to you. ERICA HARDY: Thank you. GARCIA-NAVARRO: I'm going to start with you, John. You are a full-time conductor and not involved in medicine. Explain to me how this got started. MASKO: Well, I've actually had a fairly long history with medical orchestras, and I kept hearing from musician after musician from our ensemble about how much they wished that they were playing. And I had to assume that the same was true of medical orchestras all around the country. So that resulted in this project. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GARCIA-NAVARRO: So what is it like right now to play in an orchestra? I imagine that before the pandemic, it was something to do to sort of take you out of the stresses and strains of, you know, work in the medical field. But it must have a special resonance now. HARDY: Yeah, that's so true. You know, many of us have been musicians longer than we've been doctors or scientists or nurses. You know, I started playing when I was 4 years old. And I think the music is twofold. You're absolutely right. It gives us an outlet. We use a different part of our brain. It's a time to do something else and take our mind off of medicine. We try to play all the notes, but if we hit a wrong one, you know, it's not life-or-death (laughter), you know? GARCIA-NAVARRO: Unlike in the operating room. HARDY: Yes. Right. And so - you know, so it's an outlet for us. And then I think the - you know, perhaps more importantly, it's something we can give back to our communities. You know, I got a lot of emails after we posted our first video from colleagues just thanking me and the orchestra for playing and saying, oh, you know, that was the best five minutes of just relaxation I had today. So. . . GARCIA-NAVARRO: John, what are the logistics of rehearsing and performing? I mean, dozens of people playing together remotely - that's got to be tough to keep them in time. MASKO: Yeah, it's quite a process. Some people guess that you can coordinate a musical ensemble, you know, live virtually if everything is set up correctly. But, you know, I think for most of us who've had the experience of singing \"Happy Birthday\" for someone over Zoom in a group, it's. . . GARCIA-NAVARRO: Yes. MASKO: You see that that's not really something that's practicable in this medium. So what we actually do is, you know, we've worked with a pair of absolutely fantastic producers to do these performances, which is vital. We'll basically craft a track that musicians can listen to as they play, which, you know, has our tempos, has interpretive information on it. And they will record themselves. We'll give a two-week period, usually, for that to happen, and they will submit a recording after about a week. And then I can listen to it and give a litany of feedback. And the result of that is that you end up with a unified performance across the ensemble. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Erica, is there a particular piece that resonates for you that you have played at this time? HARDY: I mean, I really loved the second piece we did, the \"Brahms Academic Overture. \"(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)HARDY: It's been an interesting process to do the recording. You know, I'm not so technologically inclined. And, you know, I may have mastered Zoom, but this was sort of another level, although they do make it quite easy. But we're really, you know, recording on our iPhones. And it's been great. It's been interesting. GARCIA-NAVARRO: John, when this pandemic is finally behind us, that day, would you like to get these folks together in person? MASKO: Absolutely. One of the influences behind founding this ensemble was the fact that the medical orchestra sphere has kind of exploded over the last couple decades. And one of the results of that fast growth has been a sort of fragmentation. Very few of these ensembles, at least before we entered the pandemic and started in on these projects, really knew about each other or knew about the other orchestras that existed. And so one of the things that's already happening is medical musicians around the country are discovering each other. And many are reconnecting with old friends. You know, we've had that happen through our ensemble already. And our hope is that even if we're not producing virtual performances because we're able to feedback together in person that the unifying effect of this ensemble can continue on in some way and be a headquarters, be a base of support for the medical orchestra movement around the country. GARCIA-NAVARRO: I've been talking to conductor John Masko and violinist Dr. Erica Hardy of the National Virtual Medical Orchestra. Thank you to you both. MASKO: Yeah, thank you. HARDY: Thank you.

But, you know, I think for most of us who've had the experience of singing \"Happy Birthday\" for someone over Zoom in a group, it's. . . GARCIA-NAVARRO: Yes. MASKO: You see that that's not really something that's practicable in this medium. So what we actually do is, you know, we've worked with a pair of absolutely fantastic producers to do these performances, which is vital. We'll basically craft a track that musicians can listen to as they play, which, you know, has our tempos, has interpretive information on it. And they will record themselves. We'll give a two-week period, usually, for that to happen, and they will submit a recording after about a week. And then I can listen to it and give a litany of feedback. And the result of that is that you end up with a unified performance across the ensemble. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Erica, is there a particular piece that resonates for you that you have played at this time? HARDY: I mean, I really loved the second piece we did, the \"Brahms Academic Overture. \" (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) HARDY: It's been an interesting process to do the recording. You know, I'm not so technologically inclined. And, you know, I may have mastered Zoom, but this was sort of another level, although they do make it quite easy. But we're really, you know, recording on our iPhones. And it's been great. It's been interesting. GARCIA-NAVARRO: John, when this pandemic is finally behind us, that day, would you like to get these folks together in person? MASKO: Absolutely. One of the influences behind founding this ensemble was the fact that the medical orchestra sphere has kind of exploded over the last couple decades. And one of the results of that fast growth has been a sort of fragmentation. Very few of these ensembles, at least before we entered the pandemic and started in on these projects, really knew about each other or knew about the other orchestras that existed. And so one of the things that's already happening is medical musicians around the country are discovering each other. And many are reconnecting with old friends. You know, we've had that happen through our ensemble already. And our hope is that even if we're not producing virtual performances because we're able to feedback together in person that the unifying effect of this ensemble can continue on in some way and be a headquarters, be a base of support for the medical orchestra movement around the country. GARCIA-NAVARRO: I've been talking to conductor John Masko and violinist Dr. Erica Hardy of the National Virtual Medical Orchestra. Thank you to you both. MASKO: Yeah, thank you. HARDY: Thank you.

Well, today the ride-hailing giants lost in court. A state judge has ordered them to consider all those drivers employees, which could cost the companies millions of dollars. NPR tech reporter Bobby Allyn is with us now from San Francisco. Bobby, how you doing? BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Hey, Mary Louise - doing OK. KELLY: So what are the stakes here? ALLYN: Well, in some ways, the stakes are the very business model Uber and Lyft are built on, which, you know, of course, relies very heavily on drivers being independent contractors. And you know, this ruling is a big deal because here we have a state judge saying Uber and Lyft are violating the law because there are hundreds of thousands of drivers who are, you know, independent contractors that the companies are refusing to convert them to regular employees. And you know, it comes after California passed a law last year that made it much more difficult for companies like Lyft and Uber to hire people as independent contractors. And here we have the judge saying Lyft and Uber are showing, quote, \"a prolonged and brazen refusal to comply\" with that California law. KELLY: What did the judge say in explaining what the rationale for this ruling was? ALLYN: Yeah. The judge said that, you know, Uber and Lyft are exhibiting, quote, \"circular reasoning. \" And what the judge meant by that is, you know, Uber and Lyft consider its engineers and other tech workers as full-time employees, but the hundreds of thousands of drivers are treated a little differently. And even though the companies, you know, have long made the case that this new state law regulating the gig economy shouldn't apply to them, the judge says the companies can no longer postpone their day of reckoning. KELLY: Let me go out on a limb and guess that Uber and Lyft are planning to appeal this. ALLYN: Yes, they sure are. Uber says it will appeal, quote, \"on behalf of California drivers. \" Just this morning in The New York Times, the CEO of Uber wrote an op-ed, you know, and he said Uber would only have full-time jobs for a small fraction of its current drivers and would have to shrink its service dramatically if they converted all of their drivers to full-time employees. And you know, Uber and Lyft are not profitable companies. They point this out. And they also say if all of their drivers were full-time employees, they'd have to lay many of them off. And for passengers, rides would get more expensive. That's what the companies say. KELLY: Yeah. So what's the timing here? Does this kick in immediately or what happens next? ALLYN: So the judge is giving Uber and Lyft 10 days to appeal, which, as you mentioned, they plan to. And this case is going to trial, and so this ruling will last until the trial and through the trial. I will say the judge noted that the state of California, the attorney general and the city attorneys who are suing the companies here are likely to prevail on the merits. So the judge is basically signaling that when it comes time for the trial that California has a really strong case. In November, voters in California will be, you know, testing this idea out about whether or not Lyft and Uber drivers should be contractors or full-time employees. There's a ballot initiative that's going to be asking voters that that both Lyft and Uber have been pushing for. So we will see what California voters think about that come November.

They say artificial intelligence and new surveillance technology can secure the border without spending billions on steel and concrete. Now comes a government watchdog report that faults Customs and Border Protection for not considering alternatives to the wall. NPR's John Burnett reports. JOHN BURNETT, BYLINE: Trump's giant wall gets all the buzz, but Customs and Border Protection is quietly testing a new generation of free-standing surveillance towers on the Arizona border that could revolutionize border security. The telescoping towers are equipped with infrared and daytime cameras, along with laser rangefinders and illuminators that can zoom in on a target miles away for a close-up. They're mounted in the bed of a Ford F-150, so they're completely mobile, and they can be operated remotely. They can tell an agent if the object moving north is a cow or a single migrant or a family. KELLY GOOD: The camera sees something - it's going to alert and then send that information to an agent in the field directly. So if I have a phone now, my phone will have an app on it, and that information will come directly to me. BURNETT: That's CBP's Kelly Good. As deputy executive director of the program management office, he's in charge of technology acquisition. I met him last March at the Border Security Expo in San Antonio, where domain awareness technology was the hottest gear. With Trump's border wall now approaching $25 million a mile, I asked Good, how much do the mobile towers cost? GOOD: Little less than a million. BURNETT: Less than a million. That's the same question the inspector general of the Homeland Security Department had. Last month, the watchdog released a report critical of the Border Patrol's single-minded fixation on a wall as the answer to border security. The inspector general wrote, quote, \"CBP's inability to effectively guide this large-scale effort poses significant risk of exponentially increasing costs. \" In fact, the audit said Border Patrol insisted on a wall, even though the agency's own internal analysis said technology and boots on the ground were smarter solutions in certain regions. Representative Henry Cuellar is a Texas Democrat from a border district where CBP proposes to build 121 miles of barriers. HENRY CUELLAR: We now are in a time we can build this virtual border wall technology. We have that already. I mean, you got the autonomous surveillant powers. But there is political pressure from the White House. They're saying, build me the wall. Get me miles. BURNETT: Last week, three landowners in the Laredo area filed legal documents in federal court, trying to stop the government from condemning their riverside property for wall construction. One of their arguments is the inspector general's report. Carlos Flores is an attorney representing the property owners. CARLOS FLORES: Ten years ago, everybody was using Blackberries. But now, you know, everyone's using the latest iPhone. And so the technology for securing the southern border has grown dramatically so that you have technology that you can use today that is probably more cost-effective than this antiquated border wall. BURNETT: CBP counters that the agency needs both - the wall and the all-seeing mobile towers. Eyes in the sky can detect illegal crossers, but it can't stop them, says Kelly Good, the CBP tech guy back at the Border Security Expo. GOOD: So if you have just technology, they can still come right through there. All they have to do is get across and get on that highway, load up in a car and they're gone. The wall or barrier is giving you time to slow it down. BURNETT: To the criticism that CBP did not consider cheaper, alternate methods to control the border, the agency responded that it was following an executive order from the president to build a physical barrier. All of this may be a moot point if Trump doesn't win a second term. Last week, Joe Biden spoke to a convention of Hispanic and Black journalists. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOE BIDEN: There will not be another foot of wall constructed in my administration. BURNETT: The presumptive Democratic nominee agrees that a 30-foot-tall structure is not the only answer. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BIDEN: I'm going to make sure that we have border protection, but it's going to be based on making sure that we use high-tech capacity to deal with it. BURNETT: While Trump's Border Patrol says it has to have a physical barrier, under a Democratic White House, the agency may rediscover a virtual wall. John Burnett, NPR News.

But the company insists that people spreading disinformation are going to find it harder than they did in 2016. The head of cybersecurity at Facebook says they are catching some false statements and also offering better information. His name is Nathaniel Gleicher. NATHANIEL GLEICHER: I think I actually want to make the act of trying to tell a lie or misleading people more difficult. KING: Facebook provides financial support to NPR, but we cover it just like any other company. We've done lots of reporting on how at times it becomes a platform for disinformation. Now Gleicher talked to Steve to announce new measures to inform voters, which, Steve, you used as a chance to ask about misinformation. And what did he tell you? STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Well, he says that Facebook is standing up what are called voting information centers. We're told that these are going to be easily found - in your face when you're scrolling through Facebook, pages that will tell you how to vote, where to vote, get you accurate information about the basics of the election. This move comes as Facebook faces a lot of pressure from Congress and some in the public to do a lot better than 2016, when Russia, as we know, interfered in the election, got a lot of disinformation out there and a lot of domestic players spread false stories, too. KING: OK. So they're trying to do better. But isn't there still a lot of false information on Facebook about voting? INSKEEP: Oh, my goodness, yes. And that was a lot of our discussion. We brought up a number of recent reports. ProPublica revealed that hundreds of thousands of people have seen videos and other information on Facebook providing false information about that very subject that Facebook wants to inform you better on - voting. At one point, they said if they - you go to the top 50 pages, the most popular pages that relate to voting, 22 of them - almost half - have false or misleading information. And there's also the matter of conspiracy theories that influence how people think about politics. Investigations by the Guardian and the Tech Transparency Center (ph) found big spreading this year of QAnon, the conspiracy movement, as well as the boogaloo movement, which calls for a second civil war. I will say that Gleicher insists they're on this. They're even doing what they call red team exercises, where they assign people to pretend to be bad actors, and then Facebook's teams try to catch them. KING: Oh, that's interesting. So is he really confident that Facebook can prevent disinformation in 2020? INSKEEP: That was exactly my question for Nathaniel Gleicher. Let's listen. Do you think that most voters, if they rely on Facebook, will be mostly well-informed? GLEICHER: I think people are going to read on our platform based on what they're looking for and the people that they're talking to. What I can tell you is every single person in the United States is going to have at the very top of their feed and on posts that they read about voting accurate information about how to vote, how the process works and what the experts in state government and elections officials are saying about how the processes function. INSKEEP: I think I hear you saying that you believe everybody is going to have an option to find accurate information, but it's going to be up to them to find it. GLEICHER: Well, we're going to put that accurate information in front of people as many ways as we can. INSKEEP: We should note, Noel, Facebook business model is still that almost anybody can say anything. They profit when there's an intense discussion of something, even if it's false. They are going after some high-profile false statements. They've made some announcements about that over time. But you know, I kept thinking about the war on drugs, where some shipments get caught and some shipments don't. And I guess Facebook's stated goal here is to come out just a little ahead. KING: And I guess we'll see if that's going to be enough. Thanks, Steve. INSKEEP: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KING: Kamala Harris is the first woman of color to run as the vice presidential candidate for a major party. Her parents are immigrants from India and Jamaica. INSKEEP: Yesterday, she and Joe Biden appeared together for the first time as running mates, and Harris noted his comfort with and proximity to Black leaders. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KAMALA HARRIS: Today he takes his place in the ongoing story of America's march toward equality and justice as only - as the only - as the only who has served alongside the first Black president and has chosen the first Black woman as his running mate. INSKEEP: Having noted what is different about her selection, Harris then did something that vice presidential nominees traditionally do. The VP's role is often to attack the other side, and she criticized the Trump campaign. KING: NPR's Juana Summers was watching it all. Good morning, Juana. JUANA SUMMERS, BYLINE: Good morning. KING: What was the case that Kamala Harris made against President Trump yesterday? SUMMERS: Well, Noel, it was a very forceful and specific case against President Trump. She is a former prosecutor. And in echoes of her own presidential campaign, she said she sees the case against the Trump and Pence campaign as open and shut. And then, as the Biden campaign has done for months now, she focused her attention on the pandemic. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)HARRIS: This virus has impacted almost every country. But there's a reason it has hit America worse than any other advanced nation. It's because of Trump's failure to take it seriously from the start, his refusal to get testing up and running, his flip-flopping on social distancing and wearing masks, his delusional belief that he knows better than the experts. SUMMERS: We also heard Harris talk about her relationship with Joe Biden, one that was forged out of her close relationship with Beau Biden, the former vice president's son who died of cancer. They served as state attorneys general at the same time. Biden had also said that he had asked Barack Obama to promise that he would be the last person in the room before Obama made a big decision. And Joe Biden said that was the kind of relationship he said he imagines he'll have with Harris. KING: OK. So it's interesting. There's two things here. There's her attack on Trump, and then there's what Kamala Harris represents more broadly. Right? We know that Joe Biden was under pressure to pick a woman of color. Are the people who put him under that pressure happy with her as the pick? SUMMERS: They were. I talked to a lot of those people, and a number of them told me that this was a moment they'd been waiting for their entire life - of course, coming in the middle of this pandemic and this reckoning in this country over a systemic racism and where we're discussing representation more openly than perhaps ever before. One of those people was LaTosha Brown. She's a co-founder of Black Voters Matter. She signed that April open letter along with hundreds of other Black women calling for Biden to put a Black woman on the ticket. LATOSHA BROWN: In this moment, we thought it was critical - that this is the time, this is the moment for a Black woman. I think it's going to show itself to be, we were right. I think it's showing itself already that we are right, that the campaign has taken on a whole nother level of energy right now. SUMMERS: We heard Harris talk yesterday about her childhood, being raised by Jamaican and Indian parents in Oakland and Berkeley during the civil rights movement as well as her education at Howard University, perhaps one of the best well-known historically Black colleges in this country. KING: And yet it's worth noting that there are progressives, especially young people of color, who just are not convinced by her because she spent time as a prosecutor in a criminal justice system that they believe is racist. SUMMERS: Yeah, that's right. This is one of the things that Mythili Sampathkumar brought up to me. She is a freelance journalist and on the board of the South Asian Journalists Association. She said her initial reaction to Harris' selection was one of pride but also a little anxiety. MYTHILI SAMPATHKUMAR: There is a lot of pride in the community from a lot of people. But there are also differences because of her political positions on things like criminal justice reform and Israel, just to name a few. SUMMERS: And since Kamala Harris ended her own presidential campaign, we've seen her go out. She's marched alongside protesters. She's championed efforts to overhaul policing, make lynching a federal crime. And one thing I heard when I was listening to those comments, her first as Joe Biden's running mate, was her standing alongside him and saying affirmatively that Black lives do matter. KING: NPR's Juana Summers. Thanks, Juana. SUMMERS: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KING: All right. So it looks like there might be a kind of showdown in Thailand this weekend. INSKEEP: The standoff is between the military-backed government and student groups who want democratic reforms. The students are calling, also, for reform of the country's wealthy and powerful monarchy. KING: Michael Sullivan is with us now from Chiang Rai, Thailand. Michael, what's been going on there? MICHAEL SULLIVAN, BYLINE: Well, these protests started at the beginning of the year. And then they were gathering steam until COVID struck, and then that put things on hold. Then they restarted a few weeks ago and got a lot of traction at campuses all over the country. But on Monday, the students upped the ante dramatically. Before, they were speaking about democratic reforms, about removing the military-backed government, of writing a new constitution. But on Monday, they added another item to the agenda - the third rail of Thai politics. And that's the role of the monarchy - and the king and his money and where he lives. And this just stunned many people here. It's just not done. Here's David Streckfuss - he's a scholar living here - talking about the speeches at the rally. DAVID STRECKFUSS: What the lawyer said and what students said soon after was the first time in modern Thai history that the monarchy has been talked about publicly in a critical way. SULLIVAN: Laws currently prohibit people from speaking ill of the king, and you can go to jail for 15 years if convicted. So this was a very big deal. KING: So why are the students doing this right now? It sounds like the stakes are just as high as they always were. SULLIVAN: Yeah, well, a lot of things - I mean, dissatisfaction with the current military-backed government, anger at that government's decision to ban a popular opposition party, which, not coincidentally, it called for an end to the military's involvement in politics - and then there's the economy. I mean, it wasn't doing that well even before the COVID pandemic hit, and Thailand locked down to keep their numbers low. Now the economy's tanked. And the students just seem to recognize that any real reform will have to involve both institutions, the monarchy and the military, who've enjoyed a symbiotic relationship for decades. KING: And so what happens over the weekend? You were talking earlier to us about a kind of showdown. SULLIVAN: Yeah. Nobody knows. I mean, a lot of people fear the worst given the military's track record in the past. I think the government and the military that backs it are in a bind. Their legitimacy is at stake here. And then there's the monarchy, too. What's the king thinking? What does he want them to do - ease up, crackdown? There's no way of knowing yet. But there's another big rally planned this weekend. Let's see what happens then. Hopefully, there'll be a peaceful solution, but nobody's banking on it. KING: OK. Michael Sullivan in Chiang Rai, Thailand. Michael, thanks so much. SULLIVAN: You're welcome. NOEL KING, HOST:   A lot of this fall's election will play out on Facebook, just like last time. But the company insists that people spreading disinformation are going to find it harder than they did in 2016. The head of cybersecurity at Facebook says they are catching some false statements and also offering better information. His name is Nathaniel Gleicher. NATHANIEL GLEICHER: I think I actually want to make the act of trying to tell a lie or misleading people more difficult. KING: Facebook provides financial support to NPR, but we cover it just like any other company. We've done lots of reporting on how at times it becomes a platform for disinformation. Now Gleicher talked to Steve to announce new measures to inform voters, which, Steve, you used as a chance to ask about misinformation. And what did he tell you? STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:   Well, he says that Facebook is standing up what are called voting information centers. We're told that these are going to be easily found - in your face when you're scrolling through Facebook, pages that will tell you how to vote, where to vote, get you accurate information about the basics of the election. This move comes as Facebook faces a lot of pressure from Congress and some in the public to do a lot better than 2016, when Russia, as we know, interfered in the election, got a lot of disinformation out there and a lot of domestic players spread false stories, too. KING: OK. So they're trying to do better. But isn't there still a lot of false information on Facebook about voting? INSKEEP: Oh, my goodness, yes. And that was a lot of our discussion. We brought up a number of recent reports. ProPublica revealed that hundreds of thousands of people have seen videos and other information on Facebook providing false information about that very subject that Facebook wants to inform you better on - voting. At one point, they said if they - you go to the top 50 pages, the most popular pages that relate to voting, 22 of them - almost half - have false or misleading information. And there's also the matter of conspiracy theories that influence how people think about politics. Investigations by the Guardian and the Tech Transparency Center (ph) found big spreading this year of QAnon, the conspiracy movement, as well as the boogaloo movement, which calls for a second civil war. I will say that Gleicher insists they're on this. They're even doing what they call red team exercises, where they assign people to pretend to be bad actors, and then Facebook's teams try to catch them. KING: Oh, that's interesting. So is he really confident that Facebook can prevent disinformation in 2020? INSKEEP: That was exactly my question for Nathaniel Gleicher. Let's listen. Do you think that most voters, if they rely on Facebook, will be mostly well-informed? GLEICHER: I think people are going to read on our platform based on what they're looking for and the people that they're talking to. What I can tell you is every single person in the United States is going to have at the very top of their feed and on posts that they read about voting accurate information about how to vote, how the process works and what the experts in state government and elections officials are saying about how the processes function. INSKEEP: I think I hear you saying that you believe everybody is going to have an option to find accurate information, but it's going to be up to them to find it. GLEICHER: Well, we're going to put that accurate information in front of people as many ways as we can. INSKEEP: We should note, Noel, Facebook business model is still that almost anybody can say anything. They profit when there's an intense discussion of something, even if it's false. They are going after some high-profile false statements. They've made some announcements about that over time. But you know, I kept thinking about the war on drugs, where some shipments get caught and some shipments don't. And I guess Facebook's stated goal here is to come out just a little ahead. KING: And I guess we'll see if that's going to be enough. Thanks, Steve. INSKEEP: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KING: Kamala Harris is the first woman of color to run as the vice presidential candidate for a major party. Her parents are immigrants from India and Jamaica. INSKEEP: Yesterday, she and Joe Biden appeared together for the first time as running mates, and Harris noted his comfort with and proximity to Black leaders. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KAMALA HARRIS: Today he takes his place in the ongoing story of America's march toward equality and justice as only - as the only - as the only who has served alongside the first Black president and has chosen the first Black woman as his running mate. INSKEEP: Having noted what is different about her selection, Harris then did something that vice presidential nominees traditionally do. The VP's role is often to attack the other side, and she criticized the Trump campaign. KING: NPR's Juana Summers was watching it all. Good morning, Juana. JUANA SUMMERS, BYLINE: Good morning. KING: What was the case that Kamala Harris made against President Trump yesterday? SUMMERS: Well, Noel, it was a very forceful and specific case against President Trump. She is a former prosecutor. And in echoes of her own presidential campaign, she said she sees the case against the Trump and Pence campaign as open and shut. And then, as the Biden campaign has done for months now, she focused her attention on the pandemic. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HARRIS: This virus has impacted almost every country. But there's a reason it has hit America worse than any other advanced nation. It's because of Trump's failure to take it seriously from the start, his refusal to get testing up and running, his flip-flopping on social distancing and wearing masks, his delusional belief that he knows better than the experts. SUMMERS: We also heard Harris talk about her relationship with Joe Biden, one that was forged out of her close relationship with Beau Biden, the former vice president's son who died of cancer. They served as state attorneys general at the same time. Biden had also said that he had asked Barack Obama to promise that he would be the last person in the room before Obama made a big decision. And Joe Biden said that was the kind of relationship he said he imagines he'll have with Harris. KING: OK. So it's interesting. There's two things here. There's her attack on Trump, and then there's what Kamala Harris represents more broadly. Right? We know that Joe Biden was under pressure to pick a woman of color. Are the people who put him under that pressure happy with her as the pick? SUMMERS: They were. I talked to a lot of those people, and a number of them told me that this was a moment they'd been waiting for their entire life - of course, coming in the middle of this pandemic and this reckoning in this country over a systemic racism and where we're discussing representation more openly than perhaps ever before. One of those people was LaTosha Brown. She's a co-founder of Black Voters Matter. She signed that April open letter along with hundreds of other Black women calling for Biden to put a Black woman on the ticket. LATOSHA BROWN: In this moment, we thought it was critical - that this is the time, this is the moment for a Black woman. I think it's going to show itself to be, we were right. I think it's showing itself already that we are right, that the campaign has taken on a whole nother level of energy right now. SUMMERS: We heard Harris talk yesterday about her childhood, being raised by Jamaican and Indian parents in Oakland and Berkeley during the civil rights movement as well as her education at Howard University, perhaps one of the best well-known historically Black colleges in this country. KING: And yet it's worth noting that there are progressives, especially young people of color, who just are not convinced by her because she spent time as a prosecutor in a criminal justice system that they believe is racist. SUMMERS: Yeah, that's right. This is one of the things that Mythili Sampathkumar brought up to me. She is a freelance journalist and on the board of the South Asian Journalists Association. She said her initial reaction to Harris' selection was one of pride but also a little anxiety. MYTHILI SAMPATHKUMAR: There is a lot of pride in the community from a lot of people. But there are also differences because of her political positions on things like criminal justice reform and Israel, just to name a few. SUMMERS: And since Kamala Harris ended her own presidential campaign, we've seen her go out. She's marched alongside protesters. She's championed efforts to overhaul policing, make lynching a federal crime. And one thing I heard when I was listening to those comments, her first as Joe Biden's running mate, was her standing alongside him and saying affirmatively that Black lives do matter. KING: NPR's Juana Summers. Thanks, Juana. SUMMERS: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KING: All right. So it looks like there might be a kind of showdown in Thailand this weekend. INSKEEP: The standoff is between the military-backed government and student groups who want democratic reforms. The students are calling, also, for reform of the country's wealthy and powerful monarchy. KING: Michael Sullivan is with us now from Chiang Rai, Thailand. Michael, what's been going on there? MICHAEL SULLIVAN, BYLINE: Well, these protests started at the beginning of the year. And then they were gathering steam until COVID struck, and then that put things on hold.

We've been talking with a man who says they can be. Nathaniel Gleicher is Facebook's head of cybersecurity policy, and he has a goal. NATHANIEL GLEICHER: I think I actually want to make the act of trying to tell a lie or misleading people more difficult. INSKEEP: Facebook provides financial support to NPR. We cover it the same as any company, which includes criticism of Facebook. It faces demands for Congressional regulation. It's also under pressure for false statements and conspiracy theories on the platform. Russian disinformation and domestic deception spread on Facebook in the last election. Nathaniel Gleicher spoke with us as the company announced a new effort. Users will now see voting information centers, which provide what the name says. GLEICHER: The voting information centers are going to include information about how to register to vote, how to check your registration status, how to vote by mail, how you request an absentee or a mail-in ballot. There will be election alerts from state election authorities about changes to the voting process. And there'll be facts about voting to help prevent or address any confusion about the process itself. INSKEEP: This all sounds really useful, but are you concerned at all that what you have here is a small boat of accurate information in an entire sea of disinformation? GLEICHER: First, I think it's important to know that this is only one piece of our election protection strategy. We have core teams that are hunting for deception campaigns. When they find them, we announce them publicly and we remove them from the platform. We also have automated systems that help tackle fake accounts and other types of deceptive behaviors and partnerships with fact-checking organizations to ensure that there's accurate information and context on posts. But a piece of the puzzle is giving people accurate information. So it will be one piece, but it will be prominently displayed, and we'll be layering it on top and into News Feed to make sure people can see it as they're engaging with the election. INSKEEP: I want to grant (ph) what you've said. You have made announcements of pages you've taken down, groups that you've banned. And yet, ProPublica in the last few days has published an investigation having to do specifically with false claims about voting, about mail-in voting - 350,000 views for a video on Facebook saying that if you mail in your ballot, Barack Obama is going to burn it - obviously, a false claim. A false claim that you can only vote by mail in California - hundreds of thousands of people saw that false claim. Now, Facebook did delete them, ProPublica says, but only after ProPublica called them out. Why do you think that happened? GLEICHER: So we work with third-party organizations to identify any type of voter suppression or voter interference. A claim that misrepresents how you vote, where you vote or when you vote violates our community standards, and we will take that down. INSKEEP: But in these cases, the posts were up and were seen by hundreds of thousands of people and had to be reported in the media before you found out about them. GLEICHER: I'd like to get to every single one of these posts as fast as possible. Large amounts of this we find proactively and remove ourselves. We also work with state elections officials because often, for this type of thing, they might see it first, particularly if it's localized. And so what I've found is that you don't want to rely on just one tool. INSKEEP: You know, I suppose you had a kind of trial run of this recently when the president of the United States made a false claim that was carried on Facebook - a false claim about mail-in balloting leading to a corrupt election. Of course, millions of people have voted by mail. There's no evidence of that whatsoever. Facebook did add a label with more information about voting, which sounds approximately like what you're talking about, but did not call the claim false. How come? GLEICHER: So we want to make sure that people hear what elected officials are saying and what they think about voting. Quite frankly, I think that information is an important factor in how some people will choose to vote in the fall. And so we want to make sure that information is out there and people can see it, warts and all. INSKEEP: If the president just says something false and nowhere do you say it's false, where's the context for that? GLEICHER: I completely agree. I think accurate context is very important. That's why having that link right there provides as much accurate context as we can provide so that people can see, here's what the experts are saying, here's how the process works. And they can weigh that against what elected officials are saying. INSKEEP: I want to ask about a couple of political movements that are based on false conspiracy theories, one of them being QAnon, which, roughly speaking, is the idea of a deep state of child predators who are attacking the president - no evidence for that whatsoever. But there is a Republican QAnon believer who won a congressional primary in Georgia the other day, and it appears to be a movement that is growing a lot on Facebook. Why would that be? GLEICHER: Enforcing against QAnon is something that we've been doing pretty consistently, actually. Just last week, we removed a large group with QAnon affiliations for violating our content policies. We've also removed networks of accounts for violating our policies against coordinated inauthentic behavior. We have teams that are assessing sort of our policies against QAnon as they currently exist and are exploring additional actions that we can take. INSKEEP: And yet, The Guardian was able to find the other day 170 groups, pages and accounts on Facebook and Instagram with 4. 5 million followers and even adds - this is a quote from The Guardian - \"Facebook's recommendation algorithm has continued to promote QAnon groups to users, and some groups have experienced explosive growth. \" Do you deny that? GLEICHER: This is exactly the type of adversarial behavior we'd expect to see. We consistently see actors on the platform as we put tools and controls in place looking for ways to get around them. INSKEEP: I'm looking for a yes or no there. The question is, are your algorithms actually promoting QAnon sites in spite of your best efforts? GLEICHER: I think I would want to talk about specific instances to weigh in on that. It really depends on the particular site that we're talking about and the post that they're making. INSKEEP: So you're not sure if that's true or not, with 170 different groups cited by The Guardian. GLEICHER: This is a place where I think we have work to do. I think that the boundaries around what constitutes a QAnon site or not are pretty blurry, and that becomes a challenge in all of this. It's why we're looking at this and we're exploring some additional steps that we can take. INSKEEP: There's another conspiracy political movement, the boogaloo movement, which wants a new civil war. The Tech Transparency Project has been studying them, identified 110 new Facebook boogaloo groups created just since June 30, which is when you said you'd crack down. And it was a well-intentioned effort, I'm sure, to crack down, but 110 new groups since then. And the Project says that the boogaloo adherents just avoid using the word boogaloo, and so they seem to escape your search engines. Is it that easy? GLEICHER: We don't rely on any one particular keyword for exactly the reason you said. We've seen these actors constantly change their terms. We knew and expected that sites like this would come back as we removed them. And what I can tell you is we've been taking aggressive action against not just sites discussing boogaloo or pages discussing boogaloo, but pages and groups where we see links between those discussions and intent or efforts to engage in physical activity or push further towards real-world harm. And what that does over time is it drives these actors to spend more and more of their effort evading the controls we're putting in place as opposed to coordinating for the ends that they're seeking. INSKEEP: I'm thinking about the fact that a very large part of the 2020 election is going to play out on your platforms. That seems like a basic reality. And I'd like to know your level of confidence. Are you willing to say with some confidence that most voters who rely on Facebook will be mostly well-informed if they do so? Are you willing to say that? GLEICHER: I think one of the things we've learned is that protecting an election is a whole-of-society challenge. And what I can tell you is that we have teams that have been focused on finding and exposing these types of campaigns for years. And I think that the tactics we saw in 2016 will be much less effective today. INSKEEP: Do you think that most voters, if they rely on Facebook, will be mostly well-informed? GLEICHER: I think people are going to read on our platform based on what they're looking for and the people that they're talking to. What I can tell you is every single person in the United States is going to have at the very top of their feed and on posts that they read about voting accurate information about how to vote, how the process works and what the experts in state government and elections officials are saying about how the processes function.

The order says the app poses a threat to national security, but there's a coalition of users who are trying to intervene. Here's NPR's John Ruwitch. JOHN RUWITCH, BYLINE: Clay Zhu practices corporate and commercial law in the San Francisco Bay Area. Most of his clients are Chinese, and they all use WeChat. CLAY ZHU: So I maintain and develop clients through WeChat all the time. I probably spend two or three hours on WeChat every day. RUWITCH: It's also how he communicates with his sister, an 85-year-old mother back in China's Hunan province. (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE RINGING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Non-English language spoken). ZHU: (Non-English language spoken). RUWITCH: When Trump issued the executive order, Zhu and other lawyers who also serve the Chinese-speaking community were alarmed. They discussed it - in a WeChat group, naturally - and decided to fight it in court. So they set up a nonprofit called the U. S. WeChat Users Alliance. Ying Cao is one of the lawyers from the WeChat group. She says they plan to file a suit in the coming days. The group, she says, has no connection to the Chinese government or Tencent, the Chinese company that owns WeChat. YING CAO: We are not interested in the politics behind this. But when the government tries to resolve a problem, they should try to minimize the harm. RUWITCH: The executive order is the latest in a string of measures the Trump administration has taken against China in recent weeks. It prohibits, quote, \"transactions\" with WeChat and Tencent. The term is open to some interpretation, but legal experts expect that app stores, at the very least, will have to remove WeChat. Angus Ni is a lawyer in Seattle. ANGUS NI: The executive arm is well within its rights to determine that something is or is not a threat to American national security. But its reasoning, especially when its actions have such a negative impact on such a racially kind of based minority needs to be well-justified and well-supported. RUWITCH: China's so-called great firewall blocks many Western communication and social media apps, making WeChat indispensable. But WeChat censors sensitive messages, and like every other app in China, it would be required to hand over information should the government ask. RON DEIBERT: There are definitely major security risks to people using those technologies, and we need to address that. I just wish it was done differently. RUWITCH: Ron Deibert is director of the Citizen Lab, an Internet watchdog at the University of Toronto. DEIBERT: What the Trump administration did is - the way I think of it - kind of like a nuclear option. RUWITCH: Fighting it in court will be tough, though. Bobby Chesney is a national security law expert at The University of Texas. BOBBY CHESNEY: Oh, it's a hugely uphill battle. RUWITCH: He says it'll be hard to win a case arguing that the executive order curtails free speech, came without due process or amounts to the government taking away property or livelihood. The same holds for a case that says the government hasn't supplied enough evidence of the risks that WeChat poses. CHESNEY: A judge isn't ultimiately going to save them, but maybe that somehow helps them in a different court. RUWITCH: Bringing a suit raises the profile of the issue and just might influence how the government interprets the word transaction and ultimately enforces the order. (SOUNDBITE OF KITCHEN AMBIENCE)RUWITCH: If the legal challenge doesn't pan out, businesses like Wang Xing's restaurant chain Easterly will have to make major adjustments. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: I called in about combination lo mein. . . RUWITCH: The Hunan-style eatery offers group deals, takes orders and stays in touch with thousands of customers in the Bay Area through WeChat. With no dining-in because of the pandemic, Wang says Easterly is even more reliant on WeChat. WANG XING: (Speaking Mandarin). RUWITCH: For now, he says, they are scraping by. Without WeChat, he fears Easterly will lose business and its connection to its customers. John Ruwitch, NPR News, Santa Clara, Calif.

Federal prosecutors say the former executive concealed the breach from authorities and paid the hackers $100,000 to cover it up. NPR's tech correspondent Shannon Bond joins us now with more. Hey, Shannon. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa. CHANG: Hey. We should note first that Uber is a financial supporter of NPR. So, Shannon, tell us the story behind these charges. BOND: Right. So Joe Sullivan was Uber's head of security. He was the person in charge of making sure that hackers couldn't get inside Uber's systems or steal sensitive personal data on drivers and customers. But back in 2016 two hackers did just that. They got into a database. They took driver's license numbers of some 600,000 drivers, also email addresses and phone numbers of 57 million people. David Anderson, the U. S. attorney here in northern California, brought these charges. And he says instead of reporting this breach to the authorities, Sullivan hid it. Here's what he told me. DAVID ANDERSON: Sullivan is being charged with a corporate cover-up, and Sullivan is being charged with the payment of hush money to conceal something that should have been revealed. BOND: Now, a spokesman for Sullivan says there's no merit to these charges. He says the hackers got identified because of Sullivan's efforts, and it was up to Uber's legal department to disclose this breach. But if convicted, Sullivan faces up to eight years in prison and fines. CHANG: What do prosecutors mean by hush money? BOND: Well, Uber really tried to keep this whole thing under wraps. Prosecutors allege Sullivan arranged for Uber to pay the hackers this hundred thousand dollars and signed nondisclosure agreements that said falsely that the hackers never stole any data. And they also say that Uber's CEO at the time, co-founder Travis Kalanick, knew about the breach. He knew about the plan to pay off the hackers. To be clear, Kalanick has not been charged. He declined to comment. But, you know, this whole situation is really reminiscent of these hard-charging, boundary-pushing behaviors that got Uber in trouble again and again under Kalanick's leadership. CHANG: Right. Right. Well, I mean, Uber did eventually reveal the hack here, right? BOND: That's right. After Kalanick was pushed out, the breach did come to light. Uber's new CEO disclosed it to authorities. He apologized. He fired Sullivan, but that was a year after Sullivan first learned about this breach. And prosecutors say that that delay had serious consequences. The hackers were able to go on and target other companies. They carried out another big breach at LinkedIn. The U. S. attorney charged two men with the hack. They pleaded guilty to criminal charges last year, and Uber says it's cooperating with the investigation. CHANG: And while we're at it, we should also point out that Uber is in the news right now for another reason. Tell us about what's going on here in California real quick. BOND: That's right. Uber and rival Lyft had been threatening to suspend service in California at midnight tonight. That's because last week a judge ordered them to reclassify their drivers as employees instead of independent contractors to comply with a new state labor law. The companies say they can't just flip a switch. But this afternoon they got a reprieve. An appeals court has given them more time to figure this out. They have until early September to come up with plans for how they would comply with this law if they end up losing in court. CHANG: That is NPR's Shannon Bond. Thank you, Shannon. BOND: Thanks.

You can understand how this might happen. You know that the house is near the woods or near the coast. But you don't quite realize the risk, don't quite realize the extent of the danger. One major real estate site is now showing a home's flood risk along with photos of the kitchen and living room so that people will know. This is one way that climate change has become a more direct part of home-buying, a long-term decision that a lot of people make. Our reporting from NPR's climate team starts with NPR's Rebecca Hersher. REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: It's obvious to a lot of Americans that climate change means more flooding. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: More than 1,000 homes and businesses are flooded in the Jackson, Miss. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: Southern Louisiana. More than 60,000 homes have been damaged. . . UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: Northwest of Omaha is still dealing with the mess. . . UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #4: More than 400 homeowners. . . HERSHER: But even though government flood maps have been around since the '70s, there was no mention of flooding on real estate websites until today. Leslie Jordan is a vice president of the website Realtor. com, which lists more than 110 million homes. LESLIE JORDAN: Flooding is the most common and costly natural disaster in the U. S. HERSHER: So Realtor. com has added flood information to every listing. Jordan says that's thanks in part to a new, privately funded flood information project called Flood Factor. Matt Eby is one of the co-founders of Flood Factor, which rates houses on a scale from 1 to 10. MATT EBY: So if it's very likely in a very deep flood, you'll get a flood factor of 10 for that property. If it's very unlikely, then it'll be a flood factor of 1. HERSHER: The ratings take into account climate change, particularly sea level rise and more extreme rain. Eby says that kind of info has actually been out there for years. It's just that regular people haven't had access to it. EBY: A democratization of this information is the way that we like to think about it, because there are people who already have this information. And they're already acting on it. HERSHER: People like mortgage and insurance companies and large real estate developers, some of which have fought against public flood disclosure laws. So are other real estate sites also going to add this flood information? Can you say? EBY: We are hopeful and happy to engage in those conversations with folks. HERSHER: And that less-than-specific answer made my colleague on NPR's climate team, Lauren Sommer, wonder, what is going on with the other real estate websites. So she called them. LAUREN SOMMER, BYLINE: First up, I asked Zillow if they're thinking about publishing flood risk. JEFF TUCKER: There are a number of challenges with that. And it's something that I think, sooner or later, would be a great feature to include. SOMMER: Jeff Tucker is an economist at Zillow who has studied how the homes they help sell are at risk from climate change. TUCKER: Hundreds of billions of dollars, yeah, just tremendous amount of real estate at risk primarily from coastal flooding, for instance. SOMMER: Tucker says the company has had internal discussions about including flood risk. But they expect pushback from some users. TUCKER: The current homeowners may be very unhappy to to have that kind of information surface if they're interested in selling their home. SOMMER: I heard the same thing from Taylor Marr, lead economist at Redfin. TAYLOR MARR: Could this actually reduce the value of this existing homeowner and, essentially, take away a lot of their net worth? SOMMER: Marr says, on the buyer side, Redfin surveys show that three-quarters of them want to know about natural disasters before making an offer. But he says that info can't crowd out other info on the website. MARR: If we made the whole front page just about flood risk, they might not be as easily able to navigate how long the commute is, for example. SOMMER: Marr says they're looking at testing including flood risk. But there are no firm plans yet. Zillow and the other site it owns, Trulia, also have no plans to publish flood risk or info about any other climate-related disasters. Lauren Sommer, NPR News.

And talks are ongoing. Companies including Microsoft and software maker Oracle are discussing a possible acquisition. But now, TikTok's chief executive, Kevin Mayer, says he is quitting. In a letter to employees reviewed by NPR, Mayer said, quote, \"the political environment has sharply changed. \" He says he's thought about what the next phase of TikTok is going to look like, and it's not going to include him. He didn't say why beyond citing upcoming structural changes to the company. Back in May, TikTok's U.

The Trump administration and TikTok are now locked in a legal battle over whether the White House can outright ban the app in the U.

NPR's Bobby Allyn spoke to one TikTok employee about what it's like to be working at the hit video-sharing app while it's facing an existential crisis. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Patrick Ryan is sitting on a couch in the garage of his house in California's San Mateo County. He's an intense, wiry guy wearing aviator-style glasses and cowboy boots. Scrolling through his laptop, he sees message after message from his colleagues at TikTok. PATRICK RYAN: Sometimes, it's anxiety. Sometimes, it's anger. Sometimes, it's disappointment. Sometimes, it's rage, you know. It's a mixture of things, and it brings up all of these emotions. ALLYN: Yes, it's an emotional experience when the president of the United States is trying to put your company out of business. Ryan is a technical manager at TikTok. He's also a lawyer. He dealt with his anger about Trump's action by suing the administration in federal court over Trump's August 6 executive order. RYAN: It's going to be prohibited for our company and for anybody to transfer money to us or for us to make any payment to any transaction of any kind for any person. And so we want to stop that, but we also want to make sure that we can continue to get paid. ALLYN: Ryan remembers the Friday night in late July when President Trump declared aboard Air Force One that he was going to ban TikTok. Fittingly enough, Ryan first found out about it from his two daughters, who are 15 and 13. They saw it on TikTok. Since then, TikTok has filed a lawsuit on behalf of the company, but Ryan is forging his own path. He's raising money for the suit online. TikTok isn't officially part of his legal battle, but the company did not discourage him. RYAN: I hear from employees all the time on a one-to-one basis in terms of what their concerns are and their fears in many ways. The questions are all very similar about, you know, what does this mean? Does this really mean that I'm going to lose my job? ALLYN: It could, but Trump's crackdown could also just mean TikTok's 1,500 hundred employees will soon get a new corporate owner, maybe even Microsoft and Walmart, which have put in a joint bid. That would solve the problems with the TikTok the administration cites. They say having a Beijing parent company leaves Americans' data susceptible to Chinese authorities. Experts say under Chinese law, companies must comply with government requests. But Ryan, who oversees TikTok's servers, says he knows firsthand that the data of Americans stays in the U. S. RYAN: I spend a lot of time, you know, making sure that that network is safe and understanding what's going on. And one of the areas that I deal with are vulnerabilities and other areas. And so we look very closely at the data flows of the network. I can say with extreme confidence that there is no shadow network. ALLYN: Ryan thinks TikTok is being unfairly singled out because its top executives are in China. He says while companies like Google, Apple and Microsoft make products that are banned in China, all of the companies have a significant presence there. RYAN: Nobody's accusing the management in Apple China of controlling Apple USA, so I don't know why that's the case here. ALLYN: In the midst of talks about TikTok's future, the company's U. S. -based top executive, Kevin Mayer, quit. Ryan says that was a blow to the company, but it won't stop his quest to fight for TikTok employees. Bobby Allyn, NPR News. San Francisco.

Fall recruitment is often a highlight of the new school year. So how are these groups, which are built on socialization, going to adapt to the COVID-19 era? Many of them are going virtual. Here's NPR's Ashley Westerman. ASHLEY WESTERMAN, BYLINE: A typical sorority recruitment sounds like, well, probably what you'd imagine. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: (Chanting) We are Delta Gamma - bronze, pink and blue. WESTERMAN: This is a recruitment video produced by Delta Gamma sorority at the University of Alabama. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: (Chanting) . . . O-K (ph). WESTERMAN: The cheers, the house tours, the rapid-fire meet-and-greets - they're all pretty standard recruitment procedures for large social sororities. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: (Chanting) Welcome to DG house. Come on in. Hi. WESTERMAN: But this year, because of the pandemic, recruitment is more likely to sound like this. (SOUNDBITE OF RINGING)TAYLOR VIBBERT: Hello. Yes, I can hear you. Nice to meet you, too. WESTERMAN: Taylor Vibbert is a freshman at Western Kentucky University. When we spoke some weeks ago, she said she always planned to join a sorority, and she'd recently learned recruitment this semester was going to be mostly virtual. VIBBERT: That was a bummer. Honestly, if I would've known, I probably wouldn't have signed up. WESTERMAN: She was concerned her personality might not come across virtually. VIBBERT: I'm probably way more outgoing in person than I am on the computer. But I don't - we'll see how it goes (laughter). WESTERMAN: Vibbert is one of tens of thousands of students who will rush a fraternity or sorority this school year, and industry consultant Gentry McCreary says there's a lot at stake for Greek organizations. GENTRY MCCREARY: If less people are joining, there are less dues coming in. That has an impact on the bottom line. That has an impact in terms of staffing and support. So there's a direct correlation between the number of students who join and then the services that these organizations are able to provide. WESTERMAN: He says some chapters are going to have to pivot and provide a more meaningful experience beyond the parties. MCCREARY: If they don't, there's no way that those groups will be able to survive because we're looking at at least a year of none of the large traditional social gatherings that we're accustomed to. WESTERMAN: McCreary says the number of students going Greek has plateaued the last few years. And while recruitment stats for this fall won't be out for months, he says he's spoken to several schools that are reporting record-breaking numbers of students signing up. That's despite not just a pandemic but also rising membership costs, reports of structural racism within the predominantly white social fraternities and sororities and a slew of recent high-profile hazing incidents - issues, McCreary says, these organizations are working hard to remedy. ASHLEE DUNN: If there were any time to join a sorority, now is the most important time. WESTERMAN: Ashlee Dunn is the chapter president of Alpha Omicron Pi at Middle Tennessee State University. Here's her pitch to potential new members. DUNN: A sisterhood is going to keep you in check and keep you motivated. You can text your sister or have a FaceTime. It's the little things that are going to keep you going during such separation. WESTERMAN: The chapter has planned a semester of mostly virtual and some in-person gatherings, but all those activities hinge on MTSU's reopening plans, and colleges across the country are already changing plans based on what the coronavirus is doing. Still, not every Greek organization is in uncharted territory. VALERIE HOLLINGSWORTH BAKER: We have a lot of virtual programs that are going on, and the sisterhood, it's working for them. WESTERMAN: Valerie Hollingsworth Baker is the president of the Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta. She says her organization is well-equipped for this moment. They've worked for years to make more of their operations virtual. HOLLINGSWORTH BAKER: When you do have this virtual type of style of trying to reach out and touch the masses, you can do so in smaller groups and one-on-ones and really encourage and keep everyone going. WESTERMAN: Greek organizations based on race, culture and identity tend to recruit much more directly, something the bigger social chapters might have to get used to. VIBBERT: Not meeting people in person and really took away any, like, jitters. WESTERMAN: Taylor Vibbert completed recruitment in mid-August and says the three days of virtual meetings or parties weren't all that bad. VIBBERT: Each party you'd go to, each sorority would kind of have a little overview, and then they'd send you into a breakout room over Zoom, where you kind of just had, like, a one-on-one conversation with one of the girls in the chapter. WESTERMAN: In the end, Vibbert pledged Alpha Xi Delta and says she's actually really excited now about the semester ahead. And her one piece of advice for others getting ready to rush a fraternity or sorority in the middle of a pandemic? VIBBERT: Just breathe. You just have to talk and be yourself. WESTERMAN: At least some things haven't changed this year. Ashley Westerman, NPR News.

Facebook has confirmed that it has removed accounts linked to Russian state actors who were trying to spread false stories. Those stories were aimed at influencing the outcome of the November vote. NPR's tech reporter Bobby Allyn is covering this and joins us now. Good morning, Bobby. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Hey, Rachel. MARTIN: So tell us more. What exactly did Facebook uncover? ALLYN: So this all started with a tip from the FBI. Federal authorities reached out to Facebook and said, hey, we found this site, peacedata. net, and it says it's an international news site, but if you look very closely, it sure does look like a Russian propaganda tool. So Facebook looked into it and, indeed, discovered that it was linked to Russian operatives, and it was sharing hundreds of bogus news articles about everything from racial injustice to the Democratic campaign of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. I talked to Ben Nimmo of research firm Graphika. They collaborated with Facebook on looking into this website. And Nimmo told me that the Russian operatives who were running it were posting articles on Facebook to groups liked by progressives. BEN NIMMO: It was very much a strongly left-leaning constituency that they were aiming at. But in among there, there were indeed pieces which were saying, well, Biden and Harris, they're much too far to the right. MARTIN: So they were trying to make progressives less likely to be supportive of the Biden-Harris ticket. How does that compare, Bobby, to what happened four years ago? ALLYN: Researchers say, you know, this operation both echoes the 2016 playbook and introduces some new elements. So four years ago, Russian troll farms pushed false stories to suppress the progressive and minority vote to try to hurt Hillary Clinton. We're seeing that tactic again. It's a similar goal. What's new here is they duped Americans into helping them seem more credible. They posted writing gigs on hiring boards in the U. S. telling, you know, young and inexperienced journalists that, hey, if you want to make some extra money, you could come write for peacedata. net. Here's Nathaniel Gleicher. He heads cybersecurity policy at Facebook. NATHANIEL GLEICHER: And they used that to reach out to unwitting freelancers to essentially trick them into writing for this fake organization and writing on topics that the Russian actors wanted them to write on. ALLYN: The thing is, Rachel, it didn't quite work. Facebook and Twitter both caught this very early on, and these pages never really gathered the reach that the Russian operatives had hoped. So the tech companies are saying, look - this is a success story. MARTIN: Can they really bask in the success of this, though? I mean, there's all kinds of other disinformation on Facebook. ALLYN: Yeah, that's right. I mean, it was identified and whacked before it reached millions of people. That is a good thing, right? But we know that Facebook has trouble controlling its platform, frankly. Whether it's violent militia groups that go there to organize or QAnon conspiracy theories, there's loads of troubling and, frankly, sometimes dangerous content on the platform. And sometimes that stuff, it slips through the cracks. MARTIN: So they have been paying attention to this, though. They've talked a lot about their efforts to better moderate the content on their platform. Is any of that working? ALLYN: You know, it's a constant game of cat and mouse. In 2016, the Russian meddling was so impactful because the Russian troll farms were able to build audiences over time, over many, many, many months. Facebook's Gleicher says Russians have some new tricks up their sleeve, but so too does Facebook. GLEICHER: Russian actors trying harder and harder to hide who they are and being more and more deceptive to conceal their operations. ALLYN: Yeah, so Facebook only started this investigation after the FBI told them about it. And before then, these pages were sharing on Facebook for three months, which in Facebook time is a very, very long time. MARTIN: NPR's Bobby Allyn. Thank you so much for your reporting on this. We appreciate it. ALLYN: Thanks, Rachel. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:   With just weeks left until the election, more evidence is coming out about how Russia is again interfering.

MARTIN: So they were trying to make progressives less likely to be supportive of the Biden-Harris ticket. How does that compare, Bobby, to what happened four years ago? ALLYN: Researchers say, you know, this operation both echoes the 2016 playbook and introduces some new elements. So four years ago, Russian troll farms pushed false stories to suppress the progressive and minority vote to try to hurt Hillary Clinton. We're seeing that tactic again. It's a similar goal. What's new here is they duped Americans into helping them seem more credible. They posted writing gigs on hiring boards in the U. S. telling, you know, young and inexperienced journalists that, hey, if you want to make some extra money, you could come write for peacedata. net. Here's Nathaniel Gleicher. He heads cybersecurity policy at Facebook. NATHANIEL GLEICHER: And they used that to reach out to unwitting freelancers to essentially trick them into writing for this fake organization and writing on topics that the Russian actors wanted them to write on. ALLYN: The thing is, Rachel, it didn't quite work. Facebook and Twitter both caught this very early on, and these pages never really gathered the reach that the Russian operatives had hoped. So the tech companies are saying, look - this is a success story. MARTIN: Can they really bask in the success of this, though? I mean, there's all kinds of other disinformation on Facebook. ALLYN: Yeah, that's right. I mean, it was identified and whacked before it reached millions of people. That is a good thing, right? But we know that Facebook has trouble controlling its platform, frankly. Whether it's violent militia groups that go there to organize or QAnon conspiracy theories, there's loads of troubling and, frankly, sometimes dangerous content on the platform. And sometimes that stuff, it slips through the cracks. MARTIN: So they have been paying attention to this, though. They've talked a lot about their efforts to better moderate the content on their platform. Is any of that working? ALLYN: You know, it's a constant game of cat and mouse. In 2016, the Russian meddling was so impactful because the Russian troll farms were able to build audiences over time, over many, many, many months. Facebook's Gleicher says Russians have some new tricks up their sleeve, but so too does Facebook. GLEICHER: Russian actors trying harder and harder to hide who they are and being more and more deceptive to conceal their operations. ALLYN: Yeah, so Facebook only started this investigation after the FBI told them about it. And before then, these pages were sharing on Facebook for three months, which in Facebook time is a very, very long time. MARTIN: NPR's Bobby Allyn. Thank you so much for your reporting on this. We appreciate it. ALLYN: Thanks, Rachel.", "section": "Technology", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

S. may have an unintended consequence. Four thousand American teachers might lose their jobs. As NPR's Bobby Allyn reports, language instructors working for a service called GOGOKID say they're being unfairly targeted. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Two years ago, Kristie Hunter started teaching kids in China how to speak English. The former elementary school teacher did this from her home in South Carolina through an online program called GOGOKID. It's owned by TikTok parent company ByteDance. KRISTIE HUNTER: We used to think it was pretty cool. You know, we worked for ByteDance. They're this huge tech company. They own TikTok. Like, that's super cool, right? ALLYN: But Trump's executive order aimed at ByteDance turned that cool factor into something else - dread. The president's order bans transactions between U. S. citizens and all of Beijing-based ByteDance's subsidiaries. HUNTER: Then I got to the part where it said, you know, all transactions between people. I was like, that's talking about me. Like, that's me. ALLYN: The maximum possible penalties for violating Trump's order are stiff - a $300,000 fine or criminal prosecution. HUNTER: I could be put in jail for teaching a 5-year-old how to say hello across the computer. ALLYN: Big fines and jail time are extremely unlikely for GOGOKID teachers, but the order is written very broadly. That's according to Justice Department lawyer Brian Fleming who used to enforce sanctions for a living. BRIAN FLEMING: A lot of that may have to do with the leverage that the U. S. government is trying to apply to ByteDance in terms of forcing the divestiture of TikTok and sort of having as broad an order as possible kind of hanging over their head. LINDSEY JACOBS: We're collateral damage. And it's frustrating to see this continued battle going on around us and no one knows that we exist. ALLYN: That's GOGOKID instructor Lindsey Jacobs, who lives in Oklahoma. She uses the income to pay for her kid's swimming club and occupational therapy for another son who has special needs. JACOBS: If I don't have that income, how does my younger son have therapy? ALLYN: A spokeswoman for GOGOKID would not say whether they plan to keep operating after September 20. That's when the order takes effect. Kristie Hunter, the teacher in South Carolina, says the pandemic means there is more competition than ever among teachers looking for remote work. She's been discussing Trump's crackdown with dozens of other GOGOKID teachers. For some, this is their primary source of income. HUNTER: We've got families that could potentially lose their homes and lose their savings because of this just broad stroke of the pen for this, quote, \"national security risk\" (laughter).

Yes, 70,000 people gather for whimsical art and music in the Nevada desert - but also body paint and bartering and communal living. It is not the kind of thing that's easy to recreate virtually, but the pandemic has forced organizers to try. NPR's Elizabeth Blair has the story. ELIZABETH BLAIR, BYLINE: At Burning Man, thousands of volunteers usually work together to help artists build enormous sculptures out of glass, metal, wood. The chaos and creativity of building the festival's temple in 2018 was captured in a recent documentary. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Go, climbers. Go. Go. This one looks good here. BLAIR: The Burning Man Temple is typically a place spacious enough for people to walk into and reflect or grieve. This year, you can sort of do that with a mobile device, desktop or virtual reality headset. In a live webinar, Burning Man Associate Director Katie Hazard invited viewers to imagine they were entering the temple. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KATIE HAZARD: And we'll walk forward metaphorically together, all of us here on the call, and see this picture, this gate in front of you. And together, let's all move through that gate together. BLAIR: Burners are true believers in participation. This year's theme is Multiverse. Different teams have created 2D and 3D virtual experiences. Turn on your webcam, and you can attend an art class or join a virtual group hug or go to a party. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ED COOKE: Welcome, everybody. And thank you so much for coming along to the SparkleVerse. BLAIR: Ed Cooke and a team created the SparkleVerse. He says, to recreate the desert experience, people have set up tents in their living rooms and dressed up in costumes. Radical self-expression is one of Burning Man's 10 Principles. COOKE: Getting up and dancing in front of your screen, bothering to put on a costume, jumping around - these things are extraordinarily powerful for kind of taking you into new realms of experience. BLAIR: Cooke admits, online he doesn't experience the sense of awe he gets in the desert. But he's convinced you can create the kind of joyful communal experience he's had there. Other burners are having none of it. DOUGLAS WOLK: It's not the same thing. BLAIR: Douglas Wolk has been going to Burning Man for 20 years. He says he keeps going back because of the principles, like no advertising and being off the grid. WOLK: What's so special about Burning Man for me is that it's really immediate, and it's not like anything else. All kinds of people come and meet up there in this bizarre, difficult, sometimes frustrating environment. And they're pretty much all there to help each other. It's really not the same thing to be sitting in front of your computer. JENNIFER LEWIN: I think the Multiverse is a very interesting experiment. BLAIR: Artist Jennifer Lewin has mixed feelings about this year's virtual festival. Burning Man is where she goes to test the limits of her work - enormous, interactive public sculptures that need to survive all kinds of weather and lots of people playing on them. LEWIN: If a sculpture can survive at Burning Man, it can survive everywhere. BLAIR: Computer drawings of her work Cosmos are in one of the multiverses. The culmination of the festival is the burning of the giant sculpture of the Burning Man. This year, they're streaming videos of people doing burns in their backyards or even just lighting candles.

MATT NOWLING: We ran into people's dorms, knocked their doors and got them registered to vote. Sometimes got kicked out of dorms. But. . . (laughter). BOND: Nowling is a senior at Denison University outside Columbus, Ohio, and interim president of College Democrats of America. Like many students who have returned to campus under restrictions to keep the virus from spreading, Nowling is finding this year challenging. NOWLING: All the different events that we would have in person simply can't happen, and I miss that a lot. BOND: Doing activism during a pandemic is hard, says Ben Rajadurai, executive director of the College Republican National Committee. BEN RAJADURAI: We are trained, like, knock doors, not keyboards, right? And then overnight, it's like, no, no, no, knock keyboards. You quite literally cannot knock doors right now.

Members are swapping political memes on messaging apps like GroupMe. Claire Grissum is president of College Republicans at the University of Missouri.

A new documentary called \"Feels Good Man\" traces Pepe's symbolic path from lovable loser to hate figure to icon for democracy. NPR's Andrew Limbong reports. ANDREW LIMBONG, BYLINE: Matt Furie, cartoonist and creator of Pepe the Frog, has a tentativeness to his voice. You can hear when he talks in the documentary about the inspiration for his most popular comic. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"FEELS GOOD MAN\")MATT FURIE: I remember when I was in second grade and I went to the bathroom alongside my cousin Davey (ph). LIMBONG: The cartoon shows Pepe urinating with his pants down to his ankles - something his cousin Davey did, too. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"FEELS GOOD MAN\")FURIE: It seems like it would feel really good, so I wanted to make a comic about that. LIMBONG: Furie gave Pepe a punchline that would become a catchphrase. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"FEELS GOOD MAN\")FURIE: Feels good, man. LIMBONG: By 2008, the Internet was still in relatively early stages of sharing memes online, a harbinger for how we communicate en masse now. On sites like 4chan, users were altering Pepe's feels good man vibes to reflect their feelings - feels bad, man; feels sad; feels angry. Arthur Jones directed the documentary. ARTHUR JONES: What we really wanted to do was tell the emotional story of the Internet. He's really an avatar for people who are anonymous online. LIMBONG: Then Pepe's popularity started reaching into mainstream culture. This bothered 4chan users. In the documentary, one named Mills characterized the wave of normies (ph) coming over to their turf like this. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"FEELS GOOD MAN\")MILLS: They started making, like, a migration over to 4chan. Young women in particular downloaded Pepe images, using them for their own likes. LIMBONG: To fend them off, Mills and his cohorts started making more reactionary, edgier Pepes glorifying racism, sexism, anti-Semitism. Director Arthur Jones says this coincided with Donald Trump's campaign for president. JONES: Pepe became weaponized in a very, like, conscious way in 2016. You know, people who are white supremacist did see the popularity of Pepe, and then they decided to pick him up as a symbol. LIMBONG: It got so bad that the Anti-Defamation League put Pepe on a list of hate symbols. Reporters started asking Matt Furie, what's it like to have made a hate symbol? And over and over again, he said it was just a phase, that it'll go away on its own. Looking back on it now, Furie tells me that the moment concerned him as an artist. FURIE: You know, you think about what you're putting out there into the world and what is going to outlast you. LIMBONG: And he didn't want it to be this. Furie naively tried getting his cartoonist friends to flood the internet with positive Pepe memes. Then he tried to wash his hands of the whole thing, killing Pepe in a comic. Neither stopped the glut of offensive Pepes. Director Arthur Jones again. JONES: I think it's kind of easy for people to maybe criticize those things, but the reality was those were the tools that he had as an artist. LIMBONG: Then a couple of copyright lawyers came to Furie's rescue. Through lawsuits and takedown notices, Furie started to get back some control over his work until it happened again. But this time, pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong were using Pepe as an icon for their fight, seemingly unaware of Pepe's baggage in the U. S. GIORGIO ANGELINI: It's all been through the power of Matt's artwork that people just connected to the emotionality of Pepe as a character. LIMBONG: Giorgio Angelini produced the documentary, and he says something about Pepe, with his big eyes and dumb grin, taps into a feeling of discontent that's universal. ANGELINI: I think that's really the story that we would like Pepe to carry on. LIMBONG: As for Furie, he's gone through cycles with his creation. He's been tired of Pepe, defensive of Pepe, fed up with Pepe. And as an artist, he's moved on from the frog. But when I talked to him on Zoom, there was a Pepe plushie hanging just over his shoulder.

(SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"FEELS GOOD MAN\") MATT FURIE: I remember when I was in second grade and I went to the bathroom alongside my cousin Davey (ph). LIMBONG: The cartoon shows Pepe urinating with his pants down to his ankles - something his cousin Davey did, too. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"FEELS GOOD MAN\") FURIE: It seems like it would feel really good, so I wanted to make a comic about that. LIMBONG: Furie gave Pepe a punchline that would become a catchphrase. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"FEELS GOOD MAN\") FURIE: Feels good, man. LIMBONG: By 2008, the Internet was still in relatively early stages of sharing memes online, a harbinger for how we communicate en masse now. On sites like 4chan, users were altering Pepe's feels good man vibes to reflect their feelings - feels bad, man; feels sad; feels angry. Arthur Jones directed the documentary. ARTHUR JONES: What we really wanted to do was tell the emotional story of the Internet. He's really an avatar for people who are anonymous online. LIMBONG: Then Pepe's popularity started reaching into mainstream culture. This bothered 4chan users. In the documentary, one named Mills characterized the wave of normies (ph) coming over to their turf like this. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"FEELS GOOD MAN\") MILLS: They started making, like, a migration over to 4chan. Young women in particular downloaded Pepe images, using them for their own likes. LIMBONG: To fend them off, Mills and his cohorts started making more reactionary, edgier Pepes glorifying racism, sexism, anti-Semitism. Director Arthur Jones says this coincided with Donald Trump's campaign for president. JONES: Pepe became weaponized in a very, like, conscious way in 2016. You know, people who are white supremacist did see the popularity of Pepe, and then they decided to pick him up as a symbol. LIMBONG: It got so bad that the Anti-Defamation League put Pepe on a list of hate symbols. Reporters started asking Matt Furie, what's it like to have made a hate symbol? And over and over again, he said it was just a phase, that it'll go away on its own. Looking back on it now, Furie tells me that the moment concerned him as an artist. FURIE: You know, you think about what you're putting out there into the world and what is going to outlast you. LIMBONG: And he didn't want it to be this. Furie naively tried getting his cartoonist friends to flood the internet with positive Pepe memes. Then he tried to wash his hands of the whole thing, killing Pepe in a comic. Neither stopped the glut of offensive Pepes. Director Arthur Jones again. JONES: I think it's kind of easy for people to maybe criticize those things, but the reality was those were the tools that he had as an artist. LIMBONG: Then a couple of copyright lawyers came to Furie's rescue. Through lawsuits and takedown notices, Furie started to get back some control over his work until it happened again. But this time, pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong were using Pepe as an icon for their fight, seemingly unaware of Pepe's baggage in the U. S. GIORGIO ANGELINI: It's all been through the power of Matt's artwork that people just connected to the emotionality of Pepe as a character. LIMBONG: Giorgio Angelini produced the documentary, and he says something about Pepe, with his big eyes and dumb grin, taps into a feeling of discontent that's universal. ANGELINI: I think that's really the story that we would like Pepe to carry on. LIMBONG: As for Furie, he's gone through cycles with his creation. He's been tired of Pepe, defensive of Pepe, fed up with Pepe. And as an artist, he's moved on from the frog. But when I talked to him on Zoom, there was a Pepe plushie hanging just over his shoulder.

That's a lot of thumbs on a lot of screens and a lot of eyes on the receiving end. As NPR's Danny Hensel reports, many of those eyes squint at punctuation and text messages. DANNY HENSEL, BYLINE: Katherine Rooks remembers the day her grammatical world came crashing down. It began when she sent a simple text to her son. KATHERINE ROOKS: And I could tell from his response that he was agitated all of a sudden. And when he came home, he said, what? What did you mean by this? And I said, well, I meant, you know, see you later or something. And he said, but you ended with a period. I thought you were really angry. HENSEL: But she was not angry. ROOKS: No. That's just, you know, how we end a sentence. HENSEL: Maybe if you're writing a book, linguist Gretchen McCulloch told NPR, but not in something as informal as a text. GRETCHEN MCCULLOCH: In an informal context, you don't need the period anymore to distinguish between one sentence or one phrase and the next because you're just going to hit send in a chat context. You can just send the message. HENSEL: So the period has lost its meaning in text messages. But McCulloch says it has a new purpose, to express seriousness. And that's OK in some situations. MCCULLOCH: But the problem is if you say OK, sounds good, and you add that note of seriousness, now you've got positive words and serious punctuation. And the clash between them is what creates that sense of passive aggression. CELIA KLIN: Texting in many ways is more like a spoken conversation that it is like anything else. HENSEL: Celia Klin teaches psychology at Binghamton University. KLIN: But with spoken conversations, a lot of the meaning that we convey is not with the words, right? It's from facial expressions, tone of voice. But we're missing all of that when we're texting. So what we have done is found ways to insert that kind of emotional interpersonal information into texting using what we have. And what we have is things like periods. HENSEL: Klin conducted a study in 2015 that asked undergraduates to look at a text message exchange where an innocent question received a one-word response, yep. Some saw the message with a period, some without. KLIN: And we found consistently through many experiments that yep with a period resulted in responses that were more negative. So people thought yep with a period was less friendly, less sincere. HENSEL: Most of the young texters I spoke to agreed. JUAN ABENANTE RINCON: I actually really don't like getting text messages that end in periods because it always feels so harsh and passive aggressive. Like, are you mad? What's going on? Like, did I do something wrong? EMMY KUPERSCHMID: It feels very much like suddenly someone's a teacher or a parent. I feel like I'm being scolded a little bit. EMMA GOMETZ: If it's like, OK, period, that's, like, I don't want to talk to you anymore (laughter). KALINA NEWMAN: It's in the same vein of somebody saying we need to talk and then not saying what they want to talk about. It's very easy to read into. HENSEL: That was Juan Abenante Rincon, Emmy Kuperschmid, Emma Gometz and Kalina Newman. ISABELLE KRAVIS: Personally, I'm a big fan of proper grammar. HENSEL: Isabelle Kravis, though, is willing to reserve judgment. KRAVIS: Like, if we're just talking about, like, our favorite movie or something and someone uses a period at the end of the sentence, I'm not going to take it, like, aggressively. HENSEL: And if you think we're making a mountain out of a, well, dot, you have company. Celia Klim, the study author, said her work prompted some backlash.

It's been promising to take major steps to limit disinformation and interference before the election. And it promised that after this election, it won't allow posts claiming false victory by the candidates. Facebook has been facing a double whammy of election disinformation recently, with some of it on the site coming from political campaigns and others from foreign or domestic bad actors trying to influence us. But does what we see on Facebook actually impact the way we vote? We're joined now by Jessica Feezell. She is a professor at the University of New Mexico who studies the intersection of social media and political behavior. Welcome. JESSICA FEEZELL: Thank you, Lulu. Thank you for having me. GARCIA-NAVARRO: It is a pleasure to have you. Much, as you know, has been said about Facebook's role in politics and elections. But does Facebook really have an impact? How much do people actually take away from what they see on the site? FEEZELL: So we know several things. We know that people who are politically engaged online are usually also politically engaged offline. So the information that we encounter definitely feeds into sort of our political ecosystem and impacts the way that we behave in real - you know, feet-on-the-ground, traditional political participation. We also know that the information that we encounter on Facebook has an effect on what we call agenda setting - or the issues that we think are important at any given time. And that can have implications for the issues that we take into the voting booth with us or the things that guide our electoral decisions. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Does your research then show that people would change their vote based on these sort of incidental contexts? FEEZELL: No, it doesn't. Changing someone's vote is a very difficult thing to do because you have all of these other socializing forces - religion, gender, education, region, personal experiences. All of these things come into play when we act politically. It could, however, make you think about certain things that make you feel ineffective or upset and sad about democracy, and maybe then you don't go vote. But the likelihood that you bump into some piece of information on Facebook, and it changes who you vote for is very unlikely. GARCIA-NAVARRO: You talk about these sociological forces that are based on your gender, your religion, your age. What kind of person do we know is more likely to be affected by something they see or read on Facebook? Is there a particular demographic that is more vulnerable to being influenced? FEEZELL: So usually, when we - you know, we model this stuff and look at it empirically, there's a number of things that we control for - many of the things that you just listed but also political interest - how engaged they are, how invested, how, perhaps, knowledgeable they are about the political world around them. It's the people who have lower levels of political interest who are most susceptible to incidental exposure to political information, whether it's good, well-crafted, quality news reporting or mis- and disinformation campaigning. GARCIA-NAVARRO: But aren't those also the people that are less likely to vote? FEEZELL: Perhaps. And there is some research by Leticia Bode that shows that it's possible that people who go online and bump into information and start to participate lightly online might sort of open up a gateway to higher levels of offline participation. So, for example, if you're online and you see a friend that you trust and really like sharing information about Black Lives Matter, for example - you think that might be interesting, and you trust this person. And so perhaps then you dig into more information about it, and you become activated by it. And maybe even it's an issue that resonates enough with who you are that it drives you to participate. It drives you into voting. GARCIA-NAVARRO: There's been a lot in the news recently about steps that Facebook has said it will take, is taking to sort of combat disinformation. Some of that has to do with taking down particular pages. It has also said it will limit new ads, political ads, in the week before the election. Is that enough? FEEZELL: So I'm happy that they're doing something. What they're doing, however, I don't believe is enough. I think that they should go further than one week and perhaps take it to a full month and pull down the political ads and let Facebook be a place of social engagement and discussion and sharing among people but not necessarily a place where people are able to pay for that speech. It would also be nice if instead of being retroactive in the information that they take down and remove, that there was some way that they could be more proactive in keeping that information from appearing in the first place because we know that when people are exposed to disinformation and misinformation - that it's quite difficult to actually correct that. There's still some lingering seed of doubt about that issue that you saw even if you've seen that that has been fact-checked and proven to be wrong.

It's a survey telescope designed to look at a huge swath of sky at once. But to capture an image of that huge swath of sky, Aaron Roodman and his colleagues at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory had to build a really big camera.

PALCA: Inside the camera are lenses, filters, cables, refrigeration equipment and a focal plane consisting of 189 detectors capable of taking that 3. 2 billion-pixel image - so not a camera you can throw together in your garage. ROODMAN: Oh, boy. No. No. Definitely not. PALCA: When it's fully assembled, a series of lenses will help focus the light from celestial objects. But Roodman says he and his colleagues needed a way to project an image onto the detectors in the focal plane without a lot of lenses. ROODMAN: So I invented a little thing I call a pinhole projector - basically a metal box with a tiny pinhole at the top of it and lights inside the box - so kind of the opposite of a pinhole camera, if you will. PALCA: The image of whatever is in the box will be projected onto the camera's detectors. But what to project for the test? They started by putting various images into the projector, including a picture of Vera Rubin, the astronomer after whom the telescope is named. But then they wanted something a bit more optically challenging. So they decided on Brassica oleracea, also known as Romanesco broccoli. Why broccoli? ROODMAN: You know, mostly for fun. PALCA: Roodman says there was a little bit more to the decision. ROODMAN: It, you know, has an interesting fractal structure, and we thought it would look cool, which I think it does. PALCA: Yeah, it kind of does. COVID-19 has delayed the completion of the camera. Roodman says they're still hoping to finish it in time to get it to Chile and installed in the telescope by the fall of 2022, where it can be used to search the sky for interesting celestial objects and heads of broccoli if they happen to be out there. Joe Palca, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF POLAR BEARS' \"PEEPERS\") AILSA CHANG, HOST:   Scientists and engineers in California are building a unique camera for a unique telescope called the Rubin Observatory telescope. It's under construction in South America. And the camera has - count them - 3. 2 billion pixels. The camera has taken its first set of test pictures. And what did it take pictures of? A head of broccoli. NPR's Joe Palca has more. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: The Rubin telescope is under construction on Cerro Pachon, a mountain in north-central Chile. It's a survey telescope designed to look at a huge swath of sky at once. But to capture an image of that huge swath of sky, Aaron Roodman and his colleagues at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory had to build a really big camera.

Last week's mission was shrouded in secrecy. But as NPR's Geoff Brumfiel reports, there are some clues about what China sent into space and why. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: Last Friday, a Chinese rocket took off carrying a mysterious payload. A terse statement on state media said it was, quote, \"a reusable experimental spacecraft. \"JONATHAN MCDOWELL: But they didn't give a launch time. They don't give any more details - no real official footage of the launch. BRUMFIEL: Jonathan McDowell is an astronomer at the Center for Astrophysics, Harvard & Smithsonian, who specializes in tracking satellites and spacecraft orbiting the Earth. When he plotted the course of China's new craft, he found that it passed over a secretive military facility, an area called Lop Nur where China once tested its nuclear weapons. MCDOWELL: There's an air base there, which has a big runway that's aligned exactly in the direction of the orbit of the spacecraft. BRUMFIEL: On Sunday, China announced its new spacecraft had landed. Sure enough, fuzzy satellite images snapped by a commercial company called Planet seemed to show activity on the giant runway right at the moment the landing would have occurred. McDowell says that the evidence is circumstantial, but he believes China has just tested a space plane. Think of it as a little space shuttle, a craft with wings, probably too small to carry people that took off on a rocket and coasted back to Earth. MCDOWELL: The information sort of all hangs together now that this was a test of something, probably a space plane, that made a winged reentry and landed on the runway at Lop Nur. BRUMFIEL: The U. S. Air Force has a similar spacecraft called the X-37B. It's been launching since 2010. So if that's what China tested, why now? BRIAN WEEDEN: It's a great question. We're not even really sure why the United States military is pursuing a space plane like it's been doing for the last decade or so. MCDOWELL: Brian Weeden studies space security issues with the Secure World Foundation. The U. S. X-37B program remains highly classified. Weeden says he believes it's being used to test new sensors and systems for the military. WEEDEN: Think about it. If you're building a brand-new satellite and you've got a lot of fancy new technology that's never been in space before, that's potentially risky. But if you can fly some of that technology in space, let's say, in the payload bay of a reusable space plane, that could allow you to get a better feel for how it might react. BRUMFIEL: McDowell says that space planes, which travel many times the speed of sound, could also potentially help with the development of so-called hypersonic weapons. But, honestly, he thinks China could just be copying the U. S. MCDOWELL: If the Americans have one of those, there must be a good reason for it. So we better get one, too. BRUMFIEL: The landing of the space plane or whatever it was is just the latest success for China. McDowell says it recently completed its own satellite navigation system. It has a robotic mission going to Mars and several probes on the moon. MCDOWELL: China is firing on all thrusters in space and just really increasing its level of involvement and capabilities. And I think that this is just one more reflection of that. BRUMFIEL: Geoff Brumfiel, NPR News, Washington. AILSA CHANG, HOST:   China's military appears to have successfully tested a new spacecraft.

If it's not sold to an American company, the video-sharing app will be banned in the U. S. Microsoft was seen as the most likely buyer. But TikTok's Chinese parent company has now rejected Microsoft's offer. NPR's Bobby Allyn joins us with the latest. Bobby, good morning. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning. MARTIN: There was all kinds of talk about this big deal with Microsoft. What happened to it? ALLYN: Yes. So in short, it was turned down by ByteDance. Dance if you remember, that's TikTok's Beijing-based parent company. And, you know, this really hurt Microsoft. Microsoft was really gunning to acquire TikTok. And it's because it would've been a gold mine of data on young people, you know, on one of the world's fastest-growing apps. Microsoft has the money and the technical know-how to operate it. But yeah, in a statement Sunday, Microsoft says its offer was rejected. And they didn't explain why, but they did say their proposal would have protected national security interests, which is how we ended up here in the first place. MARTIN: So let's talk about this deadline. I mean, President Trump has said that TikTok poses a national security threat because it's operated out of China. The president is saying that he's going to force TikTok to shut down if they can't sell it to an American operation. So, I mean, now that this Microsoft deal has fallen through, what happened? ALLYN: Right. So Trump says TikTok has no choice but to find a buyer by Tuesday - so tomorrow. But in an executive order the president signed, TikTok actually has another five days after that. But that's not really much time in the deal-making world to try to figure this out, right? So, I mean, Microsoft having its offer rejected definitely makes it more likely that TikTok could go away forever in the U. S. But it still could be saved, right, Rachel? All hope is not lost. Others are still in talks with TikTok. MARTIN: Do we know who the others are? ALLYN: Yes. So the Wall Street Journal reports that TikTok is expected to name software company Oracle as its, quote, \"trusted tech partner. \" Now, what does that mean? I have no idea. And most people don't know, either. Now, Chinese state TV has another take out today. They're saying that neither Microsoft nor Oracle will be buying TikTok. It's unclear how definitive that report is. But in any case, Oracle would be a really odd partner here. I mean, it sells database products to mostly businesses. It has no experience operating a social media company. It doesn't even sell any major consumer products. Analyst Dan Ives was among the technology watchers I talked to who is equally as confused. DAN IVES: The Oracle technology partnership, which I think to many is still a head scratcher - is that enough to keep this app alive? ALLYN: Right. So that's the key question - is whatever Oracle and TikTok hammered out enough to satisfy the Trump administration so that they will cool their pressure on the app and let it survive? We just don't know yet. MARTIN: And China itself has sort of thrown a wrench into this - right? - doing some things that are delaying talks. ALLYN: That's right, yeah. So in the middle of these talks, China passed a new rule restricting how a foreign buyer - say, an American company like Microsoft. . . MARTIN: (Laughter). ALLYN: . . . Could - yeah, could take on a Chinese algorithm. And TikTok is popular because it has this amazing algorithm, right? I mean, it's really seen as kind of the secret sauce of TikTok. It's what makes it very personalized. It's what makes, you know, videos just go viral really, really fast. So can TikTok be sold without its treasured algorithm? Would TikTok even be TikTok without it? I mean, these are really big questions right now. MARTIN: And just to end, just to step back, how exceptional is this situation now with President Trump putting this kind of pressure on a private company? ALLYN: Yeah, I mean, unprecedented, as you know, Rachel, is a term we hear thrown around a lot in the Trump era. And I don't think it would be a stretch to use it here. I mean, the president using the power of his office to force an overseas company to sell its business in the U. S. is very, very unusual. But still, that's the situation TikTok is now facing. MARTIN: NPR's Bobby Allyn, thank you. ALLYN: Thank you, Rachel. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:   There are just days left for TikTok.

Today, the social network launched a Climate Science Information Center, a central hub for climate facts - not as straightforward as it may sound. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It'll start getting cooler. WADE CROWFOOT: I wish. . . TRUMP: You just watch. CORNISH: That was President Trump yesterday in California addressing how climate change affects wildfires. We asked Facebook VP of Global Affairs and Communications Nick Clegg about what happens when politicians don't accept the science. NICK CLEGG: Facebook's role is not to tell whoever is elected as president of the United States what they can and can't say, within limits. No one, including President Trump, and no politician can say things which threaten impending real-world harm. And our policies on hate speech apply to everybody. But when it comes to the debate about climate science, what we are trying to do and why we are hopeful this Climate Science Information Center will be very effective is that it provides a simple, easy-to-find repository for authoritative information about what is happening to our climate. And our experience with the COVID information hub is that there is a real appetite for people to find out more for themselves. CORNISH: We have seen misinformation in general spreading when it comes to this issue. And is there anything that Facebook can do more proactively to prevent this misinformation from spreading? CLEGG: As I say, we do already more than any other company in the industry. No other company partners with 70-plus fact-checkers around the world. You know, fact-checking is not some - it is not some sort of light sanction. The suggestion that the only remedy to misinformation or the only credible remedy to information is when content is removed I think overlooks how effective this program of fact-checking can be. You know, removing content is the ultimate sanction, and we confine that to content where we think there is a clear and impending link to real-world harm. So for instance, this last weekend, we removed content which circulated which made claims that far-left groups were responsible for the fires in Oregon. And we did so because the police and law enforcement emergency services told us that these rumors were actually taking their resources away from helping people whose homes were ablaze. CORNISH: Earlier, you made this comment about the public and politicians. I do want to come back to it for one more thing, which is that, just recently, the Department of Health and Human Services - a public affairs official - his name's Michael Caputo - used a Facebook livestream to make all kinds of claims against the federal government, ones that do sound threatening or dangerous, you know, claiming that there were hit squads that were preparing for armed insurrection. How do you refute this? Do you reach out to people who saw the video? Is there anything you can do, or is this in the column of, it came from a politician, so it's not our deal to make comment on it? CLEGG: So I haven't seen the video, so I simply can't comment on the video itself. CORNISH: It was a livestream, so a lot - a good number of us missed it, but it came from Facebook. CLEGG: Yeah. Look. The country is going through a highly, highly polarized time, with people from all wings of opinion saying things to each other and about each other, not least in the run-up to this highly consequential election. And we have put in place all range of guardrails to try and make sure that our platform remains a place for open debate. Sometimes we act swiftly and immediately. Sometimes we don't act quickly enough. And then, quite rightly, people criticize Facebook. But I don't think it would be fair to overlook the huge, huge undertaking which now exists on Facebook, whether it is the millions of fake accounts removed every day, the 35,000 people who've been employed to help monitor what goes on on our platform. Much. . . CORNISH: And I don't think I am. I mean, I guess what I want to say is these things aren't disconnected. Here you have a science hub, and here you have someone using Facebook, someone in an official capacity who claims federal government scientists are engaging in sedition. This is going against the - let's call it good or clean information you're trying to put out on the one hand. And on the other hand, there's a steady stream of this other stuff. CLEGG: I think it would be unrealistic to imagine that the only thing one is ever going to see on Facebook is material that you feel comfortable or happy about. That's not the nature of the world we live in, and it's certainly not the nature of the highly polarized debate we have in the United States. If that video broke our rules and we didn't act on it, I'm sure that is a legitimate source of criticism. But I think the underlying point you're making is that, yes, one of the reasons for this climate science center is precisely because good speech is often the most effective antidote to bad speech. CORNISH: Well, Nick Clegg, thank you so much for your time. Much appreciated. CLEGG: Thank you. CORNISH: And we should note Facebook is a financial supporter of NPR. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:   Facebook wants to be an authority on climate. Today, the social network launched a Climate Science Information Center, a central hub for climate facts - not as straightforward as it may sound. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It'll start getting cooler. WADE CROWFOOT: I wish. . . TRUMP: You just watch. CORNISH: That was President Trump yesterday in California addressing how climate change affects wildfires. We asked Facebook VP of Global Affairs and Communications Nick Clegg about what happens when politicians don't accept the science. NICK CLEGG: Facebook's role is not to tell whoever is elected as president of the United States what they can and can't say, within limits. No one, including President Trump, and no politician can say things which threaten impending real-world harm. And our policies on hate speech apply to everybody. But when it comes to the debate about climate science, what we are trying to do and why we are hopeful this Climate Science Information Center will be very effective is that it provides a simple, easy-to-find repository for authoritative information about what is happening to our climate. And our experience with the COVID information hub is that there is a real appetite for people to find out more for themselves. CORNISH: We have seen misinformation in general spreading when it comes to this issue. And is there anything that Facebook can do more proactively to prevent this misinformation from spreading? CLEGG: As I say, we do already more than any other company in the industry. No other company partners with 70-plus fact-checkers around the world. You know, fact-checking is not some - it is not some sort of light sanction. The suggestion that the only remedy to misinformation or the only credible remedy to information is when content is removed I think overlooks how effective this program of fact-checking can be. You know, removing content is the ultimate sanction, and we confine that to content where we think there is a clear and impending link to real-world harm. So for instance, this last weekend, we removed content which circulated which made claims that far-left groups were responsible for the fires in Oregon. And we did so because the police and law enforcement emergency services told us that these rumors were actually taking their resources away from helping people whose homes were ablaze. CORNISH: Earlier, you made this comment about the public and politicians. I do want to come back to it for one more thing, which is that, just recently, the Department of Health and Human Services - a public affairs official - his name's Michael Caputo - used a Facebook livestream to make all kinds of claims against the federal government, ones that do sound threatening or dangerous, you know, claiming that there were hit squads that were preparing for armed insurrection. How do you refute this? Do you reach out to people who saw the video? Is there anything you can do, or is this in the column of, it came from a politician, so it's not our deal to make comment on it? CLEGG: So I haven't seen the video, so I simply can't comment on the video itself. CORNISH: It was a livestream, so a lot - a good number of us missed it, but it came from Facebook. CLEGG: Yeah. Look. The country is going through a highly, highly polarized time, with people from all wings of opinion saying things to each other and about each other, not least in the run-up to this highly consequential election. And we have put in place all range of guardrails to try and make sure that our platform remains a place for open debate. Sometimes we act swiftly and immediately. Sometimes we don't act quickly enough. And then, quite rightly, people criticize Facebook. But I don't think it would be fair to overlook the huge, huge undertaking which now exists on Facebook, whether it is the millions of fake accounts removed every day, the 35,000 people who've been employed to help monitor what goes on on our platform. Much. . . CORNISH: And I don't think I am. I mean, I guess what I want to say is these things aren't disconnected. Here you have a science hub, and here you have someone using Facebook, someone in an official capacity who claims federal government scientists are engaging in sedition. This is going against the - let's call it good or clean information you're trying to put out on the one hand. And on the other hand, there's a steady stream of this other stuff. CLEGG: I think it would be unrealistic to imagine that the only thing one is ever going to see on Facebook is material that you feel comfortable or happy about. That's not the nature of the world we live in, and it's certainly not the nature of the highly polarized debate we have in the United States. If that video broke our rules and we didn't act on it, I'm sure that is a legitimate source of criticism. But I think the underlying point you're making is that, yes, one of the reasons for this climate science center is precisely because good speech is often the most effective antidote to bad speech.

I'm Dave Davies, in today for Terry Gross. You know how when you go online, ads pop up for products you've shown an interest in or political messages that seem tailored for you appear on YouTube videos? Our guest today, Jill Lepore, has a story about a company formed at the end of the 1950s that had a plan to accumulate data about people's habits and preferences and use it to predict how they'll vote or shop. While the practice is a fact of life today, 70 years ago, the idea was revolutionary and controversial. The company called Simulmatics, a combination of the words simulation and automation, told clients it had crafted a people machine to predict human behavior. The idea attracted customers but drew condemnation from scholars and political leaders who saw it as a threat to democracy. Lepore has a new book about the company and its colorful founders, a mix of Madison Avenue admen and social scientists, and about its checkered history assisting politicians, corporations and the U. S. war effort in Vietnam. Jill Lepore is the David Woods Kemper '41 Professor of History at Harvard University, a staff writer at The New Yorker and host of the podcast The Last Archive. She's written many books, including \"These Truths: A History Of The United States. \" She joins me from her home in Brattleboro, Vt. , to talk about her latest book, \"If Then: How The Simulmatics Corporation Invented The Future. \" Jill Lepore, welcome back to FRESH AIR. JILL LEPORE: Hey. Thanks so much for having me. DAVIES: This enterprise had a founder, a driving spirit - not exactly a technological visionary. Tell us about this guy Ed Greenfield. LEPORE: (Laughter) Yeah. I love Ed Greenfield. He was a Madison Avenue ad guy in the 1950s. He had a company called Ed Greenfield and Co. At a time when Madison Avenue was growing, you know, that sort of \"Mad Men\" era that we're familiar with from television, he was a bit of a small-time operator. But he was a very devoted liberal and really spent a lot of time working for liberal causes and got into political consulting, which is what a lot of advertising agencies had done, mostly for Republicans. But Greenfield wanted to bring political consulting to Democrats. DAVIES: And like a lot of entrepreneurs, there was a part a bit huckster to Greenfield. I mean, he had some educational credentials that didn't exactly (laughter) stand up to scrutiny, right? LEPORE: (Laughter) Yeah. You know he seems to have been an incredibly loving and affable fellow in many ways, very charming. People admired him, but they also often tended to get really frustrated with him when they got to know him a little bit better. And one of the things they got frustrated with was the bravado and braggadocio that a lot of what he was promoting was himself. And so there was a lot of sleight of hand. So he often introduced himself as having gone to the University of Chicago and to Yale. And I asked his surviving children about that. And they all said, I don't really know that that's true. And, you know, you do what you do. You fact check. So I wrote to the registrars at all these places. And no, he had not attended those places, those schools. He didn't have degrees from them. He had incidental affiliations with them. But, you know, he was a salesman. So he sold himself. DAVIES: So Ed Greenfield came on the scene at a time when political advertising was a new thing. People just had televisions, and candidates were getting used to the idea of ad companies. And computers were new - these big hulking machines. What was the idea of this company that he put together that was so unique. LEPORE: So he wanted to devise what he called sometimes a voting behavior machine, that you could take the - what we know about voters, which is information gathered by pollsters, and the information that is the giant data set that is election returns and marry that to behavioral science and then run it all through a computer. And you could predict how people would behave mathematically. DAVIES: Right. And to do this, I mean, he was a guy who was really good at developing relationships. He knew everybody. He really tapped a lot of very sophisticated social scientists of his day, didn't he. LEPORE: Yeah, because he understood that there was this great, new thing going on, which was simulation - computer simulation. People knew it from flight simulation. Wow, you could train pilots by having a computer simulate the experience of flight. And he knew how exciting and buzzy automation was - right? - like, the way big data was buzzy, you know, a few years ago. Automation - everything's being automated. So he decided to start this new company. He called it Simulmatics to kind of mash those two words together. He thought it would be like cybernetics, you know, to be, like, a buzzword of the era. So in 1959 when he founded it, it seemed to him that this would be the future of American politics and also of American marketing. DAVIES: This Madison Avenue adman Ed Greenfield has this idea of using computers to help predict behavior. And he hooks up with a guy named Bill McPhee, who's kind of a math genius, a really interesting and colorful character. Just tell us a little bit about him and this idea that he came up with that would drive this company. LEPORE: Yeah. So McPhee was at Columbia. People sometimes called him Wild Bill McPhee. He was a very erratic genius. And he worked in the field of voting behavior, trying to use what we know about election returns and public opinion polls to come up with a mathematical model that could tell you how to predict voters' behavior. And he came up with this thing for his Ph. D. dissertation. And then Greenfield, who met everybody - he collected (laughter) people - met McPhee and said, this is it. This is it. This is the thing I've been - you know, ever since the election of 1952, I've been trying to find a way that we could use computers to influence political campaigns. And so he brought McPhee on board and he turned his - really, his doctoral dissertation into a commercial product that would found a for-profit company. I think what Greenfield didn't quite get was McPhee was a little wild-eyed. I mean, during the time he was doing that research, he was manic depressive. His wife was home with, you know, young children - had him committed to Bellevue. Most of this work he did, a great deal of it, he did while in Bellevue. DAVIES: The psychiatric hospital. LEPORE: The psychiatric hospital, yeah. DAVIES: So he writes all this down on paper, and it proves to be a really powerful idea. LEPORE: Yeah. And it is a really powerful idea. Like, I - it still is. I mean, you know, think about what political campaigns do today, right? They're collecting data about you in order to send you messages that will affect how you vote. That's now what our politics has become. I mean, especially we're stuck in our houses. That's really all that we have, right? We're not talking to people on the street or even answering the door, chatting with people about what we might do. We're just - we're bits of data being manipulated. But that idea, kookily enough, like, comes from sort of a madman in Bellevue trying to reinvent American politics. DAVIES: Right. The idea was that, you know, we have this data on people, and you can slice all this data up. And then you can tell a candidate the impact if they decide to endorse a civil rights bill or oppose a trade agreement. You can actually try and predict, simulate what would happen. Ed Greenfield, the guy who runs the ad agency, sends this proposal 'cause he's excited by it to a guy named Newton Minow, who happens to be a close adviser to Adlai Stevenson, the Democratic candidate for president the '50s. He then forwards it to Arthur Schlesinger, the Harvard historian. And what's interesting is that Newton Minow has a strong reaction to this idea. What does he think of it? LEPORE: Yeah, this knocked me out when I found it in the archives in Stevenson's papers at Princeton. Minow writes to Schlesinger. They had both been involved in Stevenson's campaigns, close advisers to Stevenson. This is 1959. Stevenson's thinking about running again for a third time in 1960. And Minow says to Schlesinger, like, you remember Ed Greenfield? He worked on the campaign in '56 'cause Greenfield had worked for the Stevenson campaign. He's got this idea, this Project Macroscope thing. Look. I think it's got to be illegal. And if it's not illegal, it's surely immoral. And I also don't think it can't work. Like, what - tell me; what should we do about this? And Schlesinger writes back and says, yeah, you know, I remember Greenfield, and yeah, I share all of your reservations. You know, and what Schlesinger - the great presidential historian - means by that is, like, a candidate for presidency should speak about civil rights forcefully because he or she should speak about civil rights forcefully, not because a computer says that, you know, you might win this district if you do that 'cause, you know - so Schlesinger is like - worry about it, the question - implications for leadership. But I don't like to stand in the way of science. And this might work (laughter). So Schlesinger's a power guy, you know? He wants to win. He wants the Democrats to win. The Republicans have held the White House for all of the '50s. DAVIES: Right. So a debate begins to emerge. I mean, does using all of these predictive tools amount to manipulating voters and manipulating an election, or is it just good, smart politics? LEPORE: Yeah. And I think other than Minow, who has a real moral clarity around this issue - I mean, I think he correctly foresees all the problems with it. There aren't a lot of people whose questions go beyond, will it work? There's a real desperation, you know, kind of partisan desperation. There's one other guy, though, who really does oppose the project. It's this guy named Eugene Burdick, who was a political scientist at the University of California, Berkeley. He'd worked for Greenfield on the Stevenson campaign in '56 and had been asked to join this new endeavor. You know, would he sign on, with all these elite behavioral scientists, to this new project? And he said no. He foresaw the problems that it could bring - right? - the way in which he says, you know, it could destroy American politics as we know it. DAVIES: We need to take a break here. Let me reintroduce you. We're speaking with Jill Lepore. Her new book is \"If Then: How The Simulmatics Corporation Invented The Future. \" We'll talk more after this short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF ALEXANDRE DESPLAT'S \"SPY MEETING\")DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. We're speaking with New Yorker staff writer Jill Lepore about her new book which tells the story of a company formed in the late '50s that pioneered the idea of accumulating data about people and using computers to predict their behavior in voting, shopping and lifestyle choices. The book is called \"If Then: How The Simulmatics Corporation Invented The Future. \"So in 1960, John F. Kennedy is running for president against Richard Nixon. And Ed Greenfield, who started this company Simulmatics, convinces the Kennedy campaign to hire the company to do some research, give them some advice. They put polling data into their computers. Did they give John Kennedy any valuable advice on that election? LEPORE: They did. I mean, at first they were working for the DNC, before Kennedy was the nominee. And what they were trying to do was convince the DNC that the Democrats needed to take a stronger position on civil rights. Greenfield was a very, very strong advocate of civil rights and so were all the scientists who worked for what became the Simulmatics corporation. So they did that first bit of work, and then when Kennedy becomes the nominee, they do additional work for Kennedy. They prepare three more reports. And it turns out that in the fall of 1960, everything that Simulmatics recommended Kennedy do Kennedy did. And so when he won, Simulmatics took credit. DAVIES: Right. And so among those were formally embracing civil rights in a way that he really hadn't before, openly acknowledging that there were questions about his Catholic faith and addressing that directly. And whether it carried the day or not, that's what he did, and he won (laughter). LEPORE: Yeah. And a really interesting measure of the difference between this era and our era is that (laughter) the Kennedy campaign did not expect Simulmatics to take credit or even to take any public role whatsoever. The idea that if you were going to hire such a company, you should probably not admit to it (laughter) seems to have been the one that animated - especially Bobby Kennedy, who was furious when Simulmatics started saying, oh, well, you know, we're responsible for Kennedy's victory. DAVIES: Right. Well, one of my favorite parts of this story is what happens after the 1960 election, which is that in January, a story appears in Harper's Magazine about Simulmatics and its role in the Kennedy campaign. Tell us about this. LEPORE: Yeah. It's an article called \"The People Machine,\" (laughter) which is super spooky-sounding, and it's by this guy Thomas B. Morgan, who's a freelance writer. He's - you know, he's written for Harper's and Esquire, a lot of other places. Morgan does not reveal that he's Ed Greenfield's best friend (laughter) and that he also was the editor of all those reports. And he goes on to become the director of PR for Simulmatics. DAVIES: The editor of reports that they did for the Kennedy campaign. LEPORE: The - (laughter) yeah. DAVIES: He was right in the middle of this, but none of this is disclosed in the story, right? (LAUGHTER)LEPORE: No, he doesn't disclose any of it. But it is actually a really interesting article, and it's not entirely all boosterism. I mean, Morgan very carefully raises all the ethical questions around - well, OK, so this happened, and we're not 100% sure that it swayed the election, but we should be asking some questions about whether this is - if it does sway elections, is this OK? Is this the right thing to do? But what the Kennedy campaign sees is just this big headline that says, Kennedy used a robot (laughter) and deferred to a robot, like, that his campaign was run by a robot. And Kennedy had run with a lot of opposition to automation, which is a big electoral issue in 1960. So it put him in a real pickle. And it was the - kind of a great story. So it wasn't so much the Harper's story, but - this is, you know, right before the inauguration. All over the country, newspapers - even little newspapers - picked it up and wrote about it and (laughter) - we've elected a robot president. I mean, just, like - just kind of, like, think of kind of 1960s automation dystopia stuff, just kind of all leaks out of this story. And, suddenly, the nation was like, oh, whoa, this is - this could be really bad. And so the Kennedy campaign has to try to, you know, backtrack. And Pierre Salinger - the, you know, spokesperson - says, oh, no, we've never even heard of Simulmatics, which is just, you know, not true (laughter). DAVIES: Just - that was a lie, wasn't it (laughter)? LEPORE: There's a lot of, you know, kind of spin around whether Kennedy had, in fact, been elected by a computer. DAVIES: Right. So - but this idea that he had a secret weapon, which was a robot - I mean, it also provoked serious debate among people who were concerned about the future democracy, right? LEPORE: Yeah. It does. And I think - the argument that wins out eventually, honestly, is the argument that's put forward by Ithiel de Sola Pool, who's the MIT political scientist who's the chairman of the research board for this new company, Simulmatics. He says, you know, you want a political candidate to have as much information as possible. This is information that our technology and scientific research is now able to provide to political campaigns. So who wants to stand in the way of knowledge? We - like, knowledge is a good thing. And progress will be when the other side also has a people machine. If we have two people machines fighting against one another, then that's fair (laughter). And (laughter) that's actually the argument that wins. DAVIES: You mentioned that computers of the day were worked by women. Tell us about the women who worked with these computers and - I don't know - how they saw their roles, how they fit into an organization. LEPORE: So the big purchasers of these mainframe computers in the 1950s were giant corporations that used them for payroll first and for inventory control. And then airlines used them for ticketing and air traffic control purposes. So there just didn't - you know, not a lot of people have - sort of no one has a personal computer. But it's - you really have to be a pretty big company to have them. And the pool of workers who are brought in to work with them is essentially the typing pool. Most computers at this time were run by women. Most of the coding was done by women. You know, women were called computers before the machines came to be called computers. It's women who've been working as typists in these corporations. And then they're brought in to learn how to work with these new machines, which, you know, look like that's what they need. But the intellectual ambition of a lot of these women is to learn how to code and to learn how to code as an intellectual project. They get pushed out of that work. And then, over the course of the 1960s, when the kind of buzzy word is computer man - like, who's a computer man (laughter)? And so the field becomes really masculinized once its status rises and once there are enough computers. That's kind of a forgotten chapter in the history of computing. But for a long time, the coders, the computers were women. DAVIES: All right. So on the strength of all of the attention that it got in the 1960 election, Simulmatics is a hot commodity. And Ed Greenfield sees a world of new clients he can pitch. Who do they pitch to? And what do they tell them they can do? LEPORE: Yeah. So they - he's put together quite a distinguished group of people. The people that work for this company are - it's an incredible array of some of the leading behavioral scientists and early computer scientists as well. They write a stock offering. They go public. You know, it's kind of a splashy initial offering. The clientele that they reach out to - some of which they succeed in bringing in - first, advertising agencies and, you know, big retailers - Colgate-Palmolive, Ralston Purina - those kinds of people. They do kind of brand-switching ad campaigns for them. They have to say, you know, we have this imaginary population of consumers. We have some consumer data that, you know, we've gotten from you, or we got from ad agencies. And we can predict, you know, who's going to switch to your dog food if you say your dog food tastes good, versus who's going to switch to your dog food if you say your dog food makes your dog more energetic. And they do, you know, just very just kind of standard fare today. But it's pioneering at the time. Everything that, you know, is done now they're proposing then. DAVIES: Right. I mean, they claimed they had this people machine, which is, really, kind of a concept. But if I have this right, what they were telling potential clients was that they have crafted 3,000 perfectly representative, though, imaginary people that have all of these characteristics that are sliced in categories that you could test anything on - you know, dog food, breakfast cereal, political messaging - whatever. How close did they come to actually having the goods they were promising? LEPORE: You know, that I find difficult to tell. I found in the archives 10,000 or so punch cards from the election research and, you know, with a bunch of people, including people at the computer history museum, (laughter) tried to rerun the people machine, like, tried to turn it - switch it back on and see - try to have some measure of assessment of it. We couldn't get the FORTRAN program (laughter) cards to work. So this is a plea for anyone who wants to take on this project. DAVIES: (Laughter). LEPORE: It's difficult to assess. You know, we still don't know, for instance, the effect that Cambridge Analytica had on the 2016 Trump campaign or the 2015 Brexit campaign, right? Like, Cambridge Analytica would like us to think that it had a huge effect. But how measurable is it even now with the tools that we have to measure it? So it's quite difficult to say. DAVIES: Yeah. It did strike me, though, I mean, that even though they were probably promising more than they had, they were really successful in getting all these Fortune 500 companies. And it just reminds me that, then as now, success in consulting has a lot more to do with personal relationships and salesmanship than actually delivering meaningful (laughter) services. LEPORE: Yeah. I mean, there's a trade industry newsletter I think in 1962 puts out a story called The Great Computer Hoax in which this guy's like look; the emperor has no clothes. Like, Simulmatics and these other companies that are following, you know, these kind of copycat companies, they got nothing (laughter). Like, you can eyeball this, guys? Like, this is a lot of money for nothing. DAVIES: We need to take a break here. Let me reintroduce you. We're speaking with Jill Lepore. Her book is \"If Then: How The Simulmatics Corporation Invented The Future. \" She'll be back to talk more about the company after this short break. I'm Dave Davies. And this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF FRANK ZAPPA'S \"UNCLE MEAT: MAIN TITLE THEME\")DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross. We're speaking with historian and New Yorker staff writer Jill Lepore. Her new book is about an American company formed at the end of the 1950s with the then-revolutionary plan of accumulating data about people and using computers to predict their behavior in voting, shopping and living. The company's clients included the John F. Kennedy presidential campaign, major corporations and the American military in Vietnam. Lepore's book is \"If Then: How The Simulmatics Corporation Invented The Future. \"So, like, in 1961, this company was really riding a wave. I mean, they had this new idea, and they were getting clients right and left. And you tell the story of that summer. These men - and they really were mostly men - these social scientists and ad men gathering at Ed Greenfield's place, I guess, on Long Island on the beach. Give us a picture of what that was like, them and their families. LEPORE: Yeah. So they decide to do a kind of whole-family retreat. So it's a lot of guys with young families, so they bring along their wives and their children to spend the summer in this very futuristic-looking place. Ed Greenfield has an old Victorian house, but right next door is a geodesic dome, you know, this one designed by - an early version of Buckminster Fuller's geodesic dome. So it looks kind of like a spaceship that's just landed there, and they use that as a workplace for coming up with new plans for what the company could do. You know, kind of - like, Greenfield keeps sending people memos like, what's your biggest idea of the day? Trying to stir people up - like, what could we - there's - sky's the limit. You know, and they're in this dome, looking out at the sky. And meanwhile, their wives are, you know, doing what you do on the beach, which is chase after children and, you know, make sure they don't get sunburned and roast corn on the cob in a bonfire at night and make tuna salad sandwiches for everybody and make sure the toddler doesn't go in over her head. And the wives - especially Bill McPhee's wife, this extraordinary woman named Minnow McPhee - write a lot about those - it's not just that summer. There are other summers that they meet again and again and again. And what you see - Minnow McPhee is a preschool teacher - so someone who's really interested in the study of human behavior. She specialized - she studied in, you know, early learning of children. And you see - what really struck me was so much anguish around the disconnect between these men. They're all white men. They're white, liberal men trying to understand the mind of other people, the minds in particular of Black voters, right? So it's white men trying to understand Black people and then the consumers, who are mainly women. And so they're trying to figure out how women think. And meanwhile, like, you know, as - Minnow's just like, they all treat their wives like crap. Like, they're just - it's this horrible - kind of a very bad bargain of 1950s marriages. I mean, some of these people had decent marriages, but the rest of them - almost all of them ended up in divorce and quite acrimonious divorces. There's something, you know, that I think really prefigures the arrogance of Silicon Valley - right? - where these guys - you know, sort of the Zuckerberg kind of guy, like, stands above us all and tries to figure out, you know, how women and people of color think and how they can be influenced - like, the irony of Simulmatics trying to figure out what message the Kennedy campaign should send about civil rights in 1960 when, you know, Black men are sitting in at lunch counters all across the South. Black men and women are demonstrating on the streets. Like, do we need to build a - write a computer program to predict what the effect would be of taking a stronger position on civil rights for Black voters? I mean, it's just - it's kind of nuts, but it's also very much the world that we now live in. DAVIES: You know, by 1964, they were - the company was struggling. And so they find a great new client, the Defense Department of the United States, then getting more and more involved in Vietnam. What did the government think that Simulmatics could do for them in Vietnam? LEPORE: Well, Ithiel de Sola Pool, who was in charge of the Saigon office that Simulmatics opens, had long been involved in the Department of Defense. He was a very determined Cold Warrior, and he shared a lot of the worldview of Robert McNamara, who, you know - who had come, of course, from Ford Motor Company as a systems analyst and who really believed in, you know, running the numbers and running the war by computer. DAVIES: He was the defense secretary for Kennedy and then Johnson, right? LEPORE: Yes. And one of the things that Simulmatics was brought in to do early on was evaluate a computer system that was trying to determine the success of - and the continued loyalty of Vietnamese people living in this confined, rural area. It's this program that was known as the Strategic Hamlet Program. The Department of Defense had computers in Saigon that were running the numbers every day - like, kind of everything you could possibly think of, every possible indicator of what was going on in these hamlets. DAVIES: I think we should just explain what these were was. . . LEPORE: Yeah. DAVIES: People were moved out of villages that were presumed to be sympathetic to the Viet Cong and then moved into these secure - you know, behind-barbed-wire compounds called strategic hamlets. And so it was a pretty radical way of trying to withdraw the popular base of the Viet Cong, and it put people in these areas. LEPORE: Yeah. So even being involved in that program, which was, you know, subject to a great deal of criticism in the United States - especially after '67, say - was a complicated thing. And most of the Simulmatics scientists refused to be involved. They left the company. They refused to go to Saigon. You know, it was a very left, you know, liberal organization. But Pool was very in favor of that program. And so Simulmatics was brought in to evaluate the success of the Strategic Hamlet Program, the databank that is this hamlet dataset that was daily running the numbers to see, you know, was the loyalty of these people - was it assured? Was it rising? Was it falling - so to do some kind of analysis. They also did a lot of measurement of popular opinion among Vietnamese peasants. And so they would drive out in a - you know, with a military escort or be flown into a village with teams of Vietnamese translators - most of these were college students - and ask questions. They would gather enough public opinion information, enough demographic information. And then you have a - you devise a model, and then you make a prediction. DAVIES: Right. And it was really striking that, in doing these public opinion surveys of Vietnamese peasants, that they would come out in military convoys and then kind of expect people to give them honest answers to long lists of questions. What kind of information were they getting from these interviews? LEPORE: Yeah. So I - you know, I spoke to some people who did the interviews, some of the social scientists. But I also spoke to some of the Vietnamese interpreters who, you know, really did the interviews. And they - you know, they - the Vietnamese interpreters said, you know, it was ridiculous. Like, you - everybody thinks you're a spy. Like, everyone's pressure these people are just the CIA posing as academics. And who's to dispute them? And then I'm not going to - you know, basically, I'm not going to try to convince them to tell me the truth 'cause I know that they're vulnerable. You know, the person I'm interviewing is sitting next to somebody, you know, who might rat them out and kill their children in response to what they - how they answer the questions. Like, there's just no - nothing about this set of circumstances that would induce an honest answer. Also, the questions are largely, like, bafflingly irrelevant to these people's lives and the kind of daily suffering that they're enduring during this war. The whole thing is just kind of a travesty. And what surprised me a bit was how clearly the Defense Department understood that it was a travesty and yet continued to fund it. There's just file after file after file in the National Archives of people at the Advanced Research Projects Agency, part of the Department of Defense that oversaw the Simulmatics project, saying, this stuff is nuts. These people are doing meaningless research. And we're paying them again and again and again for it. DAVIES: In the millions. Yeah, yeah. LEPORE: Yeah. They keep saying, let's cut it off. Let's cut this off. Let's cut this off. It's going nowhere. But it's the kind of thing McNamara really liked. DAVIES: How did Simulmatics' work in Vietnam end? Did they leave, or were they fired? LEPORE: They were fired. Each of the reports that they submitted was questioned, and each led to requests that the contracts be terminated. But finally, they were fired in 1968. DAVIES: Let me reintroduce you here. We're going to take another break. We're speaking with Jill Lepore. Her book is \"If Then: How The Simulmatics Corporation Invented The Future. \" We'll talk more after this short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF NAOMI MOON SIEGEL'S \"IT'S NOT SAFE\")DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And we're speaking with New Yorker staff writer Jill Lepore poor about her new book, which tells the story of a company formed in the late '50s that pioneered the idea of accumulating data about people and using computers to predict their behavior. The book is called \"If Then: How The Simulmatics Corporation Invented The Future. \"It's interesting that the time when Simulmatics was involved in Vietnam was a time when its work, I gather, was kind of collapsing in the United States. And Ed Greenfield was trying to figure out ways to revive the company. You describe one point at which he actually visited the operation in Saigon. What did you learn about that? LEPORE: Yeah. So he flies out. And the staff are really dubious about him. He at that point has been drinking - begun to drink much more heavily. He's kind of lost control of himself. His marriage is falling apart. A lot of what destroys the company is the instability of their domestic arrangements, kind of, you know, their inability to understand the people that they love. So Greenfield flies out to Saigon and just gets drunk and alienates everyone. And people begin pulling away from the project who had kind of held on, thinking that maybe there could be a way forward. And at that point, Greenfield and Pool also part ways, and Greenfield is forced out of the presidency of the company. DAVIES: Yeah. You said a lot of what destroyed the company was these men's inability to to handle their personal lives and people they love. Can you elaborate on that a bit? LEPORE: Yeah. I mean, I think it's a weirdness of business history that we kind of have a kind of corporate center - corporation-center notion of what is happening in a company in any given time. It's really clear that this company, which is founded on a commitment to the idea that people who aren't white men are mysterious and need to be decoded by computers, kind of can't really endure the absurdity of that idea. It kind of collapses in on itself. You know, the 1960s are a great era of emancipation for just the kind of white women who are married to this kind of guy, you know, the women that gave up their education to raise children. They get caught up in the women's liberation movement. They come to be extraordinarily distressed by what their husbands are doing. It's also the case that for most of these men, especially those who are involved in Vietnam, their sons are opposed to the war. And the family fractures in that way, as well. Greenfield's son Michael strenuously opposed to the Vietnam War, could not forgive his father for making money off of the war. So their families are really falling apart. DAVIES: So after the '60s did anybody even know the name Simulmatics? Did it just disappear? LEPORE: Yeah, I think it completely vanished. I mean, I had certainly not heard of it. There's not really scholarship about it. One of the reasons that it vanished is Ed Greenfield's own dissolution. I mean, most of the records of the company were in New York, where the headquarters were. And the company filed for bankruptcy. Ed, you know, sort of lost to the oblivion of alcoholism. Pretty much think all the archives were destroyed. You mean, this kind of thing - like, someone at some point rented the office and just chucked everything out. So it didn't really leave behind a paper trail that some - like, they all gave their corporation's records to the Harvard Business School or something. There are no corporation records. By 1970, people are writing to you Ithiel de Sola Pool at MIT, asking for - you know, do you have your punch cards? Do you have notes from this study? I'm interested in your Kerner work. And he said, you know, most of it's in New York. And those queries go nowhere. So I - a lot of what I had to do to work on this project was piece together the archive from different institutional collections. But because so many of the scientists were - you know, they were academics, they left their papers to their universities. So there is quite a lot out there. DAVIES: And you managed to meet a lot of the kids of the parents who were involved in it. How did you come upon this story? LEPORE: In 2015, I had an assignment from The New Yorker to write kind of an assessment of the state of the public opinion, the polling industry. And I wrote a piece called \"Politics And The New Machine. \" And it struck me at the time really early in my research that polling is - certainly should be, I guess, obsolete in that with the advent of data analytics companies, data - modern data - modern political data science, you don't have to call somebody up and ask them, you know, a hundred questions to know how they might vote or what they believe about, you know, Biden's latest speech or Trump's latest action 'cause you can find out. You can collect data about them. That's how politics actually works. So I was interested. And then in - for the purpose of the piece in answering, like, when did that begin? If polling is being replaced by data science, when did that begin? And that took me to Simulmatics and the 1960 election work. DAVIES: You know, the stuff that they did that was so controversial - I mean, the idea that you could assemble data and predict how people would react to a political idea or a new product, which was controversial then - is just so completely normal now. And people are collecting, you know, untold amounts of data from us in so many ways, you know, Google and Facebook and hundreds of others. What's the place of Simulmatics in the story of data and its use in the country? LEPORE: You know, I was just reading this quite chilling piece by Sue Halpern in The New Yorker this week about an app that the Trump campaign has been using and how effective it is at drawing your contact information and then also geolocating information in order to send you particular messages - and not only to you, but also to everybody in your contacts list and have gathered information about each of them by cellphone number, which is kind of the gold standard in doing voter research - right? - because you can then - if you know your cellphone number, you know kind of everything. And I was really struck reading that. We have nothing that stops this app from going into your contact lists and gathering all this information not only about you, but about everybody else that you know and then submitting messages to them in your name. How we got to this place is because no one said no to Simulmatics. DAVIES: You know, a lot of this is about how you can manipulate voters. What are you thinking about as you look to the coming election? LEPORE: When I think about what Simulmatics started doing - was really trying to convince the Democratic Party to count Black voters, right? Black voters matter, really, was Ed Greenfield's message. We're going to show you that, mathematically. We're going to build a computer. We're going to build a people machine that can show you that Black voters matter 'cause we need to be stronger on civil rights. Like, it starts with this really noble commitment to civil rights. But what it produces is the world that we have today, where we're all so segmented and micromessaged to that we have no sense of a common good any longer, which is how, you know, a democracy has to work. Like, we actually are not supposed to be going into a voting booth and voting - or sealing a ballot and sticking it in an envelope and voting the way our demographic microsegment says we must because we're actually supposed to be looking at that ballot and thinking about what's good for everyone, that notion of the public good and a public interest, which is the - just the ground on which democracy stands is falling away from beneath our feet. DAVIES: Right. And I guess if those of us who cover elections spend all of our time talking about just the hard politics of it, you know, how demographics will work, we're - that's time we could be spending talking about what's good for the country. LEPORE: Yeah, instead of just reporting the latest national poll, which doesn't really tell us anything since we live an Electoral College system anyway (laughter). I think there are deeper moral and ethical questions that, you know, good reporters are always wrestling with but I would like to hear voters on more, and I would like to hear that a lot more. I mean, I recognize the sexiness and the fun of, you know, FiveThirtyEight and the kind of gamesmanship, and everything is baseball now, or baseball is now computing (laughter). But, you know, I don't like to watch the game where they change the pitcher every three batters because they've got the numbers to do that. Like, baseball is baseball, and democracy is democracy. DAVIES: Well, Jill Lepore, thank you so much for speaking with us again. LEPORE: Thanks so much, Dave. It was a real pleasure. DAVIES: Jill Lepore is a professor of American history at Harvard and a staff writer for The New Yorker. Her book is \"If Then: How The Simulmatics Corporation Invented The Future. \" This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF BROTHERHOOD OF BREATH'S \"ANDROMEDA\") DAVE DAVIES, HOST:   This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in today for Terry Gross. You know how when you go online, ads pop up for products you've shown an interest in or political messages that seem tailored for you appear on YouTube videos? Our guest today, Jill Lepore, has a story about a company formed at the end of the 1950s that had a plan to accumulate data about people's habits and preferences and use it to predict how they'll vote or shop. While the practice is a fact of life today, 70 years ago, the idea was revolutionary and controversial. The company called Simulmatics, a combination of the words simulation and automation, told clients it had crafted a people machine to predict human behavior. The idea attracted customers but drew condemnation from scholars and political leaders who saw it as a threat to democracy. Lepore has a new book about the company and its colorful founders, a mix of Madison Avenue admen and social scientists, and about its checkered history assisting politicians, corporations and the U. S. war effort in Vietnam. Jill Lepore is the David Woods Kemper '41 Professor of History at Harvard University, a staff writer at The New Yorker and host of the podcast The Last Archive. She's written many books, including \"These Truths: A History Of The United States. \" She joins me from her home in Brattleboro, Vt. , to talk about her latest book, \"If Then: How The Simulmatics Corporation Invented The Future. \" Jill Lepore, welcome back to FRESH AIR. JILL LEPORE: Hey. Thanks so much for having me. DAVIES: This enterprise had a founder, a driving spirit - not exactly a technological visionary. Tell us about this guy Ed Greenfield. LEPORE: (Laughter) Yeah. I love Ed Greenfield. He was a Madison Avenue ad guy in the 1950s. He had a company called Ed Greenfield and Co. At a time when Madison Avenue was growing, you know, that sort of \"Mad Men\" era that we're familiar with from television, he was a bit of a small-time operator. But he was a very devoted liberal and really spent a lot of time working for liberal causes and got into political consulting, which is what a lot of advertising agencies had done, mostly for Republicans. But Greenfield wanted to bring political consulting to Democrats. DAVIES: And like a lot of entrepreneurs, there was a part a bit huckster to Greenfield. I mean, he had some educational credentials that didn't exactly (laughter) stand up to scrutiny, right? LEPORE: (Laughter) Yeah. You know he seems to have been an incredibly loving and affable fellow in many ways, very charming. People admired him, but they also often tended to get really frustrated with him when they got to know him a little bit better. And one of the things they got frustrated with was the bravado and braggadocio that a lot of what he was promoting was himself. And so there was a lot of sleight of hand. So he often introduced himself as having gone to the University of Chicago and to Yale. And I asked his surviving children about that. And they all said, I don't really know that that's true. And, you know, you do what you do. You fact check. So I wrote to the registrars at all these places. And no, he had not attended those places, those schools. He didn't have degrees from them. He had incidental affiliations with them. But, you know, he was a salesman. So he sold himself. DAVIES: So Ed Greenfield came on the scene at a time when political advertising was a new thing. People just had televisions, and candidates were getting used to the idea of ad companies. And computers were new - these big hulking machines. What was the idea of this company that he put together that was so unique. LEPORE: So he wanted to devise what he called sometimes a voting behavior machine, that you could take the - what we know about voters, which is information gathered by pollsters, and the information that is the giant data set that is election returns and marry that to behavioral science and then run it all through a computer. And you could predict how people would behave mathematically. DAVIES: Right. And to do this, I mean, he was a guy who was really good at developing relationships. He knew everybody. He really tapped a lot of very sophisticated social scientists of his day, didn't he. LEPORE: Yeah, because he understood that there was this great, new thing going on, which was simulation - computer simulation. People knew it from flight simulation. Wow, you could train pilots by having a computer simulate the experience of flight. And he knew how exciting and buzzy automation was - right? - like, the way big data was buzzy, you know, a few years ago. Automation - everything's being automated. So he decided to start this new company. He called it Simulmatics to kind of mash those two words together. He thought it would be like cybernetics, you know, to be, like, a buzzword of the era. So in 1959 when he founded it, it seemed to him that this would be the future of American politics and also of American marketing. DAVIES: This Madison Avenue adman Ed Greenfield has this idea of using computers to help predict behavior. And he hooks up with a guy named Bill McPhee, who's kind of a math genius, a really interesting and colorful character. Just tell us a little bit about him and this idea that he came up with that would drive this company. LEPORE: Yeah. So McPhee was at Columbia. People sometimes called him Wild Bill McPhee. He was a very erratic genius. And he worked in the field of voting behavior, trying to use what we know about election returns and public opinion polls to come up with a mathematical model that could tell you how to predict voters' behavior. And he came up with this thing for his Ph. D. dissertation. And then Greenfield, who met everybody - he collected (laughter) people - met McPhee and said, this is it. This is it. This is the thing I've been - you know, ever since the election of 1952, I've been trying to find a way that we could use computers to influence political campaigns. And so he brought McPhee on board and he turned his - really, his doctoral dissertation into a commercial product that would found a for-profit company. I think what Greenfield didn't quite get was McPhee was a little wild-eyed. I mean, during the time he was doing that research, he was manic depressive. His wife was home with, you know, young children - had him committed to Bellevue. Most of this work he did, a great deal of it, he did while in Bellevue. DAVIES: The psychiatric hospital. LEPORE: The psychiatric hospital, yeah. DAVIES: So he writes all this down on paper, and it proves to be a really powerful idea. LEPORE: Yeah. And it is a really powerful idea. Like, I - it still is. I mean, you know, think about what political campaigns do today, right? They're collecting data about you in order to send you messages that will affect how you vote. That's now what our politics has become. I mean, especially we're stuck in our houses. That's really all that we have, right? We're not talking to people on the street or even answering the door, chatting with people about what we might do. We're just - we're bits of data being manipulated. But that idea, kookily enough, like, comes from sort of a madman in Bellevue trying to reinvent American politics. DAVIES: Right. The idea was that, you know, we have this data on people, and you can slice all this data up. And then you can tell a candidate the impact if they decide to endorse a civil rights bill or oppose a trade agreement. You can actually try and predict, simulate what would happen. Ed Greenfield, the guy who runs the ad agency, sends this proposal 'cause he's excited by it to a guy named Newton Minow, who happens to be a close adviser to Adlai Stevenson, the Democratic candidate for president the '50s. He then forwards it to Arthur Schlesinger, the Harvard historian. And what's interesting is that Newton Minow has a strong reaction to this idea. What does he think of it? LEPORE: Yeah, this knocked me out when I found it in the archives in Stevenson's papers at Princeton. Minow writes to Schlesinger. They had both been involved in Stevenson's campaigns, close advisers to Stevenson. This is 1959. Stevenson's thinking about running again for a third time in 1960. And Minow says to Schlesinger, like, you remember Ed Greenfield? He worked on the campaign in '56 'cause Greenfield had worked for the Stevenson campaign. He's got this idea, this Project Macroscope thing. Look. I think it's got to be illegal. And if it's not illegal, it's surely immoral. And I also don't think it can't work. Like, what - tell me; what should we do about this? And Schlesinger writes back and says, yeah, you know, I remember Greenfield, and yeah, I share all of your reservations. You know, and what Schlesinger - the great presidential historian - means by that is, like, a candidate for presidency should speak about civil rights forcefully because he or she should speak about civil rights forcefully, not because a computer says that, you know, you might win this district if you do that 'cause, you know - so Schlesinger is like - worry about it, the question - implications for leadership. But I don't like to stand in the way of science. And this might work (laughter). So Schlesinger's a power guy, you know? He wants to win. He wants the Democrats to win. The Republicans have held the White House for all of the '50s. DAVIES: Right. So a debate begins to emerge. I mean, does using all of these predictive tools amount to manipulating voters and manipulating an election, or is it just good, smart politics? LEPORE: Yeah. And I think other than Minow, who has a real moral clarity around this issue - I mean, I think he correctly foresees all the problems with it. There aren't a lot of people whose questions go beyond, will it work? There's a real desperation, you know, kind of partisan desperation. There's one other guy, though, who really does oppose the project. It's this guy named Eugene Burdick, who was a political scientist at the University of California, Berkeley. He'd worked for Greenfield on the Stevenson campaign in '56 and had been asked to join this new endeavor. You know, would he sign on, with all these elite behavioral scientists, to this new project? And he said no. He foresaw the problems that it could bring - right? - the way in which he says, you know, it could destroy American politics as we know it. DAVIES: We need to take a break here. Let me reintroduce you. We're speaking with Jill Lepore. Her new book is \"If Then: How The Simulmatics Corporation Invented The Future. \" We'll talk more after this short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF ALEXANDRE DESPLAT'S \"SPY MEETING\") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. We're speaking with New Yorker staff writer Jill Lepore about her new book which tells the story of a company formed in the late '50s that pioneered the idea of accumulating data about people and using computers to predict their behavior in voting, shopping and lifestyle choices. The book is called \"If Then: How The Simulmatics Corporation Invented The Future. \" So in 1960, John F. Kennedy is running for president against Richard Nixon. And Ed Greenfield, who started this company Simulmatics, convinces the Kennedy campaign to hire the company to do some research, give them some advice. They put polling data into their computers. Did they give John Kennedy any valuable advice on that election? LEPORE: They did. I mean, at first they were working for the DNC, before Kennedy was the nominee. And what they were trying to do was convince the DNC that the Democrats needed to take a stronger position on civil rights. Greenfield was a very, very strong advocate of civil rights and so were all the scientists who worked for what became the Simulmatics corporation. So they did that first bit of work, and then when Kennedy becomes the nominee, they do additional work for Kennedy. They prepare three more reports. And it turns out that in the fall of 1960, everything that Simulmatics recommended Kennedy do Kennedy did. And so when he won, Simulmatics took credit. DAVIES: Right. And so among those were formally embracing civil rights in a way that he really hadn't before, openly acknowledging that there were questions about his Catholic faith and addressing that directly. And whether it carried the day or not, that's what he did, and he won (laughter). LEPORE: Yeah. And a really interesting measure of the difference between this era and our era is that (laughter) the Kennedy campaign did not expect Simulmatics to take credit or even to take any public role whatsoever. The idea that if you were going to hire such a company, you should probably not admit to it (laughter) seems to have been the one that animated - especially Bobby Kennedy, who was furious when Simulmatics started saying, oh, well, you know, we're responsible for Kennedy's victory. DAVIES: Right. Well, one of my favorite parts of this story is what happens after the 1960 election, which is that in January, a story appears in Harper's Magazine about Simulmatics and its role in the Kennedy campaign. Tell us about this. LEPORE: Yeah. It's an article called \"The People Machine,\" (laughter) which is super spooky-sounding, and it's by this guy Thomas B. Morgan, who's a freelance writer. He's - you know, he's written for Harper's and Esquire, a lot of other places. Morgan does not reveal that he's Ed Greenfield's best friend (laughter) and that he also was the editor of all those reports. And he goes on to become the director of PR for Simulmatics. DAVIES: The editor of reports that they did for the Kennedy campaign. LEPORE: The - (laughter) yeah. DAVIES: He was right in the middle of this, but none of this is disclosed in the story, right? (LAUGHTER) LEPORE: No, he doesn't disclose any of it. But it is actually a really interesting article, and it's not entirely all boosterism. I mean, Morgan very carefully raises all the ethical questions around - well, OK, so this happened, and we're not 100% sure that it swayed the election, but we should be asking some questions about whether this is - if it does sway elections, is this OK? Is this the right thing to do? But what the Kennedy campaign sees is just this big headline that says, Kennedy used a robot (laughter) and deferred to a robot, like, that his campaign was run by a robot. And Kennedy had run with a lot of opposition to automation, which is a big electoral issue in 1960. So it put him in a real pickle. And it was the - kind of a great story. So it wasn't so much the Harper's story, but - this is, you know, right before the inauguration. All over the country, newspapers - even little newspapers - picked it up and wrote about it and (laughter) - we've elected a robot president. I mean, just, like - just kind of, like, think of kind of 1960s automation dystopia stuff, just kind of all leaks out of this story. And, suddenly, the nation was like, oh, whoa, this is - this could be really bad. And so the Kennedy campaign has to try to, you know, backtrack. And Pierre Salinger - the, you know, spokesperson - says, oh, no, we've never even heard of Simulmatics, which is just, you know, not true (laughter). DAVIES: Just - that was a lie, wasn't it (laughter)? LEPORE: There's a lot of, you know, kind of spin around whether Kennedy had, in fact, been elected by a computer. DAVIES: Right. So - but this idea that he had a secret weapon, which was a robot - I mean, it also provoked serious debate among people who were concerned about the future democracy, right? LEPORE: Yeah. It does. And I think - the argument that wins out eventually, honestly, is the argument that's put forward by Ithiel de Sola Pool, who's the MIT political scientist who's the chairman of the research board for this new company, Simulmatics. He says, you know, you want a political candidate to have as much information as possible. This is information that our technology and scientific research is now able to provide to political campaigns. So who wants to stand in the way of knowledge? We - like, knowledge is a good thing. And progress will be when the other side also has a people machine. If we have two people machines fighting against one another, then that's fair (laughter). And (laughter) that's actually the argument that wins. DAVIES: You mentioned that computers of the day were worked by women. Tell us about the women who worked with these computers and - I don't know - how they saw their roles, how they fit into an organization. LEPORE: So the big purchasers of these mainframe computers in the 1950s were giant corporations that used them for payroll first and for inventory control. And then airlines used them for ticketing and air traffic control purposes. So there just didn't - you know, not a lot of people have - sort of no one has a personal computer. But it's - you really have to be a pretty big company to have them. And the pool of workers who are brought in to work with them is essentially the typing pool. Most computers at this time were run by women. Most of the coding was done by women. You know, women were called computers before the machines came to be called computers. It's women who've been working as typists in these corporations. And then they're brought in to learn how to work with these new machines, which, you know, look like that's what they need. But the intellectual ambition of a lot of these women is to learn how to code and to learn how to code as an intellectual project. They get pushed out of that work. And then, over the course of the 1960s, when the kind of buzzy word is computer man - like, who's a computer man (laughter)? And so the field becomes really masculinized once its status rises and once there are enough computers. That's kind of a forgotten chapter in the history of computing. But for a long time, the coders, the computers were women. DAVIES: All right. So on the strength of all of the attention that it got in the 1960 election, Simulmatics is a hot commodity. And Ed Greenfield sees a world of new clients he can pitch. Who do they pitch to? And what do they tell them they can do? LEPORE: Yeah. So they - he's put together quite a distinguished group of people. The people that work for this company are - it's an incredible array of some of the leading behavioral scientists and early computer scientists as well. They write a stock offering. They go public. You know, it's kind of a splashy initial offering. The clientele that they reach out to - some of which they succeed in bringing in - first, advertising agencies and, you know, big retailers - Colgate-Palmolive, Ralston Purina - those kinds of people. They do kind of brand-switching ad campaigns for them. They have to say, you know, we have this imaginary population of consumers. We have some consumer data that, you know, we've gotten from you, or we got from ad agencies. And we can predict, you know, who's going to switch to your dog food if you say your dog food tastes good, versus who's going to switch to your dog food if you say your dog food makes your dog more energetic. And they do, you know, just very just kind of standard fare today. But it's pioneering at the time. Everything that, you know, is done now they're proposing then. DAVIES: Right. I mean, they claimed they had this people machine, which is, really, kind of a concept. But if I have this right, what they were telling potential clients was that they have crafted 3,000 perfectly representative, though, imaginary people that have all of these characteristics that are sliced in categories that you could test anything on - you know, dog food, breakfast cereal, political messaging - whatever. How close did they come to actually having the goods they were promising? LEPORE: You know, that I find difficult to tell. I found in the archives 10,000 or so punch cards from the election research and, you know, with a bunch of people, including people at the computer history museum, (laughter) tried to rerun the people machine, like, tried to turn it - switch it back on and see - try to have some measure of assessment of it. We couldn't get the FORTRAN program (laughter) cards to work. So this is a plea for anyone who wants to take on this project. DAVIES: (Laughter). LEPORE: It's difficult to assess. You know, we still don't know, for instance, the effect that Cambridge Analytica had on the 2016 Trump campaign or the 2015 Brexit campaign, right? Like, Cambridge Analytica would like us to think that it had a huge effect. But how measurable is it even now with the tools that we have to measure it? So it's quite difficult to say. DAVIES: Yeah. It did strike me, though, I mean, that even though they were probably promising more than they had, they were really successful in getting all these Fortune 500 companies. And it just reminds me that, then as now, success in consulting has a lot more to do with personal relationships and salesmanship than actually delivering meaningful (laughter) services. LEPORE: Yeah. I mean, there's a trade industry newsletter I think in 1962 puts out a story called The Great Computer Hoax in which this guy's like look; the emperor has no clothes. Like, Simulmatics and these other companies that are following, you know, these kind of copycat companies, they got nothing (laughter). Like, you can eyeball this, guys? Like, this is a lot of money for nothing. DAVIES: We need to take a break here. Let me reintroduce you. We're speaking with Jill Lepore. Her book is \"If Then: How The Simulmatics Corporation Invented The Future. \" She'll be back to talk more about the company after this short break. I'm Dave Davies. And this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF FRANK ZAPPA'S \"UNCLE MEAT: MAIN TITLE THEME\") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross. We're speaking with historian and New Yorker staff writer Jill Lepore. Her new book is about an American company formed at the end of the 1950s with the then-revolutionary plan of accumulating data about people and using computers to predict their behavior in voting, shopping and living. The company's clients included the John F. Kennedy presidential campaign, major corporations and the American military in Vietnam. Lepore's book is \"If Then: How The Simulmatics Corporation Invented The Future. \" So, like, in 1961, this company was really riding a wave. I mean, they had this new idea, and they were getting clients right and left. And you tell the story of that summer. These men - and they really were mostly men - these social scientists and ad men gathering at Ed Greenfield's place, I guess, on Long Island on the beach. Give us a picture of what that was like, them and their families. LEPORE: Yeah. So they decide to do a kind of whole-family retreat. So it's a lot of guys with young families, so they bring along their wives and their children to spend the summer in this very futuristic-looking place. Ed Greenfield has an old Victorian house, but right next door is a geodesic dome, you know, this one designed by - an early version of Buckminster Fuller's geodesic dome. So it looks kind of like a spaceship that's just landed there, and they use that as a workplace for coming up with new plans for what the company could do. You know, kind of - like, Greenfield keeps sending people memos like, what's your biggest idea of the day? Trying to stir people up - like, what could we - there's - sky's the limit. You know, and they're in this dome, looking out at the sky. And meanwhile, their wives are, you know, doing what you do on the beach, which is chase after children and, you know, make sure they don't get sunburned and roast corn on the cob in a bonfire at night and make tuna salad sandwiches for everybody and make sure the toddler doesn't go in over her head. And the wives - especially Bill McPhee's wife, this extraordinary woman named Minnow McPhee - write a lot about those - it's not just that summer. There are other summers that they meet again and again and again. And what you see - Minnow McPhee is a preschool teacher - so someone who's really interested in the study of human behavior. She specialized - she studied in, you know, early learning of children. And you see - what really struck me was so much anguish around the disconnect between these men. They're all white men. They're white, liberal men trying to understand the mind of other people, the minds in particular of Black voters, right? So it's white men trying to understand Black people and then the consumers, who are mainly women. And so they're trying to figure out how women think. And meanwhile, like, you know, as - Minnow's just like, they all treat their wives like crap. Like, they're just - it's this horrible - kind of a very bad bargain of 1950s marriages. I mean, some of these people had decent marriages, but the rest of them - almost all of them ended up in divorce and quite acrimonious divorces. There's something, you know, that I think really prefigures the arrogance of Silicon Valley - right? - where these guys - you know, sort of the Zuckerberg kind of guy, like, stands above us all and tries to figure out, you know, how women and people of color think and how they can be influenced - like, the irony of Simulmatics trying to figure out what message the Kennedy campaign should send about civil rights in 1960 when, you know, Black men are sitting in at lunch counters all across the South. Black men and women are demonstrating on the streets. Like, do we need to build a - write a computer program to predict what the effect would be of taking a stronger position on civil rights for Black voters? I mean, it's just - it's kind of nuts, but it's also very much the world that we now live in. DAVIES: You know, by 1964, they were - the company was struggling. And so they find a great new client, the Defense Department of the United States, then getting more and more involved in Vietnam. What did the government think that Simulmatics could do for them in Vietnam? LEPORE: Well, Ithiel de Sola Pool, who was in charge of the Saigon office that Simulmatics opens, had long been involved in the Department of Defense. He was a very determined Cold Warrior, and he shared a lot of the worldview of Robert McNamara, who, you know - who had come, of course, from Ford Motor Company as a systems analyst and who really believed in, you know, running the numbers and running the war by computer. DAVIES: He was the defense secretary for Kennedy and then Johnson, right? LEPORE: Yes. And one of the things that Simulmatics was brought in to do early on was evaluate a computer system that was trying to determine the success of - and the continued loyalty of Vietnamese people living in this confined, rural area. It's this program that was known as the Strategic Hamlet Program. The Department of Defense had computers in Saigon that were running the numbers every day - like, kind of everything you could possibly think of, every possible indicator of what was going on in these hamlets. DAVIES: I think we should just explain what these were was. . . LEPORE: Yeah. DAVIES: People were moved out of villages that were presumed to be sympathetic to the Viet Cong and then moved into these secure - you know, behind-barbed-wire compounds called strategic hamlets. And so it was a pretty radical way of trying to withdraw the popular base of the Viet Cong, and it put people in these areas. LEPORE: Yeah. So even being involved in that program, which was, you know, subject to a great deal of criticism in the United States - especially after '67, say - was a complicated thing. And most of the Simulmatics scientists refused to be involved. They left the company. They refused to go to Saigon. You know, it was a very left, you know, liberal organization. But Pool was very in favor of that program. And so Simulmatics was brought in to evaluate the success of the Strategic Hamlet Program, the databank that is this hamlet dataset that was daily running the numbers to see, you know, was the loyalty of these people - was it assured? Was it rising? Was it falling - so to do some kind of analysis. They also did a lot of measurement of popular opinion among Vietnamese peasants. And so they would drive out in a - you know, with a military escort or be flown into a village with teams of Vietnamese translators - most of these were college students - and ask questions. They would gather enough public opinion information, enough demographic information. And then you have a - you devise a model, and then you make a prediction. DAVIES: Right. And it was really striking that, in doing these public opinion surveys of Vietnamese peasants, that they would come out in military convoys and then kind of expect people to give them honest answers to long lists of questions. What kind of information were they getting from these interviews? LEPORE: Yeah. So I - you know, I spoke to some people who did the interviews, some of the social scientists. But I also spoke to some of the Vietnamese interpreters who, you know, really did the interviews. And they - you know, they - the Vietnamese interpreters said, you know, it was ridiculous. Like, you - everybody thinks you're a spy. Like, everyone's pressure these people are just the CIA posing as academics. And who's to dispute them? And then I'm not going to - you know, basically, I'm not going to try to convince them to tell me the truth 'cause I know that they're vulnerable. You know, the person I'm interviewing is sitting next to somebody, you know, who might rat them out and kill their children in response to what they - how they answer the questions. Like, there's just no - nothing about this set of circumstances that would induce an honest answer. Also, the questions are largely, like, bafflingly irrelevant to these people's lives and the kind of daily suffering that they're enduring during this war. The whole thing is just kind of a travesty. And what surprised me a bit was how clearly the Defense Department understood that it was a travesty and yet continued to fund it. There's just file after file after file in the National Archives of people at the Advanced Research Projects Agency, part of the Department of Defense that oversaw the Simulmatics project, saying, this stuff is nuts. These people are doing meaningless research. And we're paying them again and again and again for it. DAVIES: In the millions. Yeah, yeah. LEPORE: Yeah. They keep saying, let's cut it off. Let's cut this off. Let's cut this off. It's going nowhere. But it's the kind of thing McNamara really liked. DAVIES: How did Simulmatics' work in Vietnam end? Did they leave, or were they fired? LEPORE: They were fired. Each of the reports that they submitted was questioned, and each led to requests that the contracts be terminated. But finally, they were fired in 1968. DAVIES: Let me reintroduce you here. We're going to take another break. We're speaking with Jill Lepore. Her book is \"If Then: How The Simulmatics Corporation Invented The Future. \" We'll talk more after this short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF NAOMI MOON SIEGEL'S \"IT'S NOT SAFE\") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And we're speaking with New Yorker staff writer Jill Lepore poor about her new book, which tells the story of a company formed in the late '50s that pioneered the idea of accumulating data about people and using computers to predict their behavior. The book is called \"If Then: How The Simulmatics Corporation Invented The Future. \" It's interesting that the time when Simulmatics was involved in Vietnam was a time when its work, I gather, was kind of collapsing in the United States. And Ed Greenfield was trying to figure out ways to revive the company. You describe one point at which he actually visited the operation in Saigon. What did you learn about that? LEPORE: Yeah. So he flies out. And the staff are really dubious about him. He at that point has been drinking - begun to drink much more heavily. He's kind of lost control of himself. His marriage is falling apart. A lot of what destroys the company is the instability of their domestic arrangements, kind of, you know, their inability to understand the people that they love. So Greenfield flies out to Saigon and just gets drunk and alienates everyone. And people begin pulling away from the project who had kind of held on, thinking that maybe there could be a way forward. And at that point, Greenfield and Pool also part ways, and Greenfield is forced out of the presidency of the company. DAVIES: Yeah. You said a lot of what destroyed the company was these men's inability to to handle their personal lives and people they love. Can you elaborate on that a bit? LEPORE: Yeah. I mean, I think it's a weirdness of business history that we kind of have a kind of corporate center - corporation-center notion of what is happening in a company in any given time. It's really clear that this company, which is founded on a commitment to the idea that people who aren't white men are mysterious and need to be decoded by computers, kind of can't really endure the absurdity of that idea. It kind of collapses in on itself. You know, the 1960s are a great era of emancipation for just the kind of white women who are married to this kind of guy, you know, the women that gave up their education to raise children. They get caught up in the women's liberation movement. They come to be extraordinarily distressed by what their husbands are doing. It's also the case that for most of these men, especially those who are involved in Vietnam, their sons are opposed to the war. And the family fractures in that way, as well. Greenfield's son Michael strenuously opposed to the Vietnam War, could not forgive his father for making money off of the war. So their families are really falling apart. DAVIES: So after the '60s did anybody even know the name Simulmatics? Did it just disappear? LEPORE: Yeah, I think it completely vanished. I mean, I had certainly not heard of it. There's not really scholarship about it. One of the reasons that it vanished is Ed Greenfield's own dissolution. I mean, most of the records of the company were in New York, where the headquarters were. And the company filed for bankruptcy. Ed, you know, sort of lost to the oblivion of alcoholism. Pretty much think all the archives were destroyed. You mean, this kind of thing - like, someone at some point rented the office and just chucked everything out. So it didn't really leave behind a paper trail that some - like, they all gave their corporation's records to the Harvard Business School or something. There are no corporation records. By 1970, people are writing to you Ithiel de Sola Pool at MIT, asking for - you know, do you have your punch cards? Do you have notes from this study? I'm interested in your Kerner work. And he said, you know, most of it's in New York. And those queries go nowhere. So I - a lot of what I had to do to work on this project was piece together the archive from different institutional collections. But because so many of the scientists were - you know, they were academics, they left their papers to their universities. So there is quite a lot out there. DAVIES: And you managed to meet a lot of the kids of the parents who were involved in it. How did you come upon this story? LEPORE: In 2015, I had an assignment from The New Yorker to write kind of an assessment of the state of the public opinion, the polling industry. And I wrote a piece called \"Politics And The New Machine. \" And it struck me at the time really early in my research that polling is - certainly should be, I guess, obsolete in that with the advent of data analytics companies, data - modern data - modern political data science, you don't have to call somebody up and ask them, you know, a hundred questions to know how they might vote or what they believe about, you know, Biden's latest speech or Trump's latest action 'cause you can find out. You can collect data about them. That's how politics actually works. So I was interested. And then in - for the purpose of the piece in answering, like, when did that begin? If polling is being replaced by data science, when did that begin? And that took me to Simulmatics and the 1960 election work. DAVIES: You know, the stuff that they did that was so controversial - I mean, the idea that you could assemble data and predict how people would react to a political idea or a new product, which was controversial then - is just so completely normal now. And people are collecting, you know, untold amounts of data from us in so many ways, you know, Google and Facebook and hundreds of others. What's the place of Simulmatics in the story of data and its use in the country? LEPORE: You know, I was just reading this quite chilling piece by Sue Halpern in The New Yorker this week about an app that the Trump campaign has been using and how effective it is at drawing your contact information and then also geolocating information in order to send you particular messages - and not only to you, but also to everybody in your contacts list and have gathered information about each of them by cellphone number, which is kind of the gold standard in doing voter research - right? - because you can then - if you know your cellphone number, you know kind of everything. And I was really struck reading that. We have nothing that stops this app from going into your contact lists and gathering all this information not only about you, but about everybody else that you know and then submitting messages to them in your name. How we got to this place is because no one said no to Simulmatics. DAVIES: You know, a lot of this is about how you can manipulate voters. What are you thinking about as you look to the coming election? LEPORE: When I think about what Simulmatics started doing - was really trying to convince the Democratic Party to count Black voters, right? Black voters matter, really, was Ed Greenfield's message. We're going to show you that, mathematically. We're going to build a computer. We're going to build a people machine that can show you that Black voters matter 'cause we need to be stronger on civil rights. Like, it starts with this really noble commitment to civil rights. But what it produces is the world that we have today, where we're all so segmented and micromessaged to that we have no sense of a common good any longer, which is how, you know, a democracy has to work. Like, we actually are not supposed to be going into a voting booth and voting - or sealing a ballot and sticking it in an envelope and voting the way our demographic microsegment says we must because we're actually supposed to be looking at that ballot and thinking about what's good for everyone, that notion of the public good and a public interest, which is the - just the ground on which democracy stands is falling away from beneath our feet. DAVIES: Right. And I guess if those of us who cover elections spend all of our time talking about just the hard politics of it, you know, how demographics will work, we're - that's time we could be spending talking about what's good for the country. LEPORE: Yeah, instead of just reporting the latest national poll, which doesn't really tell us anything since we live an Electoral College system anyway (laughter). I think there are deeper moral and ethical questions that, you know, good reporters are always wrestling with but I would like to hear voters on more, and I would like to hear that a lot more. I mean, I recognize the sexiness and the fun of, you know, FiveThirtyEight and the kind of gamesmanship, and everything is baseball now, or baseball is now computing (laughter). But, you know, I don't like to watch the game where they change the pitcher every three batters because they've got the numbers to do that. Like, baseball is baseball, and democracy is democracy. DAVIES: Well, Jill Lepore, thank you so much for speaking with us again. LEPORE: Thanks so much, Dave. It was a real pleasure.

Netflix's CEO credits the company's unorthodox office culture for its rise. NPR's Bobby Allyn has a closer look. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Unlimited vacation, submitting expenses without approval, being promoted for criticizing your company - these are the perks of working for Netflix, says CEO Reed Hastings. REED HASTINGS: It's risky trusting employees as much as we do, giving them as much freedom as we do. But it's essential in creative companies where you have much greater risk from lack of innovation. ALLYN: In his new book, \"No Rules Rules,\" Hastings discusses his guiding principle - the keeper test. The idea is to ask your boss, if I wanted to leave, how hard would you fight to keep me? If the answer is not very hard, maybe it's time for you to go. HASTINGS: Our culture memo says things like, adequate performance gets a generous severance package. ALLYN: But the ruthless culture has some employees constantly looking over their shoulder. One former Netflix employee told me he lived in constant fear of losing his job and that people of color didn't feel as empowered to offer frank feedback as his white colleagues. He eventually quit. Hastings says people of all backgrounds rise in the company, but Netflix isn't for everyone. HASTINGS: Those who feel fear tend to check out because it's an unpleasant feeling. And, really, it's best suited for people who can acknowledge intellectually the risks, but, in fact, they're so joyful about playing with great teammates. JONATHAN KNEE: There are certainly versions of this that would clearly be completely destructive, right? ALLYN: Jonathan Knee is a Columbia Business School professor and former investment banker. He likes Netflix's culture. He says it's actually better than what happens in most American offices. KNEE: People are not rewarded for giving feedback. There's going to be emotions. There's human beings. Somebody is going to cry, you know - something. You just don't want to. It's like, you know what? Let's just wait.

Reporter Jeff Lunden checked in with Playbill, the program magazine that's given out at theaters, to see how its operations have changed. JEFF LUNDEN, BYLINE: Playbill has been around for 136 years. And it's not just a program; it's a cherished souvenir, says Alex Birsh, the company's vice president. ALEX BIRSH: It has become kind of the best memento of your night out at the theater. And we find ourselves incredibly fortunate to be associated with this ridiculously fantastic art form that we miss, oh, so much. LUNDEN: In normal times, this small family-owned company distributes programs for up to 3 1/2 million theatergoers a month in 125 venues across the country - for free because of the ads for cars and jewelry and restaurants. A BIRSH: We lost 75% to 80% of our revenue because of theater being closed. LUNDEN: Playbill got a PPP loan, which lasted a couple of months, but had to furlough half its staff. So for the time being, it's digital only. And here's the kicker - before the pandemic, playbill. com attracted about 2 million unique users a month; now it's over 3 million. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"I AM WHAT I AM\")ALEXANDRA BILLINGS: (As character, singing) I am what I am. . . LUNDEN: During the pandemic, Ruthie Fierberg - Playbill's features editor - has begun producing online performances for the website. On the 51st anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, she put together a Gay Pride program. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"I AM WHAT I AM\")B D WONG: (As character, singing) . . . Sometimes the deuces. . . LUNDEN: And in celebration of the 19th Amendment, she produced a Women in Theater special. RUTHIE FIERBERG: These full-on hour-and-a-half benefit concert spectaculars that you are more accustomed to seeing on CBS after a hurricane is something that you are now seeing on playbill. com and Playbill's YouTube channel instead. LUNDEN: With Broadway idled, Playbill has been able to get all kinds of theater stars to appear online, like B. D. Wong, Alexandra Billings and Brandon Victor Dixon.

LUNDEN: Vice President Alex Birsh says this has been a big shift for the company. A BIRSH: It has been a remarkable 180 to be serving within theaters, at productions and then now producing productions ourselves online. LUNDEN: And Playbill is creating photo galleries, quizzes and contests online as well. FELICIA FITZPATRICK: My philosophy has always been - let's create a digital community of Broadway fans. LUNDEN: Felicia Fitzpatrick is the social media director. She says she's seen an uptick in engagement. FITZPATRICK: Theater kids have so many opinions, and they love sharing them, and I love them for it, right? LUNDEN: So in one social media challenge, she invited fans to sing on the website. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"BLUE HAIR\")UNIDENTIFIED SINGER: (Singing) I'm going to do what I want to, and I want to dye my hair blue. LUNDEN: Playbill's president, Philip Birsh, says he's proud of the way the company has adapted to the moment but knows it's going to be a while before theater comes back. PHILIP BIRSH: We'll have to reinvest our own capital back into the company in order to bring it up to speed once Broadway is back. But we will return. LUNDEN: In the meantime, theatergoers are going to have to get their fix of show tunes and high kicks online. For NPR News, I'm Jeff Lunden in New York. (SOUNDBITE OF NEIL COWLEY TRIO'S \"MEYER\") RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:   With theaters on Broadway and across the country shut down, companies that service the performing arts have had to adapt. Reporter Jeff Lunden checked in with Playbill, the program magazine that's given out at theaters, to see how its operations have changed. JEFF LUNDEN, BYLINE: Playbill has been around for 136 years. And it's not just a program; it's a cherished souvenir, says Alex Birsh, the company's vice president. ALEX BIRSH: It has become kind of the best memento of your night out at the theater. And we find ourselves incredibly fortunate to be associated with this ridiculously fantastic art form that we miss, oh, so much. LUNDEN: In normal times, this small family-owned company distributes programs for up to 3 1/2 million theatergoers a month in 125 venues across the country - for free because of the ads for cars and jewelry and restaurants. A BIRSH: We lost 75% to 80% of our revenue because of theater being closed. LUNDEN: Playbill got a PPP loan, which lasted a couple of months, but had to furlough half its staff. So for the time being, it's digital only. And here's the kicker - before the pandemic, playbill. com attracted about 2 million unique users a month; now it's over 3 million. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"I AM WHAT I AM\") ALEXANDRA BILLINGS: (As character, singing) I am what I am. . . LUNDEN: During the pandemic, Ruthie Fierberg - Playbill's features editor - has begun producing online performances for the website. On the 51st anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, she put together a Gay Pride program. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"I AM WHAT I AM\") B D WONG: (As character, singing) . . . Sometimes the deuces. . . LUNDEN: And in celebration of the 19th Amendment, she produced a Women in Theater special. RUTHIE FIERBERG: These full-on hour-and-a-half benefit concert spectaculars that you are more accustomed to seeing on CBS after a hurricane is something that you are now seeing on playbill. com and Playbill's YouTube channel instead. LUNDEN: With Broadway idled, Playbill has been able to get all kinds of theater stars to appear online, like B. D. Wong, Alexandra Billings and Brandon Victor Dixon.

The report says these failures contributed to two Max plane crashes killing 346 people. Here's NPR's David Schaper. DAVID SCHAPER, BYLINE: The House Transportation Committee investigation finds that there was no singular technical flaw or pilot failure that led to the deadly 737 Max plane crashes in Indonesia in October of 2018 and Ethiopia the following March. Instead, it describes the circumstances that led up to them almost like a perfect storm, calling it the horrific culmination of a series of faulty technical assumptions by Boeing's engineers, a lack of transparency on the part of Boeing's management and grossly insufficient oversight by the FAA. The report details Boeing's flawed design of a new automated flight control system on the plane and mistakes in using outdated and faulty assumptions of pilot response as well as a culture of concealment, keeping information from the FAA, its customers and the pilots who would fly the plane. PETER DEFAZIO: There's something that came out of this that's just - it's mind-boggling. SCHAPER: House Transportation Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio oversaw the inquiry and says what's mind-boggling is that both Boeing and the FAA contend they followed proper procedures. It found the 737 Max to be compliant. DEFAZIO: That's the bureaucratic word - it was compliant. But the problem is it was compliant and not safe, and people died. SCHAPER: The report also details how Boeing employees were under enormous pressure to keep costs down and the plane on schedule. Aviation Subcommittee Chairman Rick Larsen says misguided priorities of senior management drove a number of troubling decisions. RICK LARSEN: In one case, senior management went as far as installing countdown clocks in conference rooms, making clear to Max employees that meeting production timelines rather than safety was a top priority. SCHAPER: The congressional investigation is one of many into what caused the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max plane crashes. Christine Negroni is an aviation journalist and author of the book \"The Crash Detectives. \" And she says while much of this information isn't new. . . CHRISTINE NEGRONI: In the whole, what is, to me, astonishing about the report is the depth, the thickness and the deep history of both FAA and Boeing knowing that there were problems with the redesign of this airliner and the obliviousness of both parties in recognizing that this was a problem that needed to be addressed. SCHAPER: Another thing Negroni finds remarkable is that a number of people did raise safety concerns about the 737 Max. But those were either inadequately addressed or just dismissed by Boeing, many of them never seeing the light of day at the FAA. And that's an especially painful realization for the families of those who died in the Max crashes. MICHAEL STUMO: It angers us to see how much Boeing did to cover this up and how much FAA has done to help them cover it up. SCHAPER: Michael Stumo's daughter, 24-year-old Samya Rose Stumo, was on the plane that crash last year in Ethiopia. He believes evidence in this report now shows that the first plane crash in Indonesia was preventable. STUMO: But then the covering up to keep the Max in the air after the Lion Air crash so that it crashed again in Ethiopia and killed my daughter was unforgivable. SCHAPER: In a statement, a Boeing spokesman says the company has learned many hard lessons from the plane crashes and its mistakes and has made fundamental changes to the company's safety culture and protocols as a result. The House Transportation Committee is now drafting legislation to improve FAA oversight in certifying planes. A Senate committee is expected to take up its own FAA reform bill later today.

In California, local governments rely on a hodgepodge of methods to tell residents to flee to safer ground. As KQED's Lily Jamali reports, better technology has helped get the message out, but it's far from perfect. LILY JAMALI, BYLINE: Last month, when the LNU Lightning Complex fire made it to California's Yolo County near Sacramento, Sarah Johnson checked the Internet, social media, even a scanner to make sure that any wildfires remained far from the horse ranch where she lives and works. SARAH JOHNSON: Probably one of the biggest mistakes I ever made was going to sleep that night. I figured if something was happening, they would let us know. JAMALI: As the fire approached, a phone call came in - not from Yolo County's mass alert system, but from someone who boards a horse at the ranch. Johnson and others scrambled to round them up. It was time to go. JOHNSON: And I remember at one point I just had to catch myself 'cause it's like, you want to ugly cry (laughter) but, like, you need to keep moving to get these horses out of the area. JAMALI: It turns out county officials had sent mass alert phone calls to evacuate, but a year-old state law aimed at blocking robocalls meant that every single one of those calls got blocked. The problems didn't stop there. County officials say text messages which also went out didn't ping phones set to do not disturb, which many are in the middle of the night. DAVE WINNACKER: Legacy systems like Reverse 911 that rely on landlines are becoming less and less relevant. JAMALI: Chief Dave Winnacker of the Bay Area's Moraga-Orinda Fire District says smartphones have complicated existing systems, like Reverse 911, that can generate mass emergency calls to the public. But smartphones can also be a valuable tool in emergencies. WINNACKER: Everyone has what used to be a supercomputer in their pocket. JAMALI: There's been innovation even in the middle of this horrific fire season by necessity. Take the CZU Lightning Complex fire near Santa Cruz, an area that wasn't expected to burn. This year, it did. Enter the techies. A startup called Zonehaven helped officials quickly map out evacuation zones and, critically, auto-push notifications across a bunch of platforms. Here's the CEO, Charlie Crocker. CHARLIE CROCKER: Every three to four hours for a while, we were starting to communicate to the community that it was time for them to leave, and then we were able to communicate that using the maps and using Twitter and using Waze. JAMALI: Not to mention the area's existing mass alert systems. While pushing that information out, people also had a site they could visit with information updated in real time. CROCKER: Being able to sort out the wheat from the chaff is difficult. With Zonehaven, we are bringing an authoritative source that is connected directly to the agencies to the public. JAMALI: But Zonehaven hasn't been adopted everywhere. In Butte County, where the Camp Fire destroyed the town of Paradise in 2018, killing 85 people, the fire moved too fast for officials to use their emergency notification app. As fire approached again last week, Sheriff Kory Honea urged people to sign up for it. But, he said. . . KORY HONEA: We have seen far too often in this county people fail to abide by those orders, and tragic consequences were the result.

Hi, Bobby. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Hey, Sacha. PFEIFFER: And, Bobby, a huge number of people in the U. S. view and create the short videos you can view and create on TikTok. What does this news mean for all those people? ALLYN: Well, it means you won't be able to download TikTok. If you search for it in an app store on your phone, it won't be there, and that's a huge deal. Now, for those out there who already have TikTok and enjoy using it, the app won't be getting critical updates. So those people will see it freezing. It will be slower. It might crash more often. Eventually it won't function at all. PFEIFFER: And what about WeChat? Because some people think of TikTok as frivolous, but when it comes to WeChat, many Chinese nationals in the U. S. rely on it. Many American companies do business - that do business with China rely on it. ALLYN: Exactly. Yeah, WeChat will be dead in the U. S. on midnight Sunday. It won't be possible to communicate or to make payments on the app. And like you said, WeChat is not some boutique service. It's used by more than a billion people around the world. This has major economic consequences. WeChat's parent company Tencent called the Trump administration's action, quote, \"unfortunate. \" So again, WeChat is about to be completely shut down. TikTok, on the other hand, will soon lose some functions and get slow. But Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Fox Business that TikTok does have a total shutdown date, and it is nine days after the presidential election. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)WILBUR ROSS: If there's not a deal by November 12 under the provisions of the old order, then TikTok also would be, for all practical purposes, shut down. PFEIFFER: Bobby, there's been an effort to find an American buyer for TikTok. Where does that effort stand? ALLYN: Yeah, those talks are extremely fluid. Software company Oracle and Walmart appear to be the lead bidders. But the parties are still hashing out a lot of details. Now, if a deal is finalized and Trump approves it, that could really change things, right? I mean, it could make the administration withdraw these orders, and that would relieve a lot of pressure on the apps. Trump today said a deal, quote, \"could go very, very fast. \"PFEIFFER: Bobby, you're based in Silicon Valley, tech epicenter. How is the tech world responding to this news? ALLYN: Many are very alarmed, Sacha. I talked to Alex Stamos. He's the former chief security officer at Facebook. And he worries about the slippery slope effect here. He says, what if this encourages other countries to start banning apps they don't like? ALEX STAMOS: It's a very dangerous precedent to send around the world, that the United States is acting like the Chinese do. In a democracy, we should have rules that are fairly applied and adjudicated by the judicial branch, not just by fiat and the president. ALLYN: And, you know, some legal scholars told me, you know, these bans are tantamount to a ban of a newspaper or a TV channel or a website.

Most of its future growth is outside of the U. S. So what if Trump's actions here open the door to similar prohibitions on social media? PFEIFFER: That's NPR tech reporter Bobby Allyn.

S. app stores. That was the announcement from the U. S. Commerce Department today. The Chinese-owned apps have been the target of the Trump administration. They say the apps collect data from American users that could be accessed by the Chinese government. A sale of TikTok has been in the works, but so far, no deal has been finalized. And let's turn to NPR's Bobby Allyn, who's been following this story. Good morning, Bobby. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Hey, David. GREENE: So, I mean, some, like, millions of people use these apps in the United States, right? So what exactly is that going to mean for them on Sunday? ALLYN: Yeah. So we've been hearing a lot about the TikTok ban, right? I feel like it's in the headlines quite a bit. Well, here it is. And this is basically what it looks like. So TikTok is going to be banned from app stores. You know, that's where you go on your iPhone or Android and download the app. Well, you're not going to be able to download it anymore. That's a huge blow for TikTok. You know, it's one of the most popular apps in the world right now. Now, if you already have the app, as 100 million Americans do, updates are going to stop. And that could mean it could slow down or it could get really buggy. But, you know, if you're hearing this and you love or your kids love making lip syncing and dance videos on TikTok, you already have it on your phone, it's not going to, like, disappear, but it's going to get a lot more difficult for the company to maintain that. And you might notice that as a user. GREENE: Wow. OK. So it might not change immediately, but you're really going to start noticing as time goes on when you can't do those updates or anything. ALLYN: Exactly. Yep. GREENE: So in making this announcement, did the Commerce Department give any more details about these national security concerns that are really at the heart of all this? ALLYN: In short, no. The Commerce Department says, you know, this shows the Trump administration will do everything in its power to protect Americans from threats from the Chinese Communist Party. Now, whether TikTok actually poses a threat is another matter entirely. The company, for its part, says it doesn't share U. S. user data with China and that all decisions about Americans' data is made by a team led in the U. S. But, you know, TikTol says it can also share data with its Beijing parent company ByteDance. And the Trump administration has long said if China comes knocking on TikTok's door and asks for Americans' data, they will have to provide it under Chinese law. So even though we don't have any example of that actually happening, the White House says the mere possibility of it is enough to crack down on TikTok. And here's the crackdown on TikTok. GREENE: I mean, you mention we've seen these headlines, and a lot of the speculation has been whether an American company could take over the domestic operations of TikTok - hasn't happened yet. Is there still time, were that to happen? I mean, could this ban in theory go away and TikTok users could jump back on and get those updates and get the app if they don't have it? ALLYN: Yeah. Well, first, I have to say the TikTok deal is just like the deal that will never end (laughter). It's just been dragging on and dragging on and dragging on. Yeah. So the current state of play on the TikTok sale is this software company, Oracle, with some backing from Walmart, of all places, appears to be the top bidder. And I've been in touch with folks who are close to the negotiations, and it seems to be a key sticking point here is who will have a majority stake in the company? And I'm hearing the latest proposal says that Oracle and Walmart will have the majority stake. And why is that important? Because the question is who will have the final say at the end of the day - Oracle, this U. S. company, or ByteDance in Beijing? And, you know, the Trump administration - and President Trump has the final say here, and he has insisted that if Oracle does not have the final say, that national security concerns and the privacy of Americans will not be protected. So we just got to see how this is going to unfold, but the president is giving parties until November to figure this out. And until then, TikTok could get more rickety in everyone's phones.

Well, let's see. There's Tinder, Bumble, eHarmony, LinkedIn. One of these is not like the other. The community guidelines for the professional networking website prohibit romantic advances, but it turns out quite a few people have used it for just that. Reporter Ben Bergman wrote about it for the tech site dot. LA, and he joins us now. Welcome. BEN BERGMAN: Thanks. Good to be here. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So LinkedIn as a love site - you write that women in particular have been receiving unwanted advances through LinkedIn. What kind of stories were they telling you? BERGMAN: Well, you know, this is a pretty common thing for a lot of women - guys who say, hey, you're really beautiful. Do you want to have coffee? And that's sometimes the most innocuous things. It can be messages that are a lot more graphic than that sometimes. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Why might it be a place where someone would look for a date? BERGMAN: Well, there's too many dating apps to choose from, I think a lot of people would say. But there's still a bit of a stigma for at least some people - maybe people who are CEOs or a little bit more prominent in their field - who don't want to be seen on a dating app. So they are perhaps on LinkedIn and not on dating apps, and people will use it as a way to connect on there instead of overtly being on a dating app. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So obviously, in the age of #MeToo, which has really exposed how women have been subjected to unwanted sexual advances in the workplace - you know, this is a place that is meant to be a networking site. So what kind of action has LinkedIn taken? BERGMAN: The company says it is taking action. It will follow up with users who have reported inappropriate messages, and it will also tell users who are blocked exactly why they were removed, which apparently it has not done up until now. It also says it's using AI to detect possible problematic messages. And so it will flag those messages and give you the opportunity to block them. The company also says, though, that users need to do more. It says users should be keeping a tighter network. And if you don't know someone, if you don't think they should be in your network, then don't accept their friend request. GARCIA-NAVARRO: On the other hand, you did speak to a dating coach from eHarmony who said it's not inappropriate to ask for a date on LinkedIn. What did she say? BERGMAN: This was kind of surprising 'cause I actually talked to a number of dating coaches. And, yes, that is a real job, apparently. And they say that there's a sense of authenticity there. You actually know where someone worked and went to school, and the information there is much more real than other sites and that there's a lot of professionals - just like, you know, you may ask someone out at a professional networking event, you can do the same thing on LinkedIn. And they've met a lot of people, and some of them themselves have met their significant others on LinkedIn. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Has this been an issue for LinkedIn users for a while, or is there something that has created an uptick? BERGMAN: It's certainly nothing brand-new. It's gotten a little bit worse over the years. But during the pandemic, I've seen anecdotally a lot more of this happening because what happens now is a lot of women will receive these messages, and then they will post them on Twitter and say, LinkedIn is not a dating site. Look at what happened. But during the pandemic, there's not really ways to meet people in person, in the office or at bars or at parties, so it's all online. And so LinkedIn is one way to do that. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Ben Bergman is the senior reporter at dot. LA. Thank you so much. BERGMAN: Pleasure to do it.

BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: This is how some of the hundred million Americans who use TikTok learned about the app being rescued - from a TikTok made by 17-year-old Bonnie Gumball in East Texas.

ALLYN: Indeed, Trump says he's supporting a deal in which software company Oracle will team up with Walmart to form a new company, TikTok Global. Here's President Trump. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It will have nothing to do with China. It'll be totally secure. That'll be part of the deal, and it will be both Oracle, as you know, and Walmart. ALLYN: Oracle will house TikTok's data on Americans. Walmart is a major investor and will let people shop for products through TikTok. The China part, though, Trump didn't get exactly right. Oracle and Walmart will own a combined 20% of the new company. TikTok's parent company in Beijing, ByteDance - they're keeping 80% of the company, all of which is to say months of executive orders, lawsuits and confusing mixed messages about the future of TikTok, and we're left with a new company that is mostly Chinese-owned? CHRIS KELLY: The interactions with the Chinese government and the ability of the Chinese government to put pressure on the ByteDance company is still substantial. ALLYN: Chris Kelly is the former chief privacy officer at Facebook. He says Oracle babysitting TikTok user data will provide a buffer against a possible intrusion from Chinese authorities, which has been what the White House's fear has been all along. But Kelly says having most of the app's ownership in Beijing could still be a vulnerability for the data of Americans. KELLY: Will there be enough safeguards built in when there have been issues of foreign governments trying to infiltrate American companies? And so when you have that close tie that's remaining, will there be a complete ability to avoid that? ALLYN: Trump signed an order last month saying ByteDance was supposed to completely divest from TikTok in the U. S. , and that did not happen. But what's important is who the decision-makers are. TikTok says 4 out of the 5 new board members will be Americans. Weifeng Zhong researches U. S. -China economic relations at George Mason University. WEIFENG ZHONG: If Oracle doesn't have the final say, I would be very skeptical about this deal. ALLYN: However much power over TikTok Oracle has, it did emerge from all of this a big winner. Oracle is a software company that runs a cloud computing business that has been lagging behind Amazon, Microsoft and Google. Hosting millions and millions of users' data will be a big moneymaker for them. Trump and Oracle chief executive Larry Ellison have a history.

Those rumors are false. But so far, these companies have failed to stop misinformation, some of it dangerous, from spreading. Facebook, I should note, is a financial supporter of NPR. And here's our Shannon Bond. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Cameron Hill and his family were fleeing fires in Clackamas County south of Portland. And they'd heard some disturbing rumors. CAMERON HILL: I heard that police had several activists in custody. . . MONICA SAMAYOA, BYLINE: Really? HILL: . . . Down in Eugene starting - actually seen starting fires. BOND: That's Hill talking with Oregon Public Broadcasting's Monica Samayoa. These arson claims were not true, but they were lighting up social media. The rumor was the fires had been set by antifascist activists, known as antifa, or Black Lives Matter protesters. The rumors caused so much disruption, local police departments took to Facebook and Twitter to beg people to stop spreading them. They said there was no evidence that any political or activist groups were behind the fires. Tim Fox is a captain with the Oregon State Police. TIM FOX: You know, all these rumors and things that are going around are tough because we have to find people to respond to them, to investigate them, to check them out. BOND: Part of the reason these claims spread so widely on Facebook is that the world's biggest social network rewards engagement. Posts that get lots of shares, comments and likes get shown to more people, quickly amplifying their reach. As the fire rumors proliferated, Facebook did put warnings on some posts its fact-checkers found false. And after the FBI put out a statement debunking the rumors, Facebook began removing posts entirely. But by then, the rumors had been circulating for several days. KAREN KORNBLUH: And what that said to us is that they're waiting too long. BOND: Karen Kornbluh and her research team at The German Marshall Fund found these rumors spreading in private Facebook groups, some with hundreds of thousands of members. And the claims were being amplified by social media accounts known to spread false information, like followers of QAnon, a baseless conspiracy theory. A Facebook spokesman says the company acts aggressively to stop misinformation. But what happened in Oregon shows that once this kind of hoax starts spreading, it's really hard to stamp out. DOLORES ALBARRACIN: When you think of the psychology of misinformation, you know, you can think of something like molding clay. BOND: Dolores Albarracin is a psychology professor at the University of Illinois. ALBARRACIN: And when you have soft clay, you can print anything you want onto it. Once it dries out, though, that's it. Your print or shape is set. BOND: So while fact checks and removing posts can help, the real challenge is stopping harmful hoaxes from going viral in the first place. And some experts have a new idea about how to hit pause on social media's powerful amplification engine. Erin Simpson at the left-leaning Center for American Progress says the inspiration is the stock market. ERIN SIMPSON: So if the S&P drops really suddenly, we've had these thresholds in place for, you know, a lot of years now that the market will stop and that will automatically trigger, like, review. BOND: Those automatic triggers are called circuit breakers. Simpson says that's what social media - needs a circuit breaker to stop the viral spread that platforms are designed to encourage. So when a controversial topic is gaining steam, Facebook or Twitter could limit its reach while reviewing disputed information. SIMPSON: A system like this could maybe make it harder for stuff to go viral, instead of the status quo, which is a set of Facebook business products make it easier to go viral. BOND: The idea is even gaining traction inside Facebook. It says it's testing this kind of speed bump for viral posts. Shannon Bond, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF MARLEY CARROLL'S \"MIGRATION\") NOEL KING, HOST:   There are rumors that have gone viral on Twitter and Facebook that left-wing activists started the fires the wildfires in Oregon. Those rumors are false. But so far, these companies have failed to stop misinformation, some of it dangerous, from spreading. Facebook, I should note, is a financial supporter of NPR. And here's our Shannon Bond. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Cameron Hill and his family were fleeing fires in Clackamas County south of Portland. And they'd heard some disturbing rumors. CAMERON HILL: I heard that police had several activists in custody. . . MONICA SAMAYOA, BYLINE: Really? HILL: . . . Down in Eugene starting - actually seen starting fires. BOND: That's Hill talking with Oregon Public Broadcasting's Monica Samayoa. These arson claims were not true, but they were lighting up social media. The rumor was the fires had been set by antifascist activists, known as antifa, or Black Lives Matter protesters. The rumors caused so much disruption, local police departments took to Facebook and Twitter to beg people to stop spreading them. They said there was no evidence that any political or activist groups were behind the fires. Tim Fox is a captain with the Oregon State Police. TIM FOX: You know, all these rumors and things that are going around are tough because we have to find people to respond to them, to investigate them, to check them out. BOND: Part of the reason these claims spread so widely on Facebook is that the world's biggest social network rewards engagement. Posts that get lots of shares, comments and likes get shown to more people, quickly amplifying their reach. As the fire rumors proliferated, Facebook did put warnings on some posts its fact-checkers found false. And after the FBI put out a statement debunking the rumors, Facebook began removing posts entirely. But by then, the rumors had been circulating for several days. KAREN KORNBLUH: And what that said to us is that they're waiting too long.

S. , home to Google and Apple. Well, those two tech giants have now teamed up to help public health agencies use cellphones to track coronavirus infections. NPR's Jason Beaubien reports. JASON BEAUBIEN, BYLINE: When Virginia launched its COVIDWISE app at the beginning of August, Huda Mohamed thought the app was a really good idea. HUDA MOHAMED: I figured it was a great way of keeping myself COVID-safe 'cause I have an immunodeficiency. BEAUBIEN: But for weeks, Mohamed, who's studying microbiology and dietetics at James Madison University, wasn't even sure it was working. MOHAMED: I would be out and about, and I would wait for the notification, but the notification never came. BEAUBIEN: Then campus reopened. Students flooded back to Harrisonburg. Within a week, there were so many COVID cases on campus the university had to shut down in-person classes. That's when a push notification popped up on Mohamed's phone, saying she had 12 potential exposures. MOHAMED: It was a little scary because, like, I don't know exactly when that could've happened. And I started, like, in my head retracing my steps, thinking about who I was around that day. BEAUBIEN: Despite that initial notification on her home screen, when she opened the app, it said zero exposures. Mohamed wasn't sure what to do. She doesn't have health insurance or a doctor to call. So. . . MOHAMED: Like I said, I've been avoiding people this week. BEAUBIEN: It turns out she didn't have to. The push notification from Apple was a weekly summary of potential but not yet confirmed exposures. Mobile apps that use the Google/Apple technology monitor Bluetooth signals of users who are within six feet of each other for at least 15 minutes. JEFF STOVER: It doesn't collect location, doesn't collect names. BEAUBIEN: Jeff Stover with the Virginia Department of Health says that if one of the app users later tests positive, they can anonymously alert other users. Stover says despite some confusion with the push notifications, the rollout of the app is going well. With more than a half a million downloads, Virginia has more users than any other state. And Stover says the app can reach people who traditional contact tracers would never even track down. For example. . . STOVER: If I went to the local hardware store four days ago and I stood in line for 15 minutes, you know, 'cause it was just taking a while and I ended up being positive, I have no idea who that person was in front of me in line. And at least through an exposure notification app, that person might get an exposure notification. BEAUBIEN: But the reality is that very few people are getting those notifications. Since Google and Apple launched their platform in late May, the U. S. has recorded more than 4. 5 million additional cases of COVID. These smartphone systems have sent out alerts on only a few hundred of them. Other countries which have launched national apps, such as Germany, Ireland and Singapore, have had far higher use of these systems. VIVIAN SINGLETARY: And that really comes back to how public health operates in the U. S. BEAUBIEN: Vivian Singletary is the director of the Public Health Informatics Institute in Atlanta, which has hosted several forums for public health officials on this new technology. Short of the federal government issuing an app, each state has had to build its own. SINGLETARY: We do not have national public health law, per se, that governs everybody across every state. BEAUBIEN: The notification apps also require relatively new smartphones, which the elderly and some others at high risk for the disease might not have. Also, to protect users' privacy, the system doesn't report the exact time, location or duration of any potential exposure. Huda Mohamed, who was initially excited about the app, says it's less powerful than she'd hoped. MOHAMED: I think I expected more, honestly. I expected it to actually notify me, like I said, like, when it happened. BEAUBIEN: Despite this, several additional states are expected to launch apps in the coming weeks. Jason Beaubien, NPR News.

S. app stores, at least for now. A federal judge in Washington sided with the company last night, blocking President Trump's order that bans the video sharing app. The Trump administration, let's remember, calls the app a national security threat and is fighting in court to block TikTok's tock Chinese parent company, ByteDance from operating the app in the U. S. either by banning it outright or forcing a sale to a domestic buyer. We have NPR tech reporter Bobby Allyn here. Good morning, Bobby. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Good morning, David. GREENE: OK, so what is this court decision? What does it mean? ALLYN: So the judge put the brakes on a ban that was going to, like you said, prevent any new downloads of TikTok. That was supposed to take effect at midnight Sunday. And the judge didn't explain his rationale for the ruling. But TikTok's lawyers argued in a hearing just over the weekend that shutting it down would be like shutting down a modern version of the town square. They said that's akin to silencing speech. And there sure is a lot of expression on TikTok, David. I mean, it's the fastest-growing app in the world. You know, it has some hundred million users in the U. S. So, you know, all those users can now breathe a sigh of relief. They can keep posting their lip syncing and other ridiculous videos for now, that is. GREENE: It's been such an important relief for so many people going through these times of isolation. You say for now. That's important, right? I mean, this might not be the final word at all. ALLYN: No, yeah, exactly. So this is a breather for TikTok. It buys them time before there's more extensive hearing on Trump's ban. And it's important to note here that the White House is not backing down from that ban. But as this winds its way through the courts, there's one very important date. And that is November 12. That's when TikTok has to find a American buyer or disappear for real in the U. S. TikTok was hoping that the judge would also push back that date. But the judge said, no, we're sticking to the November 12 date. GREENE: Well, I mean, we heard so much about the potential deal that was supposed to keep TikTok alive in the U. S. for good. What's the latest there? ALLYN: Yeah, there was hope at one point. You know, parties were racing towards an agreement. But then things sort of went south pretty quickly. Trump gave the green light to software company Oracle to take a stake in TikTok. And Walmart was going to be a major investor. But then over in Beijing, ByteDance, which owns TikTok, said, hey, hey, not so fast. We don't want to lose control of the biggest app to ever come out of China. So talks have stalled. But, you know, the parties haven't given up. You know, they're still discussing how they can maybe resolve this. But the stakes are so high, David, for TikTok. I mean, even a temporary ban could mean 90% of TikTok's users will quit and join the competitors because, you know, in light of this happening, many other apps have cropped up that see opportunity here and are trying to take, you know, the users who maybe think TikTok might go away and hope that they jump over to their platform. GREENE: What about this basic question, Bobby? Like, is our data safe on TiokTok if, you know, we're using it in the United States? ALLYN: Yeah, this is at the very heart of the debate. You know, the Trump administration says having a Chinese owner creates a national security risk since China's government has, you know, unfettered access to private business in the country. And there is a consensus among experts that that's a real concern. But the particular threat from TikTok - that's a lot shakier. The White House has never offered ironclad evidence that China can definitely get its hands on the data of Americans. And TikTok says it's shielded because none of the data is stored on Chinese soil. And most of its data on Americans is encrypted. That said, David, none of those assurances are cooling the heat from the White House. GREENE: All right. This journey continues. ALLYN: Indeed.

The federal government estimates that more than a third of rural America has little or no Internet. But as NPR's Kirk Siegler reports, some see opportunity even in this moment of crisis. KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: These past seven months have been a big strain on families like Mandi Boren's. The Borens are cattle ranchers on a remote slice of land near Idaho's Owyhee Mountains. They have four kids in school. MANDI BOREN: When COVID hit and we went online, I thought, oh, that's great. I'll be able to get my kids' schooling done in a few hours. And then they'll be able to work with dad. And no problem. It'll be great. It didn't turn out so great. SIEGLER: She had set up an improvised classroom on a big table inside their house. BOREN: We have this little port here that we can plug in everyone's devices. SIEGLER: Everyone plugs into their satellite Internet, the only way to get online out here. It's spotty, and that's on a good day. Forget trying to Zoom or use Google Classroom. BOREN: I soon found out that our Internet speeds are so slow, and having four kids trying to do schooling at the same time didn't work so well. So we had to spread it out - all week long, actually. We were doing schooling on Saturdays and Sundays as well. SIEGLER: Her kids started back in person for now, but this pandemic has shined a glaring light on a lot of inequalities. And educators worry the rural-urban divide will only worsen if kids here can't get online to learn. Last spring, many districts resorted to delivering paper schoolwork to students who didn't have Internet or cell service at home. LESLIE MOLINA: I don't know why anybody would rationally think we can just hand you a packet and, here, you're going to go teach yourself. Like, that's basically what was going on (laughter). SIEGLER: Nearby in Nevada, Leslie Molina is the principal at McDermitt Combined on the Fort McDermitt Reservation. All 105 of her students qualify for free or reduced lunch, and about 75% have no Internet at home. MOLINA: Plus, we're also so extremely rural. I mean, we're 80 miles from a Walmart. SIEGLER: When a fifth of tribal members tested positive for coronavirus, the school decided to start back virtually, at least for the first couple weeks. But they've had time to plan. Nevada was already trying to get every student outfitted with tablets and cellular hotspots. And due to the pandemic, CARES Act money is fast-tracking that. So when McDermitt schools reopened September 8, Molina ditched those dreaded paper packets. MOLINA: So we spent that week troubleshooting a lot of technology and calling and hounding parents and students if they weren't on that, hey, remember - this is a required piece. Like, it's not optional. You don't get to turn in whatever you want. It's just like coming to school. You have to come to your class.

SIEGLER: Idaho is also using CARES Act money to build out broadband, but Boren recently learned the fiber won't reach her ranch by a year-end deadline. So for now, she's depending on her kids' school staying in person so long as it's safe. Kirk Siegler, NPR News, Boise. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:   As American schools struggle to reopen, many rural districts are worried that their students will fall even further behind than their city peers. The federal government estimates that more than a third of rural America has little or no Internet. But as NPR's Kirk Siegler reports, some see opportunity even in this moment of crisis. KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: These past seven months have been a big strain on families like Mandi Boren's. The Borens are cattle ranchers on a remote slice of land near Idaho's Owyhee Mountains. They have four kids in school. MANDI BOREN: When COVID hit and we went online, I thought, oh, that's great. I'll be able to get my kids' schooling done in a few hours. And then they'll be able to work with dad. And no problem. It'll be great. It didn't turn out so great. SIEGLER: She had set up an improvised classroom on a big table inside their house. BOREN: We have this little port here that we can plug in everyone's devices. SIEGLER: Everyone plugs into their satellite Internet, the only way to get online out here. It's spotty, and that's on a good day. Forget trying to Zoom or use Google Classroom. BOREN: I soon found out that our Internet speeds are so slow, and having four kids trying to do schooling at the same time didn't work so well. So we had to spread it out - all week long, actually. We were doing schooling on Saturdays and Sundays as well. SIEGLER: Her kids started back in person for now, but this pandemic has shined a glaring light on a lot of inequalities. And educators worry the rural-urban divide will only worsen if kids here can't get online to learn. Last spring, many districts resorted to delivering paper schoolwork to students who didn't have Internet or cell service at home. LESLIE MOLINA: I don't know why anybody would rationally think we can just hand you a packet and, here, you're going to go teach yourself. Like, that's basically what was going on (laughter). SIEGLER: Nearby in Nevada, Leslie Molina is the principal at McDermitt Combined on the Fort McDermitt Reservation. All 105 of her students qualify for free or reduced lunch, and about 75% have no Internet at home. MOLINA: Plus, we're also so extremely rural. I mean, we're 80 miles from a Walmart. SIEGLER: When a fifth of tribal members tested positive for coronavirus, the school decided to start back virtually, at least for the first couple weeks. But they've had time to plan. Nevada was already trying to get every student outfitted with tablets and cellular hotspots. And due to the pandemic, CARES Act money is fast-tracking that. So when McDermitt schools reopened September 8, Molina ditched those dreaded paper packets. MOLINA: So we spent that week troubleshooting a lot of technology and calling and hounding parents and students if they weren't on that, hey, remember - this is a required piece. Like, it's not optional. You don't get to turn in whatever you want. It's just like coming to school. You have to come to your class. SIEGLER: But you can't rely on hotspots forever, especially since cell service here is spotty. Rural leaders have been lobbying Congress for a big public works project to build out broadband, much like when the government paid to bring electricity to rural areas during another crisis - the Great Depression.

S. election and give President Trump a boost through hacking and spreading falsehoods on social media just like in 2016. This time, Russia may not have to work as hard. Clint Watts studies disinformation at the Foreign Policy Research Institute. CLINT WATTS: Russia doesn't have to make fake news. They just repeat, you know, what conspiracies are coming out of the White House and the administration. SHAPIRO: Americans, including the president of the United States, are raising the possibility of violence, spreading falsehoods about the election online and casting doubt on the whole process. To discuss the dangers, foreign and domestic, we're joined by NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre and our tech correspondent Shannon Bond. Good to have you both here. GREG MYRE, BYLINE: Hi, Ari. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Hey, Ari. SHAPIRO: So, Greg, let's start with you. Is Russia the only foreign threat or just the biggest right now? MYRE: It's the biggest foreign threat, and the national security officials and analysts who are studying this are really absolutely clear - Russia is the main foreign threat. It wants to help Donald Trump win reelection. And China and Iran are the other countries that are also mentioned but at a much lower level. Now, there's a big difference this time. The national security establishment, private researchers and the media are all much more prepared for this kind of disinformation this time. Far more eyeballs are looking for fake social media accounts, planted stories. Just to give you one example, in the 2018 midterms, the National Security Agency sent cyber teams to Europe to shut down the Russian troll factory that had been involved in the 2016 elections. So as far as we know, no foreign campaign has gained any real traction. SHAPIRO: But is it possible that the 2020 playbook is more advanced and sophisticated and may be escaping the notice of people who are looking for the kinds of things we saw in 2016? MYRE: Definitely a possibility. Microsoft put out a big report. They said it's the same Russian agency - military intelligence - that's at it again, but they are using different tactics. They were using a lot of bots and automated social media accounts last time. This time, they're going to great lengths to hide their tracks. They're trying to hire Americans who unwittingly will write stories for websites. So yes, the playbook has changed. SHAPIRO: So, Shannon, tell us about what's happening in the United States. What are you hearing from tech companies and the experts who study this? BOND: Well, they're very alarmed. I spoke with Yoel Roth. He's in charge of site integrity at Twitter. And he puts it really succinctly. YOEL ROTH: The people who know the most about how to mislead Americans are other Americans. BOND: So what security researchers are warning is that, you know, the atmosphere is just so ripe for disinformation right now. We're living with so much uncertainty, and that opens the door for bad actors to undermine confidence in voting, in the election results, because of the changes that are happening during the pandemic. There's also worries that bad actors could use fears about COVID to discourage voting. And there are real concerns about extremist groups that could use social media to incite violence. And this also creates opportunity for foreign actors to amplify disinformation that Americans are spreading, like those baseless claims that we keep hearing about voting fraud from President Trump. And domestic disinformation is more challenging in some ways for the platforms than foreign meddling. You know, if they were going to take action against somebody like the president, that inevitably becomes sort of a political football. Those calls can be much tougher for Facebook and Twitter to make than taking down Russian bots. SHAPIRO: And we've seen some of that in the last few months. Tell us about what these companies are doing. BOND: Yeah. Well, they're doing a lot more than they used to. Both Twitter and Facebook have new rules against misinformation about voting, against casting doubt on results or making premature claims of victory in the aftermath of the election. Especially Twitter has stepped up labeling posts from the president. That's something we just didn't see them do really until the last few months. They also say they're working together. There are monthly meetings with the industry and government and law enforcement agencies to discuss these threats and their responses. And both companies say they've gamed out more extreme measures that would stop real-world risks like voter suppression and violence, but they don't give us a lot of details on what those might be. SHAPIRO: Can we say yet how that's going? BOND: Well, critics say Facebook especially is still just too slow at this. It doesn't label or remove posts in many cases until after they've spread widely. The Biden campaign sent Facebook a letter this week, condemning it for not just taking down Trump's false claims about voting. It called Facebook, quote, \"the nation's foremost propagator of disinformation about the voting process. \" Facebook says it applies its rules impartially. And we should note that Facebook is among NPR's financial supporters. But, you know, what I hear again and again about social media platforms - this isn't just a question of, are they setting the right rules? It's, how are they enforcing those rules? SHAPIRO: And meanwhile, Greg, the president of the United States is repeatedly questioning the legitimacy of the election and saying things about voting that are just flatly false. How is that shaping this discussion? MYRE: Yes, this has had an impact. The Russian goal for years and years has been to undermine the credibility of the U. S. political system. And now we have a president declaring at campaign events that mail-in ballots aren't credible, that this is the most corrupt election in U. S. history. It's a sharp contrast from what we hear from officials like FBI Director Chris Wray, who say election systems have been hardened, tested and retested, and it will be extremely difficult to tamper with votes. SHAPIRO: As we enter this final month, do you expect things are going to get worse? MYRE: Well, we should be aware of any potential surprises. Violence around the election is one big concern. But another is the fact that officials are saying we may not have a winner on the night of November 3, and the country shouldn't panic if that is indeed the case. SHAPIRO: That's NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre and tech correspondent Shannon Bond. Thank you both. BOND: Thank you. MYRE: My pleasure.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)NICOLE MASON: Until we can figure out care, until we can figure out how to open the schools, you can just hang it up for women, for many women. MOSLEY: Elevating women in the workplace is something Sheryl Sandberg is invested in. She's one of the forces behind a new report that backs up what Mason is saying. Facebook's chief operating officer says all of this - the pandemic, the lack of child care and school - presents an existential threat to working women for years to come. SHERYL SANDBERG: What we are seeing in this report should terrify all of us. We are pulling the alarm bell here. This report is the largest of its kind. My foundation, Lean In and McKinsey - we put this out every year. This is our sixth year. It says that more than one in four women is considering downsizing her career or leaving the workforce right now, which means that right now this virus could not just be a health pandemic, could not just be an economic crisis but threatens to roll back the progress we have painstakingly made over the last five to 10 years for women in the workplace. Women worked a double shift before coronavirus. They had male partners, or if they were single mothers, they worked in the office. They worked at their jobs, and then they came home, and they did the majority of child care and housework. But now the average woman with a male partner is doing 20 additional hours a week over what he is doing of child care and housework. That's because our kids are home. That's because everything's shut down for this virus. MOSLEY: It seems like there's so many ways that this pandemic has exposed rifts and gaps in this economy for people, especially for workers. And for you, does it expose kind of the undercutting of the Lean In idea - right? - that basically, it does take money and support not just from work but from society, right? It's not just about what women are doing for themselves. SANDBERG: And Lean In always understood that. Lean In was always about women being able to go for leadership positions. It was always about men leaning in at home. MOSLEY: But the criticism was that it was about the privileged, and I guess that's what I'm asking. Like, right now is this a moment where it's really revealing that, like, there's a lot of women who are on the other side of that privilege line, who aren't able to marshal the resources you talked about originally behind that idea? SANDBERG: Well, that's right. And that's why, again, Lean In was always for this. Lean In was always about men doing their share and companies doing their share. So this report is not telling women to lean in. It's telling companies to lean in. It's telling companies to recognize that this wasn't working for women and mothers before coronavirus, and now it's much worse. Companies need to be flexible. Companies need to recognize the burdens women, particularly women of color, are facing at home. And companies need to adjust so that we don't lose the talent, the female talent, the women, the women of color that are so critical to doing well going forward. MOSLEY: Your report finds a positive shift in the way that companies see remote work, right? They're saying, OK, maybe this works after all. But it's not seeing a shift in the expectations of employees, and employees still feel a lot of pressure. As an executive yourself, is this something that you see can be changed? I mean, what's the reluctance here from managers, the C suite to see this? SANDBERG: Well, I think it has to be changed. And look; companies are under pressure large and small. There's an economic crisis going on. But we have to think beyond the quarter and think long-term. At Facebook, we canceled our performance cycle for the first half of the year, and we paid everyone their bonus at over a hundred percent - the same bonus. We just paid it to everyone because we were saying, we know you need to take care of your children and yourselves and elderly relatives. We mean it. Companies need to adjust their performance criteria to recognize that there is a crisis. And then that old quote, \"crisis is a terrible thing to waste\" - we need to take this as the opportunity it can be to rethink work. You're right. This report shows that more companies are open to remote work. Remote work, less work, travel - those things come out in the report. Those things could make a very big difference going forward for women to stay in the workforce and be able to thrive. MOSLEY: Sheryl Sandberg, thank you so much for speaking with us. SANDBERG: Thank you.

With so many people voting by mail this election, the results could be delayed. That uncertainty could create an opportunity for conspiracy theorists and misinformation to spread on social media. Facebook and Twitter say they see this problem coming. So what are they doing to prepare for the days after Election Day? NPR's Shannon Bond is taking a look. We should note, Facebook is among NPR's financial supporters. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: A lot of things keep Yoel Roth up at night. As head of site integrity at Twitter, a big part of his job is dreaming up all the ways bad actors could've used the platform. YOEL ROTH: Having a vivid imagination is key. None of the threats are off limits. BOND: When it comes to the election, there are lots of threats to plan for. ROTH: A high-profile figure's account gets taken over, to the possibility of a large-scale spam or bot attack, to the risks of foreign interference like we saw in 2016. BOND: Twitter, Facebook and other tech companies do regular threat modeling exercises both on their own and together. They've come up with different attacks and gamed out how they would respond. ROTH: And we really undertook a process to try and predict what the worst-case scenarios were based on what we had seen previously in 2016, 2018 and in elections around the world, as well as some of the things that we thought were likely to happen in the United States this time around. BOND: Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, told All Things Considered this week the company is on high alert for problems after November 3. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)SHERYL SANDBERG: We are worried about misinformation. We are worried about people claiming election results before the election. And we've already said, if any candidate tries to claim victory too early, if any candidate does inaccurate information, inaccurate ads after that election, we are going to take them down. BOND: Facebook, which is among NPR's financial supporters, and Twitter are already dealing with a lot of election misinformation, like a president set on undermining the legitimacy of the voting process, as he did during this week's debate. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: As far as the ballots are concerned, it's a disaster. BOND: If results are delayed as mail-in ballots are counted, that means more opportunity to cast doubt on the outcome and amplify that doubt using social media. Of course, this isn't the first time we haven't known election results right away. In 2000, it took 36 days for a winner to emerge in the battle between George W. Bush and Al Gore. CLINT WATTS: Yeah. There are some angry lawyers in Bush v. Gore. But it was pretty tame (laughter) compared to today. BOND: Disinformation expert Clint Watts, who has long studied how Russia interferes in U. S. politics, says the threat in 2020 has really changed. WATTS: And people couldn't be mobilized on social media in this way. BOND: Facebook and Twitter have made rules against undermining election results or disrupting the peaceful transfer of power. Both say they are working to stop harmful content from spreading widely. But here's the thing, platforms are designed to make posts that really capture attention because they're emotional or sensational go viral. Turning that off would be a big change to the way Twitter and Facebook work. With so much at stake, experts say it's not enough that the platforms announced these rules. Chloe Colliver studies online extremism at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue in London. CHLOE COLLIVER: The major gap now is not in the design of the policies on the platforms. The major gap is in enforcement of those policies. BOND: And in those days after the election, if people don't know who won the presidency, disinformation may be spread by Russia, even by the president of the United States. The question is, can or will the social media companies hold the line? Shannon Bond, NPR News. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:   Prepare for confusion come November. With so many people voting by mail this election, the results could be delayed. That uncertainty could create an opportunity for conspiracy theorists and misinformation to spread on social media. Facebook and Twitter say they see this problem coming. So what are they doing to prepare for the days after Election Day? NPR's Shannon Bond is taking a look. We should note, Facebook is among NPR's financial supporters. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: A lot of things keep Yoel Roth up at night. As head of site integrity at Twitter, a big part of his job is dreaming up all the ways bad actors could've used the platform. YOEL ROTH: Having a vivid imagination is key. None of the threats are off limits. BOND: When it comes to the election, there are lots of threats to plan for. ROTH: A high-profile figure's account gets taken over, to the possibility of a large-scale spam or bot attack, to the risks of foreign interference like we saw in 2016. BOND: Twitter, Facebook and other tech companies do regular threat modeling exercises both on their own and together. They've come up with different attacks and gamed out how they would respond. ROTH: And we really undertook a process to try and predict what the worst-case scenarios were based on what we had seen previously in 2016, 2018 and in elections around the world, as well as some of the things that we thought were likely to happen in the United States this time around. BOND: Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, told All Things Considered this week the company is on high alert for problems after November 3. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) SHERYL SANDBERG: We are worried about misinformation. We are worried about people claiming election results before the election. And we've already said, if any candidate tries to claim victory too early, if any candidate does inaccurate information, inaccurate ads after that election, we are going to take them down. BOND: Facebook, which is among NPR's financial supporters, and Twitter are already dealing with a lot of election misinformation, like a president set on undermining the legitimacy of the voting process, as he did during this week's debate. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: As far as the ballots are concerned, it's a disaster. BOND: If results are delayed as mail-in ballots are counted, that means more opportunity to cast doubt on the outcome and amplify that doubt using social media. Of course, this isn't the first time we haven't known election results right away. In 2000, it took 36 days for a winner to emerge in the battle between George W. Bush and Al Gore. CLINT WATTS: Yeah.

It's been a concern ever since this video went viral. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)JORDAN PEELE: (As Barack Obama) We're entering an era in which our enemies can make it look like anyone is saying anything at any point in time, even if they would never say those things. GREENE: That's from a deepfake featuring the voice of actor Jordan Peele. His face was transposed on a video of President Obama, making it look and sound like the president delivered those words. Experts are worried our adversaries would use the deepfake technology to meddle in an election. Tim Mak and Dina Temple-Raston from NPR's investigations team explain why this hasn't happened yet. TIM MAK, BYLINE: The first deepfake of the 2020 election season was tweeted out by someone you might not expect - President Donald Trump. Back in April, the president retweeted a crudely manipulated video of former Vice President Joe Biden. LINDSAY GORMAN: Biden appeared to have his tongue out and in kind of a ridiculous pose. MAK: That's Lindsay Gorman. She's an expert in technology and disinformation at the Alliance for Securing Democracy. GORMAN: And it turns out that that actually was manipulated using deep learning-based technology. And I would classify that as a deepfake. DINA TEMPLE-RASTON, BYLINE: Deep learning-based technology is sophisticated. It's more than just Photoshopping something. It uses a kind of artificial intelligence, or AI, and it works a bit like the brain does and takes lots of little bits of information and brings them together. And it's that deep learning that computers can now do that makes deepfakes so believable. An example of just how far we've come popped up in China recently. A news anchor for Xinhua, China's state-run news agency, was completely generated with AI. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE: (Non-English language spoken). TEMPLE-RASTON: This is from part of a newscast read by a computer-generated person. And she seems pretty real. MAK: Which is a problem because when experts look at adversaries who might use deepfakes against the United States, China is at the top of the list, so says Brian Pierce, a scientist at the Applied Research Laboratory for Intelligence and Security at the University of Maryland. BRIAN PIERCE: Foreign entities who have an interest in interfering with U. S. elections or just causing trouble in general, yes, we certainly put China, Russia, Iran and even North Korea falls into that category. MAK: Pierce says deepfakes haven't played the role people feared in this election season because at this point, to make one is still time-consuming and expensive. You can't just cook one up in rapid response to something that just happened. So that's the good news. The bad news, he says, is that selective editing, textual misinformation and lies are all rather effective. And you don't need AI for that. PIERCE: I think things are getting better now. There's - a lot of times, there are strategies probably you could employ, but I hesitate to focus too much on deepfakes because I think there's a lot of other ways they could achieve their goal. MAK: We saw that in 2016 with Twitter accounts and Facebook pages that can sow division without all that software and computing power. David Doermann, director of the AI Institute at University of Buffalo, says that deepfakes right now are highly personal, and they may enter the political scene locally. DAVID DOERMANN: And the place that we saw these deepfakes hurt people initially was a very grassroots level. They were using it for revenge on a spouse or a partner. And at that level, it can do a lot of damage. TEMPLE-RASTON: And that makes sense. When America's adversaries first started testing their cybercapabilities, it wasn't at the national level. They also went local. They cracked into local election databases just to look around and to see if they could. In the same way, Doermann says, people trying to meddle in our national politics might test their deepfakes on local election races first. And that's what we should watch for.

Just today President Trump called for the repeal of legal protections for the tech industry. That was after Facebook removed one of the president's posts, which made a false claim about the coronavirus. And here's Republican Congressman Jim Jordan back in July. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JIM JORDAN: I'll just cut to the chase. Big Tech's out to get conservatives. That's not a suspicion. That's not a hunch. That's a fact. CHANG: Well, we wanted to follow the facts on this argument, so we turned to NPR tech reporter Bobby Allyn. Hey, Bobby. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa. CHANG: All right. Just before we begin, we should note that Facebook is a financial supporter of NPR. Now, Bobby, what specifically are Republican lawmakers accusing Facebook of doing when it comes to conservative viewpoints? ALLYN: Yeah. So when conservatives talk about Facebook not giving them a fair shake, you know, they're really talking about two separate things - first, that Facebook silences conservative voices by taking down right-wing views. And on that, there's just no evidence. And secondly, there's this idea that conservative news is suppressed on Facebook. And to evaluate that, we just need more data. Facebook keeps information like the top 10 most popular news items totally secret. And so that creates this big vacuum, and into that vacuum goes, you know, lots of speculation and conjecture. I talked to Kathy Qian. She's a data scientist with Code for Democracy. KATHY QIAN: Facebook can't just release more data about what people see privately, right? So it's kind of like a purgatory of their own making. ALLYN: Right - a purgatory of their own making because Facebook refuses to open its hood and show the public what people are seeing on the site. But we do have a little bit of data, Ailsa. CHANG: OK, so what does that data tell us? ALLYN: Yeah. There's this tool called CrowdTangle. It's owned by Facebook, and it measures engagement. So, you know, every time you like or give a sad face or leave a comment, it counts all that stuff up. And far and away the most engaged-with content comes from conservatives - so commentators like Ben Shapiro and right-wing outlets like Breitbart. So that tells us something - right? - that, you know, conservative stories are pulling people in unlike anything else. But just because posts have lots of likes doesn't mean it's the most popular thing on Facebook. Here's data scientist Qian again. She says, you know those emoji reactions you can do on Facebook? She said it's kind of hard to understand what they mean sometimes. QIAN: The laughing face - like, what does that mean? It can mean, like, you know, I agree with this, or, like, this is so hilariously untrue. It's just really hard to tell what people actually mean by those reactions. ALLYN: Yeah, I'm not so much of a hate-liker on Facebook, but I do know a few. CHANG: So do I. All right, so we don't know exactly what's popular on Facebook, but we do know that conservative outlets do draw a lot of responses online. So how about Facebook pulling President Trump's post like it did today? Does that suggest Facebook is targeting the president? ALLYN: Yeah. So whenever Facebook acts on Trump's posts, it's going to get a lot of attention, though that doesn't necessarily mean that Facebook is out to get the president. You know, Facebook very well may be pulling down more conservative posts than liberal posts. But, you know, I talked to a lot of former Facebook employees, and they told me that's just because there is more extreme right-wing content floating around on Facebook. The conservative media world is very well-developed and has such a passionate following, and some of this stuff, as we know, stretches the truth or just contains straight-up falsehoods. Brendan Nyhan is a political scientist at Dartmouth who studies Facebook. He thinks it's the opposite of a conservative bias. He says in order to appease conservatives, Facebook is, you know, bending over backwards sometimes. BRENDAN NYHAN: They are incredibly concerned about being seen as on the side of liberals. That is against the profit motives of their business. So I don't see any reason to think they have a secret, hidden liberal agenda. ALLYN: Right. So it all comes back to this Facebook black box. And until Facebook gives us more data, the debate is just going to be very frustrating. CHANG: That is NPR's Bobby Allyn. Thank you, Bobby. ALLYN: Thanks, Ailsa.

A lot of voters, though, just find it annoying. NPR's Jim Zarroli reports. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Sometimes Melissa Michelson feels like she created a monster. MELISSA MICHELSON: I have been apologizing to people for years now. When they mention how many texts they get, I say, I am so sorry. I feel personally responsible. ZARROLI: Michelson is a political scientist at Menlo College in California. A decade ago, she helped organize a get-out-the-vote drive in San Mateo County. She wanted to see if the new technology of text messaging could be used to reach voters. What she discovered was. . . MICHELSON: Text messages were a pretty powerful tool for increasing voter turnout. ZARROLI: Thanks in part to research like hers, texting has become a big way campaigns get out the vote and raise money. And in the wake of COVID-19, it's really come into its own. THOMAS PETERS: We look back at the 2016 election, kind of call it the social media election. I think after 2020, people are going to look back and say this was the texting election. ZARROLI: Thomas Peters is chief executive of RumbleUp, a text messaging platform. Peters says candidates like texting because it's cheap and it works. He says voters don't always read emails and snail mail from campaigns. PETERS: But 99% of text messages are read, and 90% are read within the first three minutes. So it's a channel that has unparalleled visibility. ZARROLI: Peters works for Republicans, and he gets the numbers he uses from the campaigns, which collect them from a variety of sources, such as voter registration records. Republicans were late to start texting, but they've more than made up for it. The Trump campaign says it will have sent out a billion texts by Election Day. JENNIFER STROMER-GALLEY: Really, since the conventions and maybe a little bit before that, the number of text messages I'm getting from the campaign on a daily basis has tripled. ZARROLI: Jennifer Stromer-Galley of Syracuse University studies political campaigns. This year, she signed up for texts from both presidential campaigns. She gets four times as many texts from Trump as from Biden. And the texts these days are getting more aggressive. They almost sound like they're berating her. STROMER-GALLEY: The one I received yesterday basically said, do you not care that Donald Trump is running for reelection? Donate now. ZARROLI: This week, Stromer-Galley even got a text asking her to sign a get-well card for the president. She also hears from a lot of big-name Republicans acting as Trump surrogates. STROMER-GALLEY: For example, Eric Trump, the head of the RNC. Cory Gardner apparently has sent me a text, Kevin McCarthy. ZARROLI: The Trump campaign has sent out so many texts that its software program was briefly knocked out of service by spam filters in July. Sending out unsolicited texts en masse is supposed to be illegal, but Ed Gandia has been getting texts from politicians for weeks. He says he never signed up for them. ED GANDIA: It's one thing for them to have my mailing address but something totally different for them to have my cellphone. It's not something I give out. ZARROLI: Gandia is a business coach in Georgia, a hot spot of tightly contested elections. He regularly gets texts from presidential and congressional campaigns - texts reminding him where to vote or telling him about an upcoming rally and, of course, lots of texts asking for money. He tries to unsubscribe. They come in anyway. GANDIA: It's annoying. It's disruptive because many times, my phone is not on vibrate and I'm on business calls. And it seems very disrespectful. ZARROLI: Gandia says the texts do get his attention. There's just one thing they won't do - they won't sway his vote. Jim Zarroli, NPR News.

ZARROLI: Thanks in part to research like hers, texting has become a big way campaigns get out the vote and raise money. And in the wake of COVID-19, it's really come into its own. THOMAS PETERS: We look back at the 2016 election, kind of call it the social media election. I think after 2020, people are going to look back and say this was the texting election. ZARROLI: Thomas Peters is chief executive of RumbleUp, a text messaging platform. Peters says candidates like texting because it's cheap and it works. He says voters don't always read emails and snail mail from campaigns. PETERS: But 99% of text messages are read, and 90% are read within the first three minutes. So it's a channel that has unparalleled visibility. ZARROLI: Peters works for Republicans, and he gets the numbers he uses from the campaigns, which collect them from a variety of sources, such as voter registration records. Republicans were late to start texting, but they've more than made up for it. The Trump campaign says it will have sent out a billion texts by Election Day. JENNIFER STROMER-GALLEY: Really, since the conventions and maybe a little bit before that, the number of text messages I'm getting from the campaign on a daily basis has tripled. ZARROLI: Jennifer Stromer-Galley of Syracuse University studies political campaigns. This year, she signed up for texts from both presidential campaigns. She gets four times as many texts from Trump as from Biden. And the texts these days are getting more aggressive. They almost sound like they're berating her. STROMER-GALLEY: The one I received yesterday basically said, do you not care that Donald Trump is running for reelection? Donate now. ZARROLI: This week, Stromer-Galley even got a text asking her to sign a get-well card for the president. She also hears from a lot of big-name Republicans acting as Trump surrogates. STROMER-GALLEY: For example, Eric Trump, the head of the RNC. Cory Gardner apparently has sent me a text, Kevin McCarthy. ZARROLI: The Trump campaign has sent out so many texts that its software program was briefly knocked out of service by spam filters in July. Sending out unsolicited texts en masse is supposed to be illegal, but Ed Gandia has been getting texts from politicians for weeks. He says he never signed up for them. ED GANDIA: It's one thing for them to have my mailing address but something totally different for them to have my cellphone. It's not something I give out. ZARROLI: Gandia is a business coach in Georgia, a hot spot of tightly contested elections. He regularly gets texts from presidential and congressional campaigns - texts reminding him where to vote or telling him about an upcoming rally and, of course, lots of texts asking for money. He tries to unsubscribe. They come in anyway. GANDIA: It's annoying. It's disruptive because many times, my phone is not on vibrate and I'm on business calls. And it seems very disrespectful. ZARROLI: Gandia says the texts do get his attention. There's just one thing they won't do - they won't sway his vote. Jim Zarroli, NPR News.

NARECHANIA: The second question is, even if Oracle can claim that sort of protection, whether it's fair use for Google to use them. BOND: And that depends on how the justices interpret copyright law.

Yeah, seriously - took off over the mountainous region of northern England called the Lake District. RICHARD BROWNING: It was a beautiful, sunny day. It was pretty - a pretty easy climb. CORNISH: If Browning sounds a little casual, it might be because he's taken thousands of flights like this. He's the founder of a company called Gravity Industries. He invented this jet suit. But this particular flight was special. It was a proof of concept for a new kind of first responder.

But the latest sensation does not fit that bill. NPR's Bobby Allyn introduces us to the potato worker from Idaho Falls. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Nathan Apodaca's SUV had 320,000 miles. One morning last month, it couldn't go a mile more. It broke down on the highway, far away from the potato warehouse where he works. But he had a skateboard in his truck and a bottle of Ocean Spray Cran-Raspberry juice. NATHAN APODACA: I was just sitting there, and I was like, OK, I'm not going to sit here and wait for nobody to pull some jumper cables, you know, or I'm not going to flag nobody down. So I grabbed my juice, grabbed my longboard, started heading to work. ALLYN: The story could've ended there. It didn't. As Apodaca was rolling down, he started what would become a cultural sensation by going on TikTok and flipping through the tunes. APODACA: When I heard \"Dreams,\" that's when I figured, you know, OK, this is it, you know? (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"DREAMS\")FLEETWOOD MAC: (Singing) Now here you go again. You say you want your freedom. ALLYN: You see him. The 37-year-old father of two is wearing a gray hoodie.

ALLYN: Within an hour, his TikTok had a hundred thousand views. It now has more than 35 million and achieved meme status. The lieutenant governor of Montana did a tribute.

And God knows we need some of that right now. ALLYN: Fleetwood spoke to me from his home in Maui. As for Apodaca, now that he thinks about it, he says it kind of makes sense. He gave the world a moment of pure delight in the midst of stressful times. APODACA: There's just too much chaos. You know, right now, everybody just needed something to look at, something to relax to and to vibe out with. ALLYN: Apodaca has gotten more than just TikTok views out of it. Ocean Spray bought him a new truck full of Cran-Raspberry juice. He's been living in an RV, but his fans have donated him so much money he almost has enough for a down payment on a house.

That is a big reversal. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has long said the social network is a place for free speech, even if that speech is offensive. NPR tech correspondent Shannon Bond is on the line with us now to offer more details. And we should note that Facebook is among NPR's financial supporters. Hey, Shannon. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa. CHANG: So tell us a little more about this new policy. I mean, how did Zuckerberg's thinking on this change? BOND: Yeah. So to understand that, we should go back to 2018. He gave this interview to Recode, and he said that while he personally finds Holocaust denial deeply offensive, he said Facebook shouldn't take these posts down just because they're factually wrong. Here's what he told them. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARK ZUCKERBERG: I just don't think that it is the right thing to say we are going to take someone off the platform if they get things wrong, even multiple times. BOND: And really, the way that Zuckerberg frames this, you know, his idea is Facebook is a place for people to exercise free speech, and the company shouldn't be the arbiter of truth. He says that over and over. This approach, of course, has caused a lot of controversy and criticism. Zuckerberg even had to go back and clarify he wasn't defending Holocaust deniers. So today in a Facebook post, Zuckerberg now says his thinking has, quote, \"evolved\" over how his company handles Holocaust denial and that balance between free speech and harm. CHANG: Interesting. Well, what about the timing of this policy change? I mean, why is Facebook taking action now, you think? BOND: Well, Facebook says this is, you know, really about what's happening in the world. They point to data showing a global increase in anti-Semitic violence. They also referenced this study of younger Americans that showed almost a quarter say the Holocaust is a myth or exaggerated or they're unsure about it. They say that's an alarming level of ignorance. And there's external pressure. This summer, a group called the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany organized a social media campaign. Here's one of the videos it put out. And you can hear Holocaust survivors pleading with Zuckerberg. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Mark Zuckerberg. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Remove the Holocaust deniers from Facebook. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: No, there is no denying it. The Holocaust was real. I know. BOND: You know, we've been talking about this so much this year. Facebook is just under all of this pressure to stop hate speech of any kind. Of course, it can be really difficult to remove bad content, especially when it can go viral so quickly among billions of users. And Facebook has acknowledged this new policy will take some time to enforce effectively. It has to train its artificial intelligence technology to recognize and stamp out these false claims. CHANG: Right. Well, what are critics of Facebook saying about this particular change? BOND: Well, across the board, I would say, you know, this has really been welcomed by critics. You know, many of them are saying this is a really big step. This is a big deal for Facebook to do it, even if it is belated, because, of course, many of these groups have been telling Facebook for years that Holocaust denial is a huge problem. And in just the past few weeks, Facebook has been cracking down more on harmful content. It banned QAnon, the baseless conspiracy theory that really took off this year and has been so popular on Facebook. It prohibited anti-Semitic stereotypes, banned armed militia groups. I spoke with Jonathan Greenblatt. He's the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, and he's part of a coalition behind a campaign this summer to boycott Facebook advertising. JONATHAN GREENBLATT: Facebook will be judged, not on the promises they make but on how they keep those promises. BOND: And you know - and this is something that people say to me all the time. You know, Greenblatt here is saying Facebook is listening to its critics. It's doing the right thing. That's important. The real question, though, is how will they enforce all these rules? CHANG: That is NPR tech correspondent Shannon Bond. Thank you, Shannon. BOND: Thanks, Ailsa. AILSA CHANG, HOST:   Facebook said today it is banning all content that denies or distorts the Holocaust.

He gave this interview to Recode, and he said that while he personally finds Holocaust denial deeply offensive, he said Facebook shouldn't take these posts down just because they're factually wrong. Here's what he told them. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARK ZUCKERBERG: I just don't think that it is the right thing to say we are going to take someone off the platform if they get things wrong, even multiple times. BOND: And really, the way that Zuckerberg frames this, you know, his idea is Facebook is a place for people to exercise free speech, and the company shouldn't be the arbiter of truth. He says that over and over. This approach, of course, has caused a lot of controversy and criticism. Zuckerberg even had to go back and clarify he wasn't defending Holocaust deniers. So today in a Facebook post, Zuckerberg now says his thinking has, quote, \"evolved\" over how his company handles Holocaust denial and that balance between free speech and harm. CHANG: Interesting. Well, what about the timing of this policy change? I mean, why is Facebook taking action now, you think? BOND: Well, Facebook says this is, you know, really about what's happening in the world. They point to data showing a global increase in anti-Semitic violence. They also referenced this study of younger Americans that showed almost a quarter say the Holocaust is a myth or exaggerated or they're unsure about it. They say that's an alarming level of ignorance. And there's external pressure. This summer, a group called the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany organized a social media campaign. Here's one of the videos it put out. And you can hear Holocaust survivors pleading with Zuckerberg. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Mark Zuckerberg. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Remove the Holocaust deniers from Facebook. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: No, there is no denying it. The Holocaust was real. I know. BOND: You know, we've been talking about this so much this year. Facebook is just under all of this pressure to stop hate speech of any kind. Of course, it can be really difficult to remove bad content, especially when it can go viral so quickly among billions of users. And Facebook has acknowledged this new policy will take some time to enforce effectively. It has to train its artificial intelligence technology to recognize and stamp out these false claims. CHANG: Right. Well, what are critics of Facebook saying about this particular change? BOND: Well, across the board, I would say, you know, this has really been welcomed by critics. You know, many of them are saying this is a really big step. This is a big deal for Facebook to do it, even if it is belated, because, of course, many of these groups have been telling Facebook for years that Holocaust denial is a huge problem. And in just the past few weeks, Facebook has been cracking down more on harmful content. It banned QAnon, the baseless conspiracy theory that really took off this year and has been so popular on Facebook. It prohibited anti-Semitic stereotypes, banned armed militia groups. I spoke with Jonathan Greenblatt. He's the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, and he's part of a coalition behind a campaign this summer to boycott Facebook advertising. JONATHAN GREENBLATT: Facebook will be judged, not on the promises they make but on how they keep those promises. BOND: And you know - and this is something that people say to me all the time. You know, Greenblatt here is saying Facebook is listening to its critics. It's doing the right thing. That's important. The real question, though, is how will they enforce all these rules? CHANG: That is NPR tech correspondent Shannon Bond. Thank you, Shannon. BOND: Thanks, Ailsa.", "section": "Technology", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

And in order to do that, they're using monitoring systems to screen employees for the coronavirus. They have a lot of options, as NPR's Jason Beaubien discovered. JASON BEAUBIEN, BYLINE: In March of this year, Dr. Achintya Moulick found himself at the epicenter of the U. S. coronavirus pandemic. Moulick oversees three CarePoint Health hospitals in northern New Jersey, and they were swamped with people trying to get help. ACHINTYA MOULICK: One day I saw a big line outside the entrance of the hospital, and they were manually checking everybody's temperature and giving them stamps. BEAUBIEN: Moulick thought, this is crazy. MOULICK: The lines were all the way out to the garage. BEAUBIEN: Taking everyone's temperature with handheld thermometers was diverting his front-line staff, burning through precious personal protective equipment and creating a bottleneck of potentially infectious patients outside his door. So he hired a company that uses thermal scanners to take the temperature of up to 20 people at a time as they approach the front entrance. MOULICK: It checks the temperature and communicates to the security personnel, which can go into any system inside the hospital, so we can have a rapid throughput of these people into the hospital. BEAUBIEN: The thermal scanners are made by a company called Zyter. The readings can be used simply to let people in the door or for the company to keep a continuous record of employees' temperatures. Zyter is just one of dozens of firms offering systems to help employers confront the new challenges of COVID-19. Some of them are as simple as an app for employees to report any COVID symptoms. Others use Bluetooth devices on company ID badges to make sure workers are staying at least 6-feet apart. Then, if someone comes down with COVID, the company knows exactly who that person had contact with for how long, and even when exactly their temperature started to rise. Harish Pai is the chief technology officer at Zyter. HARISH PAI: All of that data can be tracked through a cloud-based portal as well on an ongoing basis, so you have a complete snapshot of your organization across facilities, across locations, and what is your risk of exposure. BEAUBIEN: Zyter has another system that uses facial recognition linked to a network of digital cameras around the facility. PAI: The digital camera-based solution, which is very nonintrusive, is probably much more secure because it can track a person all through the facility and be able to identify that person. BEAUBIEN: But many people might consider this surveillance an invasion of privacy. Some employees will find it creepy if their every movement and even their body temperature is being tracked by their boss. Should HR know exactly how long you spent in the bathroom? But in the midst of a pandemic, a firm may want to know if too many people are congregating in a break room. Amazon is using a camera-based AI system it calls Distance Assistant to keep people spaced out in its warehouses. Pai from Zyter says industrial plants where work-from-home isn't possible are some of their biggest customers. PAI: For example, we are deploying the entire contact tracing - the servers and the cameras-based solution - for a customer - for a large manufacturing customer out of Malaysia as we speak. BEAUBIEN: Some companies are adopting the bare minimum, doing just enough so the health department allows them to operate. Others, like the manufacturing plant in Malaysia, are monitoring every interaction at their workplace. Kristin Baker Spohn, a partner with the tech venture capital firm CRV, says employers need to be very clear about the purpose of the new technologies they're using. KRISTIN BAKER SPOHN: So if that purpose is the collective health of your employer and company population, I think that's something that we'll see a lot of people be excited and eager to adapt to.

NICK FOUNTAIN, HOST:  Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Nick Fountain. Today, we're going to play part of an episode of one of my favorite podcasts. It's called Rough Translation. It's hosted by Gregory Warner. I'm sure you've heard him on PLANET MONEY before. And the show we've adapted today is one they did recently about how some of the most powerful tech companies in the U. S. are reckoning with discrimination. It's a form of discrimination I had not heard of before in America. Here's Greg. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)GREGORY WARNER: When Sam Cornelius (ph) first arrived to the United States in the mid-'90s, he was surprised by how welcoming people were. SAM CORNELIUS: The people were so encouraging. You know, hey, we are going to the swimming classes. Do you want to join us? - and things like that. WARNER: They'd ask him questions about his home country, India. But even more surprising was the questions they did not ask. For instance, they did not try to know what his caste was or even what caste is. And how did that feel for you, like, putting aside caste? CORNELIUS: That is a really great feeling, you know - that, yes, now everything I will be judged by exactly what I deserve (ph). (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)WARNER: Sam is from the Dalit caste, formerly known as untouchables. And you may know this already, but the caste system in South Asia goes back thousands of years. It's based on an ancient division of labor and also purity. So there is a caste for priests. That's the Brahmins. But there's also a caste for the warriors, a caste for merchants, another caste for manual laborers. Dalits were the sewer cleaners, the garbage collectors. And in India growing up, Sam was always reminded of his association with the unclean. He saw it in the way the teachers treated him at school and the jokes people made about caste. And he always wondered what kind of person he might be if he did not have a label at all, if he was just Sam, no caste attached. And it seemed like he'd finally found that person, that new Sam, in the United States. CORNELIUS: I was doing so many activities and feeling so confident and feeling that my real potential is coming out. WARNER: After that first trip to the United States, he took another one and another after that, always here as a company employee on a work visa, never a citizen. And as more South Asians came to work in tech jobs, he had more Indian coworkers and managers. And he noticed they were trying to suss out his caste. CORNELIUS: There is famous spot on the back. Usually, Brahmins wear white thread around their shoulders. WARNER: They patted his shoulders to see if he was wearing a white thread that only Brahmins wear. CORNELIUS: So with you not even knowing, they will try to pat your shoulder and try to see - they're finding this thread. WARNER: Was he a Brahmin, like them? CORNELIUS: In other ways, they will call you for a swim, you know? Hey, let's go for a swim - because everybody takes their shirt off, and now they know who are wearing threads, who are not. WARNER: Years ago, these invitations to go swimming with American friends and neighbors were a sign of acceptance. But now the same invitations from his fellow Indians felt like a trap to out him as a Dalit. And the consequences of being outed - well, that is what our episode is about. . . (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)WARNER: . . . Because some people think that naming people's caste is the way forward to a fair world, while Sam is so afraid he'll be sacked and sent back to India for speaking out. CORNELIUS: Yes, for this interview. . . WARNER: He's decided, if he's going to speak out publicly on this topic, he's adopting a pseudonym. CORNELIUS: . . . I am Sam Cornelius. Of course, that is my alias. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)WARNER: This is Rough Translation from NPR. I'm Gregory Warner with a story about how an ancient hierarchy that we usually associate with India. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MAYA KAMBLE: I had an Indian manager. WARNER: . . . Has been imported to workplaces in the United States. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KAMBLE: He knew what my caste was. So he wanted to dominate me as much as possible. WARNER: Rough Translation - back after this break. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)WARNER: We are back with Rough Translation from NPR. I'm Gregory Warner. We started talking about caste with Lauren Frayer. . . LAUREN FRAYER: Hello. This is Lauren. WARNER: . . . NPR's India correspondent, who started thinking about caste and race in part because of an initiative at NPR to track the diversity of our sources. This is something we all now do, including this podcast. We will note how many women we're putting on the air, how many people of color and other demographic stats. FRAYER: I see my company trying to better represent America with the voices we put on the air. And I'm looking at my own sourcing, and I get too much credit. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)FRAYER: Every voice I bring to the airwaves from India is a person of color. Check the box, you know? That's diversity from my boss' point of view. But I'm looking at different types of diversity in India and thinking caste. WARNER: There is no uncontroversial way to talk about caste, and even the words we use are fraught. So you're going to hear people in this story talk about upper caste and lower caste. We're going to try to avoid those hierarchies and say dominant caste and oppressed caste. FRAYER: Oppression is a strong term, but it definitely applies here. This is oppression that's gone back centuries. It was really amplified by the British. So British colonists came in and gave Brahmins more privileges, elevated them and exploited this power differential between the Brahmins and other castes. And so when Indians won their independence in 1947, they wrote a constitution that acknowledges that oppression and lays out bold measures to try to fix it - affirmative action programs to place Dalits in government jobs, to place Dalits in top universities. And all of that exists in India still today. But despite all of this, Dalits in India face so much violence - disproportionate violence. Dalit women are raped more than women of other castes. Dalit men get lynched for falling in love with a dominant-caste woman. WARNER: Lauren knew she wanted to find out people's caste to make sure she was hearing from a variety of voices, including people who don't always get access to speak. But this brought a new problem. How actually do you find out someone's caste? CORNELIUS: So that is a good question. How does one person know your caste, right? It is not like you have a color which gives away your identity. WARNER: Sam Cornelius says sometimes it's easy. You just read someone's caste by their surname. CORNELIUS: Some surnames you cannot hide. WARNER: And how about your real surname? Is it easy to hide? CORNELIUS: Yeah, my real surname doesn't give away my caste easily. WARNER: Oh. CORNELIUS: OK? That is why, immediately, when I tell the surname, they will ask me, oh, where do you come from? You know, which part of that state you come from? They had to ask a follow-up question. FRAYER: If you can't tell by surname, you can ask about someone's neighborhood. CORNELIUS: I also try to be clever. I come from Hyderabad. So I tell, oh, I am from Hyderabad. FRAYER: It's a city of 9 million people, and all castes are there. CORNELIUS: So that's where the people are not satisfied if you give a city name. So what they do is - no, no, no. I'm not talking about where you come from. Where do originally your parents - which region or district they came from. WARNER: Sam keeps dodging the real question. CORNELIUS: My parents used to stay in Bombay, OK? So I tell them, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Actually, before that, my father used to work in the railway, so he was in Delhi (laughter). WARNER: You just keep naming cities. CORNELIUS: Yeah, naming cities because that is the facts, also. Then they'll understand that I am playing around, too. They give up. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)FRAYER: Sam doesn't want to reveal his caste because most of his Indian co-workers are from dominant castes. In fact, the overwhelming majority of South Asians in America are from dominant castes. They're often the ones with the resources and access to get here. CORNELIUS: The other question usually people ask is - oh, are you vegetarian? - because Brahmins are vegetarians. Even if you say, well, yes, I'm a vegetarian, if you are an Indian asking an Indian to find out a caste, you would say, are you vegetarian by birth or by choice? OK? WARNER: And the tricky thing about this is that a co-worker could be overhearing this entire conversation and still have no clue what they're really talking about. CORNELIUS: Yeah, yeah. They will nod. Even the people who are very active about race, they know race discrimination and all - they might have not heard about caste at all. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)WARNER: After the break, something happens that will have Sam and a lot of people in America talking with surprising candor about caste. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Suing a big corporation like Cisco was the most delightful news I heard in quite some time. WARNER: That's when Rough Translation returns. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)WARNER: We're back with Rough Translation. I'm Gregory Warner. And today, we're talking about caste, and not just caste in India, but how the caste system has been imported to corporate America. FRAYER: So earlier this summer, a lawsuit was filed by the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing on behalf of an engineer at Cisco Systems. That's one of the largest makers of computer networking equipment. They've got offices around the world. They also hire a lot of Indians on H-1B visas to come to the U. S. WARNER: And like a lot of tech companies now, they have some teams that are all Indian employees. This lawsuit focuses on a team like that at Cisco's headquarters in San Jose, Calif. FRAYER: An engineer on that team alleges that two of his supervisors, who are from dominant castes, discriminated against him because they knew he was from an oppressed caste. WARNER: And what's his name, by the way? FRAYER: We don't know his name. In the lawsuit, he is listed as John Doe. So John Doe, the alleged victim, says that when he confronted his superiors about this, he faced retaliation. And his superiors isolated him from colleagues, gave him assignments that were impossible to complete in the time given - so basically tried to push John Doe out of the company. So what does he do? What are you told to do when you suspect you're a victim of discrimination? You go to your HR department. And that's what he does in November 2016. WARNER: And this is where things get interesting. And again, what we know here is just completely according to the lawsuit. Cisco has not commented publicly on the details of this case. There's been no trial. There are no witness statements made public. But according to the lawsuit, John Doe's case is handled by a Cisco HR rep named Brenda Davis. And Davis investigates. FRAYER: She gets a confession from one of John Doe's supervisors. This guy went to university with John Doe back in India 20 years ago, and now the supervisor tells the whole work team John Doe's caste. WARNER: Allegedly, the supervisor confesses to revealing information that outed the engineer as a Dalit. Now Brenda Davis has to decide if this is discrimination. We've asked to talk with her or with someone else from Cisco's HR department. They did not make anyone available. What is public is Cisco's anti-discrimination policy. FRAYER: Decisions are made without regard to gender, race, color, citizenship, religion, age, physical or mental ability, medical condition - this is the employee manual I'm reading - genetic information, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran status, national origin, ancestry - but not caste. WARNER: No. Maybe caste discrimination could fall under the term of ancestry, but Cisco's HR department did not read it that way. They closed the investigation - no discrimination here. FRAYER: But then the engineer goes to the state of California, and the state argues that this was a violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, religion or national origin. WARNER: And the state of California - or rather, specifically, the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing takes up the case, and they say U. S. laws against discrimination do apply to caste. And even though this case is in its early stages - it may take years to resolve and settle. But just the fact that this lawsuit is out there and that there might be some American legal response to casteism, it's made a lot more people in the U. S. speak out. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)THENMOZHI SOUNDARARAJAN: OK. Let's go ahead. . . WARNER: . . . About caste. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SOUNDARARAJAN: Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening for those that are joining us in India. WARNER: So this is a virtual town hall. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SOUNDARARAJAN: . . . This town hall on caste in tech. WARNER: Thenmozhi Soundararajan, who goes by the Twitter handle @dalitdiva, runs a human rights organization called Equality Labs. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SOUNDARARAJAN: After the Cisco case, Equality Labs got close to 300 similar complaints from Facebook, Google, Microsoft, IBM, Cisco, Amazon, Dell, Twitter, Uber. . . WARNER: Hundreds of complaints about caste discrimination in the workplace. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SOUNDARARAJAN: . . . Netflix, Salesforce, Lyft, Zoom, Dropbox and Quora. WARNER: And she says none of these people went to HR. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SOUNDARARAJAN: Not a single person because of the H-1B. WARNER: H-1B visas - so if you lose your job, you have to leave the States. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SOUNDARARAJAN: It's not just about losing your work; it's losing your status. One out of two Dalit respondents in our survey said they live in fear of being outed because. . . WARNER: There are other Dalits who speak in this town hall. But they speak anonymously, behind blackened screens. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KAMBLE: I had an Indian manager. WARNER: Here's an IT worker who goes by the name Maya Kamble (ph). (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KAMBLE: He knew what my caste was. So he wanted to dominate me as much as possible. And one day, he asked me not to touch a new tool because I was ill-fated. It was a direct reference to me being from an untouchable background, and I could just remember how my ancestors were supposed to not touch things just because they were considered bad luck and even their shadow was considered bad luck. WARNER: She'd never expected to feel that shadow over her. Which gets us to the thorniest part of trying to fix this problem. Caste discrimination is largely a shadow issue in the U. S. It's not talked about openly, like race discrimination. And even many South Asian employees who might be second- or third-generation immigrants may never have been to India and may only have a dim understanding of their own caste privilege. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ANIL DASH: Because it is fully possible to grow up within caste-privileged communities in America and not have visibility into the issues that people face as a result of caste in this country because they are erased. WARNER: One of the last to speak at this virtual town hall on caste in tech is a Brahmin. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DASH: I am as privileged as it gets, whether it is caste or gender or all the other aspects there. So I'm grateful to even get the chance to speak in these conversations. FRAYER: Anil Dash is a tech CEO and writer who has been talking and tweeting about caste discrimination in the workplace even before this lawsuit. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DASH: I can't emphasize this enough. Even the most powerful caste-privileged people in the industry who are of any South Asian descent still see themselves as completely precarious in a white-dominated tech industry, myself included. They still see themselves as they're the ones backed into a corner, they're vulnerable. So the idea that they are also replicating incredible harm, it is a leap. It has not occurred to them. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)WARNER: For Sam Cornelius and other Dalit employees, they say it's not enough for companies to just be aware of caste discrimination. They have to be proactive, make sure they're diversifying their employees and actually hiring more oppressed-caste workers. CORNELIUS: They may caste us (ph), if possible, in their diversity and inclusion practices. WARNER: In other words, he says that HR departments need to start asking employees about their caste and where they stand on this hierarchy, which are exactly the questions that Sam Cornelius is using an alias to try to avoid. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)FOUNTAIN: That was an excerpt from Rough Translation. It's not the whole episode. The rest of the episode goes into the invisible code people use to indicate their status in plain sight and what one person suggests we can do about it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)FOUNTAIN: The episode is called \"How To Be An Anti-Casteist,\" and you can find it and subscribe to the Rough Translation podcast wherever you are listening to this right now. Huge thanks to Gregory and the entire Rough Translation team for sharing this show with us today. I'm Nick Fountain. This is NPR. Thanks for listening.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WARNER: Sam is from the Dalit caste, formerly known as untouchables. And you may know this already, but the caste system in South Asia goes back thousands of years. It's based on an ancient division of labor and also purity. So there is a caste for priests. That's the Brahmins. But there's also a caste for the warriors, a caste for merchants, another caste for manual laborers. Dalits were the sewer cleaners, the garbage collectors. And in India growing up, Sam was always reminded of his association with the unclean. He saw it in the way the teachers treated him at school and the jokes people made about caste. And he always wondered what kind of person he might be if he did not have a label at all, if he was just Sam, no caste attached. And it seemed like he'd finally found that person, that new Sam, in the United States. CORNELIUS: I was doing so many activities and feeling so confident and feeling that my real potential is coming out. WARNER: After that first trip to the United States, he took another one and another after that, always here as a company employee on a work visa, never a citizen. And as more South Asians came to work in tech jobs, he had more Indian coworkers and managers. And he noticed they were trying to suss out his caste. CORNELIUS: There is famous spot on the back. Usually, Brahmins wear white thread around their shoulders. WARNER: They patted his shoulders to see if he was wearing a white thread that only Brahmins wear. CORNELIUS: So with you not even knowing, they will try to pat your shoulder and try to see - they're finding this thread. WARNER: Was he a Brahmin, like them? CORNELIUS: In other ways, they will call you for a swim, you know? Hey, let's go for a swim - because everybody takes their shirt off, and now they know who are wearing threads, who are not. WARNER: Years ago, these invitations to go swimming with American friends and neighbors were a sign of acceptance. But now the same invitations from his fellow Indians felt like a trap to out him as a Dalit. And the consequences of being outed - well, that is what our episode is about. . . (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WARNER: . . . Because some people think that naming people's caste is the way forward to a fair world, while Sam is so afraid he'll be sacked and sent back to India for speaking out. CORNELIUS: Yes, for this interview. . . WARNER: He's decided, if he's going to speak out publicly on this topic, he's adopting a pseudonym. CORNELIUS: . . . I am Sam Cornelius. Of course, that is my alias. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WARNER: This is Rough Translation from NPR. I'm Gregory Warner with a story about how an ancient hierarchy that we usually associate with India. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MAYA KAMBLE: I had an Indian manager. WARNER: . . . Has been imported to workplaces in the United States. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KAMBLE: He knew what my caste was. So he wanted to dominate me as much as possible. WARNER: Rough Translation - back after this break. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WARNER: We are back with Rough Translation from NPR. I'm Gregory Warner. We started talking about caste with Lauren Frayer. . . LAUREN FRAYER: Hello. This is Lauren. WARNER: . . . NPR's India correspondent, who started thinking about caste and race in part because of an initiative at NPR to track the diversity of our sources. This is something we all now do, including this podcast. We will note how many women we're putting on the air, how many people of color and other demographic stats. FRAYER: I see my company trying to better represent America with the voices we put on the air. And I'm looking at my own sourcing, and I get too much credit. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FRAYER: Every voice I bring to the airwaves from India is a person of color. Check the box, you know? That's diversity from my boss' point of view. But I'm looking at different types of diversity in India and thinking caste. WARNER: There is no uncontroversial way to talk about caste, and even the words we use are fraught. So you're going to hear people in this story talk about upper caste and lower caste. We're going to try to avoid those hierarchies and say dominant caste and oppressed caste. FRAYER: Oppression is a strong term, but it definitely applies here. This is oppression that's gone back centuries. It was really amplified by the British. So British colonists came in and gave Brahmins more privileges, elevated them and exploited this power differential between the Brahmins and other castes. And so when Indians won their independence in 1947, they wrote a constitution that acknowledges that oppression and lays out bold measures to try to fix it - affirmative action programs to place Dalits in government jobs, to place Dalits in top universities. And all of that exists in India still today. But despite all of this, Dalits in India face so much violence - disproportionate violence. Dalit women are raped more than women of other castes. Dalit men get lynched for falling in love with a dominant-caste woman. WARNER: Lauren knew she wanted to find out people's caste to make sure she was hearing from a variety of voices, including people who don't always get access to speak. But this brought a new problem. How actually do you find out someone's caste? CORNELIUS: So that is a good question. How does one person know your caste, right? It is not like you have a color which gives away your identity. WARNER: Sam Cornelius says sometimes it's easy. You just read someone's caste by their surname. CORNELIUS: Some surnames you cannot hide. WARNER: And how about your real surname? Is it easy to hide? CORNELIUS: Yeah, my real surname doesn't give away my caste easily. WARNER: Oh. CORNELIUS: OK? That is why, immediately, when I tell the surname, they will ask me, oh, where do you come from? You know, which part of that state you come from? They had to ask a follow-up question. FRAYER: If you can't tell by surname, you can ask about someone's neighborhood. CORNELIUS: I also try to be clever. I come from Hyderabad. So I tell, oh, I am from Hyderabad. FRAYER: It's a city of 9 million people, and all castes are there. CORNELIUS: So that's where the people are not satisfied if you give a city name. So what they do is - no, no, no. I'm not talking about where you come from. Where do originally your parents - which region or district they came from. WARNER: Sam keeps dodging the real question. CORNELIUS: My parents used to stay in Bombay, OK? So I tell them, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Actually, before that, my father used to work in the railway, so he was in Delhi (laughter). WARNER: You just keep naming cities. CORNELIUS: Yeah, naming cities because that is the facts, also. Then they'll understand that I am playing around, too. They give up. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FRAYER: Sam doesn't want to reveal his caste because most of his Indian co-workers are from dominant castes. In fact, the overwhelming majority of South Asians in America are from dominant castes. They're often the ones with the resources and access to get here. CORNELIUS: The other question usually people ask is - oh, are you vegetarian? - because Brahmins are vegetarians. Even if you say, well, yes, I'm a vegetarian, if you are an Indian asking an Indian to find out a caste, you would say, are you vegetarian by birth or by choice? OK? WARNER: And the tricky thing about this is that a co-worker could be overhearing this entire conversation and still have no clue what they're really talking about. CORNELIUS: Yeah, yeah. They will nod. Even the people who are very active about race, they know race discrimination and all - they might have not heard about caste at all. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WARNER: After the break, something happens that will have Sam and a lot of people in America talking with surprising candor about caste. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Suing a big corporation like Cisco was the most delightful news I heard in quite some time. WARNER: That's when Rough Translation returns. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WARNER: We're back with Rough Translation. I'm Gregory Warner. And today, we're talking about caste, and not just caste in India, but how the caste system has been imported to corporate America. FRAYER: So earlier this summer, a lawsuit was filed by the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing on behalf of an engineer at Cisco Systems. That's one of the largest makers of computer networking equipment. They've got offices around the world. They also hire a lot of Indians on H-1B visas to come to the U. S. WARNER: And like a lot of tech companies now, they have some teams that are all Indian employees. This lawsuit focuses on a team like that at Cisco's headquarters in San Jose, Calif. FRAYER: An engineer on that team alleges that two of his supervisors, who are from dominant castes, discriminated against him because they knew he was from an oppressed caste. WARNER: And what's his name, by the way? FRAYER: We don't know his name. In the lawsuit, he is listed as John Doe. So John Doe, the alleged victim, says that when he confronted his superiors about this, he faced retaliation. And his superiors isolated him from colleagues, gave him assignments that were impossible to complete in the time given - so basically tried to push John Doe out of the company. So what does he do? What are you told to do when you suspect you're a victim of discrimination? You go to your HR department. And that's what he does in November 2016. WARNER: And this is where things get interesting. And again, what we know here is just completely according to the lawsuit. Cisco has not commented publicly on the details of this case. There's been no trial. There are no witness statements made public. But according to the lawsuit, John Doe's case is handled by a Cisco HR rep named Brenda Davis. And Davis investigates. FRAYER: She gets a confession from one of John Doe's supervisors. This guy went to university with John Doe back in India 20 years ago, and now the supervisor tells the whole work team John Doe's caste. WARNER: Allegedly, the supervisor confesses to revealing information that outed the engineer as a Dalit. Now Brenda Davis has to decide if this is discrimination. We've asked to talk with her or with someone else from Cisco's HR department. They did not make anyone available. What is public is Cisco's anti-discrimination policy. FRAYER: Decisions are made without regard to gender, race, color, citizenship, religion, age, physical or mental ability, medical condition - this is the employee manual I'm reading - genetic information, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran status, national origin, ancestry - but not caste. WARNER: No. Maybe caste discrimination could fall under the term of ancestry, but Cisco's HR department did not read it that way. They closed the investigation - no discrimination here. FRAYER: But then the engineer goes to the state of California, and the state argues that this was a violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, religion or national origin. WARNER: And the state of California - or rather, specifically, the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing takes up the case, and they say U. S. laws against discrimination do apply to caste. And even though this case is in its early stages - it may take years to resolve and settle. But just the fact that this lawsuit is out there and that there might be some American legal response to casteism, it's made a lot more people in the U. S. speak out. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) THENMOZHI SOUNDARARAJAN: OK. Let's go ahead. . . WARNER: . . . About caste. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SOUNDARARAJAN: Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening for those that are joining us in India. WARNER: So this is a virtual town hall. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SOUNDARARAJAN: . . . This town hall on caste in tech. WARNER: Thenmozhi Soundararajan, who goes by the Twitter handle @dalitdiva, runs a human rights organization called Equality Labs. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SOUNDARARAJAN: After the Cisco case, Equality Labs got close to 300 similar complaints from Facebook, Google, Microsoft, IBM, Cisco, Amazon, Dell, Twitter, Uber. . . WARNER: Hundreds of complaints about caste discrimination in the workplace. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SOUNDARARAJAN: . . . Netflix, Salesforce, Lyft, Zoom, Dropbox and Quora. WARNER: And she says none of these people went to HR. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SOUNDARARAJAN: Not a single person because of the H-1B. WARNER: H-1B visas - so if you lose your job, you have to leave the States. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SOUNDARARAJAN: It's not just about losing your work; it's losing your status. One out of two Dalit respondents in our survey said they live in fear of being outed because. . . WARNER: There are other Dalits who speak in this town hall. But they speak anonymously, behind blackened screens. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KAMBLE: I had an Indian manager. WARNER: Here's an IT worker who goes by the name Maya Kamble (ph). (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KAMBLE: He knew what my caste was. So he wanted to dominate me as much as possible. And one day, he asked me not to touch a new tool because I was ill-fated. It was a direct reference to me being from an untouchable background, and I could just remember how my ancestors were supposed to not touch things just because they were considered bad luck and even their shadow was considered bad luck. WARNER: She'd never expected to feel that shadow over her. Which gets us to the thorniest part of trying to fix this problem. Caste discrimination is largely a shadow issue in the U. S. It's not talked about openly, like race discrimination. And even many South Asian employees who might be second- or third-generation immigrants may never have been to India and may only have a dim understanding of their own caste privilege. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ANIL DASH: Because it is fully possible to grow up within caste-privileged communities in America and not have visibility into the issues that people face as a result of caste in this country because they are erased. WARNER: One of the last to speak at this virtual town hall on caste in tech is a Brahmin. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DASH: I am as privileged as it gets, whether it is caste or gender or all the other aspects there. So I'm grateful to even get the chance to speak in these conversations. FRAYER: Anil Dash is a tech CEO and writer who has been talking and tweeting about caste discrimination in the workplace even before this lawsuit. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DASH: I can't emphasize this enough. Even the most powerful caste-privileged people in the industry who are of any South Asian descent still see themselves as completely precarious in a white-dominated tech industry, myself included. They still see themselves as they're the ones backed into a corner, they're vulnerable. So the idea that they are also replicating incredible harm, it is a leap. It has not occurred to them. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WARNER: For Sam Cornelius and other Dalit employees, they say it's not enough for companies to just be aware of caste discrimination. They have to be proactive, make sure they're diversifying their employees and actually hiring more oppressed-caste workers. CORNELIUS: They may caste us (ph), if possible, in their diversity and inclusion practices. WARNER: In other words, he says that HR departments need to start asking employees about their caste and where they stand on this hierarchy, which are exactly the questions that Sam Cornelius is using an alias to try to avoid. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FOUNTAIN: That was an excerpt from Rough Translation. It's not the whole episode. The rest of the episode goes into the invisible code people use to indicate their status in plain sight and what one person suggests we can do about it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FOUNTAIN: The episode is called \"How To Be An Anti-Casteist,\" and you can find it and subscribe to the Rough Translation podcast wherever you are listening to this right now.

They also see it as a battle between the president and social media. This week, Twitter blocked and Facebook limited the reach of an article with unconfirmed claims about Biden, and the president and his allies are calling foul. Meanwhile, experts warn that these platforms are rife with misinformation and threats to the election. NPR's tech correspondent Shannon Bond joins us with more. Hi, Shannon. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Hi, Ari. SHAPIRO: This has blown up into a really big deal. Explain why. BOND: Well, I think, you know, this is really - it's maybe the biggest decision that Facebook and Twitter have made so far about what content they limit on their platforms. This is all about a New York Post story that's based on supposed emails from Hunter Biden, Joe Biden's son. And there's lots of questions about the story, including whether these emails are real and how they were obtained by the Trump associates who gave them to the Post. SHAPIRO: And explain exactly what Facebook and Twitter did in response to this controversial and unfounded story. BOND: That's right. So Facebook said it would show the links to this story less frequently in users' news feeds so fewer people would see it. They said that was to give its independent fact-checkers more time to check it out. And we should note here that Facebook is an NPR sponsor. Twitter took a much more aggressive approach. It blocked people from posting the link at all or posting any images of these emails. And the reason, Twitter said, is that the posts break its rules about sharing personal information and about spreading hacked materials. But it didn't give any more details about how it reached that conclusion. SHAPIRO: I should say - I characterized it as an unfounded story. I should say it is a questionable story, and there are a lot of unclear things about it. Republicans are up in arms about this today. And is this useful political ammunition for them? BOND: Well, I think you just need to listen to what Republican Sen. Ted Cruz said today. This is going to be a big talking point for them in the weeks before Election Day. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TED CRUZ: We have seen big tech - we've seen Twitter and Facebook actively interfering in this election in a way that has no precedent in the history of our country. BOND: Now, this is something conservatives complain about a lot, that the social media companies are biased and censor them. There's not a lot of data on this, but what we do know shows it doesn't really support those claims. And remember, Ari, in general, social media companies make decisions all the time about what we see in our feeds, but they don't always do a good job of explaining how and when they apply their rules. And this week, even Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said the way Twitter communicated blocking these links without more explanation was unacceptable. SHAPIRO: We're lately hearing so much more from the tech companies about what they let people post and why. Is this just the lessons of 2016 manifesting, being close to an election? What's going on? BOND: Yeah. I mean, just today, YouTube said it was going to ban content about the QAnon conspiracy theory. That's something Facebook and Twitter have already done. And there's just a lot of rules now about trying to stamp out misinformation and these conspiracy theories. And make no mistake; there are real threats on social media right now. The Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee had a hearing about this today. Here's what Nina Jankowicz, who studies Russian disinformation, told them. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)NINA JANKOWICZ: Nineteen days before voting closes in the 2020 election, I believe we are more vulnerable to online disinformation from both foreign and domestic sources than ever before. BOND: And so she emphasized, you know, there's a real-world impact to these things that happen online. Like that plot that we heard about to kidnap Michigan's governor - that was in part organized on Facebook. SHAPIRO: And so what's going to happen next? This is obviously an ongoing story. BOND: Well, whenever the tech companies act to limit misinformation, that, of course, makes them part of the story. So I think we can expect to keep hearing these criticisms from conservatives about this, you know, in the coming weeks. And Senate Republicans are going to get a chance to question the CEOs of Twitter, Facebook and Google about how they handle speech. That's a hearing that's scheduled just six days before the election. SHAPIRO: That's NPR tech correspondent Shannon Bond. Thank you, Shannon. BOND: Thanks, Ari.

Here's the president speaking during the NBC town hall moderated by Savannah Guthrie. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SAVANNAH GUTHRIE: Now, can you just once and for all state that that is completely not true. . . PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: So I know - yeah. GUTHRIE: . . . And disavow QAnon in its entirety? TRUMP: I know nothing about QAnon. GUTHRIE: I just told you. TRUMP: I know very little. You told me. But what you tell me doesn't necessarily make it fact. I hate to say that. I know nothing about it. I do know they are very much against pedophilia. MARTIN: YouTube's moves to limit the spread of QAnon conspiracy theories is just one of the efforts by tech companies to crackdown ahead of Election Day. Facebook, for instance, rolled out a ban on messages that deny the Holocaust and ads that discourage vaccinations. So are these policies enough? And what kind of disinformation is being pushed ahead of Election Day? We've called Camille Francois for this. She is a former executive at Google. And she is the chief innovation officer at Graphika, which analyzes data and networks. And she's with us now from New York. Camille Francois, thank you so much for joining us. CAMILLE FRANCOIS: Thank you for having me. MARTIN: Would you just start by telling us some of the current threads of misinformation currently being pushed online? What's your organization been tracking? FRANCOIS: We tend to put a lot of different concepts under the broad umbrella of misinformation and disinformation. And in reality, there are a lot of these pieces that don't belong together. So when your uncle shares some bad information on Facebook, that really has nothing to do with, for instance, the sophisticated Russian troll farm campaign that seeks to attack the integrity of the election. We continue to see a lot of foreign threats. Russia continue to be active in the space, along with China and Iran. And there are a lot, of course, of domestic threats. We've talked about conspiratorial theories. QAnon is a big one. There are also concerns with militarized social movements, movements like the boogaloo, for instance. And, finally, there's sort of a wealth of bad and unreliable information that people can share without any bad intent. And this is what we call misinformation. MARTIN: So let's take those, separately. I mean, I take your point. I know that a lot of news organizations and different nonprofit groups and authors have been trying to address the - what I would call the benign misinformation that you just described, you know? Your uncle passing things along just because that's what he's interested in, doesn't realize that it's not true. There have been a lot of groups trying to address that in recent years, trying to get people to practice good information hygiene, you know, as it were. Are those efforts making any difference at all from what you can see? FRANCOIS: I think those efforts are helping. Labeling the source of the information is helping and helping people verify where the information they're sharing are coming from. I'll give you specific examples. Recently, we've seen a lot of viral photos and viral videos that were pretending to be from, you know, New York last week or Chicago 10 minutes ago. In reality, people who are sharing this believe it to be the case. But those videos were quickly proven to actually be totally decontextualized. One of them was from Paris in 2016. Another one was actually from I think Chicago but, you know, years ago. And so helping people understand where is the information coming from also help them not share things that are decontextualized. MARTIN: So what about the other end of the spectrum, what you talked about, these organized troll farm efforts mainly by, you know, hostile foreign governments? Is what you're seeing now - how is that - how does that compare to 2016? FRANCOIS: Hey, that's a great question. Let me be straightforward. In 2016, neither Silicon Valley nor Washington was prepared to tackle foreign interference. The large Russian efforts to manipulate public conversations were quite successful. And if you think about it, none of the major platforms had any rules to prevent this type of activity. And they had no teams focused on detecting this type of activity. We've gone a long way since then. In 2020, we have - all major platforms have now created very specific rules against these types of hostile troll farm activity. So we're in a much better place because there's a professional field of people detecting this type of activity. And everybody has agreed that this was unwanted and has created rules around it. MARTIN: Well, as we mentioned, Facebook announced just last week that it would be banning conspiracy-based movements or ideas being pushed by conspiracy-based movements, like QAnon. And YouTube announced similar plans to address that group and others like it just a couple of days ago. But I take your point. But it's less than three weeks until Election Day. Does it strike you as kind of a little bit late? FRANCOIS: I think you're right that the platforms have been much slower to address domestic disinformation and to address some of design considerations that help disinformation go viral than what they have with foreign actors. And so Facebook, for instance, for the first time, took action on QAnon under the idea that the conspiracy theory was actually violence-generating. And it did that in two waves. On the first wave of action, they said, let's remove all the pages that are related to QAnon and have a violent content. And on the second wave, they said, actually, let's just remove all pages and groups and Instagram accounts that are representing QAnon, even if they contain no violent content, right? So they came around to the idea that the very idea of the QAnon conspiracy theory was not wanted on Facebook and was a violent-inducing conspiracy theory. We also saw Twitter do something quite interesting. They created a temporary election season set of changes. They're making it harder for people to retweet quickly, and they're turning off some of the suggestions just for the election season, recognizing that some of these features can accelerate the spread of harmful mis- and disinformation throughout the election. MARTIN: Do you feel that - on the whole that this country is safer from the kinds of distorting effects that we saw in 2016, especially the intentionally destructive effects than we were four years ago? FRANCOIS: Yeah. I think that the technology industry's in a better place to make us safer. But I think that some of the threats are not technology threats. And I think that when you see elected officials sort of actively participating in disseminating harmful and false information, then you don't really have a Twitter, Facebook problem; you have a political problem. And so I think that overall, there is a lot that has been done by the technology industry and by the platforms to get better at tackling mis- and disinformation. There's still more that needs to be done. But, unfortunately, not all of this problem is a technology problem. We also have a really important political problem around spreading disinformation. MARTIN: That was Camille Francois. She is a data researcher and the chief innovation officer at Graphika. Ms. Francois, thank you so much for joining us today and sharing your expertise. FRANCOIS: Thank you for having me. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:   On the same day this week that YouTube said it would remove more, quote, \"conspiracy theory content used to justify real-world violence,\" unquote, President Trump refused to disavow one of the groups pushing that material online. Here's the president speaking during the NBC town hall moderated by Savannah Guthrie. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SAVANNAH GUTHRIE: Now, can you just once and for all state that that is completely not true. . . PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: So I know - yeah. GUTHRIE: . . . And disavow QAnon in its entirety? TRUMP: I know nothing about QAnon. GUTHRIE: I just told you. TRUMP: I know very little. You told me. But what you tell me doesn't necessarily make it fact. I hate to say that. I know nothing about it. I do know they are very much against pedophilia. MARTIN: YouTube's moves to limit the spread of QAnon conspiracy theories is just one of the efforts by tech companies to crackdown ahead of Election Day. Facebook, for instance, rolled out a ban on messages that deny the Holocaust and ads that discourage vaccinations. So are these policies enough? And what kind of disinformation is being pushed ahead of Election Day? We've called Camille Francois for this. She is a former executive at Google. And she is the chief innovation officer at Graphika, which analyzes data and networks. And she's with us now from New York. Camille Francois, thank you so much for joining us. CAMILLE FRANCOIS: Thank you for having me. MARTIN: Would you just start by telling us some of the current threads of misinformation currently being pushed online? What's your organization been tracking? FRANCOIS: We tend to put a lot of different concepts under the broad umbrella of misinformation and disinformation. And in reality, there are a lot of these pieces that don't belong together. So when your uncle shares some bad information on Facebook, that really has nothing to do with, for instance, the sophisticated Russian troll farm campaign that seeks to attack the integrity of the election. We continue to see a lot of foreign threats. Russia continue to be active in the space, along with China and Iran. And there are a lot, of course, of domestic threats. We've talked about conspiratorial theories. QAnon is a big one. There are also concerns with militarized social movements, movements like the boogaloo, for instance. And, finally, there's sort of a wealth of bad and unreliable information that people can share without any bad intent. And this is what we call misinformation. MARTIN: So let's take those, separately. I mean, I take your point. I know that a lot of news organizations and different nonprofit groups and authors have been trying to address the - what I would call the benign misinformation that you just described, you know? Your uncle passing things along just because that's what he's interested in, doesn't realize that it's not true. There have been a lot of groups trying to address that in recent years, trying to get people to practice good information hygiene, you know, as it were. Are those efforts making any difference at all from what you can see? FRANCOIS: I think those efforts are helping. Labeling the source of the information is helping and helping people verify where the information they're sharing are coming from. I'll give you specific examples. Recently, we've seen a lot of viral photos and viral videos that were pretending to be from, you know, New York last week or Chicago 10 minutes ago. In reality, people who are sharing this believe it to be the case. But those videos were quickly proven to actually be totally decontextualized. One of them was from Paris in 2016. Another one was actually from I think Chicago but, you know, years ago. And so helping people understand where is the information coming from also help them not share things that are decontextualized. MARTIN: So what about the other end of the spectrum, what you talked about, these organized troll farm efforts mainly by, you know, hostile foreign governments? Is what you're seeing now - how is that - how does that compare to 2016? FRANCOIS: Hey, that's a great question. Let me be straightforward. In 2016, neither Silicon Valley nor Washington was prepared to tackle foreign interference. The large Russian efforts to manipulate public conversations were quite successful. And if you think about it, none of the major platforms had any rules to prevent this type of activity. And they had no teams focused on detecting this type of activity. We've gone a long way since then. In 2020, we have - all major platforms have now created very specific rules against these types of hostile troll farm activity. So we're in a much better place because there's a professional field of people detecting this type of activity. And everybody has agreed that this was unwanted and has created rules around it. MARTIN: Well, as we mentioned, Facebook announced just last week that it would be banning conspiracy-based movements or ideas being pushed by conspiracy-based movements, like QAnon. And YouTube announced similar plans to address that group and others like it just a couple of days ago. But I take your point. But it's less than three weeks until Election Day. Does it strike you as kind of a little bit late? FRANCOIS: I think you're right that the platforms have been much slower to address domestic disinformation and to address some of design considerations that help disinformation go viral than what they have with foreign actors.

We all know that. But it is not all fun stuff. The platform is confronting a surge of misinformation and extremist content. So TikTok is learning from Facebook and Twitter, which have been dealing with this for a while. Here's NPR's Bobby Allyn. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Early on in the pandemic, a guy in Brooklyn walked by a hospital and took out his phone. He opened TikTok and started filming. It was part of a disinformation campaign to frame the coronavirus as a hoax. (SOUNDBITE OF TIKTOK VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Not much happening. And this is a hospital that serves thousands and thousands of people here in downtown Brooklyn, N. Y. There is no mass chaos out here, contrary to what the mainstream media is telling you. ALLYN: He went by the username saynotosocialism on TikTok. Now, of course, believing that recording the outside of a hospital proves anything at all is absurd. But the Trump-supporting conspiracy theory QAnon endorsed the idea. And on TikTok, it caught on. ANGELO CARUSONE: More people saw it. More people were going to film their hospital, which in turn was getting them video views and incentivizing more people to do it. So it was this incredible feedback loop. ALLYN: That's Angelo Carusone, president of the left-leaning watchdog group Media Matters, which found more than a dozen QAnon hashtags on TikTok that together garnered hundreds of millions of views. TikTok has since banned all QAnon content. But Carusone says TikTok's algorithm rewards engagement. And hoaxes - they could be really engaging. CARUSONE: The algorithm is sort of like the recommendation engines of YouTube but on steroids. ALLYN: The power and reach of the app isn't lost on other fringe groups. Earlier this month, Brandon Caserta was arrested in connection with a plot to kidnap the governor of Michigan. Before that happened, though, he posted this TikTok, previewing his, quote, \"recon plan. \"(SOUNDBITE OF TIKTOK VIDEO)BRANDON CASERTA: Guess what? I'm sick of being robbed and enslaved by the state, period. I'm sick of it. And these are the guys who are actually doing it. ALLYN: TikTok took down Caserta's video and the earlier one of the hospital. TikTok says it will remove all accounts sharing hate and misinformation. But in reality, some extremists have learned how to outfox the app's defenses - both human and AI. The Anti-Defamation League's Dave Sifry found that white supremacists are using code language on TikTok to find new recruits. DAVE SIFRY: The number one for the letter I or L. And so you might see n-4-z-l standing for Nazi. ALLYN: Another common tactic among extremists on TikTok is attempting to hijack a trending topic. SIFRY: They might use the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter as a way to actually promulgate some of their hateful ideologies to people who are searching for other kinds of videos. ALLYN: But those who work with TikTok say it deserves credit for not repeating the mistakes of older social networks like Facebook and Twitter. TikTok has learned that a scattershot method of just taking down bad stuff as it appears doesn't work. The controls have to be proactive. Hany Farid is a UC Berkeley computer science professor who sits on a TikTok advisory panel. HANY FARID: Ah, here's a piece of content. Ah, here's a group. Let's ban this. Let's not ban that. And there's no coherent policy. And I think TikTok has the advantage of coming to this game relatively late and seeing what has not worked with the other social media companies. ALLYN: Unlike other social networks, Farid says TikTok sees itself as entertainment. And that's mostly what you see on the platform - dances, jokes, pranks, ridiculous dog videos. Hateful and violent videos are made, too, though TikTok is good at catching it. Still, Farid admits it's there if you look hard enough. FARID: And I'm not excusing it. I'm not saying, well, you know, that's the price you pay. But, you know, just playing defense is hard. And no matter how good the algorithms get, no matter how many moderators you hire, there's going to be mistakes. ALLYN: TikTok has twice as many U. S. users as Twitter.

The spacecraft only needs to stay there for five to 10 seconds, just long enough to collect some dust and rocks, which is pretty cool if it works, which it might not. Here's NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: The asteroid is named Bennu. It's about 200 million miles away, and it's a potentially dangerous asteroid. DANTE LAURETTA: Our most recent calculations suggest that it has about a 1 in 2,700 chance of impacting the Earth. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Dante Lauretta of the University of Arizona is the principal investigator for a NASA mission called OSIRIS-REx. He says the good news is this asteroid wouldn't hit Earth for at least 150 years. LAURETTA: And part of the OSIRIS-REx mission is to better understand that impact probability. GREENFIELDBOYCE: What's more - asteroids are like pristine relics of the early solar system, undisturbed leftovers from when the planets first formed. So NASA isn't the only space agency interested in asteroids. Japan's has already collected a tiny amount of asteroid material that's on its way back to Earth. It will get here in December. Lori Glaze is head of NASA's planetary science division. She says the agencies have been collaborating. LORI GLAZE: And, of course, we'll be exchanging portions of each other's samples so that we can maximize the science. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Assuming NASA's effort goes off without a hitch. Its probe arrived at Bennu a couple years ago, giving researchers their first up-close view of this asteroid. Lauretta says they were expecting a smooth, sandy surface. LAURETTA: Immediately, I was struck by how rough and rugged and rocky the surface was. GREENFIELDBOYCE: It's been a real challenge to find a relatively rock-free spot where the probe can be ordered to briefly touch down. Later today, operators will send the go command. As the spacecraft leaves orbit and ventures down, the scientists will only be able to watch a trickle of data coming back. LAURETTA: There's nothing we can do to change the course of events. In fact, by the time we get the data, everything that happened was 18 1/2 minutes in the past because that's how far away the spacecraft is from the Earth. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The spacecraft, which is about the size of a big passenger van, will head to a crater that's about the size of a tennis court, but it's filled with boulders. LAURETTA: So we're actually targeting a site about half that size, about 10 meters across. This is roughly the size of a few parking spaces in a parking lot. GREENFIELDBOYCE: If the spacecraft's onboard systems decide that it's likely to hit a dangerous rock, it might call off the attempt. If everything goes just right, the research team will know right away if they've touched the surface. Knowing if they've got a sample will take longer. Beth Buck is the mission operations program manager at Lockheed Martin Space. BETH BUCK: Our first imagery will start coming in on Wednesday, and that will give us a much better feel for whether we have a sample or not and how the spacecraft is actually performing. GREENFIELDBOYCE: With luck, they'll have collected everything from tiny grains to stones nearly an inch across. Heather Enos of the University of Arizona is the deputy principal investigator for the mission. HEATHER ENOS: The best outcome would be that we would collect a massive sample. I mean, we say we have a requirement of 60 grams or two ounces, so we have the capability of collecting up to two kilograms. And I would love for that capsule to be completely full. GREENFIELDBOYCE: By October 30, the team will decide whether or not to try another sample collection attempt in January. And in March, the spacecraft will start its two-year journey back home.

The U. S. , France and Ukraine were all affected, other countries and some companies, too. NPR justice correspondent Ryan Lucas is here with details. Good morning, Ryan. RYAN LUCAS, BYLINE: Good morning, Noel. KING: How significant were these attacks? LUCAS: These attacks are a big deal. Officials and experts say that they're some of the most damaging cyberattacks that we've seen in recent years. And the indictment spells them all out. It starts with cyberattacks that targeted Ukraine's electricity grid back in the winters of 2015 and 2016. Here's how the head of the Justice Department's national security division, John Demers, described those. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOHN DEMERS: These attacks turned out the lights and turned off the heat in the middle of the Eastern European winter as the lives of hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian men, women and children went dark and cold. LUCAS: Now, the defendants are also accused of a really nasty cyberattack known as NotPetya that initially targeted Ukraine but very quickly spread across the globe. It caused billions of dollars in damages including in the United States. The indictment says that it knocked a hospital system in Pennsylvania offline, including its critical systems. And one company in the U. S. , according to the indictment, spent half a billion dollars dealing with the fallout from that attack. KING: OK. So that's a lot of money and also, in the case of Ukraine, a lot of people hurt. LUCAS: Absolutely. Absolutely. And there's more in the indictment, more attacks. They allegedly conducted a hack and leak operation in the run up to France's 2017 election. That targeted the campaign of the now president of France, Emmanuel Macron. Then there are cyberattacks targeting the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea. There's an interesting thing in the indictment here saying that the Russians tried to leave digital fingerprints behind to frame North Korea for that one. And finally, there are hacks that targeted the investigations that British and international authorities were conducting into the poisoning of a former Russian spy in the U. K. with a nerve agent. KING: Who are these guys that the Justice Department is charging? LUCAS: So the department says that all six men who are facing charges are current or former members of Russia's military intelligence agency. That's the GRU. It's the same Russian intelligence service that was responsible for some of the hacks that we saw targeting the U. S. election back in 2016. Interestingly, one of the defendants here was also charged as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation back in 2018. But this new indictment and the allegations that are in it, it shows what Justice Department officials say is, really, Russia's reckless use of cyberattacks. Here, again, is the Justice Department's John Demers. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DEMERS: No country has weaponized its cyber capabilities as maliciously and irresponsibly as Russia - wantonly causing unprecedented collateral damage to pursue small tactical advantages in fits of spite. LUCAS: Now, the DOJ says these attacks pursued Russia's geopolitical goals. Take Ukraine, for example - Ukraine and Russia have been locked in a war now for several years in eastern Ukraine. Now, the hacks targeting the 2018 Olympics could be seen more as a fit of spite, as Demers put it there. Russian athletes were banned from competing under the Russian flag because of a massive, state-sponsored doping scandal in Russia. KING: Really runs the gamut. Let me ask you lastly - so the GRU meddled in the 2016 election. Does this indictment say or suggest that they're interfering in this election? LUCAS: There's nothing related to that in this indictment. And U. S. officials said in announcing these charges that the timing was not tied at all to the political schedule. That said, this is a good reminder of what Russian state hackers are capable of. And it also makes clear that they didn't tone it down after the U. S. called the Russians out for election interference back in 2016. In this case, none of the defendants is in U. S. custody. It's unlikely that any of them ever will be. Still, U. S. officials say it is worth putting the weight of the U. S. government behind these allegations and calling Russia out. KING: Justice correspondent Ryan Lucas. Thanks, Ryan. LUCAS: Thank you. NOEL KING, HOST:  The Justice Department has charged six Russian intelligence officers in connection with hacking computer systems around the world. The U. S. , France and Ukraine were all affected, other countries and some companies, too. NPR justice correspondent Ryan Lucas is here with details. Good morning, Ryan. RYAN LUCAS, BYLINE: Good morning, Noel. KING: How significant were these attacks? LUCAS: These attacks are a big deal. Officials and experts say that they're some of the most damaging cyberattacks that we've seen in recent years. And the indictment spells them all out. It starts with cyberattacks that targeted Ukraine's electricity grid back in the winters of 2015 and 2016. Here's how the head of the Justice Department's national security division, John Demers, described those. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOHN DEMERS: These attacks turned out the lights and turned off the heat in the middle of the Eastern European winter as the lives of hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian men, women and children went dark and cold. LUCAS: Now, the defendants are also accused of a really nasty cyberattack known as NotPetya that initially targeted Ukraine but very quickly spread across the globe. It caused billions of dollars in damages including in the United States. The indictment says that it knocked a hospital system in Pennsylvania offline, including its critical systems. And one company in the U. S. , according to the indictment, spent half a billion dollars dealing with the fallout from that attack. KING: OK. So that's a lot of money and also, in the case of Ukraine, a lot of people hurt. LUCAS: Absolutely. Absolutely. And there's more in the indictment, more attacks. They allegedly conducted a hack and leak operation in the run up to France's 2017 election. That targeted the campaign of the now president of France, Emmanuel Macron. Then there are cyberattacks targeting the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea. There's an interesting thing in the indictment here saying that the Russians tried to leave digital fingerprints behind to frame North Korea for that one. And finally, there are hacks that targeted the investigations that British and international authorities were conducting into the poisoning of a former Russian spy in the U. K. with a nerve agent. KING: Who are these guys that the Justice Department is charging? LUCAS: So the department says that all six men who are facing charges are current or former members of Russia's military intelligence agency. That's the GRU. It's the same Russian intelligence service that was responsible for some of the hacks that we saw targeting the U. S. election back in 2016. Interestingly, one of the defendants here was also charged as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation back in 2018. But this new indictment and the allegations that are in it, it shows what Justice Department officials say is, really, Russia's reckless use of cyberattacks. Here, again, is the Justice Department's John Demers. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DEMERS: No country has weaponized its cyber capabilities as maliciously and irresponsibly as Russia - wantonly causing unprecedented collateral damage to pursue small tactical advantages in fits of spite. LUCAS: Now, the DOJ says these attacks pursued Russia's geopolitical goals. Take Ukraine, for example - Ukraine and Russia have been locked in a war now for several years in eastern Ukraine. Now, the hacks targeting the 2018 Olympics could be seen more as a fit of spite, as Demers put it there. Russian athletes were banned from competing under the Russian flag because of a massive, state-sponsored doping scandal in Russia. KING: Really runs the gamut. Let me ask you lastly - so the GRU meddled in the 2016 election. Does this indictment say or suggest that they're interfering in this election? LUCAS: There's nothing related to that in this indictment. And U. S. officials said in announcing these charges that the timing was not tied at all to the political schedule.

S. Justice Department and 11 states are suing Google, accusing it of squeezing out competitors and monopolizing Internet search. The government says the tech giant is hurting consumers by making it hard for rival search engines to gain a foothold. NPR's Shannon Bond covers Google, which we should note is among NPR's financial supporters. Hi, Shannon. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Hi, Tonya. MOSLEY: So how does the government allege Google is hurting its competitors? BOND: Well, in short, it says Google is abusing its power. And this case is really all about Google's dominance. The Justice Department says about 80% of Internet searches in the U. S. go through Google, and that number is even bigger on mobile phones. And that's because Google has spent a lot of money over the years to be the default search engine on many browsers and phones, like Apple iPhones. And the government says that's made it hard for other companies to compete. Here's U. S. Deputy Attorney General Jeff Rosen. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JEFF ROSEN: If the government does not enforce the antitrust laws to enable competition, we could lose the next wave of innovation. If that happens, Americans may never get to see the next Google. MOSLEY: How is Google responding to these charges? BOND: Well, it says this lawsuit is deeply flawed. You know, it says people aren't forced to use Google. They choose to use it because it's the best search engine. And Google also says these contracts we're talking about to be the default search provider aren't unfair. It compares it to a company that makes cereal paying a supermarket for, you know, better placement on the shelf. And that - you know, that doesn't mean that other cereal isn't also there on the shelf for you to buy. So Google says consumers can and do choose which search engine they want to use. MOSLEY: OK, Shannon, but I bet if I were to ask one of these other search engines, they would actually say Google doesn't make it easy for them. BOND: That's right. So, you know, on many phones, as we've said, Google search is the default because of these contracts. That's especially true of phones that run on Google's Android software, which is the majority of phones in the world. I spoke to Gabriel Weinberg. He's the CEO of DuckDuckGo, another search engine. And he says it takes a lot of steps to change all the default settings there. And people - a lot of people just don't do that. And Weinberg says that's why his company has only been able to get about 2% market share in search. GABRIEL WEINBERG: But if it was really one click, like Google itself says it should be, we think that 2% would be easily 20% today. BOND: So Weinberg says it should be easier to change search providers. And we should also note here that DuckDuckGo is also a financial supporter of NPR. MOSLEY: So what could this lawsuit mean? Is Google going to be broken up? BOND: That's really the big question. And, you know, the Justice Department's lawsuit doesn't get into specifics, but officials have said all options are on the table. That could mean pushing Google to split off some businesses. But, you know, this is going to take a long time. If we look back to the last big antitrust lawsuit against a tech giant - that was Microsoft in the 1990s - that took years to resolve. So this is a long road we're going to be on. MOSLEY: And, you know, in the meantime, we're just two weeks away from the election. Is it possible the timing of this suit is also politically motivated? BOND: Well, there certainly have been questions over why the Department of Justice is filing this suit now. You know, we have heard the Trump administration talk a lot about cracking down on big tech. Justice officials say, you know, this is the result of a 16-month-long investigation. It's not driven by any kind of political schedule or considerations. But I think the backdrop to this is there has been the real change in Washington after years of this hands-off approach to the tech industry. Now Republicans and Democrats are much more skeptical about the power of these big companies. MOSLEY: Definitely a lot to follow here. That's NPR's Shannon Bond. Thank you so much.

They say the company broke antitrust laws on its way to becoming the most dominant search engine in the world. Now, this lawsuit sets up the biggest fight over a tech giant's power in more than about 20 years. NPR's Shannon Bond covers Google, which, we should note, is among NPR's financial supporters. Hey, Shannon. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Good morning, Noel. KING: OK. So Google is being accused of abusing its power. What does the Department of Justice say exactly? BOND: Well, here is Deputy Attorney General Jeff Rosen at a press conference this morning. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)JEFFREY ROSEN: Google is the gateway to the Internet and a search advertising behemoth. Google achieved some success in its early years, and no one begrudges that. But as the antitrust complaint filed today explains, it has maintained its monopoly power through exclusionary practices that are harmful to competition. KING: OK - A little bit of lingo. What does he mean by that in simple terms? BOND: Well, I think we all know Google has these huge businesses, right? It's the biggest search engine. Eighty percent of searches in the U. S. happen on Google, the DOJ says. And the company also sells $160 billion a year in ads. And basically, what this case is arguing is Google has got there and kind of created this monopoly unfairly. And so the Justice Department says it's done this by striking deals to become the default search engine in many browsers and on people's smartphones. It pays billions of dollars every year to do this. And the DOJ says that has blocked out competitors. It's allowed Google to keep making billions of dollars selling advertising. The government described this feedback loop as the self-reinforcing monopolies. And ultimately, the government is arguing here, that has meant less choice for consumers - we just don't have another search engine to go to - and higher prices for the advertisers. KING: A lot of companies in - several companies in Silicon Valley, several big ones, are facing the same kinds of accusations. What are the implications of this lawsuit for Facebook, for example? BOND: Right. Well, as - let's just sort of back up a little bit. As you said at the top, you know, this is the most - biggest, you know, antitrust case in tech since the Microsoft case more than 20 years ago. And, you know, since then, Washington has taken a really hands-off approach to regulating tech. We've seen the industry thrive and grow largely without limits, but that's really beginning to change. So, you know, in this specific case, the Justice Department and the attorneys general have been investigating Google for more than a year. We should say 11 attorneys general has joined the Justice Department in this suit. And they are also looking at other companies like Facebook, like Amazon, like Apple - both the Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission, attorneys general. And those investigations are ongoing, so I think it would be fair to expect more of this in the future. KING: OK. So this was just announced a few hours ago. What has Google said so far? BOND: Right. So this morning, Google has said that the lawsuit is deeply flawed. It says, quote, \"People use Google because they choose to, not because they are forced to or because they can't find alternatives. \" That kind of thing is what Google has been saying for a long time. And we should note, they've weathered challenges before. In 2013, there was a Federal Trade Commission investigation into the search business that ended with no accusations of wrongdoing. But at the same time, regulators in Europe have been taking a closer look. And Google has been fined more than $9 billion in the past few years over competition issues. So, you know, I think this is setting up for a big fight. KING: Is it significant at all that this is happening two weeks before Election Day? BOND: Well, I was just thinking, this is - there's long-standing Justice Department policy that the department not take any action in the runup to an election. The idea there is you want to avoid even the appearance of using the department's powers to influence an election. And certainly in this case, critics may say, you know, the department is violating that policy, if not in word, then in spirit. You know, officials on the press conference this morning said this was not political. This was - you know, this is an investigation that's been going on for 16 months, and they felt the timing is right. But it's also, you know, not a secret. Attorney General Bill Barr has been outspoken about reining in big tech. It's something the Trump administration talks about a lot. You know, Democrats and Republicans in Congress have also been calling for action to rein in the power of big tech and to really kind of grapple with its influence on our lives. So, you know, I think we can expect to see more scrutiny of Google and the other tech companies. KING: OK. NPR's Shannon Bond. Thanks, Shannon. BOND: Thank you.

(SOUNDBITE OF COIN SPINNING)KENNY MALONE, HOST:  For years now, as the big tech companies turned into really big tech companies and then into really, really big tech companies, there has been this looming question - will the United States government take these companies to court? JACOB GOLDSTEIN, HOST:  Will the government use antitrust law, the part of the law that covers competition, to try to prevent these newly really, really big companies from shutting out competitors in a way that hurts consumers, in a way that hurts everybody else, in a way that hurts us? MALONE: And yesterday, the government answered that question. GOLDSTEIN: The answer was yes. MALONE: The answer was yes. Yesterday, the United States Department of Justice dug out its copy of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 and filed a lawsuit, possibly the biggest antitrust lawsuit the government has brought in the 21st century. And it is against Google. (SOUNDBITE OF DANIEL ALEXIS PEMBERTON'S \"DOCTOR DIZZY\")GOLDSTEIN: Google. MALONE: Google. GOLDSTEIN: The United States of America v. Google LLC. MALONE: It's not U. S. v. Alphabet? GOLDSTEIN: Nope. I've got the complaint right here. It's Google. MALONE: OK. (SOUNDBITE OF DANIEL ALEXIS PEMBERTON'S \"DOCTOR DIZZY\")GOLDSTEIN: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Jacob Goldstein. MALONE: And I'm Kenny Malone. Today on the show, how exactly did Google violate antitrust law, at least according to the government? GOLDSTEIN: And how will the world change if Google loses the case? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MALONE: One quick thing before we get into the meat of this case - there is a political subtext here. This is a major antitrust suit two weeks before a presidential election. GOLDSTEIN: There were reports earlier this year that the attorney general was pushing the Department of Justice to bring the case before the election. And also, the federal government, the DOJ is joined in the case by attorneys general from 11 states. And all of those attorneys general are Republicans. MALONE: And so far, it seems like Democratic attorneys general agree with the general arguments the government is making in this case against Google. But they reportedly may also want to bring their own even-bigger case. GOLDSTEIN: So, OK, that is the political subtext. Now, let's get to the text. Let's get to the case itself. MALONE: And as is the PLANET MONEY custom, when going deep into antitrust, we called up professor Eleanor Fox. In fact, we called her yesterday right after the government had filed this big lawsuit. GOLDSTEIN: So this is a big day for you? ELEANOR FOX: Yeah, it's a big day. MALONE: Eleanor is a law professor at NYU, expert in antitrust law. GOLDSTEIN: What was, like, the first moment in the complaint when something grabbed you? FOX: Actually, I think the complaint is very well-written. And I think those introductory paragraphs that summarize the kind of conduct are grabbing. MALONE: So this is a - that's a positive review of the complaint. GOLDSTEIN: (Laughter_). FOX: That's right. MALONE: But is there a sentence in particular you would point to and say, OK, here's where we should start? FOX: I mean, if you're doing it methodically, you really have to start on, do they have monopoly power? GOLDSTEIN: In order to win this case, the government is going to have to clear a series of hurdles. Hurdle No. 1 is prove that Google has a monopoly. There's no strict numerical definition of monopoly. But Eleanor says, typically, it applies when a company has at least 70 or 80% of a market. MALONE: But what market are we talking about here? And this question - what is the relevant market or markets? - is a surprisingly interesting, contentious question in antitrust in general and in this case in particular. GOLDSTEIN: This question comes up in the very first sentence of the complaint the government filed yesterday. The government says Google has, quote, \"monopolies in the markets for general search services, search advertising and general search text advertising. \"MALONE: So the government is arguing that Google has monopolies in three separate markets - one for general search, like, you know, whatever, Internet searching - right? - like what we think of when we think of searching. GOLDSTEIN: And then they're saying the company also has monopolies in two other markets for advertising on-search results. If you want to buy an ad on a general search result, according to the government, you're pretty much stuck buying it from Google. MALONE: But the government's case largely focuses on that first market, the market for general Internet searches. GOLDSTEIN: Google hasn't filed its formal response to this case yet. But in a statement yesterday, the company said the relevant market here is not general search. It's all kinds of online searches. And Google says when you think of all kinds of online searches, we, Google, don't have a monopoly. You know, when people want to buy something, they usually go to Amazon and do a search there. When they want to travel, a lot of the time, they go to Kayak or Expedia, do a search there. MALONE: And in the past, Google has made very similar arguments about advertising markets. The relevant market isn't search advertising, it's all advertising. People who want to buy ads can buy them from Google or from Facebook, or they could buy ads on the radio or on TV or on billboards. GOLDSTEIN: These are all classic antitrust arguments. The government argues that a company has a monopoly in some particular market. And then the company says, no, no, no, you're defining the market all wrong. We actually have lots of competitors. MALONE: And it's going to be up to the court to decide what is the relevant market here? If it's the market for general Internet searches, Google has, like, 90% of that market, according to the complaint. That is a monopoly. But if the relevant market is all searches on Google and Amazon and Kayak, then maybe Google does not have a monopoly. GOLDSTEIN: Say the court does find that Google has a monopoly in search, despite Google's arguments to the contrary, is that enough for the courts to say that Google did something wrong? FOX: It's enough to start to ask the question. . . GOLDSTEIN: (Laughter). FOX: . . . Did Google do something wrong? GOLDSTEIN: OK. Is it illegal to have a monopoly in America? FOX: Oh, no. Absolutely not. GOLDSTEIN: OK. What is the next question the court has to answer? FOX: OK. The next challenge for the government is to say what exactly they claim Google did that was anti-competitive. GOLDSTEIN: So if the government clears that first hurdle, proving that Google has a monopoly in the relevant market, then the next hurdle is this - prove that Google has done things that have squashed competition in a way that is bad for consumers. MALONE: Now, for all of the criticisms people may have about Google, the Department of Justice has really honed in on one particular practice here. It's a strategy, really, and that is for Google to create a world where anywhere you turn to search the Internet, you are going to be using Google. For example, Siri. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SIRI BEEP)MALONE: . . . What is Apple's default search engine? SIRI: Here are your results. MALONE: And here we have a bunch of Google search results telling me that Google is Apple's default search engine. GOLDSTEIN: And to become Apple's default search engine, Google pays Apple something like $10 billion a year, according to the complaint. MALONE: Billion. GOLDSTEIN: B-I-L-L-I-O-N is a lot of money even for a company as rich as Google or as Apple. $10 billion is almost 20% of Apple's total annual net income, basically their profit. This money from Google is about one-fifth of Apple's annual profits. MALONE: And in exchange for all this money, Google is not only the default search engine for Siri, but also for the Safari Web browser on your iPhone and your MacBook. And when you search on your iPad and your CarPlay and basically on any Apple product, the default Internet search is going to be a Google search. GOLDSTEIN: On the other hand, if you are using products not made by Apple, Google is probably also the default search. Google makes the Android operating system that lots of phones use. It also pays phone makers that use Android to make Google the default on that operating system, also enters into a lot of deals that require companies to do things like put the Google search app on the homepage of the phone and make the app undeletable. Google also pays Firefox, the browser, to make Google the default search there. Google created its own browser, Chrome, as the default search there. MALONE: Between Google's own products and then these deals it makes with other companies - the government calls these exclusionary deals - Google has managed to be the default search engine for 80% of the search market, according to the complaint. A lot of that other 20%, by the way, that comes from computers and tablets that run Microsoft Windows, where the default search engine is Microsoft's search engine, Bing. GOLDSTEIN: So if you step back, you see the broader story the government is telling here. Google makes all this money because it has a monopoly selling ads against general Internet searches. And then, it takes a big chunk of that money and gives it to Apple and these other companies in order to keep other search engines out. Here's a quote from the complaint - \"Google aggressively uses its monopoly positions and the money that flows from them to continuously foreclose rivals and protect its monopolies. \" After the break, what Google says about all this. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GOLDSTEIN: So the government's case is basically that Google is paying all this money to be the default search engine and that doing that stifles competition and harms consumers. MALONE: Google's response to this so far comes from this statement that they posted online yesterday where they make a few arguments. The first one is, it is easy to change your default search engine if people want to do that. In fact, they include in their, like, blog posts or whatever, all of these gifts that show you, like, step by step, how to change your default search engine. So why is the government making such a big deal about it? People can change it if they want to. Their second point is that paying to become the default, it's not so different from this practice that we see in, like, retail. Maybe the Kellogg Company will pay for premium shelf space at the grocery store. GOLDSTEIN: Yeah, this is a classic thing. Food companies pay money to get on the, like, good shelf at the grocery store. MALONE: But the Department of Justice says, well, first of all, nobody actually changes their defaults. This is why, I don't know, maybe a company like Google would want to pay billions of dollars to be the default. Clearly, being the default matters to them. And then they also argue that, like, these deals Google makes are different than the deals that, like, Kellogg's might make because a key difference between the search business and the cereal business is that in the search business, being bigger actually helps you make your product better. FOX: Their huge network effect. So it's very hard for someone else to get into the market because there are good aspects. . . GOLDSTEIN: Yes. FOX: . . . Of having a network. GOLDSTEIN: Well, and in this instance, it's also the case, as I understand it, that, you know, Google learns from every search everybody does. You know, every search is information. And they look at what links people click on. So with every search, Google gets better. And so because people are searching so much more on Google, it gets better and better. And it - the gap between Google and its rivals expands, in part because Google is bigger and is gathering more data, which is making it more better. FOX: Yes. I mean, this is true. And this suit is really - it's saying there is space for other viable, strong, big search engines. And Google's doing everything to block their path and trying to be sure that they won't ever get the scale that can compete with Google. MALONE: Now, the sort of final hurdle in at least modern American antitrust law is this idea of consumer harm. A judge is going to maybe look at everything we've talked about. And they can decide that, OK, yep, Google has a monopoly and, OK, these are exclusionary deals that makes Google the default everywhere. But the bottom-line question is going to be, is all of this together bad for consumers? GOLDSTEIN: A judge might look at this case and agree with some of what the government is arguing, but might conclude in the end that Google is good for consumers, that having one giant search engine that gets better and better every day because so many people are searching on it is good. You know, similar arguments apply to other big tech companies, right? Part of the reason Facebook and Instagram are useful to people is because those are the social networks where everybody is. So similarly, the judge might look at this case and say, Google's great, consumers are winning. MALONE: But Eleanor Fox says there's another reasonable decision a judge very well may come to after looking at this case. They may say, there are all of these other search engines that could exist if only Google were not spending billions of dollars a year just to make sure it's the default search engine everywhere. And the absence of those other search engines, maybe like a search engine that works better or lets users have more privacy or whatever, a judge could very well decide that the absence of choice alone is obviously harming consumers. GOLDSTEIN: Say the government wins the case. The judge says, OK, Google, you are no longer allowed to pay all that money to be the default search engine everywhere. That is a violation of antitrust law. So, like, how does the world change? MALONE: Yeah, you can imagine that in the future, maybe, you get a brand-new iPhone. You open it up, and you get a prompt that's like, you know, what language do you want to use? And then another prompt that's like, what search engine do you want? Do you want Yahoo, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Google? There is no default. But, like, lots of people - I'll go out on a limb, and I will say most people probably are still going to pick Google. Google is still going to have a massive market share. So, like, what really is different about that post-antitrust case future? FOX: It would be different because it's letting in competition and preventing a dominant firm from entrenching itself. And this is hard to explain to people on the street because they don't see a difference immediately. And maybe down the line, a competitor - who knows? It might be. . . GOLDSTEIN: Might be some 12-year-old kid, right? FOX: Yeah, that's right. But this is what competition is. I mean, competition is - it's sort of in the air. It's like free speech, you know. You don't know who's going to say what, but you surely don't want to cut it off. GOLDSTEIN: So, Kenny, as you mentioned earlier in the show, this is like a really - but pretty narrow case, you know. When you think about all the complaints people have about the power that big tech companies have, this case is focused really pretty narrowly. And Eleanor says, as a result, it means the government might win, which is hard for the government to do in antitrust cases. MALONE: Yeah. You could think of it as, like, cherry-picking the case that you can potentially win as opposed to, maybe, these reports of Democratic state attorneys general working on something bigger, something more ambitious that would have a bigger impact on companies in the long run. But that is going to be a harder case to win. And so this is the dilemma that the government has been facing with bringing antitrust cases. Narrow - more likely to win. Broad - but more likely to lose. GOLDSTEIN: There is a third option. Just a few weeks ago, a group of Democrats in Congress released this big report on antitrust law in America, suggested new laws that Congress could pass. So if the Democrats wind up winning big in the elections next month, there's a good chance that next year, Congress might pass, and the president might sign new antitrust laws that would make it easier for the government to sue companies and win.

(SOUNDBITE OF COIN SPINNING) KENNY MALONE, HOST:   For years now, as the big tech companies turned into really big tech companies and then into really, really big tech companies, there has been this looming question - will the United States government take these companies to court? JACOB GOLDSTEIN, HOST:   Will the government use antitrust law, the part of the law that covers competition, to try to prevent these newly really, really big companies from shutting out competitors in a way that hurts consumers, in a way that hurts everybody else, in a way that hurts us? MALONE: And yesterday, the government answered that question. GOLDSTEIN: The answer was yes. MALONE: The answer was yes. Yesterday, the United States Department of Justice dug out its copy of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 and filed a lawsuit, possibly the biggest antitrust lawsuit the government has brought in the 21st century. And it is against Google. (SOUNDBITE OF DANIEL ALEXIS PEMBERTON'S \"DOCTOR DIZZY\") GOLDSTEIN: Google. MALONE: Google. GOLDSTEIN: The United States of America v. Google LLC. MALONE: It's not U. S. v. Alphabet? GOLDSTEIN: Nope. I've got the complaint right here. It's Google. MALONE: OK. (SOUNDBITE OF DANIEL ALEXIS PEMBERTON'S \"DOCTOR DIZZY\") GOLDSTEIN: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Jacob Goldstein. MALONE: And I'm Kenny Malone. Today on the show, how exactly did Google violate antitrust law, at least according to the government? GOLDSTEIN: And how will the world change if Google loses the case? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MALONE: One quick thing before we get into the meat of this case - there is a political subtext here. This is a major antitrust suit two weeks before a presidential election. GOLDSTEIN: There were reports earlier this year that the attorney general was pushing the Department of Justice to bring the case before the election. And also, the federal government, the DOJ is joined in the case by attorneys general from 11 states. And all of those attorneys general are Republicans. MALONE: And so far, it seems like Democratic attorneys general agree with the general arguments the government is making in this case against Google. But they reportedly may also want to bring their own even-bigger case. GOLDSTEIN: So, OK, that is the political subtext. Now, let's get to the text. Let's get to the case itself. MALONE: And as is the PLANET MONEY custom, when going deep into antitrust, we called up professor Eleanor Fox. In fact, we called her yesterday right after the government had filed this big lawsuit. GOLDSTEIN: So this is a big day for you? ELEANOR FOX: Yeah, it's a big day. MALONE: Eleanor is a law professor at NYU, expert in antitrust law. GOLDSTEIN: What was, like, the first moment in the complaint when something grabbed you? FOX: Actually, I think the complaint is very well-written. And I think those introductory paragraphs that summarize the kind of conduct are grabbing. MALONE: So this is a - that's a positive review of the complaint. GOLDSTEIN: (Laughter_). FOX: That's right. MALONE: But is there a sentence in particular you would point to and say, OK, here's where we should start? FOX: I mean, if you're doing it methodically, you really have to start on, do they have monopoly power? GOLDSTEIN: In order to win this case, the government is going to have to clear a series of hurdles. Hurdle No. 1 is prove that Google has a monopoly. There's no strict numerical definition of monopoly. But Eleanor says, typically, it applies when a company has at least 70 or 80% of a market. MALONE: But what market are we talking about here? And this question - what is the relevant market or markets? - is a surprisingly interesting, contentious question in antitrust in general and in this case in particular. GOLDSTEIN: This question comes up in the very first sentence of the complaint the government filed yesterday. The government says Google has, quote, \"monopolies in the markets for general search services, search advertising and general search text advertising. \" MALONE: So the government is arguing that Google has monopolies in three separate markets - one for general search, like, you know, whatever, Internet searching - right? - like what we think of when we think of searching. GOLDSTEIN: And then they're saying the company also has monopolies in two other markets for advertising on-search results. If you want to buy an ad on a general search result, according to the government, you're pretty much stuck buying it from Google. MALONE: But the government's case largely focuses on that first market, the market for general Internet searches. GOLDSTEIN: Google hasn't filed its formal response to this case yet. But in a statement yesterday, the company said the relevant market here is not general search. It's all kinds of online searches. And Google says when you think of all kinds of online searches, we, Google, don't have a monopoly. You know, when people want to buy something, they usually go to Amazon and do a search there. When they want to travel, a lot of the time, they go to Kayak or Expedia, do a search there. MALONE: And in the past, Google has made very similar arguments about advertising markets. The relevant market isn't search advertising, it's all advertising. People who want to buy ads can buy them from Google or from Facebook, or they could buy ads on the radio or on TV or on billboards. GOLDSTEIN: These are all classic antitrust arguments. The government argues that a company has a monopoly in some particular market. And then the company says, no, no, no, you're defining the market all wrong. We actually have lots of competitors. MALONE: And it's going to be up to the court to decide what is the relevant market here? If it's the market for general Internet searches, Google has, like, 90% of that market, according to the complaint. That is a monopoly. But if the relevant market is all searches on Google and Amazon and Kayak, then maybe Google does not have a monopoly. GOLDSTEIN: Say the court does find that Google has a monopoly in search, despite Google's arguments to the contrary, is that enough for the courts to say that Google did something wrong? FOX: It's enough to start to ask the question. . . GOLDSTEIN: (Laughter). FOX: . . . Did Google do something wrong? GOLDSTEIN: OK. Is it illegal to have a monopoly in America? FOX: Oh, no. Absolutely not. GOLDSTEIN: OK. What is the next question the court has to answer? FOX: OK. The next challenge for the government is to say what exactly they claim Google did that was anti-competitive. GOLDSTEIN: So if the government clears that first hurdle, proving that Google has a monopoly in the relevant market, then the next hurdle is this - prove that Google has done things that have squashed competition in a way that is bad for consumers. MALONE: Now, for all of the criticisms people may have about Google, the Department of Justice has really honed in on one particular practice here.

Google's chief legal officer Kent Walker calls this lawsuit deeply flawed in a statement. Eleven Republican state attorneys general joined that suit, including Arkansas AG Leslie Rutledge, who's on with me now. And before we start talking, I want to note that Google is a financial sponsor of NPR. Good morning, Ms. Rutledge. LESLIE RUTLEDGE: Good morning. Thanks so much for having me on today. KING: Of course. State attorneys general, I should say, were investigating Google. What is the most compelling evidence that investigation uncovered that says to you, what Google is doing is illegal and we should sue the company? RUTLEDGE: Look - right. When people Google something, they believe that it's free to Google and that they're going to get the best products brought up to them on that search engine. But what we have found through those investigations is that Google has manipulated those search engines. They have exclusivity contracts. Essentially, when you buy an Apple product, it automatically defaults to Google. And when you type something into Google and it populates, you may not be getting the best products or the best services to you; rather, you're getting what Google wants you to see. And that's what's so concerning, is that they control 90-plus percent of the market space in the search engine world. KING: I'm going to get to the point you're making about default in just a moment. But a thing that I am very curious about - have you gotten specific complaints from your constituents in Arkansas saying, Google is making it hard for me to do X, Y and Z in a way that is illegal? RUTLEDGE: Well, we receive thousands of complaints every single week - some, you know, about search engines, some about robocalls. And so I don't have those in front of me, unfortunately, right now. But, yes, we receive complaints about people not being able to find or perhaps their products not being populated - you know, why is my product, why are my services 10 - on Page 10 of a Google search when it's clearly the most popular product and it should be on Page 1? KING: OK. Let's move to the question of it being the default search engine. So one of the main arguments in favor of Google, the argument that Google would make, is it is free in the sense that I am not paying anything when I, you know, Google my name, for example - which I try not to do. It is the best - that's Google's argument. And if you want to change your search engine, Google says, here's how you do it. In fact, in their statement responding to the lawsuit, they actually have instructions on how to change a search engine from Google to, say, Bing. Why don't you buy that? RUTLEDGE: Well, it is the default. And the reason why we don't buy it is because, again, like I said, they control 90% plus of the market space in this area, and so it's not hard to shut out competition when you've already shut out competition. And people - Google has now become a verb. It's not simply a noun. It's not simply a company. It's a verb. And so people use it to describe - even if they were using Bing or some other search engine, they will say, well, let me Google that, and they might go to Bing. They're not going to say, let me Bing that. And it has become kind of a. . . KING: Wait. It's not illegal for Google to be a verb. I mean, I get what you're saying. RUTLEDGE: Yes. KING: But that's not illegal. RUTLEDGE: No, it's - that's not illegal, but the deceptive trade practices - and that's why we're bringing this antitrust lawsuit, stating that - and pushing out the competition where there can be no competition is illegal. And that's why we've worked with the Department of Justice, Attorney General Barr and these other 10 states to bring this suit against Google. We want Americans to have the best products and the best services. I know if my 2-year-old daughter gets sick at night and I'm searching - I'm Googling, if you will - to find a pediatrician or how to help her, I want the best doctor and the best medication. I don't want what Google says is best; I want the actual best. And that's what every American wants when they look for something. We don't want something free just because it's free. We want the best that's free. KING: The lawsuit talks about the need for, quote, \"structural remedies,\" but then it doesn't offer any details. What are the structural remedies that you envision? Are you talking about breaking apart parts of this business? RUTLEDGE: Not necessarily, no. Not at all. I think it's allowing more competition to come in. There are so many new and innovative models for search emerging, but in order for those models to have a chance, we need Google to break its stranglehold over the Internet. So it doesn't mean breaking apart the company; it means breaking apart the stranglehold, breaking apart that 90-plus percent of the marketplace. KING: You're talking about Google doing something voluntarily, which many businesses would argue that it is not in their interest and they shouldn't do it. Let me ask you about something - about who's joined this suit. So it's 11 Republican state attorneys general. No Democrats just yet, as I understand it. Historically, Republicans have not been in favor of many types of government regulation of private business. The Trump administration often is not. What makes this particular case different? RUTLEDGE: Well, we would strongly encourage our Democratic colleagues from across the country to join these efforts. I know that we've been in conversations with them. And so this doesn't necessarily have to be a partisan effort. We would love for it to be a bipartisan effort. And, yes, while Republicans - we are not fond of overregulation by government. However, when you have companies or big tech companies who are shutting out competition or who are impacting individuals' free speech rights, then, yes, we will step in, and that's our job as the chief law enforcement and the chief legal officers of our respective states and working with the Department of Justice. KING: Are you considering signing onto any similar lawsuits against other tech giants? So Facebook, Apple and Amazon spring to mind. RUTLEDGE: Well, it has been concerning in recent weeks and months with what we're seeing from big tech companies who are blocking speech on their platforms, speech that is not necessarily violent or destructive, but rather speech that they do not agree with. And so we want all Americans, whatever platform they're using, to be able to exercise their free speech and to be able to use these platforms and to not be shut out simply for political reasons, as - you know, and right now we are approaching the November 3 election. Many people are already voting absentee or early voting in states. And these signs of big tech companies blocking speech has become very concerning. It is something that we are talking about on a national level. KING: I will say that we would need to look a bit further for evidence for that, as our tech correspondent Shannon Bond has pointed out. Leslie Rutledge, attorney general for Arkansas, thank you so much. RUTLEDGE: Thank you. Have a great day. NOEL KING, HOST:   The Department of Justice is suing Google, accusing it of being, quote, \"a monopoly gatekeeper for the Internet. \" Google's worth about a trillion dollars, which is very big, and the DOJ says it's abusing its dominance over smaller rival companies. Google's chief legal officer Kent Walker calls this lawsuit deeply flawed in a statement. Eleven Republican state attorneys general joined that suit, including Arkansas AG Leslie Rutledge, who's on with me now. And before we start talking, I want to note that Google is a financial sponsor of NPR. Good morning, Ms. Rutledge. LESLIE RUTLEDGE: Good morning. Thanks so much for having me on today. KING: Of course. State attorneys general, I should say, were investigating Google. What is the most compelling evidence that investigation uncovered that says to you, what Google is doing is illegal and we should sue the company? RUTLEDGE: Look - right. When people Google something, they believe that it's free to Google and that they're going to get the best products brought up to them on that search engine. But what we have found through those investigations is that Google has manipulated those search engines. They have exclusivity contracts. Essentially, when you buy an Apple product, it automatically defaults to Google. And when you type something into Google and it populates, you may not be getting the best products or the best services to you; rather, you're getting what Google wants you to see. And that's what's so concerning, is that they control 90-plus percent of the market space in the search engine world. KING: I'm going to get to the point you're making about default in just a moment. But a thing that I am very curious about - have you gotten specific complaints from your constituents in Arkansas saying, Google is making it hard for me to do X, Y and Z in a way that is illegal? RUTLEDGE: Well, we receive thousands of complaints every single week - some, you know, about search engines, some about robocalls. And so I don't have those in front of me, unfortunately, right now. But, yes, we receive complaints about people not being able to find or perhaps their products not being populated - you know, why is my product, why are my services 10 - on Page 10 of a Google search when it's clearly the most popular product and it should be on Page 1? KING: OK. Let's move to the question of it being the default search engine. So one of the main arguments in favor of Google, the argument that Google would make, is it is free in the sense that I am not paying anything when I, you know, Google my name, for example - which I try not to do. It is the best - that's Google's argument. And if you want to change your search engine, Google says, here's how you do it. In fact, in their statement responding to the lawsuit, they actually have instructions on how to change a search engine from Google to, say, Bing. Why don't you buy that? RUTLEDGE: Well, it is the default. And the reason why we don't buy it is because, again, like I said, they control 90% plus of the market space in this area, and so it's not hard to shut out competition when you've already shut out competition. And people - Google has now become a verb. It's not simply a noun. It's not simply a company. It's a verb. And so people use it to describe - even if they were using Bing or some other search engine, they will say, well, let me Google that, and they might go to Bing. They're not going to say, let me Bing that. And it has become kind of a. . . KING: Wait. It's not illegal for Google to be a verb. I mean, I get what you're saying. RUTLEDGE: Yes. KING: But that's not illegal. RUTLEDGE: No, it's - that's not illegal, but the deceptive trade practices - and that's why we're bringing this antitrust lawsuit, stating that - and pushing out the competition where there can be no competition is illegal. And that's why we've worked with the Department of Justice, Attorney General Barr and these other 10 states to bring this suit against Google. We want Americans to have the best products and the best services. I know if my 2-year-old daughter gets sick at night and I'm searching - I'm Googling, if you will - to find a pediatrician or how to help her, I want the best doctor and the best medication. I don't want what Google says is best; I want the actual best. And that's what every American wants when they look for something. We don't want something free just because it's free. We want the best that's free. KING: The lawsuit talks about the need for, quote, \"structural remedies,\" but then it doesn't offer any details. What are the structural remedies that you envision? Are you talking about breaking apart parts of this business? RUTLEDGE: Not necessarily, no. Not at all. I think it's allowing more competition to come in. There are so many new and innovative models for search emerging, but in order for those models to have a chance, we need Google to break its stranglehold over the Internet. So it doesn't mean breaking apart the company; it means breaking apart the stranglehold, breaking apart that 90-plus percent of the marketplace. KING: You're talking about Google doing something voluntarily, which many businesses would argue that it is not in their interest and they shouldn't do it. Let me ask you about something - about who's joined this suit. So it's 11 Republican state attorneys general. No Democrats just yet, as I understand it. Historically, Republicans have not been in favor of many types of government regulation of private business. The Trump administration often is not. What makes this particular case different?

It alleges that Google paid Apple as much as $12 billion to be the default search engine for iPhones. Prosecutors say this proves that Google abused monopoly power to try to keep rivals down. We should mention Apple and Google are both financial supporters of NPR. NPR's Bobby Allyn covers tech and joins us now. Bobby, thanks so much for being with us. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: You got it, Scott. SIMON: And why does the government contend that this payment is evidence Google abused power? ALLYN: So the heart of the government's case against Google is that it's grown so large it functions like a monopoly, like an oil baron or like a steel magnet. But instead of being an industrialist, it has huge power over the Internet, which, on its face, is not illegal. But when a company gains this much power and throws its weight around to make sure nobody else can compete, that's when there are real legal questions. And the Justice Department says that's how Google behaves. One really vivid example of this, at least allegedly, is this $12 billion payment. Google paid that to Apple to make sure Google would be the predetermined search engine on every single Apple device. SIMON: Practical effect, as you note, is every time somebody buys an iPhone or an iPad and they search for something on the Internet, it's a Google search. Some people might consider that good. Why is it a problem? ALLYN: In short, because if you're a search competitor, say Bing or DuckDuckGo or you pick one, you don't get any attention. I mean, how often, Scott, are you Googling things on your phone, right? (Laughter) I mean. . . SIMON: That's how we say it. ALLYN: Right. Exactly. So their dominance is baked into the verb. So - and the Justice Department points this out. And inside Google, becoming the default search engine was a huge priority. The Justice Department says Google insiders called the prospect of not getting the deal code red. Google CEO Sundar Pichai met one-on-one with Apple's Tim Cook to hammer out the terms of the deal behind closed doors. And according to the court papers, an unidentified senior employee from Google wrote to an Apple counterpart, quote, \"our vision is to work as if we are one company. \" And so I called up former Justice Department antitrust lawyer John Newman and asked, is this collusion? JOHN NEWMAN: I would say it's somewhere in the middle. It's not classic collusion. ALLYN: So it's not like two oil companies conspiring to raise the price of oil, for instance. NEWMAN: It looks more like one monopolist agreeing with another company to split the monopoly rent. SIMON: So we have Google and Apple, who are technically competitors, working together to make each other stronger. What do the companies say about it? ALLYN: The companies say there's nothing strange or illegal about it, that companies make deals all the time to get the best distribution for their products. And Apple just decided that Google simply was the best partner to work with. And Google says, look; people like Google, right? Its dominance and strength is the result of just how great it is. And former Justice Department lawyer Newman says, yeah, You can be the best, but that is not an argument to not give others a fair shot. NEWMAN: If it is true that Google will win out on a competitive playing field - and it may be, even in a competitive market, a lot of people would like to use Google. But even if that's true, that's not a reason to leave the competitive playing field uneven. SIMON: Bobby, where's the case go from here? ALLYN: Yeah. So, Scott, it's going to drag on for many years. The big question on everyone's mind is, will Google be broken up? Plenty of calls on Capitol Hill for that to happen, but it's just too early to say whether a judge is going to buy the Justice Department's case, and if a judge does, what exactly will be done about it. But I've talked to many antitrust experts. And they all tell me if the DOJ does persuade a judge, one outcome could be that, you know, when you buy an iPhone, you'll be given an option of what should be your default search engine. It might not automatically go to Google. This is what happens when you buy a smartphone in Europe, for instance. But in Europe, most people still choose Google. SIMON: Well, we'll certainly be following this case - sounds like for years. Thanks very much for your reporting, Bobby. ALLYN: You've got it. Thanks, Scott.

NPR has learned that back in July, two cybersecurity firms sent the Department of Homeland Security a report that warned about flaws in voter registration websites around the country. The fear is that a defect that existed back in 2016 that might have allowed hackers to download voter information or change voter registration files could be used again. NPR's Dina Temple-Raston, who obtained the report, explains. DINA TEMPLE-RASTON, BYLINE: To understand why a report about the possible vulnerabilities in the voter registration websites is so important, we need to go back to the summer of 2016. That's when questions first started to surface about darker forces hacking into online voter rolls. And to this day, one of the most mysterious of these cases comes out of Riverside County, Calif. MICHAEL HESTRIN: Each of the cases we investigated, people had their voter registration changed unbeknownst to them. They got no notice. They didn't go in and change it. TEMPLE-RASTON: That's Riverside County District Attorney Michael Hestrin. And during the June 2016 primary, people were showing up to vote only to find that they were suddenly listed in the voter rolls as members of the Green or independent party. HESTRIN: Now, the voter is telling us, I didn't change my registration 10 days before an election. I've been a Republican for, you know, 25 years. Why would I do that? TEMPLE-RASTON: And it wasn't just one or two complaints. HESTRIN: Once the number got to be over, you know, 15 or 20 or so, I was very concerned. I sent out several investigators. TEMPLE-RASTON: Riverside County may live in infamy as an election cold case because back in 2016, the state of California didn't capture the one thing that helps investigators track down a hacker, an IP address. Not every California government official agrees, but Hestrin is convinced that the voter registration website in Riverside County was hacked four years ago. Then, a month later in Illinois. . . (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)STEPHANIE SY: The FBI says foreign hackers have penetrated state election systems. UNIDENTIFIED NEWSCASTER #1: Data from as many as 200,000 voter records was stolen in Illinois. UNIDENTIFIED NEWSCASTER #2: Specifically, the internal database of voter information. TEMPLE-RASTON: Officials only discovered the breach because whoever was inside goofed and crashed the server. Intelligence officials later confirmed publicly that they had traced the hack back to Russia.

Announcing this morning the indictment of 12 Russian military operatives on hacking charges related. . . TEMPLE-RASTON: These kinds of incidents and news this week of new Russian intrusions into county electoral systems puts a troubling report that was sent to DHS a few months ago in a different light. Written by cybersecurity experts at RiskIQ and Northrop Grumman and obtained by NPR, it warned that flaws that might have allowed hackers to change voter registration files four years ago could still exist in California and Florida and could be used again. The report, which went to the agency in July, was hypothetical and it didn't point to any specific hacks but concluded that the vulnerabilities were probably still there. A DHS spokesperson downplayed it, telling NPR that it was unverified and questionable. Just hours later, though, the director of National Intelligence, John Ratcliffe, announced this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOHN RATCLIFFE: We have confirmed that some voter registration information has been obtained by Iran and separately by Russia. TEMPLE-RASTON: Then on Thursday, the FBI and DHS announced that Russian hackers targeted dozens of state and local government networks and voting-related systems. Among the fresh concerns, that the websites that are used to identify voters at the polls could be changed. NEIL JENKINS: Voter registration databases tend to be online. And because of that, they tend to have many of the same vulnerabilities that other websites have. TEMPLE-RASTON: That's Neil Jenkins. He was the election security coordinator for the Department of Homeland Security in 2016. He says if a website is on the Internet, it's at risk. JENKINS: They need to be monitored. They need to be patched and mitigated. TEMPLE-RASTON: But he says even if there's a vulnerability, even if the report is correct and there are flaws in the voter registration websites, local election boards are unlikely to do anything about it because we're too close to the election. JENKINS: Amazon probably doesn't make a lot of changes to its infrastructure just before Prime Day. Target doesn't patch a lot of vulnerabilities the day before Black Friday because they know operationally, the website has to be up and running. TEMPLE-RASTON: And the last thing election officials would want to do just weeks before their big day, Jenkins said, is to insert a patch and accidentally crash their own websites.

And as we spend more of our lives in the digital world, our personal information can be compromised, and our technology is tracking our movements. For NPR's Life Kit, reporter Laurel Wamsley talked to experts to find out the best ways to keep our personal data safe and got a list of things you can do today to protect yourself and your data. LAUREL WAMSLEY, BYLINE: Eva Galperin is the director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. She says we all have something worth protecting, even if we think of ourselves as having nothing to hide. EVA GALPERIN: Most of us still lock our doors. We still close our windows and have shades on them. We still don't run around sharing our passwords or our credit card numbers with just about anybody. WAMSLEY: That's true on the Internet, too. Galperin says there are some steps that make sense for almost all of us. So that's takeaway No. 1 - practice good security hygiene to keep your accounts safe. GALPERIN: All of your passwords should be passphrases. WAMSLEY: That's right, passphrases, longer than a password. Passphrases are strong and unique for each site. So don't use 1234. And don't use the same password for different websites. You don't want all of your accounts to be compromised because one of them gets hacked. GALPERIN: And then, of course, you have the problem of how you're going to remember all of your long and strong and unique passwords. And the answer is you don't. You use a password manager in order to manage them all. And then all you have to do is remember the passphrase for your password manager. WAMSLEY: Then turn on two-factor authentication for your accounts. That's where you're asked to put in your cellphone number so you can receive a text with an additional number you input to log in. And those nudges you get from your computer or phone to install the latest security update? You should download those. And make sure you're not unwittingly handing over your passwords or personal information to bad actors. That's our second takeaway - beware of phishing. These attempts can happen via email, text or phone call. But there are often signs that these messages aren't legit, like spelling errors or weird web addresses. If it looks fishy, it could be phishing. Matt Mitchell is a tech fellow at the Ford Foundation and the founder of CryptoHarlem, where he teaches people how to protect their privacy. He suggests you take a look at the apps on your phone. MATT MITCHELL: Ask yourself - when did I install this thing? Can I delete it right now? WAMSLEY: For a lot of things, you can use the browser on your phone instead of an app. And Mitchell says that's better because browsers can only get certain information. MITCHELL: They could still track you with pixels and all kinds of stuff. But when I have an app, I have an accelerometer. I have a camera. I have a microphone. I have your contacts. I have so much access to your data. The first thing I do is tell people, like, let's get rid of some apps. WAMSLEY: That's takeaway three - get rid of apps you don't really need. He has another tip, too - going to myactivity. google. com and deleting your history. MITCHELL: And it will show you every search term and everything you've ever done, every YouTube video you ever looked at, all that stuff. And I tell them to delete everything. And it'll say, are you sure you want to delete this? 'Cause if you delete this, it might affect some stuff. And just blow it all away. WAMSLEY: The experts point out that in the U. S. , we don't have a general national privacy law that protects our everyday Internet use. So if you really want better privacy online, you need to call your congressperson and tell them you care about it. We're going to be on the Internet for a long time. The more each of us understands how our data is collected and used and how to keep private what we want to keep private, the better, safer and healthier our digital lives will be.

But if you speak Spanish and use that language with friends and relatives and to get your news, you're probably getting bombarded with it on one particular platform. WhatsApp is the app of choice for many who keep in touch with relatives throughout Latin America and the United States. And because the messages are encrypted, it's hard to trace the origins of stories shared by WhatsApp users. It also creates a unique way for anybody outside of the United States to filter inaccurate or deliberately misleading information into the country - that according to Randy Pestana, assistant director of research at Florida International University's institute for public policy. RANDY PESTANA: External state actors don't actually have to target these Latin groups in the United States. You can go to their host country, spread the news there. If it comes up on media, let's say, in Colombia, oftentimes, what you'll find is the Colombian relative will then send it to their relatives in Miami, and then it'll be shared throughout Miami. So you don't even need to target the United States. You can target another country. MARTIN: But there are efforts to fight the spread of online misinformation and disinformation. Right now, we're going to hear about one of the newest ones. It's a fact-checking tool available to WhatsApp users in both English and Spanish. It's called FactChat. It was developed by the Poynter Institute's International Fact-Checking Network. And joining us now to tell us more is associate director Cristina Tardaguila. Cristina Tardaguila, welcome. Thank you so much for joining us. CRISTINA TARDAGUILA: Thank you. It's a great pleasure to be here. MARTIN: So tell me more about FactChat. How does it work? TARDAGUILA: It's quite easy. If you are a English speaker, and you have your phone in your hand with a WhatsApp account on it, you just have to type hi dot F-A-C-T-C-H-A-T - which means FactChat - dot me. And if you're a Spanish speaker, you should have to change the hi for hola - so it's H-O-L-A dot FactChat dot me. And once you do that, you're going to see your WhatsApp popping up, and you're going to have to send the message that is there, and you're going to receive a numerical menu. And you just have to type the number that you want. If you want to just search, you type one. If you want to read the latest fact-checks, you type two. And that's the way the fact-checkers in the United States found to fight misinformation on WhatsApp, which is quite big today. MARTIN: You were telling us that there - that the amount of misinformation and disinformation targeting Spanish speakers is a lot. So are you seeing a spike in this? Are you seeing sort of an increase as we get closer to the Election Day? Although I do have to say, I think everybody knows this. You know, people are already voting. Millions of people have already cast their ballots. But what sort of ideas or misinformation and disinformation are we talking about? TARDAGUILA: Well, we are - when we talk about the Latino community, what we see from the fact-checking point of view is a lot of messages trying to connect both Trump and Biden to politicians in different countries. So we see a lot of messages trying to correlate both the candidates to Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua, Maduro in Venezuela, Chavez in Venezuela - also with Castro in Cuba, a little bit with the Colombian president. So that's one point. The second point that we're seeing is a lot of interest from the Latino community in fact-checks related to abortion. It's, like, family and religion seems to play a big role in these things in this type of disinformation. And also, we are seeing lots of hoaxes relating Biden to pedophile cases. And we are also seeing Trump being accused of having harassed a young model. Both informations (ph) are completely false. They don't stand up, right? This is what I say that's scary. It's just not false, but it's also defamation. MARTIN: So it's beyond the realm of sort of vigorous political discourse. It's just maligning these people in really disgusting ways, is I think what I hear you saying. So you just launched this tool just last month. Have WhatsApp users taken to it? Have you gotten a sense of how widely it's being used at this point? TARDAGUILA: Oh, yeah. Yeah. We're having a very interesting analytics about the chatbot. And right now, we have five times more users in the Spanish version than in the English version, which tells us that, first, this was the tool that was much needed and expected. Also, I can tell you that we are getting spikes of 24,000 messages per day, which is very, very big if you're comparing to my experience back in Brazil in 2018. It's at least, like, four times bigger - the use of the - the usage of the bot here in this election. So we're very confident that this is an important tool and an important experience. MARTIN: The second presidential debate on Thursday featured a number of statements that fact-checkers identified as false or misleading. Did you see a lot of use of the app after the debate or during it? TARDAGUILA: Yes, Michel. The debates were very interesting - all of them, not only the last one. We did live fact-checking, and all 12 partners were active during the night publishing content. And that was being input into the chatbot. In all debates, we had big spikes in the usage numbers. And - but the latest debate, the members of the fact-check collaboration found at least 50 claims that were either misleading, lacking context or just oversimplified. So anyone that was actually using FactChat during that last debate was able to see the fact-checks in real time, which is pretty cool. MARTIN: So before we let you go, why does this matter? I think some people might be listening to our conversation and go, oh, well, it's just - you know, it's just politics. People say stuff. You know, sometimes it's true, sometimes it's not true. What's the big deal? So what is the big deal? TARDAGUILA: So, well, first of all, you have to understand that every decision in your life is based on information. So if you have bad information, then you're probably going to have a bad decision, right? But I - what I fear is the fact that when you get a piece of misinformation that confirms your bias, so you're sticking to your own ideas and your own thoughts, you're not being able or open to actually talk to others and share ideas and debate. And that's what's expected during a campaign when you're just getting stuff that will confirm what you are thinking and what you are expecting. So this means that falsehoods in the United States are actually separating people. They are actually helping polarize the country. So that's why it's all so bad. MARTIN: That was Cristina Tardaguila with the International Fact-Checking Network at the Poynter Institute. She's telling us about the FactChat tool. Cristina Tardaguila, thank you so much for speaking with us. TARDAGUILA: It was great. Thank you.

In the runup to Election Day, each of them have tightened their rules about what's OK on their sites. Today their CEOs defended those decisions to a skeptical Senate committee. NPR's Shannon Bond has been following along and joins us now. And Shannon, we should note Facebook and Google are among NPR's financial supporters. You know, a hearing like this would normally be a big show with all the top tech CEOs on Capitol Hill. In the age of coronavirus, what was the scene, so to speak? SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Well, the CEOs and many lawmakers appeared by video, but it did still have some of the fireworks you might expect, like this from Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TED CRUZ: Mr. Dorsey, who the hell elected you and put you in charge of what the media are allowed to report and what the American people are allowed to hear? BOND: And, Audie, let me just paint the picture here. So Cruz is on video. So is the guy he's yelling at. That's Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who is this eccentric guy with a beard that's gotten really long during the pandemic. Dorsey's known for being really into meditation. He remained very calm throughout the hearing, despite what you just heard. We also heard today from Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Google's Sundar Pichai. And it was Pichai's first appearance since the Justice Department hit Google with a big lawsuit last week. But the focus today was really on Twitter and Facebook. CORNISH: What was the policy focus? BOND: Well, it was supposed to be about how these companies handle online speech. The ostensible topic was this decades-old law known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. And put simply, it says online platforms cannot be held responsible for what people post on them, no matter how damaging or offensive. But lately, there's been this emerging bipartisan consensus to rethink the law but for very different reasons. Democrats are concerned about the spread of hate speech and misinformation while Republicans are worried about censorship. CORNISH: Now, what did you hear in the way of actual change or ideas for reform? BOND: Not a whole lot, frankly; for many of these Republican lawmakers, this hearing was much more about scoring points than substance. But the people who did talk about reform were the CEOs. They warned that getting rid of this law would mean their companies would probably have to take a much heavier hand when it comes to taking down content. And that's the opposite of what Republican lawmakers want. Senators spent a lot of time today asking why the platforms have put labels warning that some of President Trump's posts are misleading but have not done the same with posts from other world leaders. CORNISH: And did the CEOs have a response to that? BOND: Well, they say their policies aren't politically motivated. So here's what Jack Dorsey said when he was asked about a tweet from the president, claiming falsely that mail-in ballots are vulnerable to fraud. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JACK DORSEY: We saw the confusion it might encourage, and we labeled it accordingly. And the goal with our labeling. . . ROGER WICKER: You're speaking of the president's tweet. DORSEY: Yes. BOND: And Dorsey here - he drew a distinction between this case. So he said here President Trump was saying something that really could do harm to his own people. And, you know, as opposed to other world leaders' statements, you know, against adversaries, Dorsey described those as being much more about saber rattling. CORNISH: Why is this happening now, I mean, so close to the election? BOND: Well, that is a good question. And it's a question that some Democrats had themselves of the Republican colleagues - their Republican colleagues who called this hearing. You know, they said the Republicans were really politicizing an issue that shouldn't be partisan. But, you know, Republicans have raised again and again these complaints about bias, even though they're not supported by any systemic evidence. And they clearly wanted to give these complaints an airing before the election, and so here we are. CORNISH: That's NPR's Shannon Bond. Thanks for following this for us. BOND: Thanks, Audie.

BOND: Not a whole lot, frankly; for many of these Republican lawmakers, this hearing was much more about scoring points than substance. But the people who did talk about reform were the CEOs. They warned that getting rid of this law would mean their companies would probably have to take a much heavier hand when it comes to taking down content. And that's the opposite of what Republican lawmakers want. Senators spent a lot of time today asking why the platforms have put labels warning that some of President Trump's posts are misleading but have not done the same with posts from other world leaders. CORNISH: And did the CEOs have a response to that? BOND: Well, they say their policies aren't politically motivated. So here's what Jack Dorsey said when he was asked about a tweet from the president, claiming falsely that mail-in ballots are vulnerable to fraud. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JACK DORSEY: We saw the confusion it might encourage, and we labeled it accordingly. And the goal with our labeling. . . ROGER WICKER: You're speaking of the president's tweet. DORSEY: Yes. BOND: And Dorsey here - he drew a distinction between this case. So he said here President Trump was saying something that really could do harm to his own people. And, you know, as opposed to other world leaders' statements, you know, against adversaries, Dorsey described those as being much more about saber rattling. CORNISH: Why is this happening now, I mean, so close to the election? BOND: Well, that is a good question. And it's a question that some Democrats had themselves of the Republican colleagues - their Republican colleagues who called this hearing. You know, they said the Republicans were really politicizing an issue that shouldn't be partisan. But, you know, Republicans have raised again and again these complaints about bias, even though they're not supported by any systemic evidence. And they clearly wanted to give these complaints an airing before the election, and so here we are. CORNISH: That's NPR's Shannon Bond. Thanks for following this for us.

S. hospitals. The hackers have deployed malware meant to shut down medical facilities in order to demand millions of dollars in ransom payments. The private security firm Mandiant was among the companies that helped to identify these attacks and is now working with federal agencies. And Charles Carmakal joins us next. He is senior vice president and chief technology officer at Mandiant. Good morning. CHARLES CARMAKAL: Good morning. Thanks for having me. INSKEEP: It's kind of common, I'm sad to say, to have ransomware attacks. What makes this one so significant? CARMAKAL: Yeah, so you're right. Ransomware is very common today, and we see it across a lot of different organizations and a lot of different sectors. But seeing ransomware deployed at hospital organizations that's deliberate by a threat actor is actually pretty new and different. What we find is actually most threat actors aren't willing to deploy ransomware and cause disruption to hospitals, especially right now during the pandemic, because they're worried about impacting lives. But what's unique about this is we see a threat actor that is deliberately targeting health care organizations, specifically hospitals, and has no real fear of potential human impact and is just looking to make money. INSKEEP: Let's talk about the potential human impact. As far as you can tell, could this kind of attack just cause confusion or could it actually kill people? CARMAKAL: It could potentially do both. And look, we're really concerned about the confusion angle. You think about a ransomware attack and what actually happens to a hospital, you know, as the hospital learns that systems are being encrypted, they tend to take systems offline. And they have to refer - revert back to the paper-based means to treat patients. And so what you sometimes find is that hospitals will end up diverting patients to other hospitals which may be minutes away, may be hours away. So it really just depends. And so no matter what, you're going to deal with situations where the ability for the health care practitioners to give care to patients, it's going to get delayed, which could certainly impact people's lives. INSKEEP: Did some attacks succeed? CARMAKAL: Unfortunately, yes. Many did succeed over the past several days and the past few weeks. And what we're afraid of is that it may happen to other organizations in the future. INSKEEP: Has anybody been paying ransom money? CARMAKAL: Unfortunately, yes. There are a number of organizations that do pay. It's a pretty big problem because so many organizations feel so compelled to pay these threat actors. I'll tell you, look, many of these organizations that pay, it's not because they're necessarily doing anything wrong from a security perspective. Sometimes, they have great backups in place. Sometimes, they have the ability to recover. But sometimes, they feel so compelled to pay the threat actors because they've created so much confusion, created so much disruption, and sometimes they've even stolen personal information that these victim organizations feel compelled to pay them because they don't want that personal information of their patients or their customers to be exposed to the world. INSKEEP: Let me ask about one other aspect of this. We said hackers from Russia. Whenever we hear that phrase right here at election time, of course, we think about Russia's ongoing efforts to interfere with the U. S. election. But in this case, it appears to be an effort to get money. Is there some connection between Russian election interference and this kind of interference? CARMAKAL: Yeah. So what I'll say about this particular threat actor, you know, we believe that they're based in Eastern Europe. We believe that they're organized. They're a criminal operation, and they're financially motivated. And it's very clear to us today that they are interested in making money. And so that appears to be their primary driver. INSKEEP: Wow, but willing to go after hospitals to do that. Mr. Carmakal, thank you very much. CARMAKAL: No problem. Thank you.

And deepfakes make up one disturbing side of misinformation. Another - conspiracy theories. Sure, they've been around a long time - classics like the earth is flat or another one that just won't go away. ANDREW MARANTZ: There's a secret cabal of shadowy, wealthy elites who either explicitly are named as Jews or just kind of fit into type of mold that sounds like they're probably Jews. ZOMORODI: In the past few years, these conspiracy theories, along with a whole set of new ones, have moved from the extreme fringes into the American mainstream. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Fox News Media brings America together. JEANINE PIRRO: If ever there were a question whether a deep state existed. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: The deep state is real, folks. PIRRO: . . . You got your answer this week. MARIA BARTIROMO: Do you believe George Soros is behind all of this, paying these people. . . PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Talking about all of this with the global warming and the - a lot of it's a hoax. It's a hoax. I mean, it's a money-making industry. SEAN HANNITY: The mob in the media - well, they will be advancing their new conspiracy theory and their newest. . . ZOMORODI: The most recent and obvious example. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: . . . An online conspiracy theory group. It's unclear if. . . ZOMORODI: QAnon. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: QAnon's baseless conspiracy theories have been repeatedly debunked. Despite this, the far-right group continues to. . . ZOMORODI: A network of conspiracy theories all leading back to a mythic, anonymous leader named Q, allegedly a high-level government official who has access to top-secret information. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: Well, I don't know much about the movement other than I understand they like me very much, which I appreciate. But I don't know much about the movement. MARANTZ: Yeah, so QAnon starts with the assumption that Donald Trump is secretly saving the world and that, you know, he doesn't want credit for it. He doesn't want to boast about it, but he's actually the only person who is ferreting out this massive deep state conspiracy that involves hundreds of people engaging in child sex trafficking and satanic, cannibalistic rituals. ZOMORODI: (Laughter) Oh, my God. MARANTZ: It's like, sorry, what? And, you know, that is just straight-up misinformation/disinformation. So in a way, that's almost a less ambiguous case because it's so completely bonkers, honestly. And it's almost like if I were writing the script, I would be like, no, guys. That's too on the nose. Like, that's too. . . ZOMORODI: It's. . . MARANTZ: That's too much of a completely. . . ZOMORODI: No one will believe that. MARANTZ: . . . Bizarre - yes. No one will believe it. But, you know, millions of people do. ZOMORODI: This is journalist Andrew Marantz. MARANTZ: I am a staff writer at The New Yorker magazine, and I wrote a book called \"Antisocial\" - I have to make sure I remember the subtitle - \"Online Extremists, Techno-Utopians, And The Hijacking Of The American Conversation. \"ZOMORODI: Even before QAnon entered mainstream conversation in 2017, Andrew noticed a huge rise in far-right extremism and conspiracy theories online. MARANTZ: Starting 2014 or 2015 - around there, I started seeing this informational crisis on the horizon. I certainly was not the only person. But I was kind of behind the curve at the time because I wasn't back then thinking of this as a particularly political story. I was thinking of it as, you know, a business story or a tech story or. . . ZOMORODI: Yeah. MARANTZ: But then the summer of 2016, I really started saying, OK, this is going to have a massive impact on the presidential election. I mean, in a way, how could it not, right? (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MARANTZ: Racist memes, misogynist propaganda, viral misinformation - so I wanted to know who was making this stuff. I wanted to understand how they were spreading it. Ultimately, I wanted to know what kind of impact it might be having on our society. ZOMORODI: Here's Andrew on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MARANTZ: So that's how I ended up in the living room of a social media propagandist in Southern California. He was a married white guy in his late 30s. He had a table in front of him with a mug of coffee, a laptop for tweeting, a phone for texting and an iPad for livestreaming to Periscope and YouTube. And yet with those tools, he was able to propel his fringe, noxious talking points into the heart of the American conversation. For example, one of the days I was there, a bomb had just exploded in New York, and the guy accused of planting the bomb had a Muslim-sounding name. Now, to the propagandist in California, this seemed like an opportunity because one of the things he wanted was for the U. S. to cut off almost all immigration, especially from Muslim majority countries. So he started livestreaming, getting his followers worked up into a frenzy about how the open borders agenda was going to kill us all and asking them to tweet about this and use specific hashtags, trying to get those hashtags trending. And tweet they did - hundreds and hundreds of tweets. ZOMORODI: It must have been kind of weird for you, like, sitting there and watching how public manipulation works from a couch. MARANTZ: Yeah. What you see when you sort of sit at someone's elbow and watch them do this is - it's like getting good at poker or something. You kind of learn the basic mechanics of the thing, and then you play a lot of rounds. And if you're good enough, you know, you don't win every round, but you win a lot of them. So what that means in terms of social media is you kind of get a sense of what the algorithms want. And the really simplistic way of putting it is that they want whatever has the sharpest emotional impact on the viewer and specific kinds of emotions, too - the emotions that make people do something with their - either click or share. But for the most part, he wasn't breaking the rules of Twitter or whatever platform he was using. He was just really good at getting his message out there. ZOMORODI: And so this guy in California and all the other folks you spent time with - like, what was their mission? Was it just to create chaos, to tear down democracy? - because that guy doesn't seem like he really believes in this stuff, but there are people who do. MARANTZ: Yeah. It's a spectrum, right? It's - sometimes we talk about, you know, people who are doing this for profit cynically, who don't believe what they're peddling and then people, on the other hand, who are true believers. And I think that is a true and worthwhile distinction. And I guess all I would add is that there are many shades of gray in between. ZOMORODI: Yeah. MARANTZ: Right? So it's not purely immediate monetary motivation in most cases. And then you'll get some cases where it is just people who have just been radicalized or, you know, red-pilled as they call it. And they just think the world will not be safe until we have a white ethnostate. And, you know, obviously, those people are hard to deal with because they're pretty far gone. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MARANTZ: I talked a lot with one young woman who grew up in New Jersey, and then after high school, she moved to a new place. And suddenly, she just felt alienated and cut off and started retreating into her phone. She found some of these spaces on the Internet where people would post the most shocking, heinous things. And she found this stuff really off-putting but also kind of engrossing. She started interacting with people in these online spaces, and they made her feel smart. They made her feel validated. She started feeling a sense of community, started wondering if maybe some of these shocking memes might actually contain a kernel of truth. A few months later, she was in a car with some of her new Internet friends headed to Charlottesville, Va. , to march with torches in the name of the white race. She'd gone, in a few months, from Obama supporter to fully radicalized white supremacist. ZOMORODI: OK, so for those of us who just can't wrap our heads around how someone's ideas about the world can change so rapidly. . . MARANTZ: Right. ZOMORODI: . . . Like, how does that happen, especially with something like QAnon, which is really an entire mindset? MARANTZ: Yeah. So it's sort of like any cult. You know, you start with the stuff that sounds less controversial, and then the more and more people get initiated, the more they're prepared to believe more and more outlandish things. So you kind of start with parts of it that are closer to the truth. Like, there was this guy Jeffrey Epstein who was - really was doing all kinds of outrageously terrible things. And he really was friends with Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew and. . . ZOMORODI: You're right. MARANTZ: You know, there really was a conspiracy to cover up those crimes that is still ongoing. And then you kind of go from there to, you know, I bet Hillary was involved. And I also bet Tom Hanks was involved. And I bet Oprah's probably involved. And they all have a dungeon somewhere where they're locking up children and trying to harvest their adrenal glands. And. . . ZOMORODI: OK, you lost me with the adrenal glands. MARANTZ: (Laughter) Well, I think when you start going down that rabbit hole, part of it is engaging in a kind of collective fan fiction. And part of it is, wait. Wait. Wait. But what if this is real? And it's flirting with that line. And, you know, I can get that to some extent. ZOMORODI: Yeah. MARANTZ: I get the thrill of being like, what if there really was an Illuminati? And it's just - to a certain kind of person at a certain desperate moment in their lives or just spend too much time on the Internet, they can't keep those blurry lines straight, and it becomes their entire reality. ZOMORODI: I can understand how, in a time of financial problems, insecurity, this idea of being part of a movement and having meaning in your life and being, you know, part of, like, the revolucion (ph), right (laughter). . . MARANTZ: Absolutely. ZOMORODI: Like, that's very exciting. Yeah. MARANTZ: Yeah - part of the underground, part of the resistance and having secret knowledge that no one else can see except for your compadres. Yeah. It's just bizarre how far it can go. ZOMORODI: And some of these tropes are, you know, centuries old. . . MARANTZ: Yeah. ZOMORODI: . . . In some ways. They are not new. MARANTZ: Yeah. I did not expect the fact that I am Jewish to matter in any way. I didn't expect to be talking about things like \"Protocols Of The Elders Of Zion\" and, like, \"Mein Kampf\" and stuff. I thought, frankly, that they would be a little more original than that. ZOMORODI: (Laughter). MARANTZ: But as it turns out, there are certain tropes that just refuse to go away, and it does a lot of work for people. It helps explain things that are otherwise unexplainable. You know, why is the economy so obviously seemed to be rigged against me? Why can't I find meaningful work? Or why do I have work, but I still don't feel like my life has any purpose? Why - you know, on and on and on with these kind of sometimes unanswerable questions. And if the answer is because there are ten people in a room somewhere saying, I don't want people to have meaning in their lives, then in a way, that's kind of a comforting explanation because it means that there's at least a nameable reason or an identifiable enemy. And often that's Jews. Often that's women. Often it's just whoever is a visible other in terms of being a person of color or what have you. But I think one of the notable things for me is not that these tropes still exist in the world but the fact that they can be revived in terms of popularity and in terms of salience to the national discourse. That I did find surprising. ZOMORODI: I mean, it feels as though this idea that a single person switching on a story that changes people's perception of what reality even is has become so commonplace that we are in the midst of an era of very little trust. MARANTZ: Yes, it is commonplace now. And the companies have had a lot of time to try to figure this out. In some ways, they have. You know, it is no longer OK on Facebook to buy an ad in an American election using rubles as the currency. ZOMORODI: Right. MARANTZ: That was a loophole that was open in 2016 that should not have been open, but it was. They did close that loophole. But the larger loophole, which is the entire incentive structure, the entire thing that social media is built to do - that hasn't changed. And, yeah, as a result, we are living in a pretty confused and confusing time. ZOMORODI: So what do we do in the meantime? Like, how do we fix this at least a little bit? MARANTZ: Yeah. So a lot of the bigger solutions to this are going to have to be systemic. And the companies are going to have to step up, and it might involve government regulation and all kinds of bigger things. But. . . ZOMORODI: Yeah. MARANTZ: Until they rebuild and dismantle their business model, there are things that individuals can do. And one of them - I call it being a smart skeptic. So there are things that pass for skepticism online that I think are actually just knee-jerk, contrarian trollery (ph). So you often see people saying, well, I'm just asking for more evidence, and I'm just asking the question. But that is not real skepticism. ZOMORODI: Yeah. MARANTZ: Real skepticism is being open-minded but not being so open-minded that your brain falls out, demanding evidence but not demanding evidence past the time when a question has been settled. If you just sort of say, well, I don't know; you know, everybody says racism is bad, but, like, I'm skeptical of that claim, I don't think skepticism is the best word for what you're doing there. And sometimes there just is consensus on something, and there's a certain cast of mind of a person who just doesn't want to hear that. It's a kind of addiction to feeling like you have secret access to knowledge that, you know, the boundaries of polite society doesn't want you to have. ZOMORODI: If only we all had that secret access, right? MARANTZ: Yeah. I mean, it's a thrilling idea. It's just that sometimes the real answer is the answer that most people already believe. And I'm sorry if that's boring, but it just sometimes is the case. ZOMORODI: That's Andrew Marantz. He's a journalist and staff writer for The New Yorker. You can see his full talk at ted. com.

MARANTZ: But then the summer of 2016, I really started saying, OK, this is going to have a massive impact on the presidential election. I mean, in a way, how could it not, right? (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) MARANTZ: Racist memes, misogynist propaganda, viral misinformation - so I wanted to know who was making this stuff. I wanted to understand how they were spreading it. Ultimately, I wanted to know what kind of impact it might be having on our society. ZOMORODI: Here's Andrew on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) MARANTZ: So that's how I ended up in the living room of a social media propagandist in Southern California. He was a married white guy in his late 30s. He had a table in front of him with a mug of coffee, a laptop for tweeting, a phone for texting and an iPad for livestreaming to Periscope and YouTube. And yet with those tools, he was able to propel his fringe, noxious talking points into the heart of the American conversation. For example, one of the days I was there, a bomb had just exploded in New York, and the guy accused of planting the bomb had a Muslim-sounding name. Now, to the propagandist in California, this seemed like an opportunity because one of the things he wanted was for the U. S. to cut off almost all immigration, especially from Muslim majority countries. So he started livestreaming, getting his followers worked up into a frenzy about how the open borders agenda was going to kill us all and asking them to tweet about this and use specific hashtags, trying to get those hashtags trending. And tweet they did - hundreds and hundreds of tweets. ZOMORODI: It must have been kind of weird for you, like, sitting there and watching how public manipulation works from a couch. MARANTZ: Yeah. What you see when you sort of sit at someone's elbow and watch them do this is - it's like getting good at poker or something. You kind of learn the basic mechanics of the thing, and then you play a lot of rounds. And if you're good enough, you know, you don't win every round, but you win a lot of them. So what that means in terms of social media is you kind of get a sense of what the algorithms want. And the really simplistic way of putting it is that they want whatever has the sharpest emotional impact on the viewer and specific kinds of emotions, too - the emotions that make people do something with their - either click or share. But for the most part, he wasn't breaking the rules of Twitter or whatever platform he was using. He was just really good at getting his message out there. ZOMORODI: And so this guy in California and all the other folks you spent time with - like, what was their mission? Was it just to create chaos, to tear down democracy? - because that guy doesn't seem like he really believes in this stuff, but there are people who do. MARANTZ: Yeah. It's a spectrum, right? It's - sometimes we talk about, you know, people who are doing this for profit cynically, who don't believe what they're peddling and then people, on the other hand, who are true believers. And I think that is a true and worthwhile distinction. And I guess all I would add is that there are many shades of gray in between. ZOMORODI: Yeah. MARANTZ: Right? So it's not purely immediate monetary motivation in most cases. And then you'll get some cases where it is just people who have just been radicalized or, you know, red-pilled as they call it. And they just think the world will not be safe until we have a white ethnostate. And, you know, obviously, those people are hard to deal with because they're pretty far gone. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) MARANTZ: I talked a lot with one young woman who grew up in New Jersey, and then after high school, she moved to a new place. And suddenly, she just felt alienated and cut off and started retreating into her phone. She found some of these spaces on the Internet where people would post the most shocking, heinous things. And she found this stuff really off-putting but also kind of engrossing. She started interacting with people in these online spaces, and they made her feel smart. They made her feel validated. She started feeling a sense of community, started wondering if maybe some of these shocking memes might actually contain a kernel of truth. A few months later, she was in a car with some of her new Internet friends headed to Charlottesville, Va. , to march with torches in the name of the white race. She'd gone, in a few months, from Obama supporter to fully radicalized white supremacist. ZOMORODI: OK, so for those of us who just can't wrap our heads around how someone's ideas about the world can change so rapidly. . . MARANTZ: Right. ZOMORODI: . . . Like, how does that happen, especially with something like QAnon, which is really an entire mindset? MARANTZ: Yeah. So it's sort of like any cult. You know, you start with the stuff that sounds less controversial, and then the more and more people get initiated, the more they're prepared to believe more and more outlandish things. So you kind of start with parts of it that are closer to the truth. Like, there was this guy Jeffrey Epstein who was - really was doing all kinds of outrageously terrible things. And he really was friends with Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew and. . . ZOMORODI: You're right. MARANTZ: You know, there really was a conspiracy to cover up those crimes that is still ongoing. And then you kind of go from there to, you know, I bet Hillary was involved. And I also bet Tom Hanks was involved. And I bet Oprah's probably involved. And they all have a dungeon somewhere where they're locking up children and trying to harvest their adrenal glands. And. . . ZOMORODI: OK, you lost me with the adrenal glands. MARANTZ: (Laughter) Well, I think when you start going down that rabbit hole, part of it is engaging in a kind of collective fan fiction. And part of it is, wait. Wait. Wait. But what if this is real? And it's flirting with that line. And, you know, I can get that to some extent. ZOMORODI: Yeah. MARANTZ: I get the thrill of being like, what if there really was an Illuminati? And it's just - to a certain kind of person at a certain desperate moment in their lives or just spend too much time on the Internet, they can't keep those blurry lines straight, and it becomes their entire reality. ZOMORODI: I can understand how, in a time of financial problems, insecurity, this idea of being part of a movement and having meaning in your life and being, you know, part of, like, the revolucion (ph), right (laughter). . . MARANTZ: Absolutely. ZOMORODI: Like, that's very exciting. Yeah. MARANTZ: Yeah - part of the underground, part of the resistance and having secret knowledge that no one else can see except for your compadres. Yeah. It's just bizarre how far it can go. ZOMORODI: And some of these tropes are, you know, centuries old. . . MARANTZ: Yeah. ZOMORODI: . . . In some ways. They are not new. MARANTZ: Yeah. I did not expect the fact that I am Jewish to matter in any way. I didn't expect to be talking about things like \"Protocols Of The Elders Of Zion\" and, like, \"Mein Kampf\" and stuff. I thought, frankly, that they would be a little more original than that. ZOMORODI: (Laughter). MARANTZ: But as it turns out, there are certain tropes that just refuse to go away, and it does a lot of work for people. It helps explain things that are otherwise unexplainable. You know, why is the economy so obviously seemed to be rigged against me? Why can't I find meaningful work? Or why do I have work, but I still don't feel like my life has any purpose? Why - you know, on and on and on with these kind of sometimes unanswerable questions. And if the answer is because there are ten people in a room somewhere saying, I don't want people to have meaning in their lives, then in a way, that's kind of a comforting explanation because it means that there's at least a nameable reason or an identifiable enemy. And often that's Jews. Often that's women. Often it's just whoever is a visible other in terms of being a person of color or what have you. But I think one of the notable things for me is not that these tropes still exist in the world but the fact that they can be revived in terms of popularity and in terms of salience to the national discourse. That I did find surprising. ZOMORODI: I mean, it feels as though this idea that a single person switching on a story that changes people's perception of what reality even is has become so commonplace that we are in the midst of an era of very little trust. MARANTZ: Yes, it is commonplace now. And the companies have had a lot of time to try to figure this out. In some ways, they have. You know, it is no longer OK on Facebook to buy an ad in an American election using rubles as the currency. ZOMORODI: Right. MARANTZ: That was a loophole that was open in 2016 that should not have been open, but it was. They did close that loophole. But the larger loophole, which is the entire incentive structure, the entire thing that social media is built to do - that hasn't changed. And, yeah, as a result, we are living in a pretty confused and confusing time. ZOMORODI: So what do we do in the meantime? Like, how do we fix this at least a little bit? MARANTZ: Yeah. So a lot of the bigger solutions to this are going to have to be systemic. And the companies are going to have to step up, and it might involve government regulation and all kinds of bigger things. But. . . ZOMORODI: Yeah. MARANTZ: Until they rebuild and dismantle their business model, there are things that individuals can do. And one of them - I call it being a smart skeptic. So there are things that pass for skepticism online that I think are actually just knee-jerk, contrarian trollery (ph). So you often see people saying, well, I'm just asking for more evidence, and I'm just asking the question. But that is not real skepticism. ZOMORODI: Yeah. MARANTZ: Real skepticism is being open-minded but not being so open-minded that your brain falls out, demanding evidence but not demanding evidence past the time when a question has been settled. If you just sort of say, well, I don't know; you know, everybody says racism is bad, but, like, I'm skeptical of that claim, I don't think skepticism is the best word for what you're doing there. And sometimes there just is consensus on something, and there's a certain cast of mind of a person who just doesn't want to hear that. It's a kind of addiction to feeling like you have secret access to knowledge that, you know, the boundaries of polite society doesn't want you to have. ZOMORODI: If only we all had that secret access, right? MARANTZ: Yeah. I mean, it's a thrilling idea. It's just that sometimes the real answer is the answer that most people already believe. And I'm sorry if that's boring, but it just sometimes is the case. ZOMORODI: That's Andrew Marantz. He's a journalist and staff writer for The New Yorker. You can see his full talk at ted. com.

I'm Manoush Zomorodi. On the show today, technology, deception and our changing sense of reality. And so far, we've been talking about deepfakes, conspiracy theories and other kinds of misinformation. But data and algorithms - they can warp our reality, too. JOY BUOLAMWINI: We can deceive ourselves into thinking they're not doing harm, or we can fool ourselves into thinking, because it's based on numbers, that it is somehow neutral. AI is creeping into our lives. And even though the promise is that it's going to be more efficient; it's going to be better, if what's happening is we're automating inequality through weapons of math destruction and we have algorithms of oppression, this promise is not actually true and certainly not true for everybody. ZOMORODI: Weapons of math destruction, algorithms of oppression, which basically means bias and human error can be encoded into algorithms leading to inequality. To keep them in check, the Algorithmic Justice League to the risk. BUOLAMWINI: My name is Joy Buolamwini. I'm the founder of the Algorithmic Justice League, where we use research and art to create a world with more equitable and accountable AI. You might have heard of the male gaze or the white gaze or the post-colonial gaze. To that lexicon, I add the coded gaze. And we want to make sure people are even aware of it because you can't fight the power you don't see, you don't know about. ZOMORODI: Joy hunts down the flaws in the technology that's running every part of our lives, from deciding what we see on Instagram to how we might be sentenced for a crime. BUOLAMWINI: What happens when somebody is harmed by a system you created? You know, what happens if you're harmed? Where do you go? And we want that kind of place to be the Algorithmic Justice League so you can seek redress for algorithmic harms. ZOMORODI: You are a lot of things. You're a poet. You're a computer scientist. You are a superhero. Like. . . (LAUGHTER)ZOMORODI: Kind of hard to put into a box. Can you just explain why you created the Algorithmic Justice League? BUOLAMWINI: Yes. So the Algorithmic Justice League is a bit of an accident. When I was in graduate school, I was working on an art project that used some computer vision technology to track my face. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BUOLAMWINI: Hi, camera. I've got a face. Can you see my face? So at least that was the idea. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BUOLAMWINI: You can see her face. What about my face? And when I tried to get it to work on my face, I found that putting a white mask on my dark skin. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BUOLAMWINI: Well, I've got a mask. . . . Is what I needed in order to have the system pick me up. And so that led to questions about, wait; are machines neutral? Why do I need to change myself to be seen by a machine? And if this is using AI techniques that are being used in other areas of our lives - whether it's health or education, transportation, the criminal justice system - what does it mean if different kinds of mistakes are being made? And also, even if these systems do work well - let's say you are able to track a face perfectly. What does that mean for surveillance? What does it mean for democracy, First Amendment rights, you know? ZOMORODI: Joy continues from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)BUOLAMWINI: Across the U. S. , police departments are starting to use facial recognition software in their crime-fighting arsenal. Georgetown Law published a report showing that 1 in 2 adults in the U. S. - that's 117 million people - have their faces and facial recognition networks. Police departments can currently look at these networks unregulated, using algorithms that have not been audited for accuracy. Machine learning is being used for facial recognition, but it's also extending beyond the realm of computer vision. So who gets hired or fired? Do you get that loan? Do you get insurance? Are you admitted into the college that you wanted to get into? Do you and I pay the same price for the same product purchased on the same platform? Law enforcement is also starting to use machine learning for predictive policing. Some judges use machine-generated risk scores to determine how long an individual is going to spend in prison. So we really have to think about these decisions. Are they fair? And we've seen that algorithmic bias doesn't necessarily always lead to fair outcomes. When I think about algorithmic bias - and people ask me, well, what do you mean machines (laughter) are biased? It's just numbers. It's just data. I talk about machine learning, and it's a question of, well, what is the machine learning from? ZOMORODI: Well, what is the machine learning from? Like, what's the information that it's taking in? BUOLAMWINI: So an example of this - what I found was that for face detection, the ways in which systems were being trained involved collecting large datasets of images of human faces. And when you look at those datasets, I found that many of them were pale and male, right? You might have a dataset that's 75% male faces, over 80% lighter-skinned faces. And so what it means is the machine is learning a representation of the world that is skewed. And so what you might have thought should be a neutral process is actually reflecting the biases that it has been trained on. And sometimes what you're seeing is a skewed representation, but other times what machines are picking up on are our own societal biases that are actually true to the data. ZOMORODI: For example, Amazon was building a hiring tool. BUOLAMWINI: You need a job. Somebody in your life needs a job (laughter), right? You want to get hired. ZOMORODI: And to get hired, you upload your resume and your cover letter. BUOLAMWINI: That's the goal. It starts off well. ZOMORODI: But before a human looks at your resume, it gets vetted by algorithms written by software engineers. BUOLAMWINI: So we start off with an intent for efficiency. We have many more applications than any human could go through. Let's create a system that can do it more efficiently than we can. ZOMORODI: And how to build that better system? BUOLAMWINI: Well, we're going to gather data of resumes, and we're going to sort those resumes by the ones that represented candidates we hired or did well. Your target is who you think will be a good long-term employee. ZOMORODI: And now the system gets trained on the data. BUOLAMWINI: And the system is learning from prior data. So I like to say the past dwells within our algorithms. You don't have to have the sexist hiring manager in front of you. Now you have a black box that's serving as the gatekeeper. But what it's learning are the patterns of what success has looked like in the past. So if we're defining success by how it's looked like in the past and the past has been one where men were given opportunity, white people were given opportunity and you don't necessarily fit that profile, even though you might think you're creating this objective system, it's going through resumes, right? This is where we run into problems. ZOMORODI: So here's what happened with Amazon's hiring tool. BUOLAMWINI: What happened was, as the model was being built and it was being tested, what they found was a gender bias where resumes that contained the word women or women's or even all women's colleges - right? - so indication of being a woman were categorically being ranked lower than those that didn't. And try as they might, they were not able to remove that gender bias. So they ended up scratching the system. (SOUNDBITE OF RECORD SCRATCHING)ZOMORODI: They scratched the system, and that's a big win. But one win compared to thousands of platforms that use skewed algorithms - that could warp reality. BUOLAMWINI: It has not been the case that we've had universal equality or absolute equality, in the words of Frederick Douglass. And I especially worry about this when we think about techno benevolence in the space of health care, right? We're looking at, let's say, a breakthrough that comes in talking about skin cancer. Oh, we now have an AI system - right? - that can classify skin cancer as well as the top dermatologists, a study might say, a headline might read. And then when you look at it, it's like, oh, well, actually, when you look at the data set, it was for lighter-skinned individuals. Then you might argue, well, you know, lighter-skinned people are more likely to get skin cancer. And when I was looking into this, it actually - darker-skinned people who get skin cancer - usually, it's detected in stage 4 because there are all of these assumptions you're not even. . . ZOMORODI: Ah. BUOLAMWINI: . . . Going to get it in the first place. So these assumptions can have meaningful consequences. ZOMORODI: You know, we are talking just before the U. S. presidential election. Have you seen any examples of artificial intelligence being used in voting or politics? BUOLAMWINI: Yeah. So Channel 4 News just did this massive investigation showing that the 2016 Trump campaign targeted 3. 5 million African Americans in the United States, labeled them as deterrents in an attempt to actually keep people from showing up to the polls. ZOMORODI: They used targeted ads? BUOLAMWINI: Yes. And we know we know from Facebook's own research - right? - that you can influence voter turnout based on the kinds of posts that are put on their platform. And they did this in battleground states. And so in this way, we're seeing predictive modeling and ad targeting - right? - being used as a tool of voter suppression, which has always been the case to disenfranchise, right? You might say Black lives don't matter, but it's clear Black votes matter because of so much. . . ZOMORODI: Right. BUOLAMWINI: . . . Effort used to rob people of what blood was spilt for, you know, for generations. So it should be the case - right? - that any sorts of algorithmic tools that are intended to be used, again, have to be verified for nondiscrimination before it's even adopted. ZOMORODI: So as a Black woman technologist, you know, there are not that many of you, frankly. Why not, you know, go work at Google or Amazon and make these changes to the algorithms directly? Why act as sort of a watchdog? BUOLAMWINI: Well, I think there are multiple ways to be involved in the ecosystem. But I do think this question you pose is really important because it can be an assumption that by changing who's in the room, which is important and needs to happen, we're going to then change the outcome and the outputs of these systems. So I like to remind people that most software developers, engineers, computer scientists - you don't build everything from scratch, right? You get reusable parts. And so if there's bias within those reusable parts or large-scale bias in the datasets that have become standard practice or the status quo - right? - changing the people who are involved in the system without changing the system itself is still going to reproduce algorithmic bias and algorithmic harms. ZOMORODI: So how do we build systems that are more fair? Like, if there's no data for the artificial intelligence to sort of, you know, process to start to pump out recommendations, then how do we even change that? BUOLAMWINI: Yeah. Well, it's a question of what tools do you use towards what objectives. So the first thing is seeing if this is the appropriate tool. Not every tool - not every decision needs to be run through AI. And oftentimes you also need to make sure you're being intentional. And so. . . ZOMORODI: Right. BUOLAMWINI: The kinds of changes you would need to make systematically for even who gets into the job pool in general - it means you do have to change society to change what AI is learning. ZOMORODI: What do you say, Joy, to people who might be listening and thinking, like, you know, let's take a step back and look at the bigger picture? We - in many ways, things are way better than they were thanks to technology because, you know, here we are in a pandemic, and anyone can work from anywhere because we have the Internet and we have Zoom and all of these platforms. Equality and access is on the whole improved. Why - let's not, like, be Debbie Downers about it. BUOLAMWINI: Yeah. I mean, I always ask, who can afford to say that? - because I can tell you the kids who are sitting in McDonald's parking lot so they can access the Internet to be able to attend school remotely - that has never been their reality. And so oftentimes, if you are able to say technology on the whole has done well, it probably means you're in a fairly privileged position. There's still a huge digital divide. Even - there are billions of people who don't have access to the Internet. I mean, I was born in Canada. I moved to Ghana and then grew up in the U. S. So I had very Western assumptions, you know, about what tech could do and very much excited to use the tech skills I gained as an undergrad at Georgia Tech, you know, to use tech for good, tech for the benefit of humanity. And so when I critique tech, it's really coming from a place of having been enamored with it and wanting it to live up to its promises. I don't think it's being a Debbie Downer to show ways in which we can improve so the promise of something we've created can actually be realized. I think that's even a more optimistic approach than to believe in wishful thinking that is not true. ZOMORODI: You know, one thing that you've said that I find so - I love this idea that - you say there's a difference between potential and reality and that we must separate those two ideas. BUOLAMWINI: Yes. So it's so easy to fixate on our aspirations of what tech could be. And I think in some ways, it's this hope that we can transcend our own humanity - right? - our own failures. And so, yes, even if we haven't gotten society quite right, ideally, we can build technology that's better than we are. But we then have to look at that fact that technology reflects who we are. It doesn't transcend who we are. And so I think it's important that, when we think about technology, we ask, what's the promise? What's the reality? And not only what's that gap but who does it work for? Who does it benefit? Who does it harm and why? And also, how do we then step up and stand up to those harms?

And sometimes what you're seeing is a skewed representation, but other times what machines are picking up on are our own societal biases that are actually true to the data. ZOMORODI: For example, Amazon was building a hiring tool. BUOLAMWINI: You need a job. Somebody in your life needs a job (laughter), right? You want to get hired. ZOMORODI: And to get hired, you upload your resume and your cover letter. BUOLAMWINI: That's the goal. It starts off well. ZOMORODI: But before a human looks at your resume, it gets vetted by algorithms written by software engineers. BUOLAMWINI: So we start off with an intent for efficiency. We have many more applications than any human could go through. Let's create a system that can do it more efficiently than we can. ZOMORODI: And how to build that better system? BUOLAMWINI: Well, we're going to gather data of resumes, and we're going to sort those resumes by the ones that represented candidates we hired or did well. Your target is who you think will be a good long-term employee. ZOMORODI: And now the system gets trained on the data. BUOLAMWINI: And the system is learning from prior data. So I like to say the past dwells within our algorithms. You don't have to have the sexist hiring manager in front of you. Now you have a black box that's serving as the gatekeeper. But what it's learning are the patterns of what success has looked like in the past. So if we're defining success by how it's looked like in the past and the past has been one where men were given opportunity, white people were given opportunity and you don't necessarily fit that profile, even though you might think you're creating this objective system, it's going through resumes, right? This is where we run into problems. ZOMORODI: So here's what happened with Amazon's hiring tool. BUOLAMWINI: What happened was, as the model was being built and it was being tested, what they found was a gender bias where resumes that contained the word women or women's or even all women's colleges - right? - so indication of being a woman were categorically being ranked lower than those that didn't. And try as they might, they were not able to remove that gender bias. So they ended up scratching the system. (SOUNDBITE OF RECORD SCRATCHING) ZOMORODI: They scratched the system, and that's a big win. But one win compared to thousands of platforms that use skewed algorithms - that could warp reality. BUOLAMWINI: It has not been the case that we've had universal equality or absolute equality, in the words of Frederick Douglass. And I especially worry about this when we think about techno benevolence in the space of health care, right? We're looking at, let's say, a breakthrough that comes in talking about skin cancer. Oh, we now have an AI system - right? - that can classify skin cancer as well as the top dermatologists, a study might say, a headline might read. And then when you look at it, it's like, oh, well, actually, when you look at the data set, it was for lighter-skinned individuals. Then you might argue, well, you know, lighter-skinned people are more likely to get skin cancer. And when I was looking into this, it actually - darker-skinned people who get skin cancer - usually, it's detected in stage 4 because there are all of these assumptions you're not even. . . ZOMORODI: Ah. BUOLAMWINI: . . . Going to get it in the first place. So these assumptions can have meaningful consequences. ZOMORODI: You know, we are talking just before the U. S. presidential election. Have you seen any examples of artificial intelligence being used in voting or politics? BUOLAMWINI: Yeah. So Channel 4 News just did this massive investigation showing that the 2016 Trump campaign targeted 3. 5 million African Americans in the United States, labeled them as deterrents in an attempt to actually keep people from showing up to the polls. ZOMORODI: They used targeted ads? BUOLAMWINI: Yes. And we know we know from Facebook's own research - right? - that you can influence voter turnout based on the kinds of posts that are put on their platform. And they did this in battleground states. And so in this way, we're seeing predictive modeling and ad targeting - right? - being used as a tool of voter suppression, which has always been the case to disenfranchise, right? You might say Black lives don't matter, but it's clear Black votes matter because of so much. . . ZOMORODI: Right. BUOLAMWINI: . . . Effort used to rob people of what blood was spilt for, you know, for generations. So it should be the case - right? - that any sorts of algorithmic tools that are intended to be used, again, have to be verified for nondiscrimination before it's even adopted. ZOMORODI: So as a Black woman technologist, you know, there are not that many of you, frankly. Why not, you know, go work at Google or Amazon and make these changes to the algorithms directly? Why act as sort of a watchdog? BUOLAMWINI: Well, I think there are multiple ways to be involved in the ecosystem. But I do think this question you pose is really important because it can be an assumption that by changing who's in the room, which is important and needs to happen, we're going to then change the outcome and the outputs of these systems. So I like to remind people that most software developers, engineers, computer scientists - you don't build everything from scratch, right? You get reusable parts. And so if there's bias within those reusable parts or large-scale bias in the datasets that have become standard practice or the status quo - right? - changing the people who are involved in the system without changing the system itself is still going to reproduce algorithmic bias and algorithmic harms. ZOMORODI: So how do we build systems that are more fair? Like, if there's no data for the artificial intelligence to sort of, you know, process to start to pump out recommendations, then how do we even change that? BUOLAMWINI: Yeah. Well, it's a question of what tools do you use towards what objectives. So the first thing is seeing if this is the appropriate tool. Not every tool - not every decision needs to be run through AI. And oftentimes you also need to make sure you're being intentional. And so. . . ZOMORODI: Right. BUOLAMWINI: The kinds of changes you would need to make systematically for even who gets into the job pool in general - it means you do have to change society to change what AI is learning. ZOMORODI: What do you say, Joy, to people who might be listening and thinking, like, you know, let's take a step back and look at the bigger picture? We - in many ways, things are way better than they were thanks to technology because, you know, here we are in a pandemic, and anyone can work from anywhere because we have the Internet and we have Zoom and all of these platforms. Equality and access is on the whole improved. Why - let's not, like, be Debbie Downers about it. BUOLAMWINI: Yeah. I mean, I always ask, who can afford to say that? - because I can tell you the kids who are sitting in McDonald's parking lot so they can access the Internet to be able to attend school remotely - that has never been their reality. And so oftentimes, if you are able to say technology on the whole has done well, it probably means you're in a fairly privileged position. There's still a huge digital divide. Even - there are billions of people who don't have access to the Internet. I mean, I was born in Canada. I moved to Ghana and then grew up in the U. S. So I had very Western assumptions, you know, about what tech could do and very much excited to use the tech skills I gained as an undergrad at Georgia Tech, you know, to use tech for good, tech for the benefit of humanity. And so when I critique tech, it's really coming from a place of having been enamored with it and wanting it to live up to its promises. I don't think it's being a Debbie Downer to show ways in which we can improve so the promise of something we've created can actually be realized. I think that's even a more optimistic approach than to believe in wishful thinking that is not true. ZOMORODI: You know, one thing that you've said that I find so - I love this idea that - you say there's a difference between potential and reality and that we must separate those two ideas. BUOLAMWINI: Yes. So it's so easy to fixate on our aspirations of what tech could be. And I think in some ways, it's this hope that we can transcend our own humanity - right? - our own failures. And so, yes, even if we haven't gotten society quite right, ideally, we can build technology that's better than we are. But we then have to look at that fact that technology reflects who we are. It doesn't transcend who we are. And so I think it's important that, when we think about technology, we ask, what's the promise? What's the reality? And not only what's that gap but who does it work for? Who does it benefit? Who does it harm and why? And also, how do we then step up and stand up to those harms? ZOMORODI: That's Joy Buolamwini, founder of the Algorithmic Justice League. You can watch her full talk at ted. com.

It's Manoush. A quick note - this episode makes a couple references to sexual violence, which may be hard to hear. Just want to give you a heads-up before we get started. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Manoush Zomorodi, and on the show today, technology and deception. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)DANIELLE CITRON: The word deception has particular meaning. Deception is the intentional falsehood. That is, there is something done to manipulate how people feel in the world. It's designed to change people's behavior and mislead. ZOMORODI: This is Danielle Citron. CITRON: I'm a law professor at Boston University School of Law, where I teach privacy and free speech. ZOMORODI: Danielle also researches technology and cyber harassment. And one of the best examples of this, she says, is the story of a woman named Rana Ayyub. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RANA AYYUB: It was the 22 of April 2018. You know, I just. . . CITRON: Rana Ayyub is an investigative journalist in India who has exposed human rights abuses and government corruption. AYYUB: You know, I am somebody who sent one of the most important ministers in the Modi government behind bars in 2010. And that man now happens to be the second most powerful man in India. CITRON: And in April of 2018, she received an email from a source inside the Modi government, and the person said, heads-up - a video is going around about you. AYYUB: It was, like, a 2-minute, 30-second porn video with my image morphed on it. CITRON: It was a fake sex video. And I mean, she's got big brown eyes. It looked like her. That was Rana, you know, no questions about it. AYYUB: When I got that video, I felt like I was humiliated. I was shamed by the people who wanted to discredit me. CITRON: And it went viral. (SOUNDBITE OF PING)AYYUB: Screenshots of that video were all over my social media, on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, messages and forwards all over India. CITRON: Within 48 hours, it's been reported that it was on, like, half of the phones in India. AYYUB: Before I knew, it was on my father's phone, my brother's phone. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CITRON: Within a day after that, her home address, her cellphone number - all over the Internet. There were fake ads on adult, like, finder sites, saying that she was available for sex and this is where she lives. She was inundated with death and rape threats. AYYUB: I think I was as good as dead for the next five days since I received that video. CITRON: And she pretty much didn't leave her house for, like, six months. AYYUB: And I kept asking my friend - I said, what have I done to deserve this? CITRON: She became like a shell of herself. ZOMORODI: And so how was that video made possible? If it wasn't her, what was it? CITRON: It was a deepfake. Her face was inserted into a porn clip. So, you know, when I first worked on it, you know, what we knew about it was that you could insert faces into videos and use sophisticated neural networks to do that. You know, it's called generative adversarial networks that sort of insert a video and then find mistakes and then keep iterating so that it becomes pretty perfected. But even then - so two years ago, you could sort of tell, though. You know, like, if you stared at it enough, it wasn't as good as Pixar; it wasn't as good as, you know, the Lucasfilm's. And over time, what we've seen is that now we can create from whole - digital whole cloth videos showing you doing and saying things that you never did or said. And they're really hard to tell with the human eye that it's just not manufactured, right? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CITRON: And so Rana was a perfect example of and the first one I had heard of of a deepfake sex video being used to basically drive someone out of the marketplace of ideas. ZOMORODI: So if I go on one of these platforms right now, like, what's the likelihood that I will come across a deepfake? Or are we talking about a future that we're careening towards? CITRON: I'm largely imagining a terrible future, but there's - it's pretty bad in here now. Let me explain. A group called Sensity - they found that a year ago, there were 15,000 deepfake videos online. And of those 15,000, 96% were deepfake sex videos, and 99% of those 96% were of women's faces inserted into porn. ZOMORODI: Wow. CITRON: Fast-forward to just a year later - 50,000 deepfake videos. Again, same lineup - right? - like, mostly, over 90% deepfake sex videos and, again, same lineup, mostly all of women whose faces are being inserted into porn without their permission. And it's not just U. S. women. You know, they found that it was women from all over the world. ZOMORODI: And, like, I guess, women's images have been altered and airbrushed for so long. And in some sense, we're already surrounded by fake images everywhere. But this is clearly taking it to a whole nother disturbing level. CITRON: Yeah, yeah. Lies are absolutely nothing new to the human condition. But what makes this phenomenon different is sort of two things coming together. And the first is that we have this human frailty where audio and video have this power over us, especially, you know, what we see, so that we see something, we're going to believe it. What's new is that we're in an online environment in which online platforms - their business model, their incentives is to accelerate, share and ensure that we make things go viral 'cause then we're liking, clicking and sharing, and they're making money off of online advertising. And so their business model is aligned with our worst instincts. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: Information travels faster and farther than ever, and it does much more than just spark titillation or outrage. It changes what we believe. Conspiracy theories, new kinds of fake audio and video and algorithms working behind the scenes make knowing what's true or false harder and harder. Our sense of reality is warping. And we can see the consequences - a deep distrust in each other and our fundamental institutions like democracy. And so today on the show, technology, deception and ideas about what we can do to bring ourselves back to reality because, as Danielle Citron says, it takes just a trick of the human eye to upend someone's deeply held beliefs. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CITRON: Deepfakes appear authentic and realistic, but they're not. They're total falsehoods. ZOMORODI: Danielle continues from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CITRON: Now, it's the interaction of some of our most basic human frailties and network tools that can turn deepfakes into weapons. So let me explain. As human beings, we have a visceral reaction to audio and video. We believe they're true on the notion that, of course, you can believe what your eyes and ears are telling you. And it's that mechanism that might undermine our shared sense of reality. Although we believe deepfakes to be true, they're not. And we're attracted to the salacious, the provocative. We tend to believe and to share information that's negative and novel. And researchers have found that online hoaxes spread 10 times faster than accurate stories. We're also drawn to information that aligns with our viewpoints. Psychologists call that tendency confirmation bias. And social media platforms supercharge that tendency by allowing us to instantly and widely share information that accords with our viewpoints. ZOMORODI: OK, so all that information leads us to believe things, whether they are indeed facts or lies, but what about the people who say that they have the right to produce deepfakes or spread other misinformation because of the First Amendment - free speech? CITRON: It's a misunderstanding both of First Amendment doctrine and free speech theory - right? - 'cause not all ones and zeros and words are protected speech as a matter of First Amendment law and a matter of free speech values, right? Why do we protect free speech? Because it helps us figure out how to govern ourselves, because the truth sort themselves out in the marketplace of ideas, because it helps us engage in self-expression, because it's a safety value. You know, there's so many reasons why we protect free speech. ZOMORODI: All those reasons, yupCITRON: All those reasons. And we could add more. You know, we got a few more. But when it comes to defamatory falsehoods - let's take the deepfake video of showing someone doing and saying something they never did. As a matter of First Amendment doctrine, we chill that kind of speech. If you, with actual malice, spread a fake video of a public official doing and saying something they never did, but you know it's false, you can be sued for that, right? So much - and I've been writing about this stuff for a long time and, in my book, \"Hate Crimes In Cyberspace,\" kind of explore how, you know, these online tools - it isn't all just the public square. You know, the Supreme Court has a series of silly kind of - you know, this understanding of the Internet is, like, as if it's still 1996, right? Like, it's all the town square, and we're all town criers. That's foolish. What we're doing online is we're working. We're hustling for clients. We're spreading ideas. We are finding loved ones, right? We are exploring ideas. We are doing - everything that we do offline, we do it online because phones are wherever we are. And so the idea that everything that happens online is protected free speech is wrong. And it's not good for free speech values. So the deepfake sex video of Rana - guess what? It ended up with her offline and silenced. You know, your nude photo appears in a search of your name. You are offline. You take down - this is just my experience working with victims. You literally take down all of your presence online. ZOMORODI: You're basically canceled for something that you didn't do. CITRON: That's right. Your private persona becomes your public persona in an unwilling way that destroys your public persona. And so it's so easy for people to say it's free speech. And, you know, I will often get the pushback, often from people who are privileged - so white men - love you - but they will say to me. . . ZOMORODI: (Laughter). CITRON: Like, you know, Danielle, like, you're a prude. Why are you making such a big deal about nude photos? We should all just put our nudes online. And I just then take a beat. I'm calm, right? I don't get mad. But I say, I'm so glad you're going to make that choice. But I'm not going to make that choice - right? - 'cause it's going to cost me and other women, women of color, trans women, gay men, trans men, you know, bi folks, like, queer folks - it's just going to cost them more. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: In a minute, Danielle Citron on why deepfakes have the potential to undermine our democracy. On the show today, technology, deception and our changing sense of reality. I'm Manoush Zomorodi, and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Manoush Zomorodi, and we were just hearing lawyer and privacy expert Danielle Citron describe a recent Internet phenomenon, videos called deepfakes. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: Walk with me into the future, where we are in a place where we don't know whether to believe anything we see. What is that like? CITRON: So that - we call that the liars dividend. In a world in which we can't tell the difference between what's fake and what's real, that's a real boon to the mischief-makers and the liars because they get to point to real evidence of their wrongdoing and say it's not true and get to walk away from responsibility and accountability for bad things that they've done. And we've seen illustrations of this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You know, I'm automatically attracted to beautiful. I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. CITRON: After the Access Hollywood tape came out, President Trump said, you know, hey; I said that, and I'm sorry. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: This was locker room talk. I'm not proud of it. I apologize to my family. I apologize to the American people. CITRON: A year later, he shared with a reporter, it actually wasn't me on the Access Hollywood tape. He was sort of throwing out the liars dividend. Maybe it'll work, right? Now, for the most part, that didn't really have great traction. And it's kind of part of his brand - all of it - so that, you know, the liar's dividend - like, he tried it. It didn't work, and maybe that didn't hurt him and didn't matter. But in an environment in which we are sort of post-truth so that we're going to believe falsehoods if they accord with what we believe and we're going to disbelieve truths if they don't accord with what we think - you know, confirmation bias - then we're in this kind of post-truth environment. And I never thought I would say this about our own country, but political discourse feels fragile in a way that makes me feel like we're much more like a Myanmar than we are, you know, Canada. We don't feel like on solid ground in terms of discourse. And so in this environment, it feels so fragile, our democracy. ZOMORODI: As we see what happens in terms of the platforms taking responsibility or laws passed or whatever sort of systemic change may or may not happen, I mean, how much of us - each of us as individuals who go online who - a lot - do we have - what's our responsibility? Maybe - I don't know. Sometimes I say to people, like, you know, you are up against massive corporations. . . CITRON: Yeah. ZOMORODI: . . . When you like and share and all that stuff. You are being manipulated. But maybe you see it differently. Maybe you think that we each have to do a better job as well. CITRON: We do. You know, in the here and the now where there aren't laws - right? - there are very few state laws around deep - you know, digital forgeries. We are the guardian at the gate. Platforms aren't going to do it for us. Do you know what I'm saying? Like, we can't expect platforms whose incentives are to share because that's where their money is. It's on us, each and every one of us. We need to protect ourselves and our democracy. It's ours. It's ours to lose. So I do think we have a huge role. What I'm asking is so modest. Think before you click and share. Ask yourself, is this likely? And if it's really crazy, don't you think that it's fake? You know, that's why it's there, right? It's there because it's negative and novel. It's there to feed on our salacious curiosity. Don't do it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: That's Danielle Citron. She's a professor of law at Boston University Law School, where she teaches and writes about privacy and free speech. You can see her full talk at ted. com. MANOUSH ZOMORODI, HOST:   Hey.

(SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) CITRON: Deepfakes appear authentic and realistic, but they're not. They're total falsehoods. ZOMORODI: Danielle continues from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) CITRON: Now, it's the interaction of some of our most basic human frailties and network tools that can turn deepfakes into weapons. So let me explain. As human beings, we have a visceral reaction to audio and video. We believe they're true on the notion that, of course, you can believe what your eyes and ears are telling you. And it's that mechanism that might undermine our shared sense of reality. Although we believe deepfakes to be true, they're not. And we're attracted to the salacious, the provocative. We tend to believe and to share information that's negative and novel. And researchers have found that online hoaxes spread 10 times faster than accurate stories. We're also drawn to information that aligns with our viewpoints. Psychologists call that tendency confirmation bias. And social media platforms supercharge that tendency by allowing us to instantly and widely share information that accords with our viewpoints. ZOMORODI: OK, so all that information leads us to believe things, whether they are indeed facts or lies, but what about the people who say that they have the right to produce deepfakes or spread other misinformation because of the First Amendment - free speech? CITRON: It's a misunderstanding both of First Amendment doctrine and free speech theory - right? - 'cause not all ones and zeros and words are protected speech as a matter of First Amendment law and a matter of free speech values, right? Why do we protect free speech? Because it helps us figure out how to govern ourselves, because the truth sort themselves out in the marketplace of ideas, because it helps us engage in self-expression, because it's a safety value. You know, there's so many reasons why we protect free speech. ZOMORODI: All those reasons, yup CITRON: All those reasons. And we could add more. You know, we got a few more. But when it comes to defamatory falsehoods - let's take the deepfake video of showing someone doing and saying something they never did. As a matter of First Amendment doctrine, we chill that kind of speech. If you, with actual malice, spread a fake video of a public official doing and saying something they never did, but you know it's false, you can be sued for that, right? So much - and I've been writing about this stuff for a long time and, in my book, \"Hate Crimes In Cyberspace,\" kind of explore how, you know, these online tools - it isn't all just the public square. You know, the Supreme Court has a series of silly kind of - you know, this understanding of the Internet is, like, as if it's still 1996, right? Like, it's all the town square, and we're all town criers. That's foolish. What we're doing online is we're working. We're hustling for clients. We're spreading ideas. We are finding loved ones, right? We are exploring ideas. We are doing - everything that we do offline, we do it online because phones are wherever we are. And so the idea that everything that happens online is protected free speech is wrong. And it's not good for free speech values. So the deepfake sex video of Rana - guess what? It ended up with her offline and silenced. You know, your nude photo appears in a search of your name. You are offline. You take down - this is just my experience working with victims. You literally take down all of your presence online. ZOMORODI: You're basically canceled for something that you didn't do. CITRON: That's right. Your private persona becomes your public persona in an unwilling way that destroys your public persona. And so it's so easy for people to say it's free speech. And, you know, I will often get the pushback, often from people who are privileged - so white men - love you - but they will say to me. . . ZOMORODI: (Laughter). CITRON: Like, you know, Danielle, like, you're a prude. Why are you making such a big deal about nude photos? We should all just put our nudes online. And I just then take a beat. I'm calm, right? I don't get mad. But I say, I'm so glad you're going to make that choice. But I'm not going to make that choice - right? - 'cause it's going to cost me and other women, women of color, trans women, gay men, trans men, you know, bi folks, like, queer folks - it's just going to cost them more. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ZOMORODI: In a minute, Danielle Citron on why deepfakes have the potential to undermine our democracy. On the show today, technology, deception and our changing sense of reality. I'm Manoush Zomorodi, and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ZOMORODI: It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Manoush Zomorodi, and we were just hearing lawyer and privacy expert Danielle Citron describe a recent Internet phenomenon, videos called deepfakes. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ZOMORODI: Walk with me into the future, where we are in a place where we don't know whether to believe anything we see. What is that like? CITRON: So that - we call that the liars dividend. In a world in which we can't tell the difference between what's fake and what's real, that's a real boon to the mischief-makers and the liars because they get to point to real evidence of their wrongdoing and say it's not true and get to walk away from responsibility and accountability for bad things that they've done. And we've seen illustrations of this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You know, I'm automatically attracted to beautiful. I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. CITRON: After the Access Hollywood tape came out, President Trump said, you know, hey; I said that, and I'm sorry. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: This was locker room talk. I'm not proud of it. I apologize to my family. I apologize to the American people. CITRON: A year later, he shared with a reporter, it actually wasn't me on the Access Hollywood tape. He was sort of throwing out the liars dividend. Maybe it'll work, right? Now, for the most part, that didn't really have great traction. And it's kind of part of his brand - all of it - so that, you know, the liar's dividend - like, he tried it. It didn't work, and maybe that didn't hurt him and didn't matter. But in an environment in which we are sort of post-truth so that we're going to believe falsehoods if they accord with what we believe and we're going to disbelieve truths if they don't accord with what we think - you know, confirmation bias - then we're in this kind of post-truth environment. And I never thought I would say this about our own country, but political discourse feels fragile in a way that makes me feel like we're much more like a Myanmar than we are, you know, Canada. We don't feel like on solid ground in terms of discourse. And so in this environment, it feels so fragile, our democracy. ZOMORODI: As we see what happens in terms of the platforms taking responsibility or laws passed or whatever sort of systemic change may or may not happen, I mean, how much of us - each of us as individuals who go online who - a lot - do we have - what's our responsibility? Maybe - I don't know. Sometimes I say to people, like, you know, you are up against massive corporations. . . CITRON: Yeah. ZOMORODI: . . . When you like and share and all that stuff. You are being manipulated. But maybe you see it differently. Maybe you think that we each have to do a better job as well. CITRON: We do. You know, in the here and the now where there aren't laws - right? - there are very few state laws around deep - you know, digital forgeries. We are the guardian at the gate. Platforms aren't going to do it for us. Do you know what I'm saying? Like, we can't expect platforms whose incentives are to share because that's where their money is. It's on us, each and every one of us. We need to protect ourselves and our democracy. It's ours. It's ours to lose. So I do think we have a huge role. What I'm asking is so modest. Think before you click and share. Ask yourself, is this likely? And if it's really crazy, don't you think that it's fake? You know, that's why it's there, right? It's there because it's negative and novel. It's there to feed on our salacious curiosity. Don't do it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ZOMORODI: That's Danielle Citron. She's a professor of law at Boston University Law School, where she teaches and writes about privacy and free speech.

Uber and Lyft are celebrating a big win in California. Voters there overwhelmingly chose to let the ride-hailing companies continue treating their drivers in the state as independent contractors not as employees. NPR tech correspondent Shannon Bond joins us. Before we begin, we want to note that Uber and Lyft are among NPR's financial supporters. Shannon, I want to start with what this means for the drivers of these companies. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Right. So there are hundreds of thousands of drivers here in California, and it means they won't be getting standard employment benefits from these companies, so things like health insurance, paid sick leave, overtime pay. Now, the state had passed a law extending those benefits to gig workers, but Californians have now voted to exempt Uber, Lyft and similar apps from the law. However, under the ballot measure that voters just approved, the companies will give some limited benefits to drivers, so things like subsidies for health insurance for some drivers, accident insurance and some guarantees about pay. CORNISH: This creates a major, essentially, exemption to new California law. Is there any word from state officials on that? BOND: Well, the state lawmaker who wrote this labor law - she said she and her allies would continue to fight for worker protections. You know, what we're really looking for is to hear from the state attorney general's office. They didn't have any comment while election results are still being certified. But the attorney general and prosecutors in three big cities here had sued Lyft and Uber earlier this year, trying to force them to comply with this labor law. So that - this doesn't mean that legal battle is over, but it means that any outcome will be far more limited because of how voters have chosen. CORNISH: Are there any takeaways here about how people should view this industry? BOND: Well, you know, when I talked to drivers about this ballot measure, their support or opposition in many cases hinged on concerns about flexibility. So many of them say they want to choose when and how they work. And the companies had warned that if they had to make drivers employees, they would set schedules. They might employ a lot fewer drivers, and I think that concerned a lot of people. But really, the biggest lesson in this whole battle has been the power of money. So Uber, Lyft and food-delivery app DoorDash - they spent more than $200 million promoting this ballot measure. It was the most expensive campaign over a ballot initiative in California history. You know, and here in Berkeley, you know, I was flooded with texts. I got mailers at my house about it. The companies used their apps to lobby drivers and passengers. You know, they put out these claims that the measure was good for drivers. They warned that there would be higher fares, longer wait times. And like I said before, you know, they would employ fewer drivers if they had to make the drivers employees. And, you know, all of that money they spent - it really seemed to have worked. Californians voted to approve this ballot measure, and it was money well spent for these companies. CORNISH: That's NPR's Shannon Bond. Thanks. BOND: Thank you.

NPR's Shannon Bond has this report. And we should note, Uber and Lyft are among NPR's financial supporters. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: It's been hard to escape messages promoting the ballot measure known as Proposition 22 here in California, like this ad featuring drivers for Lyft and Uber talking about why they support the measure. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD)UNIDENTIFIED RIDE-SHARE DRIVER #1: App-based driving works for my family. UNIDENTIFIED RIDE-SHARE DRIVER #2: Drivers want to stay independent contractors. UNIDENTIFIED RIDE-SHARE DRIVER #3: Prop 22 protects our flexibility. UNIDENTIFIED RIDE-SHARE DRIVER #4: And offers wage guarantees. . . UNIDENTIFIED RIDE-SHARE DRIVER #5: And health care benefits. . . UNIDENTIFIED RIDE-SHARE DRIVER #6: Vote yes on Prop 22. BOND: Ads like this blanketed the state. They came by text, on fliers in mailboxes, even on delivery bags when you ordered takeout. Uber, Lyft and the food delivery app DoorDash spent more than $200 million in support of Proposition 22, making it the most expensive ballot measure campaign in California history. And it worked. Voters overwhelmingly approved the measure. For Joe Renice, who drives for Uber in San Francisco, that's a relief. JOE RENICE: This is a job that I make over $100,000 a year doing. And I have complete and total freedom and flexibility to do that. BOND: Renice's view is one the companies say a majority of drivers share. Renice says flexibility is the most important thing to him. RENICE: We know going in, this is a trade-off. I'm trading a salary. I'm trading 401(k). I'm trading insurance for the ability to do this when and where and how I want to do it. It's not for everybody. Some people are better off being employees, not me. BOND: But not all drivers agree. JEROME GAGE: Drivers are being taken advantage of, and Prop 22 was really just an attempt by Uber and Lyft to legalize it. BOND: Jerome Gage is a Lyft driver in Los Angeles who worked on the campaign opposing the measure. He and other opponents say the company's emphasis on flexibility is a distraction since nothing in the state labor law requires them to set schedules for drivers. GAGE: So now drivers, now more than ever, need to organize and improve our working conditions. BOND: Labor groups fought hard against the ballot measure. They say the companies are trying to get special treatment so they can avoid paying hundreds of millions of dollars in benefits like other employers. Gage says the election results are a blow - but the work of organizing will continue. GAGE: My pride is hurt. But one thing that has been inspiring me is the energy in this grassroots-level effort to fight Uber and Lyft. BOND: And the ballot measure is not a total loss. It does mandate the companies provide some new benefits for drivers, including a stipend to buy health insurance and guarantee of some pay. Organizers say they'll keep pushing for more protections, and they're looking beyond California to other states that are facing off with Uber and Lyft over whether drivers are employees.

Joe Biden has pulled ahead in Pennsylvania as that state continues its vote count. Biden leads by more than 7,000 votes now, and that lead is expected to continue to grow. Early this morning, vote counting in Georgia put Biden narrowly ahead. Any one of several states would give Biden the presidency now. His lead in Nevada expanded slightly yesterday. Those are facts. Now let's talk through some falsehoods that are circulating on social media. NPR tech reporter Bobby Allyn has been looking this. We should just emphasize, again, what we're going to be talking through here are falsehoods. What kinds of misinformation or disinformation are out there? BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Yeah. So researchers have pinpointed two main misinformation campaigns since Election Day. The first is around what's become known as Sharpiegate. Some may have heard of this by now. It's this baseless idea that Trump supporters in Arizona were tricked into using Sharpies to invalidate their votes. Now, election officials there say, yeah, poll workers handed Sharpies out, but it's a perfectly acceptable way to fill out a ballot. This hasn't stopped the hashtag from helping to stoke all sorts of speculation and rumor not just about markers, Steve, but about, you know, really extreme and violent ideas. The second trend that researchers are seeing is around the hashtag #StopTheSteal. And posts around this are - were about the false allegation that the election was being stolen from President Trump. And, of course, the president himself has repeatedly said this, even from the White House. INSKEEP: Which was completely false yesterday. And I just want to circle back to the Sharpie, just so I'm clear. If anybody listening filled out their ballot with a Sharpie, they fed it into a machine, the machine read it, it's fine. Is that your understanding? ALLYN: Exactly. That's right. INSKEEP: OK. And so anybody telling you otherwise is lying to you. That's good to know. What are social media platforms doing about that? ALLYN: Well, let's look at Stop the Steal. So a Facebook group under that name gained more than 300,000 followers in less than 24 hours. And then Facebook took it down after, quote, \"worrying calls for violence. \" And, you know, for Facebook, it's really rare to see this kind of aggressive response to a controversy around mis- and disinformation. Now, over at Twitter, President Trump's favorite social media - if you go to his Twitter feed right now, you'll see that a good chunk of his tweets, you know, about a third of them, actually, are covered up with a gray square that said, hey, guys, this might be misleading. So compared to Facebook and Twitter, over at YouTube, meanwhile, they aren't doing very much. There are videos there where right-wing announcers are just saying straight up that Trump won the election, which is not true. And YouTube refuses to take them down, but they are slapping a small, little warning on it that also says this is misleading, but they're not taking it down. And full disclosure here, Steve - Facebook and Twitter are among NPR's financial supporters. INSKEEP: Are those efforts having any effect? ALLYN: Right. So a good person to assess this would be Alex Stamos. He used to be the chief security officer at Facebook. And he's now the director of Stanford's Internet Observatory. And he says, you know, these major platforms, broadly speaking, are doing a pretty good job. ALEX STAMOS: We're always going to have disinformation. I think the goal here for the company should be for them to make sure their product affordances don't make disinformation worse - the things they do around amplification, around recommendations and such. ALLYN: Right, so Stamos is basically saying, you know, it's going to be impossible to completely get rid of some of these wacky theories on Facebook and Twitter and YouTube. But the platforms are trying to make sure they're not being used as a megaphone for them, which hasn't always been the case. And Facebook is even planning additional steps to tamp down the spread of baseless claims and premature claims to victory. It just recently said it would limit the spread of live videos related to the election. INSKEEP: I just want to mention, when I'm trying to figure out what's true or false, the most vital thing for me is to wait, hold on a second, see if something makes sense, wait for more information to come in, slow down. I think people trying to deceive me try to stampede me. So that's one thing I can advise people is to wait. What do researchers say to be vigilant about, very briefly? ALLYN: Right. Two things - one, livestreaming really, really, really you have to be vigilant about. I mean, as this stuff is rolling, it's really hard for automated systems to catch it. And another thing is, you know, when the stuff is whacked, it often appears in other places. So keep an eye out for these hashtags and variations on the hashtags because mis- and disinformation, like a lot of things on the Internet, evolves. INSKEEP: NPR tech correspondent Bobby Allyn, thanks so much. ALLYN: Thank you, Steve. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:   All this morning, we're leading with facts. Joe Biden has pulled ahead in Pennsylvania as that state continues its vote count. Biden leads by more than 7,000 votes now, and that lead is expected to continue to grow. Early this morning, vote counting in Georgia put Biden narrowly ahead. Any one of several states would give Biden the presidency now. His lead in Nevada expanded slightly yesterday. Those are facts. Now let's talk through some falsehoods that are circulating on social media. NPR tech reporter Bobby Allyn has been looking this. We should just emphasize, again, what we're going to be talking through here are falsehoods. What kinds of misinformation or disinformation are out there? BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Yeah. So researchers have pinpointed two main misinformation campaigns since Election Day. The first is around what's become known as Sharpiegate. Some may have heard of this by now. It's this baseless idea that Trump supporters in Arizona were tricked into using Sharpies to invalidate their votes. Now, election officials there say, yeah, poll workers handed Sharpies out, but it's a perfectly acceptable way to fill out a ballot. This hasn't stopped the hashtag from helping to stoke all sorts of speculation and rumor not just about markers, Steve, but about, you know, really extreme and violent ideas. The second trend that researchers are seeing is around the hashtag #StopTheSteal. And posts around this are - were about the false allegation that the election was being stolen from President Trump. And, of course, the president himself has repeatedly said this, even from the White House. INSKEEP: Which was completely false yesterday. And I just want to circle back to the Sharpie, just so I'm clear. If anybody listening filled out their ballot with a Sharpie, they fed it into a machine, the machine read it, it's fine. Is that your understanding? ALLYN: Exactly. That's right. INSKEEP: OK. And so anybody telling you otherwise is lying to you. That's good to know. What are social media platforms doing about that? ALLYN: Well, let's look at Stop the Steal. So a Facebook group under that name gained more than 300,000 followers in less than 24 hours. And then Facebook took it down after, quote, \"worrying calls for violence. \" And, you know, for Facebook, it's really rare to see this kind of aggressive response to a controversy around mis- and disinformation. Now, over at Twitter, President Trump's favorite social media - if you go to his Twitter feed right now, you'll see that a good chunk of his tweets, you know, about a third of them, actually, are covered up with a gray square that said, hey, guys, this might be misleading. So compared to Facebook and Twitter, over at YouTube, meanwhile, they aren't doing very much. There are videos there where right-wing announcers are just saying straight up that Trump won the election, which is not true. And YouTube refuses to take them down, but they are slapping a small, little warning on it that also says this is misleading, but they're not taking it down. And full disclosure here, Steve - Facebook and Twitter are among NPR's financial supporters. INSKEEP: Are those efforts having any effect? ALLYN: Right. So a good person to assess this would be Alex Stamos. He used to be the chief security officer at Facebook. And he's now the director of Stanford's Internet Observatory. And he says, you know, these major platforms, broadly speaking, are doing a pretty good job. ALEX STAMOS: We're always going to have disinformation. I think the goal here for the company should be for them to make sure their product affordances don't make disinformation worse - the things they do around amplification, around recommendations and such. ALLYN: Right, so Stamos is basically saying, you know, it's going to be impossible to completely get rid of some of these wacky theories on Facebook and Twitter and YouTube. But the platforms are trying to make sure they're not being used as a megaphone for them, which hasn't always been the case. And Facebook is even planning additional steps to tamp down the spread of baseless claims and premature claims to victory. It just recently said it would limit the spread of live videos related to the election. INSKEEP: I just want to mention, when I'm trying to figure out what's true or false, the most vital thing for me is to wait, hold on a second, see if something makes sense, wait for more information to come in, slow down.

So will President-elect Biden take on the tech industry? Before we dig into that question, we do just want to note that Facebook, TikTok are both financial supporters of NPR. Let's turn to NPR tech reporter Bobby Allyn. Bobby, good morning. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Good morning, David. GREENE: So big picture - what should Silicon Valley expect from a Biden White House? ALLYN: Yeah. So in short, big tech will be in Biden's crosshairs. Look; like you mentioned, for years, tech companies have avoided government regulation, and that's let Big Tech prosper and become integral in our daily lives. I mean, just look at the pandemic. We really know how much we need and use tech every single day, and that's made the tech companies larger and richer. There have been many loud calls in Washington to take on the tech sector. But in the Trump administration, there have been, you know, very few new regulations. I talked to Darrell West at the Brookings Institution, and he says that could start to change under Biden. DARRELL WEST: The era of permissionless innovation is over. There's going to be more public engagement, public oversight and public regulation of the technology sector. GREENE: So are we talking about, like, major legislation, other big changes in how these social platforms are going to be operating? ALLYN: Yeah, perhaps. So in Silicon Valley, where I'm located, all eyes are on the future of this law known as Section 230. And it's this decades-old law that shields online companies from lawsuits. And it, you know, basically lets them decide what's allowed and what's not allowed to be on platforms like Facebook and Twitter. And conservatives have called this censorship. Democrats don't. But even Democrats agree that the law gives Big Tech a free pass. Biden has said that Section 230 should be revoked immediately. And if that sounds familiar, David, it's because Trump has basically said the same exact thing. In reality, though, this law is the foundation of the modern Internet. It really enables free expression online, so do not expect it to be totally scrapped. That's according to Stanford law professor Mark Lemley. MARK LEMLEY: What the platforms really want to avoid is losing the legal liability shield. They would be happy to sort of have some oversight and regulation if it meant that they still kept their immunity. ALLYN: And I'll note here - a Biden campaign spokesman recently tweeted that Facebook is, quote, \"shredding the fabric of our democracy\" over the platform not doing enough to take on misinformation. So Biden's people sound like they're ready to play hardball with tech, though executives from Amazon, Uber and Airbnb are part of Biden's transition team. So we'll see what effect they have. GREENE: Are we going to see hardball, as well, when it comes to TikTok? I mean, you have President Trump who has spent months trying to ban the, you know, massively popular video app. Are we going to see a different course from Biden? ALLYN: Yeah. You know, this summer, Biden made his campaign staff delete Chinese-owned TikTok from their phones. And Biden has called the app, quote, \"a matter of genuine concern. \" That said, picking up Trump's push to, you know, put the company out of business is not likely going to be Biden's path. Biden advisers, like the Trump administration, you know, raise alarms about intrusions into Americans' data and the possibility of Chinese espionage, though, you know, an all-out war with TikTok, like the one Trump has launched - don't expect that from the Biden White House. You know, most folks I talked to said, you know, Biden's likely to be more strategic, less antagonistic. And David, actually, today was supposed to be a big day for TikTok. It was the deadline for them to sell their U. S. assets to an American company, but they say they're not ready to do that. I asked the Department of Justice - hey, are you going to enforce the president's order? And nine hours after I asked, they declined to comment. So I guess Trump has his mind focused on other things right now. GREENE: The story goes on. NPR's Bobby Allyn. Thanks, Bobby. ALLYN: Hey, thanks, David.

One reason - live video. NPR tech correspondent Shannon Bond joins us now to explain. Hi, Shannon. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Hey, Ari. SHAPIRO: Start off by telling us about some of these live videos that have popped up since last week. Like, what do you see in them? BOND: Well, how much time do you have? So let's start with Election Day. There were fake results that were livestreamed on YouTube, which is the video platform owned by Google. And one of these livestreams actually reached the top five on Google's results for vote tallies in swing states. And, you know, that meant that hundreds of thousands of viewers saw some of these streams before YouTube eventually took them down. We also are seeing live commentary from influencers, sort of like what you would see on cable news, right? And so these influencers will push these false narratives about voter fraud. They'll show tweets. They'll play other video clips. And they often frame them as saying, well, I'm just asking questions or people on the Internet are saying this. Another tactic we see is what is effectively fake live video. So people post video from something that happened last year or take a video from a protest in one city and claim it's live from another city, and they'll use trending hashtags on those videos to reach a lot of people. SHAPIRO: I think we're all familiar now with how social media companies can crack down on text and photos that are still - that stay up for a while, and you pull them down. How do you do that with live video? I mean, it seems like a unique challenge. BOND: Yeah. I mean, we did see these companies move really quickly last week, you know, labeling posts from President Trump and his supporters making false claims. But live video is harder to stop the spread of. For one reason, it's live, and you can't scan it as quickly as text. Here's what Evelyn Douek told me. She's at Harvard Law School. She studies the platform's rules. EVELYN DOUEK: It's harder to search video content as opposed to text. And so it's a lot harder to scrutinize what's going on, and it's a lot more time consuming. BOND: And so these videos, you know, they may eventually get taken down by the platforms or a label is put on saying they're misleading, but in the meantime, they reach lots and lots of viewers. SHAPIRO: What do the companies say they're doing about this? BOND: Well, I should say, first of all, that Google, Facebook and TikTok are all among NPR's financial supporters. Now, Facebook and YouTube both say they are taking steps to limit the reach of misleading claims made on live video, you know, by limiting distribution or not recommending them. But they're still slow at this. I mean, take last week - former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon went on the livestream on Facebook and YouTube, and he called for Dr. Anthony Fauci and FBI Director Christopher Wray to be beheaded. YouTube and Facebook both deleted this video, but only hours after it had gone live, lots and lots of people had seen it. The companies also penalized Bannon's account. He can't post new posts or new videos. But that was a less aggressive stance than Twitter, which permanently suspended Bannon's account. You know - and, Ari, another tricky challenge for these platforms is, you know, a video doesn't just stay on one platform. So in many cases, somebody will take a snippet of a live feed from YouTube - right? - with, you know, baseless rumors and, you know, spreading these sort of claims. They'll put that up on TikTok. Maybe TikTok takes it down because it also doesn't allow some of these misleading claims. But those things get reposted, and it's just really hard to stamp out. It's so hard for any individual company to take really effective action kind of against the proliferation of these false claims because even after they've been debunked, they pop up again and again. SHAPIRO: That's NPR correspondent Shannon Bond. Thank you, Shannon. BOND: Thank you.

Both Microsoft's Xbox Series X and Sony's PlayStation 5 hit stores this week. NPR's Vincent Acovino says this marks the newest chapter in an ongoing face-off between Microsoft and Sony. VINCENT ACOVINO, BYLINE: At the start of the 21st century, Sony was firmly in control of the video game market. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: That is PlayStation 2, the hottest game to hit the market. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: Hey, Heidi (ph). That's right. Tomorrow morning at 8 a. m. at Target, it'll be packed with PlayStation 2 fans, and it's expected to be the biggest consumer launch in history. ACOVINO: But less than a year later, Microsoft would release its first-ever video game console. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BILL GATES: You may have been wondering what this great device was here. And so for the first time, let me now unveil Xbox. ACOVINO: The Xbox was big, ugly and powerful. Commercials from the time advertised a new dimension to console gaming, an emphasis on online multiplayer and connectivity. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: I just got into Xbox Live. Now, my gamertag, my online ID, is Dark Master. ACOVINO: None of this was enough to topple Sony's reign at the time, but the Xbox did announce the arrival of a new competitor. And since then, the battle between Microsoft and Sony has been a hotly contested one. This year, both corporate titans are releasing their new consoles at a strange time - during the COVID-19 pandemic. CARTER ROGERS: Gaming has really reached a lot of new audiences. ACOVINO: Carter Rogers, an analyst at Nielsen's SuperData, says that despite all the economic insecurity that was brought on by the pandemic, video games are just as popular as ever and are facing even less competition from other entertainment like movies and live sports. Earlier this year, Nintendo Switch consoles saw hardware shortages as games like Animal Crossing: New Horizons posted record sales numbers. Rogers says these new consoles will likely fly off the shelves this holiday season. ROGERS: For the next few months at least, it's purely a question of how many devices can be manufactured and shipped out. ACOVINO: Chris Plante reviewed Microsoft's new Xbox Series X console for the website Polygon. He says that during the last console generation, Microsoft went all-in on the Xbox being an all-in-one entertainment device. CHRIS PLANTE: Infamously, during their big reveal event, they spent the majority of an hour talking about everything but video games. ACOVINO: But Microsoft's tune has now changed. Central to the plan this time around are lots of games, presented at an affordable price. PLANTE: The biggest thing on Xbox right now is Game Pass, which is their version of Netflix for video games. ACOVINO: For around $10 a month, Xbox offers access to a constantly updated library of over 100 games, including big-name franchises like Halo and Gears of War. However, there are not many new games to play, something that might change as the generation wears on, as Microsoft has made aggressive acquisitions of big companies - companies like Bethesda Softworks, who are the makers of the Fallout series. PLANTE: And they are just gobbling up studios. People who like games like Fallout or Elder Scrolls - those games will now be part of Game Pass moving forward. ACOVINO: So while Microsoft's strategy might feel less ambitious this time around, Sony is turning some heads with the PlayStation 5. That starts with the look of the console itself. It has a mostly white exterior and is one of the heaviest game consoles ever, making it the subject of many a meme. ELISE FAVIS: I think my favorite is comparing it to a Stormtrooper. ACOVINO: Elise Favis reviewed the console for The Washington Post. She calls it a sensory experience. That experience starts with an innovative new controller. FAVIS: It has haptic feedback, which is basically a more sophisticated range of vibrations and sensations that you will feel in the palm of your hands. So for example, you can feel, like, the pitter-patter of raindrops. ACOVINO: The system also features an impressive lineup of Sony exclusives, including Spider-Man: Miles Morales and a remake of Demon's Souls. But Chris Plante reminds us that if you can't get your hands on a new console this holiday season, it doesn't mean you're necessarily missing out. PLANTE: I think the marketing machine of video games has broken our brains. There are great games coming out this fall. They're going to look amazing on the new consoles. You just can play them on your older system if you'd like that, too. ACOVINO: Vincent Acovino, NPR News.

This year, both corporate titans are releasing their new consoles at a strange time - during the COVID-19 pandemic. CARTER ROGERS: Gaming has really reached a lot of new audiences. ACOVINO: Carter Rogers, an analyst at Nielsen's SuperData, says that despite all the economic insecurity that was brought on by the pandemic, video games are just as popular as ever and are facing even less competition from other entertainment like movies and live sports. Earlier this year, Nintendo Switch consoles saw hardware shortages as games like Animal Crossing: New Horizons posted record sales numbers. Rogers says these new consoles will likely fly off the shelves this holiday season. ROGERS: For the next few months at least, it's purely a question of how many devices can be manufactured and shipped out. ACOVINO: Chris Plante reviewed Microsoft's new Xbox Series X console for the website Polygon. He says that during the last console generation, Microsoft went all-in on the Xbox being an all-in-one entertainment device. CHRIS PLANTE: Infamously, during their big reveal event, they spent the majority of an hour talking about everything but video games. ACOVINO: But Microsoft's tune has now changed. Central to the plan this time around are lots of games, presented at an affordable price. PLANTE: The biggest thing on Xbox right now is Game Pass, which is their version of Netflix for video games. ACOVINO: For around $10 a month, Xbox offers access to a constantly updated library of over 100 games, including big-name franchises like Halo and Gears of War. However, there are not many new games to play, something that might change as the generation wears on, as Microsoft has made aggressive acquisitions of big companies - companies like Bethesda Softworks, who are the makers of the Fallout series. PLANTE: And they are just gobbling up studios. People who like games like Fallout or Elder Scrolls - those games will now be part of Game Pass moving forward. ACOVINO: So while Microsoft's strategy might feel less ambitious this time around, Sony is turning some heads with the PlayStation 5. That starts with the look of the console itself. It has a mostly white exterior and is one of the heaviest game consoles ever, making it the subject of many a meme. ELISE FAVIS: I think my favorite is comparing it to a Stormtrooper. ACOVINO: Elise Favis reviewed the console for The Washington Post. She calls it a sensory experience. That experience starts with an innovative new controller. FAVIS: It has haptic feedback, which is basically a more sophisticated range of vibrations and sensations that you will feel in the palm of your hands. So for example, you can feel, like, the pitter-patter of raindrops. ACOVINO: The system also features an impressive lineup of Sony exclusives, including Spider-Man: Miles Morales and a remake of Demon's Souls. But Chris Plante reminds us that if you can't get your hands on a new console this holiday season, it doesn't mean you're necessarily missing out. PLANTE: I think the marketing machine of video games has broken our brains. There are great games coming out this fall. They're going to look amazing on the new consoles. You just can play them on your older system if you'd like that, too. ACOVINO: Vincent Acovino, NPR News.

And we should note Facebook is among NPR's financial supporters. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo had a bone to pick with Twitter. On November 4, she tweeted a link to an article claiming, falsely, that Democrats were trying to steal the election. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARIA BARTIROMO: And I got a note from Twitter saying to me, hello, we have received a complaint regarding your account. BOND: Twitter hid her tweet behind a warning that it contained misleading content. So Bartiromo fired off another tweet, saying she would soon be leaving Twitter and telling her followers to join her on Parler. She invited Parler CEO John Matze onto her show. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MORNINGS WITH MARIA\")BARTIROMO: And of course, the success of Parler is partly because people understand that they're getting censored. Have Twitter and Facebook gone too far, John? JOHN MATZE: Well, once you start content curation and you start fact-checking, you're introducing bias. BOND: Bartiromo's complaint is one many conservatives have made in the past few weeks as Facebook and Twitter crack down more aggressively on efforts to cast doubt on the presidential election. Some say they found a more welcoming home on Parler. Radio host Mark Levin told his audience he was fed up after Facebook restricted his account for repeatedly sharing false information. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARK LEVIN: I want to strongly encourage you to leave Facebook and to follow me on Parler. BOND: Thanks to all the attention, Parler, which was founded in 2018, is right now one of the most downloaded apps. In just the past week, its membership doubled to 10 million. That's impressive but still just a tiny fraction of the 187 million people who use Twitter every day or Facebook's billions of users. Parler looks a lot like Twitter, with a feed of posts known as Parleys. One of its early investors is Rebekah Mercer, the conservative donor known for backing Donald Trump, Steve Bannon and Breitbart News. NPR talked to Matze, the CEO, this summer. He said the app intended to solve a problem he saw on big social media platforms. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)MATZE: We found that a lot of people were experiencing or were talking about censorship. We also saw that there was a lot of issues with algorithms changing. BOND: Matze says the goal isn't to be a Wild West with no rules, but a town square. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)MATZE: We take a hard line against pornography and nudity. But if people disagree with one another, we're not there to mediate and moderate the conversation. BOND: And that means that some of the claims Facebook and Twitter are now removing or slowing the spread of are popping up on Parler - hashtags like stop the steal, which is being used to organize protests and perpetuate baseless claims of voter fraud. Shannon McGregor studies social media at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. She's alarmed by what she sees on Parler because she says misinformation is already thriving there. SHANNON MCGREGOR: What we've seen in the past with some of these other sort of fringe or alternative social media sites is if there's no rules and if it's really siloed, then we know that what happens is it gets more and more extreme. BOND: But McGregor and other experts are skeptical that conservatives with the biggest audiences will really abandon larger social media apps for Parler, even as they encourage their followers to do so. MCGREGOR: All these people have accounts on Twitter because that's where journalists are, and that's where the press is, right? And so if they actually left Twitter, they would be less newsworthy, right?

This time, it's about how the social media companies handled allegations of voter fraud and other false or misleading posts around Election Day. A Senate committee grilled the companies' CEOs at a hearing today. NPR tech correspondent Shannon Bond joins us now with more. Hi, Shannon. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Hey, Ari. SHAPIRO: We have to note, as usual, that Facebook is a financial supporter of NPR. So tell us what the purpose was of today's hearing at the Senate Judiciary Committee. BOND: Well, it was originally called by Republican senators who were really angry over how Facebook and Twitter had curbed the spread of this story in The New York Post before the election about President-elect Joe Biden's son. But, Ari, the focus at today's hearing on both sides of the aisle was really broader. You know, senators took these companies to task for how they handled misinformation about the election. So Democrats - you know, they've been pointing to efforts from President Trump and his allies to cast doubt on the election results on social media. You know, these are still happening. On the other hand, Republicans, you know, repeated claims that the platforms come down harder on conservative speech than others. They say that's bias. SHAPIRO: Well, what did Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey say in response? BOND: Well, both of them defended their approaches to the election. And it's worth noting we don't really know, actually, how effective these measures have been, and they say that's something they're going to be studying and sharing that data. Also, notably, both CEOs admitted some errors in how they've handled things in recent weeks. So Dorsey said Twitter was wrong to block people from sharing the New York Post story. It actually made a change to its policy as a result of the whole brouhaha. Zuckerberg, on the other hand - he talked about mistakes Facebook has made in blocking some political ads. And he said that's due to there just being so much content on this platform. I mean, there are more than 2 billion Facebook users. That's a lot of posts. SHAPIRO: There have been so many hearings with these CEOs. Are lawmakers saying they'll do anything about it? BOND: Well, there is a growing sense that, you know, lawmakers may try to pass new laws. I mean, both Democrats and Republicans have come to this agreement that tech companies just have too much power, as they see it. Here's committee chair Republican Senator Lindsey Graham at the hearing today. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)LINDSEY GRAHAM: There's Republican and Democrat concern about the power that's being used by social media outlets to tell us what we can see and what we can't, what's true and what's not. BOND: And even the CEOs themselves today - they said they are open to more regulation. But, you know, as notable as all that is, there isn't really agreement on both sides of the aisle over what the real problem is here. You know, senators just can't agree. Are the companies doing too much or too little? SHAPIRO: So there's another big election coming up, the two Senate runoffs in Georgia in January. What do you expect from the companies regarding that election? BOND: Well, that is a question that Democrat Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut had for both CEOs. He asked them, and here's what they said. And Zuckerberg's answer's first. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARK ZUCKERBERG: Senator, our policy is to have a similar approach in the upcoming Georgia special elections that we took during the general election. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: Mr. Dorsey? JACK DORSEY: Yes, we do. We - and we intend to learn from all of our experience with this election. BOND: And, Ari, that is the big question I think all of us have. What have Twitter and Facebook learned from the presidential election? Is that going to change the way they handle these decisions going forward for Georgia and for other elections? And, you know, there's also one more thing that Jack Dorsey of Twitter confirmed will change after this election. It has to do with President Trump. So Twitter has this policy exempting world leaders from some of its rules, but once Trump leaves office, he won't get that special treatment anymore. He's going to be a regular Twitter user just like the rest of us. SHAPIRO: NPR's Shannon Bond, thank you. BOND: Thanks, Ari. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:   Senators are upset with Facebook and Twitter again.

Foreign adversaries, those hackers who were supposed to crack into voter systems or spread disinformation, they didn't have much of a role. Tim Mak and Dina Temple-Raston of NPR's investigations team explain why. TIM MAK, BYLINE: Geoff Brown, head of New York City's Cyber Command in downtown Manhattan, spent November 3 watching for hackers, for anyone who might have been trying to use the Internet in some way to undermine the election. GEOFF BROWN: It's like a game of chess with a sentient opponent on the other side. And I think all the indications was that opponents were trying to test and interfere with elections all over the globe. MAK: So he watched and waited and nothing happened. BROWN: On the night of the election and running up to the election in this cycle, no, we didn't see anything strange. We didn't see any suspicious behavior. MAK: But Brown said the threat was there. BROWN: I don't think it was overstated at all. I think it was a real threat. And I think that being prepared was exactly what we needed to do. DINA TEMPLE-RASTON, BYLINE: In some ways, November 3 became a kind of Y2K of election nights. So much was supposed to go wrong, but very little actually did. Stu Solomon is the chief operating officer at Recorded Future, a cybersecurity firm. And he was watching for hackers on election night, too. STU SOLOMON: And in this case, the good guys won. The bad guys are not deterred. They're just going to simply look for another element of the attack surface where they could create the outcomes they want. TEMPLE-RASTON: Microsoft and the U. S. military's Cyber Command targeted a huge network of computers controlled by Russian cybercriminals known as TrickBot. Solomon says one of the reasons we didn't see massive cyberattacks on the system was because of that. SOLOMON: So the fact that it was disrupted right at the same time that the elections were kicking into high gear is not a coincidence. And yes, it definitely had impact. MARK ARENA: The people behind TrickBot are very, very experienced, compromising a huge number of people's computers globally. TEMPLE-RASTON: That's Mark Arena, the CEO of Intel 471, a cyber intelligence firm. He's been watching TrickBot for some time, and he figures Microsoft and CyberCom targeted TrickBot because if there was going to be a massive attack on U. S. election systems, TrickBot probably would have been involved. MAK: There were other pre-emptive strikes that may have helped protect the election. Facebook and other social media companies took down fake accounts linked to the Chinese, Iranian and Russian governments. Arena said that over the past few years, social media organizations have significantly improved how they monitor their sites. ARENA: It's obvious to me that Facebook and other social media companies have massively upped the spending on resources to identify these sources within their platforms. They should be commended for it. MAK: So there are two reasons why the election appears to have avoided the kind of mischief that marred the 2016 contest. First, a huge purveyor of ransomware, TrickBot, was hobbled. TEMPLE-RASTON: And second, social media companies were more proactive about taking down fake accounts. MAK: And there's one more piece that local officials say was critical. And it came from the Department of Homeland Security. TEMPLE-RASTON: Its Cyber Infrastructure and Security Agency, to be precise, which was run by a man named Christopher Krebs. MAK: His agency had spent the years since the 2016 election fanning out to various states to help them beef up security around their election systems and voter rolls. TEMPLE-RASTON: Which, given how smoothly everything went, brings us to what may have been the most surprising cyber event of the political cycle. After Krebs said 2020 was the most secure election America has ever had. . . MAK: President Trump fired him in a tweet. TEMPLE-RASTON: And that was the one thing before the election no one had prepared for. For NPR News, I'm Dina Temple-Raston in New York. MAK: And I'm Tim Mak in Washington. (SOUNDBITE OF AK'S \"23. 01. 2018\") RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:   With all the focus on recounts and baseless claims of fraud being made by the president, something may have gotten lost in this election. Foreign adversaries, those hackers who were supposed to crack into voter systems or spread disinformation, they didn't have much of a role. Tim Mak and Dina Temple-Raston of NPR's investigations team explain why. TIM MAK, BYLINE: Geoff Brown, head of New York City's Cyber Command in downtown Manhattan, spent November 3 watching for hackers, for anyone who might have been trying to use the Internet in some way to undermine the election. GEOFF BROWN: It's like a game of chess with a sentient opponent on the other side. And I think all the indications was that opponents were trying to test and interfere with elections all over the globe. MAK: So he watched and waited and nothing happened. BROWN: On the night of the election and running up to the election in this cycle, no, we didn't see anything strange. We didn't see any suspicious behavior. MAK: But Brown said the threat was there. BROWN: I don't think it was overstated at all. I think it was a real threat. And I think that being prepared was exactly what we needed to do. DINA TEMPLE-RASTON, BYLINE: In some ways, November 3 became a kind of Y2K of election nights. So much was supposed to go wrong, but very little actually did. Stu Solomon is the chief operating officer at Recorded Future, a cybersecurity firm. And he was watching for hackers on election night, too. STU SOLOMON: And in this case, the good guys won. The bad guys are not deterred. They're just going to simply look for another element of the attack surface where they could create the outcomes they want. TEMPLE-RASTON: Microsoft and the U. S. military's Cyber Command targeted a huge network of computers controlled by Russian cybercriminals known as TrickBot. Solomon says one of the reasons we didn't see massive cyberattacks on the system was because of that. SOLOMON: So the fact that it was disrupted right at the same time that the elections were kicking into high gear is not a coincidence. And yes, it definitely had impact. MARK ARENA: The people behind TrickBot are very, very experienced, compromising a huge number of people's computers globally. TEMPLE-RASTON: That's Mark Arena, the CEO of Intel 471, a cyber intelligence firm. He's been watching TrickBot for some time, and he figures Microsoft and CyberCom targeted TrickBot because if there was going to be a massive attack on U. S. election systems, TrickBot probably would have been involved. MAK: There were other pre-emptive strikes that may have helped protect the election.

And you'll see the space between the stars is dark. I'm not exactly blowing your mind here, am I? No. The question is, how dark is the dark space? Astronomers recently tried to find out. Here's NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: The darkness of outer space seems like a pretty basic thing to know. But Tod Lauer says it's long been a mystery. He's with the National Science Foundation's National Optical Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory. And he says, what would it look like if you could somehow take away all the stars and galaxies that give out visible light? TOD LAUER: Is there any light coming from the universe itself? Is space truly black? Or is there a little bit of a glow that you can see? GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says it's hard to detect a faint glow when there's lots of other bright light around. That's the case on Earth and all through the inner solar system, which is full of dust that reflects sunlight. Out beyond all the planets, however, that dust isn't a problem. The sunlight is much weaker. And right now, that's where you'll find NASA's New Horizons probe. Five years ago, this spacecraft made history when it flew past Pluto. Since then, it's just kept going. It's more than 4 billion miles from home. To try to see how dark space really is, Lauer and other members of the New Horizons team analyzed a bunch of images taken by the spacecraft, unexciting images of just blank, dark sky, maybe sprinkled with faint stars. LAUER: So it's sort of boring images of fields with a few stars in them. But for us, that's gold to be mined. GREENFIELDBOYCE: They processed the images to essentially just take away the light from all known sources. Marc Postman is an astronomer with the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Md. MARC POSTMAN: The main things you need to subtract off are scattered light from other nearby bright stars, light from very faint stars and very faint galaxies that we know about. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Scattered light from the Milky Way itself, light from all the galaxies beyond our own that are thought to be out there. And he says, here's the thing. When they did all that, in the end, they were left with about a quarter of the light they started with. That means a quarter of the total light they measured in outer space could not be accounted for. Where did it come from? Postman says either there are twice as many galaxies as people think. . . POSTMAN: Or there's some as yet unknown new source of light that we need to think about. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Maybe even something related to dark matter. That's a mysterious form of matter that exerts a gravitational pull on visible matter but has never been seen directly. MICHAEL ZEMCOV: I think if it was dark matter, that would be amazing. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Michael Zemcov is an astrophysicist at Rochester Institute of Technology who wasn't part of the research team. He thinks the results seem solid, if disconcerting. ZEMCOV: If you look at what they're saying, they're saying that there's as much light outside of galaxies as there is inside of galaxies, which is a pretty tough pill to swallow, frankly. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says that's because astronomers have been studying visible light for centuries but seem to be missing something pretty important. ZEMCOV: Are we sure that the big galaxies are where everything is? Maybe it's a bunch of little stuff. Maybe it's some other exotic process that we don't know about yet. GREENFIELDBOYCE: So how dark is outer space? There is light out there, light that scientists can't explain. But still, it's pretty dark. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News.

Globally, the average sea level is more than eight inches higher now than it was in 1880, and the trend is accelerating. NPR's Rebecca Hersher has the story about a new satellite that could help scientists understand how climate change is changing our seas. Here's her story. REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: If you live near the coast, you've probably seen buoys and other contraptions along the water's edge that measure what's going on in the ocean, including how high the water is. But when it comes to understanding global climate change, there is no substitute for satellite data. JOSH WILLIS: From space, you can see the whole thing. HERSHER: Josh Willis is a scientist at NASA. He's leading the U. S. team that's launching a new satellite called Sentinel-6 in collaboration with the European Space Agency. Sentinel-6 will zip around the globe 800 miles up and look at the surface of all the oceans. WILLIS: It's really kind of an incredible feat of technology. We can actually measure the water level with an accuracy of about one inch from 800 miles up. HERSHER: Sentinel-6 uses radar to make continuous measurements. WILLIS: A radar beam comes down out of the satellite. It bounces off that surface, and then it measures the signal coming back. And by figuring out how long it takes to go down and come back, you can tell how far away the water is. HERSHER: If you know how far away the water is, you can figure out how high it is relative to the land. Sentinel-6 is the latest in a string of satellites that do this kind of measurement going back to the '90s. But those missions were somewhat ad hoc, and scientists couldn't always be sure that there would be a next mission when the current one ended, which is a nightmare when you're trying to understand how the climate is changing over time, which is why they are really excited that this time, the satellite will be up there for five years and then another identical satellite will launch to do another five years - so a decade of reliable data. LuAnne Thompson studies oceans at the University of Washington. LUANNE THOMPSON: I use that data every day in my research. HERSHER: Thompson has been studying how the oceans have been changing for decades. She says obviously sea level rise is tangibly important to people who live on the coasts, but ocean changes affect everyone. What happens in the ocean doesn't stay there. For example, currents and ocean temperatures affect weather and fish populations. THOMPSON: We can also use the sea level measurements to understand how currents are changing, how the ocean is storing heat. HERSHER: And hotter oceans can drive more powerful hurricanes. And scientists use sea level data from satellites to figure out exactly how hot the oceans are getting, too, because water gets bigger as it gets hotter. THOMPSON: So by knowing the sea level, we have an indication of how much the ocean has expanded because of warming. HERSHER: Josh Willis of NASA says the Sentinel-6 satellite is crucial because climate change is happening fast. In the past, scientists had to make do with less data about the oceans. But now, with the Earth rapidly warming, climate scientists need as much information as possible about what's happening around the globe. WILLIS: Sea level is continuing to rise, and we can't stop measuring it. Every year, every decade, we're remaking the climate and raising sea levels higher and higher. HERSHER: Sentinel-6 is scheduled to launch on November 21 from California. Rebecca Hersher, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF IHF'S \"BRIDGE\") RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:   The oceans are rising.

CHARLES: He was announcing a new Food and Agriculture Climate Alliance. It includes other farm groups, also big environmental organizations like the Nature Conservancy, where Pipa Elias is director of agriculture. PIPA ELIAS: It feels like, in the past 18 months, the conversation has just really shifted. CHARLES: The shift is happening for a couple of reasons. Many food companies have promised to reduce their greenhouse emissions, and they're pushing for changes on the farm, sometimes paying for the changes. And Barb Glenn, who's CEO of the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture, says it's partly just what farmers are experiencing. BARB GLENN: Everyone in this unique coalition understands and is witnessing the changing of the climate, and we all want to be involved in impacting it. CHARLES: The new alliance is proposing dozens of policy changes. They'd encourage farmers to install equipment that captures methane, a powerful greenhouse gas from cow manure, or farm in a way that builds healthier, carbon-rich soil, actually removing carbon from the air. Farmers would get paid to do this, maybe by the government, maybe by private companies that want to offset or cancel out some of their own carbon emissions by paying for greenhouse gas reductions somewhere else. Some environmentalists who are not part of this alliance, like Jason Davidson at Friends of the Earth, are dead set against some of those ideas. JASON DAVIDSON: There's a heavy reliance on voluntary, market-based solutions. CHARLES: But those carbon offsets that farmers might sell just allow polluters somewhere to keep polluting, he says. Also, it can be hard to measure what some of these farming methods actually accomplish. Meredith Niles, a specialist on farming and the environment at the University of Vermont, says scientists are working on that measurement problem. And the fact that farm groups are finally talking about reducing their own greenhouse emissions, she says, is a big step forward. MEREDITH NILES: A lot of farmers didn't want to speak about it because it might mean potential regulation. CHARLES: They're fine with incentives, though, and there are signs that the incoming Biden administration is thinking the same way. The leader of the Biden transition team for the U. S.

Department of Agriculture recently called on the USDA to set up a so-called carbon bank. It would pay farmers to fight climate change.

With cases of the coronavirus surging across the country, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is recommending that people don't travel. And that in-person turkey dinner? That should be with people you've been living with for at least 14 days before the holiday. For some people, that's No one. But although we might not be able to see our loved ones in person, it doesn't mean we can't spend the holiday with them. J. D. Biersdorfer answers people's technology questions for The New York Times and has been thinking about alternatives to the traditional holiday gathering. Her latest piece is \"How To Have A Fully Remote Family Thanksgiving. \" And J. D. Biersdorfer joins me now. Thanks for being with us. J D BIERSDORFER: Thank you for having me. FADEL: So let's start with one of the most important parts of the remote setup. You recommend people connecting via video platforms. I think a lot of people are familiar with Zoom, maybe a little too familiar. What are some other ways to connect, especially if you're sick of sitting in front of a computer all day? BIERSDORFER: There are a number of video chat platforms - like, Facebook Messenger has a rooms feature. There's FaceTime, which is Apple's platform, if your whole family's in the Apple ecosystem, Google Duo. And then if the video thing is just not for everyone, you can still have a great family text chain where you're sending food photos or you just get the old-fashioned telephone service and do an audio call, maybe put it on speaker phone if you have a number of people in your House, and just call people that way. FADEL: So, you know, cooking is such a big part of the day, cooking together, bonding over recipes. How do you recreate that experience remotely? BIERSDORFER: You can also pull the video into the kitchen as well if your family is inclined to go with the more video stream route. And then if you've got the one person in the family who always has all the cookbooks with all the ancient family recipes that you always, always have for your holiday meal and you want to share that out, you can have that person who is the keeper of the cookbooks scan or take a photo of the recipes, send them out to everyone. Maybe you're in the kitchen, everyone's got their video call on and you're cooking together using the same reference material. Or even if you want to bring in a little business into it, you know, make it be a presentation on the screen. FADEL: You know, also, Thanksgiving is about - a lot about food, a lot about cooking, but it's also about bonding time, people watching football, playing games. What are some fun things to play while you're hosting a remote gathering? BIERSDORFER: Yeah. So if you're - dependent on how your family rolls, Trickster Cards is a site that lets you get on and you can have four people playing cards through a Web browser. And if you even want, you can have the video of the players there. If you are into the traditional after-dinner movie while you digest, there are a number of sync watch apps. I think Teleparty is a big one. It works with Netflix and Hulu and Disney+. But you can synchronize the movie, send everyone an invite so they're all there on the same screen. And then there's a little chat window where you can say the same snarky things about the movie that you would if you were sitting there watching it on the couch. And for those who like football, because I believe Detroit and Dallas are doing their traditional games no matter what, Yahoo! Sports has a feature where you can use their Yahoo! Sports app to watch the games together, I think up to four people. But if you want to sit there and tease the fan of the other team, that's a way to kind of do that in sync if you don't feel like texting. FADEL: When you were reporting this out and trying to give the best advice on how to do Thanksgiving remotely, what was the best nugget you came across? BIERSDORFER: Well, I started from the point of all the things that I like to do just for my traditional family Thanksgivings and how those would translate to the digital world. And to your point earlier on, people were maybe getting a little Zoom fatigued. Being on screen the entire time might be a little bit too much. So maybe just do - if you are in the video mode, do that sporadically throughout the day. Just don't have a constant live stream. Less can be more here. And also, give members of the family a time to shine. If you've got, say, a niece or a nephew who's taking music lessons, maybe have them give a little performance after dinner for everyone on the call. You know, grandma can see the dance or hear the guitar solo. And have people maybe share some life stories. Like, we probably have grandparents who remember what life was like before the polio vaccine, which we're kind of in the same point. And get those first-hand stories. Especially if you're into genealogy or capturing family history, this could be your perfect opportunity to get all of that firsthand memories right there when people are sort of focused on them.

But Zoom will not host just any conversation. The video streaming platform is being accused of censorship after it blacklisted a controversial speaker at a public event. NPR's Bobby Allyn reports, and we should note Zoom is a financial supporter of NPR. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: The controversial speaker is Palestinian activist Leila Khaled. Khaled is a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. The U. S. considers it a terrorist group. Khaled is notorious for hijacking a plane in 1969 and trying to do it again a year later. So when Rabab Abdulhadi invited Khaled to speak, she knew it would set off a big debate. Abdulhadi, a professor at San Francisco State University, says it never happened because of Zoom. The company said there were legal concerns. RABAB ABDULHADI: We might be implicated in criminal activities of material support for terrorism, and that might include imprisonment and a fine. ALLYN: Abdulhadi didn't fear those consequences. She sees Khaled as a feminist icon who should be able to speak at a public event. Some 1,500 people had planned to tune in on Zoom. ABDULHADI: As a platform, they do not have the right to use their being a platform in order for them to veto the content of our classroom and thus actually impinge on our academic freedom. ALLYN: Legally, Zoom can't tell Abdulhadi what to teach. But it can kick speakers off its platform, and the pro-Israel Lawfare Project had been pressuring Zoom to do just that. Brooke Goldstein is the project's executive director. BROOKE GOLDSTEIN: So if your interest is in having an academic discussion about controversial issues, go ahead. But that doesn't mean that you have the right to assist a designated terrorist group in carrying out their mission. ALLYN: This wasn't the first time Zoom faced this kind of heat. This summer Zoom shut down meetings commemorating the Tiananmen Square massacre at the request of the Chinese government. Social media sites like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have been in the middle of debates over enforcing content rules for a while. For Zoom, it's new. DAPHNE KELLER: Welcome to the party, Zoom. ALLYN: Daphne Keller is a former Google lawyer who is now at Stanford Cyber Policy Center. Zoom started as a corporate video service, but now with the pandemic, millions of people use Zoom for everything - lectures, birthday parties, karaoke, weddings. Keller says that's forced them to set boundaries. KELLER: Do we want Zoom to be the content police or the speech police? - because we're all so dependent on them. You know, they are functioning in a way that, for previous generations, the Postal Service or the phone company functioned. ALLYN: Zoom may act like a phone company, but it isn't a utility. There's certain speech that can get it in legal trouble. Faiza Patel is with NYU's Brennan Center for Justice. She says with the endless flood of speech on the Internet, there have to be rules. FAIZA PATEL: I think we're all kind of struggling to figure out how to maneuver in this space, which is quite different from what we've had before. ALLYN: Patel says tech companies' terms of service usually say, we encourage free speech and debate. But censoring someone from actually speaking does challenge that. PATEL: That obviously creates a question about, well, are you really allowing, you know, the full extent of the conversation? ALLYN: Back at San Francisco State University, Abdulhadi is looking for an alternative to Zoom that doesn't, as she sees it, silence political speakers. ABDULHADI: I mean, it's a very serious problem to be vulnerable to the only means of communications in today's pandemic times because what does this really mean for the future of education? What does this mean for the future of communication? ALLYN: In a statement, Zoom says it supports academic freedom and the open exchange of ideas, but hosting someone linked to a terrorist group violates their terms of service.

And welcome to Newshour from the BBC World Service, coming to you live from our studios in central London. GREENE: But when the BBC wanted to step up its audio game online, it wanted a more informal, friendlier voice than that. So it turned to artificial intelligence. NPR tech correspondent Shannon Bond introduces us to their newest sound. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE: I'm the BBC's synthetic voice, and I can read out articles from bbc. com. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: This is the first time I'm meeting this voice, which I'm sorry to say doesn't have a name. The BBC told me I could ask it anything, so I asked it to explain how it works. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE: It's easy. I take the text that's on the screen and read it out loud. Well, OK, maybe it's not quite that simple. There's a lot of tech going on in the background. BOND: The BBC developed the voice with engineers at Microsoft using machine learning. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE: They based it on many hours of human recordings and finely tuned it to create the voice you hear now. Pretty clever, eh? BOND: A lot of publishers are trying these experiments to turn text into speech to make their websites and apps accessible for people who have a hard time seeing and to keep people engaged even if they're too busy to sit down and read. So the BBC did a lot of research and decided to shed one of its best-known traits, the very proper accent known as the Queen's English. (SOUNDBITE OF BBC BROADCAST)UNIDENTIFIED BROADCASTER #2: Here is the Air Ministry's weather forecast for tomorrow. BOND: Online, the BBC wanted a voice that's more easygoing, one you could imagine having a pint with. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE: I'm British, so I say tomahto (ph) while you say tomayto (ph). I'm also Northern, aka not from London, so I say Bath, while the Queen of England might say Bahth (ph). BOND: Bath, Bahth. OK, that might not sound like a big deal to American ears, but on the other side of the pond, it really matters. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE: In the U. K. , Northerners are known for sounding friendly. I hope I do, too. BOND: That tone also sets the BBC apart from the audio technology other news organizations are using. CLAIRE: This is your Washington Post Election 2020 results update. I'm Claire, elections AI presenter for the Post. BOND: Claire is all business, no drama. At the other end of the spectrum, there's The New York Times. UNIDENTIFIED VOICE ACTOR: Black theater is having a moment. Thank Tyler Perry - seriously. BOND: The Times bought a company this year called Audm, which produces audio stories with professional voice actors. The BBC is aiming for somewhere in the middle. Here's what its voice sounds like reading a recent story. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE: But when the office temporarily closed eight months ago due to the pandemic, Domino wasn't wistful about losing his daily dose of corporate culture, the view or free kombucha. BOND: So now when you might think about flipping on the radio or a podcast, the BBC hopes you'll try out a news story or feature. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE: Life can get busy, so I can help by reading articles out loud, letting you get on with other things at the same time. You might need to go for a run, pick the kids up from school or make supper, which I believe Americans call dinner. BOND: But do people really want to listen to a robotic voice, even a friendly one? I asked Nick Quah, who writes the audio industry newsletter Hot Pod. He says that depends on whether the AI can fool you into thinking it's a real person. NICK QUAH: Could you - (laughter) can it be an automated delivery of information that doesn't feel mechanical, that feels vaguely believable as (laughter) a source of like, you know, that intimacy that people look for in the audio format?

NICK QUAH: Could you - (laughter) can it be an automated delivery of information that doesn't feel mechanical, that feels vaguely believable as (laughter) a source of like, you know, that intimacy that people look for in the audio format? BOND: And when it comes to that question, we humans still have an edge over the robots. Just ask Siri.

The holiday season is usually a great time to break them out, but like so many other things, family game night might have to be a bit different this year. Instead of breaking out the board games around a shared table, families and friends are trying to figure out how to play games together, but remotely. So in lieu of our regular conversation about the year's best board games, we've reached out to LA Times interactive games reporter Todd Martens for his suggestions for games that can be played online. Todd Martens, welcome. Thank you so much for joining us. TODD MARTENS: Great. Yeah, thank you for having me - happy to be here. MARTIN: Well, first of all, have you seen more interest in online games since the pandemic has started and more people are staying at home? MARTENS: Yeah. I think definitely, I think, over the last few months, you know, we've seen all of these even companies that make puzzles running out of puzzles and companies that make board games running out of board games - and then, you know, online games. At the start of the pandemic, everybody was playing Animal Crossing, which sort of became the obsession because it was such an easy game to play for gamers and non-gamers alike. So I think a lot of people are becoming curious who maybe weren't playing games because games allow you to be social. MARTIN: OK. So let's start with the classics that people might already be familiar with playing in person like Monopoly, Scrabble, card games. Are they still fun to play online? MARTENS: Yeah, all these sort of classic board games do have apps. Your mileage may vary. Some translate easier to that medium than others. But there's also a lot of stuff that is being sort of tailored specifically for this moment that I also think is kind of interesting. There's a lot of companies that run in real life in non-pandemic times escape rooms, and they've pivoted to online escape rooms. And you set up a time, and they have sort of an actor walk you and, you know, your family through, you know, an hour's worth of puzzles. There's one in Austin, Texas, called Novel Escape, and they do, like, a \"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea\" sort of themed escape room. And that's just sort of a way to turn it into - I don't know - holidays if you can't gather to maybe turn it into an event. MARTIN: That sounds fun. OK, but what about people who are by themselves? MARTENS: Yeah. No, so, I mean, obviously, you know, I mean, most games are designed to be played solo. You know, there's - in the last few months, there's been a lot of attention focused on this game Among Us. It garnered some headlines when Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez played it online with some followers as sort of a get-out-the-vote moment. But basically, you and your friends are on a ship. One person on the ship is an imposter, and you have to sort of figure out who the imposter is. And you could play that with your family, or you can play that with, you know, strangers and just sort of take your luck with who you sort of meet. MARTIN: (Laughter) OK. MARTENS: You don't have to physically - you don't have to actually speak to them. You just sort of play it (laughter). MARTIN: Solid point - solid point. That's called Among Us. MARTENS: Among Us, yeah. MARTIN: Among Us. OK. Well, you know, is there something that you think families can play if they have different comfort levels with technology? MARTENS: There's a new - newish - it came out about a year ago now - called Blinks - B-L-I-N-K-S. And it's sort of a twist on the board game. It's these little, tiny octagonal cubes that are filled with LED lights, and all the lights sort of speak to each other. So you're playing relatively simple games that you can play solitaire or you can play with, like, you know, two, three, four people. And my sort of favorite thing about it, as somebody who's quarantined alone, is they just, like, look really, you know, enchanting. You know, it's, like, you can sort of dim the lights, and you have these, like, beautiful colors that sort of light up and help you play a game. MARTIN: That sounds good. Todd Martens writes about interactive entertainment and pop music for the LA Times, and we reached him in Los Angeles. Todd Martens, thanks so much for talking to us.

So technology is being developed to identify cattle through facial recognition. Seth Bodine of member station KOSU reports that the goal is to track cattle in the event of disease. SETH BODINE, BYLINE: For Jake Calvert, the only way to tell his cows apart is with colorful ear tags. Take those off, and it gets a little tricky. JAKE CALVERT: It'd be tough for me to say, oh, well, that's 24, and that's - obviously, the only red cow in the herd, 48 - I'd be able to tell her. BODINE: But cows have unique faces just like humans. Facial recognition technology can pick up on about 200 key measurement points to identify a human face, what's known as biometrics. It turns out that concept works for cows, too, and artificial intelligence is really good at it. KC OLSON: The artificial intelligence looked at the pictures for millions of iterations and effectively taught itself which features of the bovine head were most characteristic of the species. BODINE: That's K. C. Olson. He teaches range livestock nutrition at Kansas State University. He and his team showed the AI lot of cow pictures. Then they played a game. We'll call it, have you seen this cow? OLSON: Ninety-four percent of the time, artificial intelligence got the right answer. BODINE: The ultimate goal is to develop an app called CattleTracs. Ranchers would snap a picture of the cow, then send it to a database that Joe Hoagland's company is developing. He says it could lead to a speedier way to track a sick cow. JOE HOAGLAND: We could trace it and quarantine it and manage it much like we're dealing today with the coronavirus. You know, if you can get on top of it early, you can control it. BODINE: A highly infectious illness like hoof and mouth disease could all but shut down the cattle industry, disrupting the supply of meat. Right now cows have to be tracked painstakingly through paper documents and sales records to figure out how far a disease has potentially spread. Rosslyn Biggs is a beef extension specialist at Oklahoma State University. ROSSLYN BIGGS: We need to be able to limit it because undoubtedly, we will have significant interruptions in our supply chain here in the United States. Our export markets will undoubtedly cut us off. BODINE: The U. S. Department of Agriculture has been eyeing radio electronic ear tags to replace metal tags as official IDs now used widely for cows that travel between states, but these tags are met with resistance from ranchers because of cost. That's why, though Calvert isn't yet sold on the technology, once facial recognition for cows becomes available, he expects ranchers to embrace it. CALVERT: Because a $9 - even a $20 a year subscription to a phone app is going to be far cheaper than tagging 500 calves with RFID tags. BODINE: The USDA says it's aware of research into cattle facial recognition and will continue to evaluate it as a possible way to easily identify and trace millions of cows.

It has put thousands of journalists out of work. And that is part of the reason why a newsletter startup called Substack is having a moment. As NPR's Bobby Allyn reports, it offers writers a way to get paid without relying on bosses or the whims of Facebook to distribute their stories. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: For the past seven years, journalist Casey Newton has covered the tech world for the website The Verge. He's become something of a Silicon Valley institution - required reading for industry insiders. This fall, he quit his staff job to launch a Substack newsletter. CASEY NEWTON: And all of a sudden, this thing comes along where it's like, imagine never having to ask your boss for a raise again. Like, all you have to do is do good work and attract customers. ALLYN: Substack gave Newton a website and slick email tools. It offered him the added perks of a health care subsidy and a legal defense fund. Newton does his own marketing. NEWTON: All I have to do is find a few thousand people that'll pay me 10 bucks a month or a hundred bucks a year, and I'll have one of the best jobs in journalism. ALLYN: Newton enjoins legions of other writers who are ditching jobs at established publications like Rolling Stone, The New Republic and Vox to join what's become known as the Substackerati. San Francisco-based Substack co-founder Chris Best says part of his pitch to writers is this - sick of publishing clickbait in hopes of becoming the next viral hit on Facebook or Twitter? Join Substack. CHRIS BEST: The platforms we're spending all of our time on incentivize that stuff and make that stuff easy and give it fuel. And so the way to fix that is to have a better business model where that's not true. ALLYN: Email newsletters are nothing new, but Best says Substack is different because it lets independent writers make money; that is, if they can convert readers into paid subscribers. Helena Fitzgerald, a New York freelance writer, had almost given up on newsletter writing until she found Substack. Now she's getting a sizable chunk of her income from her newsletter called \"Griefbacon. \"HELENA FITZGERALD: The one-sentence pitch I have for it is that it's like long, weird essays about love. And that's like something that, like, you can't really pitch to a site that is looking to get a lot of clicks through an algorithm. ALLYN: Substack is a three-year-old company but has reached new heights this year. It makes sense. People are glued to their phones like never before, and the pandemic has slammed the media industry. By one estimate, nearly 30,000 media jobs have been cut in 2020. Substack sees this as an opportunity. But paychecks aren't guaranteed, notes NYU journalism professor Meredith Broussard. MEREDITH BROUSSARD: The Substack model works really well for some people who already have prestige and a following, and it doesn't work that well for everybody else. ALLYN: Influential voices on the right and left, historians and even an anonymous bankruptcy expert have all found success on Substack. But Broussard says the question is whether this is an enduring model or just another passing Internet fad. BROUSSARD: We've seen the enthusiasm before. We've seen this hype cycle before. So if this is the time that it really happens, then I'm here for it. And if it's not the time that it happens, there's going to be another thing around the corner. NEWTON: I'm not somebody who thinks that Substack is going to save journalism. ALLYN: Again, Casey Newton, formerly of The Verge, now of Substack. NEWTON: Do I think it can create a lot of sustainable journalism jobs? I do. ALLYN: Newton says he understands the suspicion some have about a tech startup trying to disrupt the news business.

Because they are active on social media, the Biden family's lives are less private than other presidents' children and grandchildren have been. NPR's Elena Moore reports. ELENA MOORE, BYLINE: During the Democratic National Convention, Joe Biden's four granddaughters were introduced in a pretty traditional way. They appeared in a video explaining how they had encouraged their grandfather to run for president. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)NAOMI BIDEN: He thought we were calling a meeting sort of to, like, discuss, you know, whether or not we wanted him to. But really, we were calling it to be like, get in that race. Hurry up. MOORE: That's Naomi Biden, the president-elect's eldest granddaughter. She's next to her sisters, Finnegan and Maisy and their cousin Natalie. All four granddaughters played active roles in Joe Biden's online campaign, along with Ella and Cole Emhoff, the stepchildren of Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. But some of these young adults are also public on their own time, using Twitter, Instagram and TikTok. Over the last year, Naomi Biden's voice has gotten especially louder over Twitter, from posting supportive messages about her pop to sharing Biden-themed memes. She's racked up tens of thousands of likes. This adds to Biden's appeal, according to Lisa Caputo. She was press secretary to Hillary Clinton as first lady. LISA CAPUTO: He's relatable to begin with. But then to hear it through the voice and through the eyes of his granddaughter, I think, just puts a whole nother lens of relatability onto him in a whole nother way that never would have been contemplated or utilized way back when. MOORE: President Trump's younger son, Barron, isn't visible on social media. President Obama's daughters aren't super visible either. Tevi Troy is a historian who studied presidential usage of pop culture and says, well, things have changed. TEVI TROY: The time seems to be right to have a president who has a bunch of family members who are active on social media. And social media is not a weird or elite thing. It's a kind of common thing today. MOORE: And while presidential families have played public roles before, says historian and journalist Kate Andersen Brower, the Biden and Emhoff young adults stand out. KATE ANDERSEN BROWER: I think that this is really a first where we're seeing this kind of individualism and the support of the family. MOORE: Brower says she was struck by Ella Emhoff's presence on Instagram. Emhoff is an art student and often posts photos of her work online. She also went viral on election night when a TikTok was posted of her trying her first McDonald's Filet-O-Fish while watching CNN. The video has 2. 4 million views. BROWER: She's capturing that individualism. MOORE: And days later, when the election was called for Biden, his own grandchildren went viral when they told the world their family had begun celebrating the win. Naomi Biden tweeted a picture of the family group hug with the president-elect. And Maisy Biden posted a TikTok. She walks on screen in a T-shirt that says Joe the vice president, and crosses out the word vice. It was set to this song by The Belmonts. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"NA NA HEY HEY (KISS HIM GOODBYE)\")THE BELMONTS: (Singing) Na, na, na, na, hey, hey, hey, goodbye. MOORE: It has 1. 7 million views. Still, Brower cautions that in the past, some first families have taken a step back after the campaign ends. BROWER: I'm curious to see if the Biden grandchildren in particular really take this public facing role once he is in office. MOORE: But that would mean breaking their social media habit.

They appeared in a video explaining how they had encouraged their grandfather to run for president. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO) NAOMI BIDEN: He thought we were calling a meeting sort of to, like, discuss, you know, whether or not we wanted him to. But really, we were calling it to be like, get in that race. Hurry up. MOORE: That's Naomi Biden, the president-elect's eldest granddaughter. She's next to her sisters, Finnegan and Maisy and their cousin Natalie. All four granddaughters played active roles in Joe Biden's online campaign, along with Ella and Cole Emhoff, the stepchildren of Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. But some of these young adults are also public on their own time, using Twitter, Instagram and TikTok. Over the last year, Naomi Biden's voice has gotten especially louder over Twitter, from posting supportive messages about her pop to sharing Biden-themed memes. She's racked up tens of thousands of likes. This adds to Biden's appeal, according to Lisa Caputo. She was press secretary to Hillary Clinton as first lady. LISA CAPUTO: He's relatable to begin with. But then to hear it through the voice and through the eyes of his granddaughter, I think, just puts a whole nother lens of relatability onto him in a whole nother way that never would have been contemplated or utilized way back when. MOORE: President Trump's younger son, Barron, isn't visible on social media. President Obama's daughters aren't super visible either. Tevi Troy is a historian who studied presidential usage of pop culture and says, well, things have changed. TEVI TROY: The time seems to be right to have a president who has a bunch of family members who are active on social media. And social media is not a weird or elite thing. It's a kind of common thing today. MOORE: And while presidential families have played public roles before, says historian and journalist Kate Andersen Brower, the Biden and Emhoff young adults stand out. KATE ANDERSEN BROWER: I think that this is really a first where we're seeing this kind of individualism and the support of the family. MOORE: Brower says she was struck by Ella Emhoff's presence on Instagram. Emhoff is an art student and often posts photos of her work online. She also went viral on election night when a TikTok was posted of her trying her first McDonald's Filet-O-Fish while watching CNN. The video has 2. 4 million views. BROWER: She's capturing that individualism. MOORE: And days later, when the election was called for Biden, his own grandchildren went viral when they told the world their family had begun celebrating the win. Naomi Biden tweeted a picture of the family group hug with the president-elect. And Maisy Biden posted a TikTok. She walks on screen in a T-shirt that says Joe the vice president, and crosses out the word vice. It was set to this song by The Belmonts. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"NA NA HEY HEY (KISS HIM GOODBYE)\") THE BELMONTS: (Singing) Na, na, na, na, hey, hey, hey, goodbye. MOORE: It has 1. 7 million views. Still, Brower cautions that in the past, some first families have taken a step back after the campaign ends. BROWER: I'm curious to see if the Biden grandchildren in particular really take this public facing role once he is in office. MOORE: But that would mean breaking their social media habit.

A group of her former colleagues and academics wrote an open letter calling this, quote, \"unprecedented research censorship. \" NPR's Bobby Allyn is following this story. And before we begin, we need to note that Google is a financial supporter of NPR. Hi, Bobby. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Hey, Ari. SHAPIRO: Tell us more about this researcher. Who is she, and what did she do at Google? ALLYN: Yeah. Her name is Timnit Gebru, and she's kind of this all-star researcher in her field. She's done, you know, some of the leading studies into how things like facial recognition technology can be biased against women and people of color. She started a group called Black in AI because there are just so few Black scientists working on artificial intelligence. Her mission as a scientist has basically been to show how technology can hurt marginalized groups. And Google found that interesting enough that they hired her. And they had her lead a team of researchers who are studying the ethics of AI, something that's huge to the future of Google's business. SHAPIRO: But her employment there was cut short. Tell us what happened. ALLYN: Right. So Gebru and six other researchers had just finished a draft of a research paper they wanted to submit to a conference next year. And I've reviewed the paper, Ari, and it is pretty dense. But essentially, it's about a tool that can scan massive amounts of texts online and generate sentences that look like they were written by a human. Gebru wrote in the paper that this tool might end up mirroring some of the hate and discrimination and other awful things you could find on the Internet. And Gebru says out of nowhere, she was told the paper had to be retracted. And she was like, why? And she wasn't told why. And so she said, if I'm not told why this paper has to be retracted, I might even resign over it. But, Ari, she never had a chance to. Gebru told me she found out what happened when she was talking to one of her team members. TIMNIT GEBRU: Literally right then, she was, like, oh, my God. What? What's happening? What's happening? Did you resign? What's going on? What's going on? And I'm like, what? ALLYN: Gebru says she never resigned but was fired. GEBRU: I feel like people silenced me in the most fundamental way - by trying to censor my scientific voice. SHAPIRO: Wow. So does Google have a different version of the story? What are they saying about this? ALLYN: They do have a different version of the story. Google says that she threatened to resign unless management met with her to discuss why it wouldn't support the paper, and they wouldn't do that. So they considered it a resignation. But there's another layer to the story here. Gebru has been outspoken about the need for more women and more people of color at Google, and she wrote an email to co-workers criticizing Google's lack of progress in diversifying. She even encouraged them to stop participating in a diversity program Google had started. She saw it as useless. And in an email I reviewed sent by her boss at Google to colleagues, he sounded pretty irked about that. Since yesterday, though, more than 1,200 Google employees have signed an open letter demanding answers about how she was let go. SHAPIRO: So, obviously, this has touched a nerve and deals with some larger issues than one employee. What are her supporters saying about this? ALLYN: Yeah, it does. So the letter from her colleagues says she faced, quote, \"defensiveness, racism, gaslighting, research censorship and now a retaliatory firing. \" And a big theme that's come out in the upwelling of social media reaction is that this, like you said, is not an isolated incident at Google. Some are connecting it to past walkouts over racial inclusion and sexual harassment. I talked to Ifeoma Ozoma. She's a consultant who works on tech accountability, and she's a former Google employee. IFEOMA OZOMA: So Google is doing this over and over again and seems to not care at all and to believe that they can continue to get away with it. ALLYN: Yeah. And so what Gebru's case has done is put the spotlight on Google and whether it can indeed handle dissent from its employees. SHAPIRO: NPR tech reporter Bobby Allyn, thank you. ALLYN: Thanks, Ari.

But the truth is that for this semester, a lot of instruction has been online. Anya Kamenetz from NPR's education team has been checking with teachers across the country to see what's been going well and where there are still big gaps. ANYA KAMENETZ, BYLINE: Deborah Rosenthal starts virtual kindergarten on Zoom every morning with a song. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG)UNIDENTIFIED SINGER: (Singing in Spanish). KAMENETZ: There's a greeting from the class mascot - a dragon - yoga with meditation and letter sounds practice. DEBORAH ROSENTHAL: Oso, oso. O. O. O. KAMENETZ: Rosenthal teaches in a Spanish immersion program in a public school in San Francisco's Mission District. She's taught kindergarten for 15 years and she loves it. ROSENTHAL: Kindergarten is just such a wonderful, physical, tactile age. And so everything in kindergarten is very, very hands-on. KAMENETZ: But with the district all online this semester, she says. . . ROSENTHAL: It's such a different experience. I mean, it's a very two-dimensional experience. KAMENETZ: Rosenthal has been working really hard to make online learning as rich as possible for her kids, many of whom come from families near the poverty line, that are undocumented and are dealing with COVID-related job loss. ROSENTHAL: I was a pretty dedicated teacher to begin with. But I find that I'm spending - I don't know - 10 or 12 hours a day doing lessons and thinking about my lessons and thinking about a way of bringing my lessons to the kids and making it engaging. KAMENETZ: Very few people would tell you that doing kindergarten online was a good idea or, frankly, even possible. That was before 2020. This fall, across the country, most instruction has been virtual. I talked to educators in six states from California to South Carolina. They said the heart of the job right now is getting students connected with school and keeping them that way technologically, but even more importantly, emotionally. THERESA ROUSE: We have a lot of staff who work really hard to build solid relationships with all of our students. KAMENETZ: Theresa Rouse is superintendent of Joliet Public School District 86 in Illinois. They put 400 teachers through intensive training in online teaching with an organization called the Digital Learning Collaborative. They spent the first three weeks of the school year focusing just on social and emotional skills. And, says Rouse, any adult at a school, from teachers to the assistant principal, to a school counselor or social worker, might drop in during video classes to show they care. ROUSE: If they're seeing a student that looks distressed, they pull them aside into a breakout room, have a conversation. Are you OK? KAMENETZ: Across the country in rural South Carolina, Caroline Weathers usually teaches science at St. George Middle School. This year, her full-time job is helping families, maybe with a Wi-Fi hotspot or an app parents can download to track kids' grades. She says she'd like to continue the role going forward, getting parents more of a voice in their kids' education. CAROLINE WEATHERS: We have the parents' attention. So maybe now is the time to really, you know, really reach out. In 10 years, we might see something entirely different in education. KAMENETZ: But right now, teachers say, the digital divide is huge. And it's heartbreaking. Rosenthal in San Francisco teaches at a school called Buena Vista Horace Mann. It's a community school, meaning there are wraparound services, including lots of help with technology. But despite that, she didn't make contact with one of her students until 2 1/2 months into the school year. ROSENTHAL: The little girl was going to a babysitter that was not literate. And so they - nobody could help this child get onto a computer even though the mom picked up a hot spot and so forth. KAMENETZ: Although attendance on her daily Zooms is high, Rosenthal says, because of issues like these, no more than a fourth of her students are accessing the written assignments. What keeps her up at night, she says, are the kids she's just not getting to. ROSENTHAL: Every year as a teacher, you will have five, six kids that are struggling, right? They came very unprepared to school. But at least they're with me all day long so I can support them literally, you know, six or seven hours a day. KAMENETZ: She says, this year, most of her kids are learning and growing. But those five or six who started out behind aren't getting much of anywhere. Anya Kamenetz, NPR News.

You could take the subway or order a Lyft or Uber. Or soon, if a group of New York City drivers has their way, you could open The Co-op app on your phone. Ken Lewis is one of those drivers and one of the organizers of The Co-op. Thanks very much for being with us, Mr. Lewis. KEN LEWIS: Yes, sir. Thank you very much. SIMON: What do you hope your app can do? LEWIS: Well, I think that rideshare has been a very positive model for transportation. But I think there is also that part where it has been very predatory and extractive on our community. And so we hope that we can solve that problem while keeping the benefits of rideshare. SIMON: I think all of us who've been in an Uber or Lyft have heard the drivers complain about the fees the companies collect. How would yours be different, if it would be? LEWIS: Yes. This is one of the main benefits, I think, that people will see immediately. One, our trips are going to be slightly under Uber and Lyft charges for riders. And we will actually be able to pay drivers still more than they actually get at this moment from Uber and Lyft. They take, like, 25 and 30% from drivers. We will be taking 15%. But more than that - the really important is that while Lyft make their money for Wall Street investors and Silicon Valley investors, we will be a co-operative. So any profits will go back to the drivers. SIMON: Well, Mr. Lewis, will you also put some money into some of the services that these ridesharing companies offer, like background checks for drivers, which can be a concern to people? LEWIS: Yes, yes. I mean, we will give the benefits that rideshare has. I mean, in New York City, the TLC already does a job of background checks and so on. But we will do additional checks as needed. But we are also going to make sure that we respond to some of the deserts where people can't get a ride. I mean, there has been a study that showed that actually Uber and Lyft charge people who are Black and brown more than they do other riders. We are going to make sure that this is going to be fair to everybody, and riders will benefit, and drivers will also. SIMON: Would your Co-op drivers still be technically independent contractors? LEWIS: Well, yes, but they will also be owners. And so we have to look at that. But they will all have a share. They will all be able to elect the driver board and so on. And so drivers are going to be really invested in this. SIMON: What's your pitch to customers potentially, Mr. Lewis? LEWIS: Well, our pitch to customers will principally be to support drivers who have had a really hard time. But you get the same drivers with the same cars and with a price point that's a bit lower. We also have started some negotiations to help drivers to buy electric cars, which will help the environment and the community also. SIMON: Not to get ahead of yourselves, but would you hope eventually to branch out to other cities? LEWIS: Well, at the moment we are focusing on New York City. But there is nothing more powerful than an idea whose time has come. And this is it, you know? SIMON: Ken Lewis - his project is called The Co-op - thank you so much for being with us.

PATRICK SKLUZACEK: I am Patrick Skluzacek. I am a master auto technician at a - you know, a small shop. I am a veteran with 22 years in the Army and in the Army Reserve. And I was one tour in Iraq. ELLIOTT: Today, Patrick Skluzacek lives in Blaine, Minn. , Back in 2007, he was serving in the Army as a convoy commander in Fallujah. He saw a lot of things during the war that he couldn't shake. P SKLUZACEK: The biggest thing, I think, after I got back is even driving down Minnesota roads. You have this, what if? What if that's a bomb? What if that's a bomb? Cheese and crepes (ph), I'm driving by all this trash on the side of the road. And what - could that blow up? Could that blow up? Could that blow up? You're so paranoid from doing this for a whole year. You just can't quit being in the Army. ELLIOTT: Tyler Skluzacek remembers when his dad's nightmares began. TYLER SKLUZACEK: My dad is suddenly not sleeping well, very irritable. He was a very irritable man, not like he was before he left. And so it was definitely hard. It was my - all of my high school years and most of my college years, he was kind of in a rough spot like that. ELLIOTT: But the biggest toll was on Patrick's life. P SKLUZACEK: Destroyed it pretty much - I lost my wife. ELLIOTT: In a divorce. P SKLUZACEK: I didn't get to see my family. The only way I could sleep was to - vodka and pills - pretty much lost everything, you know, my house, everything, my job. Everything went. ELLIOTT: His father's downfall was painful for Tyler. During his senior year in college, he heard about a computer hackathon, a marathon event where developers come together to work on a project. This one was devoted to finding ways to help people with PTSD. T SKLUZACEK: So I took my meager senior-year salary and went to the competition, where I met some brilliant psychiatrists and doctors, mostly out of various VAs around the country, and built a small team. And we developed this application. It's a smartwatch application that monitors PTSD symptoms while someone sleeps but also provides, like, gentle interruptions in order to try to pull them out of the sleep with haptic feedback or vibrations to the wrist. ELLIOTT: Tyler was using technology to imitate something service animals were already doing, recognizing a traumatic nightmare and then nudging or licking the person to disrupt the bad dream. The smartwatch does this with a gentle vibration. But there was some trial and error to get just the right calibration. And for that, Tyler used his dad as a guinea pig. T SKLUZACEK: He had to endure a lot of bad versions of the application, as you can imagine, right? No application is perfect on the first try. It was iteration, iteration, iteration. I think he says, like, iteration - what do you say - iterations five or seven or nine or something, it finally stopped spooking you awake or was providing just enough stimulus to pull you out of the traumatic situation. P SKLUZACEK: I still remember, though, when I - you had me wear it full-time, and I had my air hammer at work. And you thought I was having a heart attack because I was - had the watch on. And you thought my heart rate was 6,000 beats per minute. T SKLUZACEK: Yeah. I was terrified. Watching someone's data 24/7, I feel like, is a lot like having a baby. I don't have a baby, but, like, you're suddenly very concerned at all hours. ELLIOTT: But, eventually, father and son working together hit upon the right formula. T SKLUZACEK: It was honestly pretty incredible to have done something for my dad that, you know, positively influenced his life and using technology. So I'm a big tech guy. And being able to make someone's life better and use technology was just a win-win. ELLIOTT: After years of suffering, Patrick Skluzacek finally found relief. He was able to get his life back. He has remarried. And he's working again. He still has the occasional bad dream, but they don't rule his life. P SKLUZACEK: It was night and day when I put that watch on, and it started working. There are some bad nights out there regardless with the watch or not. That's hard even for a little watch to break up a nightmare. You know, but mostly rarely, rarely woke up at night, rarely. ELLIOTT: More people will soon be able to benefit from Tyler Skluzacek's invention. An investor purchased the rights to the app and started a company called NightWare. Last month, the Food and Drug Administration approved the device to treat PTSD-related nightmare disorder. It will soon be available through the Veterans Administration.

Maybe it's your entire work life. Maybe most of your family time has been on Zoom. The question is, are these interactions any less real than if they were happening IRL? Chris Stedman actually started thinking about this before the pandemic. CHRIS STEDMAN: I spent the last few years really wrestling with this sort of central question of what it means to be real in a time when so much of our life now happens in spaces that we have absorbed the idea that they are less real. KING: He wrote a book called \"IRL: Finding Realness, Meaning, And Belonging In Our Digital Lives. \" A few years ago, Chris Stedman was a mess. He'd just gone through a bad breakup, and then he got scabies. The problem was he couldn't tell anyone. He'd curated his social media feeds to make it look like his life was perfect, like he was always happy and handsome and having fun. But at that moment, he said enough. He took a selfie in which he sort of looks like a heartbroken man with scabies, and he put it on Instagram where everyone could see it. STEDMAN: That really felt like the first moment when I actually showed everyone else in my life, anyone who didn't see me in person, a little bit of what was going on and where I was at. What's funny is I look at it now and it's - first of all, it's not really a bad picture. But. . . KING: (Laughter). STEDMAN: . . . What's - what was notable to me about it was that it felt so stark. And it felt so sort of out of place from the rest of my sort of digital output. You know, I wanted to understand why it felt so difficult to me to share that photo. KING: Did your friends have any kind of reaction? Did anyone say, oh, my God, man, you look terrible? STEDMAN: (Laughter) Yes, I did. KING: They did. OK. OK. So people were, quote-unquote, \"real with you. \"STEDMAN: I definitely got some texts from a couple people. KING: (Laughter). STEDMAN: I also mention in the book at that time in my life 'cause I - you know, right after my scabies diagnosis, it was - you know, I went to such a dark place that I really was sort of a little less active online. And I mention in the book my sister texting me one day worried, saying, you know, are you OK? What's going on? You haven't tweeted. (LAUGHTER)STEDMAN: And - but I do think the selfie thing reveals something, which is that I don't think anyone else thinks as much about our online presentation as we do. For all of human history, we have always been multiple selves, right? The person I am in this conversation with you right now is different from the person I am when I'm just talking with my best friends or when I'm hanging out with my mom. You know, these are all sort of slightly different versions of me. But I think when we are confronted with that reality, sometimes the way that we respond to that is by saying, well, one of those is my sort of true self, and the rest are all kind of fake or different versions of myself that I'm putting on for others. But the reality is, who we are is not one true self and a bunch of other fake selves, but rather a composite of many selves. And the Internet, I think, gives us a chance to see these things in ourselves, the things that we're often less comfortable with. KING: I'm very curious, though, how you deal with outright meanness. You - you're presenting, like, a fairly optimistic view of living right online. But how do you deal with people who are just outright jerks online? STEDMAN: Yeah. KING: And there are many, many of them who seem to feel like that's OK 'cause it's a digital space, not real life. STEDMAN: Right. Well, that's just it. I mean, you know, I very early on in my career got a lot of very negative attention from people who didn't agree with some of my ideas and for years was very personally attacked. People went after my mom. It was so strange to me. And so I think my reaction to that really was to withdraw. And I think that's a big part of why I presented a very sort of safe self on the Internet for years. But what I realized is that that actually really didn't protect me because even though I maybe felt like I was safe from trolls, I was safe from people being really critical of me, I also was not feeling like myself online. And the Internet is this huge part of our world now, and I want the Internet to feel like a space where I can be myself. And I don't want to feel like I need to keep myself completely guarded in order to be able to be online. I think that in order to feel like ourselves, we have to be vulnerable. Vulnerability is a risk, right? It's a risk that we'll get hurt. But that risk exists in every other part of our life. KING: Yeah. STEDMAN: When I, you know, open myself up to someone, whether it's a family member, someone I'm dating, you know, there's a risk that they'll reject me. There's a risk that they'll hurt me. There's a risk they'll be cruel to me. But the answer isn't to just wall myself off and give them the sort of safest version of myself that I can, and I think that that's true online. KING: Talk to me about coming out. You write that you first came out to strangers online. That's a very, very personal thing to share with strangers. But in some ways, I sort of get the impression that it was easier for you to tell strangers that you were gay than it was to tell people who you - your parents, for example. STEDMAN: Yeah, yeah. So, I mean, I came out first to digital strangers in part because it felt so much safer. If I came out to someone online and it went poorly, I could close out of the window and, you know - but if I came out to my mom and that went poorly, well, that would have, you know, many other consequences. And so coming out online became a way of finding a sense of community at a time when I desperately needed one, when I was very isolated as a young, queer person in a community where I didn't see any other queer people around me. I write about it in \"IRL\" in this - in the context of talking about my love of maps as a kid because, you know, when I was a kid, I grew up in a community where - a community that felt small to me in all kinds of ways. And I loved atlases as a kid because they helped me place myself in a much broader world. I could, you know, read all about countries that I had never been to, communities that I had no connection to and see that there was so much else in the world beyond just my one town. And the Internet functioned very similarly to me. At a time when I saw no other LGBT people around me, I could log on to the Internet and find other people, see that the world was so much broader than what I knew.

It hasn't quite given up on the idea of robotaxis, but it is recognizing it can no longer afford to spend billions of dollars on the technology. NPR's Camila Domonoske reports. CAMILA DOMONOSKE, BYLINE: Uber has always aimed big. It wanted to operate around the globe. It wanted to replace personal car ownership. And when it came to self-driving technology, Uber wanted to play a starring role in that revolution and make a fortune off of it. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRAVIS KALANICK: There's a huge, huge, like, positive impact to society when driverless cars become a thing. DOMONOSKE: That was Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick at a World Economic Forum event in 2016. And after Kalanick was pushed out of Uber because of numerous scandals, new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi was still optimistic. He spoke at Davos in 2018. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DARA KHOSROWSHAHI: We will have autonomous cars on the road, I believe, within the next 18 months not as a kind of a test case but as a real case out there. DOMONOSKE: Just a few months after that remark, a self-driving Uber on a test run struck and killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Ariz. After that deadly crash, Uber pulled its test vehicles off the road for a while, but research into self-driving software continued. The goal was to eventually offer rides without needing to pay drivers. But while self-driving technology has been improving, it's not close to making Uber any money. And that research is very expensive. DANIEL IVES: Yeah, they've put a lot of money. It's in the billions. DOMONOSKE: Daniel Ives is with Wedbush Securities. After all these years, Uber is recognizing its limitations. It's never turned a profit, and the pandemic has it bleeding money. Self-driving could still be part of Uber's future in years to come through partnerships, but the company won't be developing the technology in-house. IVES: This was a strategic vision, but ultimately, for it to really play out, they were going to need to sell this business. They could not support that level of R&D needed to make this successful. DOMONOSKE: All that expertise is heading to a startup named Aurora that's working on self-driving trucks. Uber isn't getting any cash in exchange. Ives says this transaction is all about getting a money-loser off the books. It's a sign the company that always dreamed big is narrowing its focus. Uber is doubling down on ride-hailing and food delivery as it chases that elusive profit. Camila Domonoske, NPR News.

And that research is very expensive. DANIEL IVES: Yeah, they've put a lot of money. It's in the billions. DOMONOSKE: Daniel Ives is with Wedbush Securities. After all these years, Uber is recognizing its limitations. It's never turned a profit, and the pandemic has it bleeding money. Self-driving could still be part of Uber's future in years to come through partnerships, but the company won't be developing the technology in-house. IVES: This was a strategic vision, but ultimately, for it to really play out, they were going to need to sell this business. They could not support that level of R&D needed to make this successful. DOMONOSKE: All that expertise is heading to a startup named Aurora that's working on self-driving trucks. Uber isn't getting any cash in exchange. Ives says this transaction is all about getting a money-loser off the books. It's a sign the company that always dreamed big is narrowing its focus. Uber is doubling down on ride-hailing and food delivery as it chases that elusive profit. Camila Domonoske, NPR News.

Lines at the polls would have been longer, and the ballots would have taken more time to count if they hadn't gotten a big infusion of cash. It came from a nonprofit funded by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. We should mention Facebook is among NPR's financial supporters. Local officials say they are grateful for the help, but some observers say this is no way to fund an election. Here's Tom Scheck of the investigative group APM Reports. TOM SCHECK, BYLINE: Election officials in Chester County, Pa. , did something different this year. Some residents were worried about whether election drop boxes were secure, so the workers who collected the ballots wore body cameras. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PAT CONLIN: This is Ranger Pat Conlin. I have arrived at my first destination for the Voter Services ballot collection. SCHECK: Each day, county workers recorded video as they opened drop boxes and collected the ballots before delivering them to the election office. Chester County Voting Services Director Bill Turner says the body cameras and some drop boxes would never have happened without a grant from the Center for Tech and Civic Life. BILL TURNER: Honestly, I don't know what we would have done without it. SCHECK: Chester County got $2. 5 million from the nonprofit - more than the county's entire 2020 election budget. The county used the money to hire more staff and to buy equipment. Turner says that helped them process mountains of mail-in ballots as the nation waited for Pennsylvania's results. TURNER: This grant really was a lifesaver in allowing us to do so more efficiently. And it probably would have taken a very long time if we didn't have the resources to do this. SCHECK: Turner says they applied for the grant because the money they got from the federal government this year wasn't enough. The CARES Act included $400 million for elections, but running this election was extra-expensive given the pandemic, the huge turnout and all the mail-in ballots. And the federal government didn't send a second payment. LIZ HOWARD: Despite election officials basically begging our federal government for assistance, that money never came through. SCHECK: Liz Howard is an election security expert with the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. HOWARD: Congress really failed our election officials. SCHECK: With Congress failing to deliver, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife donated $350 million to the Center for Tech and Civic Life, a nonprofit that works to make elections more inclusive and secure. Officials with the nonprofit declined interview requests, so it's difficult to determine how the money was spent. But a review of more than 30 grant agreements and interviews with more than 20 election directors show it was used on everything from voter outreach to food. Bulloch County, Ga. , budget officer Peyton Fuller says they used the money to buy extension cords to space out voting machines. PEYTON FULLER: We were thinking, you know, we were going to get, like, five or $6,000. And then they came back and sent $60,000, and I was like, yeah, this is amazing. SCHECK: And in Coconino County, Ariz. , grant money helped establish early voting on the Navajo Indian Reservation for the first time. Conservative groups claimed the grants helped sway the election in favor of Joe Biden. But an APM Reports analysis of voter registration and turnout in Georgia, Pennsylvania and Arizona shows no difference between counties that received grant money and those that didn't. The money didn't change the outcome but did make things run more smoothly. Still, Suffolk University political science professor Rachael Cobb says private money can be viewed as coming with strings attached. For example, Zuckerberg may be trying to improve his image after being criticized over how Facebook handles misinformation. RACHAEL COBB: I don't think elections should be public-private partnerships. They are public enterprises run by public institutions and ideally fully funded by public institutions. SCHECK: Back in Chester County, Bill Turner says he's not worried about using the private money for elections. He says if the nonprofit makes those funds available again, he'll apply for a grant.

And today, the social media giant got hit with a one-two punch - first, a lawsuit from 48 attorneys general across the country and then another lawsuit from the Federal Trade Commission. Both say Facebook has gone too far. NPR tech correspondent Shannon Bond joins us. And we need to mention that Facebook is a financial supporter of NPR. Hi, Shannon. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Hi, Ari. SHAPIRO: Walk us through the argument that these lawsuits are making. BOND: Sure. So the FTC and these states have been investigating Facebook together, and the core accusation is the same in both suits. Here's what New York Attorney General Letitia James, who led the state's investigation, said at a press conference today. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)LETITIA JAMES: For nearly a decade, Facebook has used its dominance and monopoly power to crush smaller rivals and snuff out competition, all at the expense of everyday users. BOND: So James described this strategy at Facebook of crushing the competition by buying or burying. So in the first case, you know, she says, Facebook spends huge amounts of money to buy companies that it sees as potential rivals. And the key companies at issue here are Instagram, which Facebook bought in 2012, and WhatsApp, which it bought a few years later. And those deals, you know, they really helped Facebook gain users, especially on smartphones, and become even more powerful. You know, today, more than 2 billion people use its apps every day. SHAPIRO: So that's the buy part of the equation. What about the bury? How does James say Facebook crushed competitors? BOND: Right. So for companies that rebuffed Facebook's offers to do a deal or that it didn't want to buy, prosecutors say Facebook lured them in - lured their developers in - with promises they could plug into its systems and access its data. And then they allege if those companies look like they might be a competitive threat, Facebook would pull the plug. So as an example, you might remember Vine, the short video app. It was really popular. You could look on there and find your Facebook friends in the app until Facebook cut off that access. And what, you know, James and the FTC allege is that this buy or bury strategy, it not only harmed competitors, it also actually hurt social media users because they have less choice over what social networks to use. SHAPIRO: So what are these lawsuits seeking? I mean, how do they propose to dismantle this, if that's actually what they want? BOND: Well, among other things, both lawsuits have a really big ask. They're basically asking the courts to look at breaking up Facebook, forcing it to undo these purchases of Instagram and WhatsApp, which, of course, are its crown jewels. And you know, that's a really big ask. The attorney generals' suit also asked the court to block Facebook from making any new deals worth more than $10 million while this case is going on. And, you know, $10 million sounds like a lot of money, but that's not necessarily a lot for a tech company. So that could basically stop Facebook from buying almost, you know, anything that it might have its eye on while this is all happening. SHAPIRO: Now, Facebook has been under this kind of criticism from Congress for a while, although these lawsuits are new. How does Facebook respond to to these critiques? BOND: That's right. Well, Facebook says, you know, look, the FTC had a chance to raise concerns over the purchases of Instagram and WhatsApp back when they happened years ago, and it didn't do it. So Facebook is accusing the government of asking for a do-over. It says that's just not fair. It also says, you know, that Instagram and WhatsApp are so successful in large part because Facebook bought them and invested in them. And it says it's unfair to try to punish them for that success. You know, Facebook also has pointed repeatedly to other competition it faces in social media. It says it's not the only player. Look at TikTok, which has gained lots of users. But you know, Ari, four years, these biggest tech companies, you know, they didn't receive a lot of scrutiny or regulation. That is really starting to change. Just in October, the U. S. Justice Department sued Google, alleging anti-competitive behaviour. SHAPIRO: That's NPR tech correspondent Shannon Bond. Thank you. BOND: Thank you.

That's what it'll take to control the pandemic, allow the economy to recover and get our lives back to normal. And that's one reason the false claims about the vaccines on social media are so harmful, as NPR tech correspondent Shannon Bond reports. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: University of Washington researcher Kolina Koltai first heard about the coronavirus back in January from anti-vaccination groups on Facebook. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)KOLINA KOLTAI: They were posting stories from China like, hey, here's this mysterious illness, or here's something that seems to be spreading. BOND: It's hard to remember now, but back then, few people in the U. S. were talking about the virus. But those opposed to vaccination were paying attention. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)KOLTAI: There's been a long outstanding concern that an epidemic or, in this case, a pandemic is going to potentially cause another vaccine to be created to potentially be, like, forced onto everyone. BOND: Koltai is well-versed in these false conspiracy theories about vaccines. She's studied the growing anti-vaccination movement on Facebook since 2015. Before now, these claims mainly circulated in specific groups dedicated to vaccines, alternative health and parenting. But this year, a global pandemic has created what she calls the perfect storm for misinformation to hit the mainstream. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)KOLTAI: There's so much we don't know, so much uncertainty. And uncertainty makes us all so prone to misinformation to try to, like, quell that feeling. BOND: Falsehoods have multiplied, from neighborhood chats to groups for pet owners, because so many people have questions about the COVID vaccines. They've also been propelled by groups opposed to lockdowns and mask-wearing and promoting QAnon, a fact-defying, pro-Trump conspiracy theory - like these discredited claims in a video titled \"Plandemic\" that went viral this summer. KOLTAI: Essentially, that this was all part of a larger plan - to use the word plandemic - as a way to, like, sort of force vaccines. They're going to force things onto us to get to this, like, you know, new world order. BOND: Baseless claims that the virus was planned and that vaccines will be used to track or control people were among the most mentioned pieces of misinformation this year, according to Zignal Labs, a media analytics company. And this matters to public health. A recent Gallup survey found more than a third of Americans, 37%, are not willing to get a COVID vaccine. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)IMRAN AHMED: It's a really, really, really powerful parallel pandemic to the real pandemic. BOND: Imran Ahmed is CEO of the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate, which tracks online misinformation. His group commissioned its own poll this summer. It found people in the U. S. and U. K. who rely on social media for information about the pandemic were less likely to say they would get a COVID vaccine than those who get their news from traditional media. The group also found the 150 largest anti-vaccination accounts on social media gained 8 million followers since January. Ahmed says these twin pandemics amplify each other. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)AHMED: One being biological, one being social, working in concert to really undermine our capacity to contain COVID. BOND: The social networks are well aware of the problem. Facebook, YouTube and TikTok, which are all NPR financial supporters, say they're removing debunked claims about COVID vaccines. Twitter says it's still working on its policy. Recently, Facebook took down some of the biggest anti-vaccination groups and pages. Ahmed says even with these moves, public health officials face an uphill battle to persuade enough people to get vaccinated, while vaccine opponents have a lower bar. AHMED: Their job is not to persuade people not to take a vaccine. It's to inject doubt. That's it. That's all you got to do for their side.

And I said, this is something I need to go back and take a closer look at. But I didn't read all the details of it. ALLYN: In Austin, Texas, Tom Krones was really busy when he got the email last month. TOM KRONES: Part of it was I just kind of figured I'll do it later. ALLYN: Airbnb had set a deadline of just a few days later. So by the time Krones remembered. . . KRONES: You know, I should probably buy, like, a couple shares just for fun. And I pulled up the email again, and it was too late. ALLYN: To be clear, many Airbnb hosts jumped at this chance, and for some, it paid off handsomely. Los Angeles-based Airbnb host Jino Cabrera says he was thinking about it. JINO CABRERA: I've never even bought a single share of stock in my life. ALLYN: But he took a gamble, bought 200 shares. It cost him about $14,000. Once the stock started trading, his money doubled. He quickly cashed out. CABRERA: I sold my stocks yesterday (laughter). ALLYN: Cabrera is now celebrating in Las Vegas. He is not alone in being surprised. Airbnb co-founder Brian Chesky was on Bloomberg TV when an anchor told him the price of the stock had doubled. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BRIAN CHESKY: That's the first time I've heard that number. That is - that's a - you know, when we. . . ALLYN: Krones was watching this from his home in Austin. KRONES: That's the one thing that makes me feel a little bit better about the whole thing - right? - is seeing his face and being like, OK, well, if he didn't know, then I can't be expected to know either. ALLYN: Of course, it's cold comfort since he is not a dollar richer today than he was before the IPO. The same cannot be said of Chesky, whose net worth went up $7 billion.

Airbnb sent it to thousands of its hosts. It was an invitation to buy company stock ahead of its blockbuster initial public offering this past week. Problem is, it kind of looked like spam. So many of them ignored it and missed out on what could have been a golden ticket. NPR's Bobby Allyn has the story.

JACOB GOLDSTEIN, HOST:  Last week, the federal government and attorneys general - or ah-ttorneys (ph) general, if you prefer - from 46 states, and from Guam and Washington, D. C. , filed what may be the biggest antitrust case of the 21st century and one of the biggest antitrust cases in all of American history. AMANDA ARONCZYK, HOST:  They have accused Facebook of using its power and money to squash competition, in large part by buying out its competitors. So since 2012, Facebook has bought dozens of companies, and the antitrust case focuses on two big acquisitions in particular - Instagram and WhatsApp. GOLDSTEIN: According to the complaint filed by the government, Facebook's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp were illegal. And as a result, the government argues Facebook should be forced to sell off the companies, companies - Facebook points out, for its part - that they have spent tens of billions of dollars to acquire and build. ARONCZYK: Now, if you have been listening to PLANET MONEY for a while, the news of this case might not be a surprise. GOLDSTEIN: Almost two years ago, at the beginning of 2019, we did a whole series about the history of antitrust law in America, about the part of the law that deals with monopoly and market power and competition among big businesses. It had been decades since the government had used antitrust law in a big way, but it was a moment when a few big tech companies were clearly getting bigger and bigger and people were starting to talk about it again, starting to ask if the government was going to go back and dust off those old laws that it had used to break up big companies like Standard Oil and AT&T. ARONCZYK: One of the people we talked to in that show was Scott Hemphill. He's an expert in antitrust law. He's also a professor at NYU Law School. And last week, as soon as this Facebook case was announced, we called him up - got back in touch. GOLDSTEIN: I am going to play something from the last time we talked. Let's see. You ready? Here. SCOTT HEMPHILL: Yeah. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)HEMPHILL: The main thing I'd want to do is to take a hard look at tech mergers that have already been consummated and where there may have been an anti-competitive problem at the time. GOLDSTEIN: Specifically, what are some of those mergers? HEMPHILL: So the one that jumps out to me is Facebook - Instagram. GOLDSTEIN: Nailed it. HEMPHILL: (Laughter). GOLDSTEIN: When I saw the case yesterday, I actually thought, this is exactly what we talked about on the show almost two years ago. I mean, is it that it was obvious? Was - to anyone who was an expert, was it obvious that this was coming? HEMPHILL: I don't know the answer to that. I don't know whether it was obvious or not. You know, this was two years ago. I think it has become increasingly obvious. GOLDSTEIN: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Jacob Goldstein. ARONCZYK: And I'm Amanda Aronczyk. Today on the show, the case against Facebook. GOLDSTEIN: Why so many politicians and government lawyers who don't agree on, seemingly, anything else all agree that the government should break up Facebook. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ARONCZYK: When we talked to Scott Hemphill, the antitrust expert, a couple years ago, he didn't say Facebook's acquisition of Instagram was obviously a problem. He said, maybe it was a problem, maybe it wasn't. We need to figure it out. GOLDSTEIN: Under antitrust law, intent matters. So one of the essential questions here is why Facebook bought Instagram and, for that matter, WhatsApp. One important fact here - it is legal to have a monopoly. Just having a monopoly does not, on its own, get you in trouble. On top of that, in some cases, it is also legal to have a monopoly and buy other companies. Might be fine, for example, if Facebook bought Instagram and WhatsApp because it thought the combination of the companies would make them better than they would be on their own. ARONCZYK: The idea is it's good for consumers when an acquisition makes companies' products better or cheaper. That's the free market working as it should. Scott says that may be legal. HEMPHILL: Facebook, of course, continues to say that the reason that they acquired Instagram was to, you know, turbocharge it, to make it all it could be. GOLDSTEIN: But on the other hand, if Facebook bought Instagram and WhatsApp because it was afraid that they were going to take away some of Facebook's business, if it bought them because they didn't want to compete against them, that is potentially illegal because a dominant firm buying up competitors so it doesn't have to outcompete them - that, ultimately, reduces choice for consumers. And consumer choice - they call it consumer welfare in the law - that is what modern antitrust law is supposed to protect. ARONCZYK: So that is the big question. Why did Facebook buy these companies? And one of the things that's happened in the two years since we did that last antitrust series was the government started trying to answer that big question. It started investigating Facebook, looking into these specific acquisitions. GOLDSTEIN: Part of that investigation was this big hearing you might remember from this summer where the heads of the big tech companies testified before Congress. Mark Zuckerberg testified. Remember, they had, like, a little screen of his face set up, you know, because he was remote. It was like Max Headroom on trial. And he spoke directly to Facebook's acquisition of Instagram. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARK ZUCKERBERG: I mean, I think with hindsight, it probably looks, like, obvious that Instagram would have reached the scale that it has today. But at the time, it was far from obvious. A lot of the competitors that they competed with in mobile sharing, including companies like Path - I mean, I don't even think Path exists today. It was not a guarantee that Instagram was going to succeed. The acquisition has done wildly well, largely because we invested heavily in building up the infrastructure and promoting it and working on security and working on a lot of things around this. And I think that this has been an American success story. GOLDSTEIN: Zuckerberg has also pointed out that when Facebook bought Instagram, it was a tiny company. It had 13 employees. It had no revenue at all. And, you know, people didn't even think of it as a social network. They just thought of it as a photo app for your phone. ARONCZYK: But the congressional investigation was more than just CEO testimony. Behind the scenes, the House committee also subpoenaed records from the companies so they could try to figure out what Mark Zuckerberg and his colleagues were saying to each other in emails and presentations that happened around the time of the acquisitions. GOLDSTEIN: As it happens, one of the key staffers working on that House investigation was the other person we talked to in our big tech antitrust show a couple years ago, an attorney named Lina Khan. LINA KHAN: Yeah, I think you and I met just a few weeks before I joined the House Antitrust Subcommittee. GOLDSTEIN: By the time we talked to Lina Khan, she had already become famous, or at least antitrust nerd famous, for this paper she published in 2017 when she was still in law school. It was a paper about antitrust law and how it should deal with Amazon and with tech companies more generally. ARONCZYK: So she talked to us, and then she went off to do that investigation in Congress. And when we talked to her again last week, she told us about her team's investigation of Facebook, in particular about a moment when they were looking into the Instagram acquisition. KHAN: So the way it works is, you know, the company submit thousands and thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of emails. You're kind of just, like, mining through them to see if there's anything there. And then when our team came across this email in particular, it was kind of just, like, a, oh, wow, this really exists kind of moment. ARONCZYK: The email she's talking about is this exchange between Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook's chief financial officer. It took place in early 2012. Facebook was still trying to decide whether or not to buy Instagram. And this email exchange is a big deal in the Facebook lawsuits that were filed last week. GOLDSTEIN: So it starts when Zuckerberg writes to the CFO about Facebook acquiring companies, quote, \"that are building networks that are competitive with our own. \" He cites Instagram in particular and says, quote, \"if they grow to a large scale, they could be very disruptive to us. \"ARONCZYK: The CFO replies to Zuckerberg. He's trying to figure out and he's asking, why do you really want to buy Instagram to, quote, \"neutralize a potential competitor, acquire talent, integrate their products with ours? \" And he says to Zuckerberg, look, if you're just buying them to neutralize a competitor, some other competitor was just going to spring up and take their place. GOLDSTEIN: And then Zuckerberg writes back. And this is, I think, the key email here. He writes back to the CFO, and he says he does want to neutralize a competitor and also integrate their products with Facebook, says it's both. And he says in this email, even if they buy Instagram and another competitor does spring up, he says, quote, \"those new products won't get much traction. \"ARONCZYK: In other words, if Facebook buys Instagram, Facebook plus Instagram will be so big that new competitors won't be able to catch up. They won't be able to compete. GOLDSTEIN: What did you think when you saw that email? KHAN: That was definitely a moment where we felt, OK, you know, we're onto something. We found something great and compelling, in particular because, you know, there's been speculation for years that Facebook bought up Instagram in order to neutralize a competitive threat. But never did we think that we would be able to find it in an email that in a way that was - it was just so plainspoken and so blatant, frankly. ARONCZYK: Two months after that email exchange, Facebook announced a deal to buy Instagram for a billion dollars, which was twice as much as the company had been valued at just days before. GOLDSTEIN: So that is the Facebook-Instagram story. The next key moment comes when Facebook bought WhatsApp. And this one seems a little more subtle to me - right? - because WhatsApp's a messaging app, not a social network, doesn't seem obvious to me as a competitive threat to Facebook. But what Facebook realized that I clearly did not is that messaging apps were what people used most often on their phones, and they used them to communicate with their family and closest friends. Also, WhatsApp was growing like crazy in countries all around the world. And, you know, what is a group chat but a social network coming into being? ARONCZYK: In one email, Facebook's director of product management called mobile messaging services the biggest threat to our product that I've ever seen in my five years here at Facebook, and we are all terrified. GOLDSTEIN: Also, Zuckerberg himself told Facebook's board of directors in 2013, quote, \"the biggest competitive vector\" - whatever - \"competitive vector for us is for some company to build out a messaging app for communicating with small groups of people and then transforming that into a broader social network. \"ARONCZYK: The very next year, Facebook bought WhatsApp for roughly $20 billion. That's like buying 20 Instagrams. GOLDSTEIN: That's a lot of Instagrams. ARONCZYK: That's a lot of Instagrams. GOLDSTEIN: One thing that's worth noting at this point in the story is both the Instagram and WhatsApp acquisitions were reviewed by the federal government before they went through. The government looked at it and was like, sure, Facebook, you can buy these companies. ARONCZYK: Facebook now points to those reviews and says, look, if you had a problem, you should have told us at the time. In a statement last week, the company's general counsel said that the Federal Trade Commission and the states, quote, \"stood by for years while Facebook invested billions of dollars and millions of hours to make Instagram and WhatsApp into the apps that users enjoy today. \" And then they said now the agency has announced that no sale will ever be final, no matter the resulting harm to consumers or the chilling effect on innovation. GOLDSTEIN: We asked Lina Khan about this, and one of the things she says is the government argues in its case that these acquisitions and Facebook's intent in these acquisitions are part of a broader pattern of behavior, that Facebook's behavior has changed over time. And she says you can see this when you zoom out and compare Facebook in its early days to Facebook after it bought up these other companies. KHAN: When Facebook first entered the market in 2004, it was doing so by really trying to compete with MyScape (ph) and - sorry - with MySpace and with other social networks. And it was really trying to make Facebook good for users, right? It was trying to improve privacy protections. It was trying to improve quality. It was really trying to innovate. ARONCZYK: But then she says after Facebook got big and bought up its potential competitors, that changed. KHAN: Once Facebook eliminated the competition, in part through buying out rivals, Facebook was no longer disciplined in this way. And so Facebook, over the last decade, has routinely reneged on privacy commitments. And when Facebook announced the acquisition of WhatsApp, there were a lot of concerns that Facebook would roll back those privacy protections. And then the FTC even told Facebook, listen. You have to honor WhatsApp's existing privacy commitments. And if you don't, that could actually violate the law. Lo and behold, a few years later, despite initially promising that Facebook would not, you know, merge the WhatsApp data with Facebook's data or use WhatsApp data for selling ads, a few years later, Facebook goes ahead and does it anyway. And that really hurt users. ARONCZYK: After the break, what happens next - WhatsApp-ens next (laughter). GOLDSTEIN: WhatsApp. So, OK, those are some of the key pieces of the government's case against Facebook. There's actually two cases - one from all the state attorneys general, the other from the federal government, the Federal Trade Commission. They're probably going to be combined together, and it's likely to take years for the courts to decide the outcome. ARONCZYK: Now, if Facebook wins, if the government cannot prove that Facebook bought Instagram and WhatsApp because it didn't want to compete with them, then Facebook gets to go on being Facebook. GOLDSTEIN: But if the government wins, it wants the court to break up Facebook, to make the company spin off Instagram and WhatsApp into separate companies that have to compete against each other. ARONCZYK: And Scott Hemphill, the guy who saw this case coming two years ago - he says that as these companies compete, they might try to differentiate themselves in order to win over customers. HEMPHILL: Yeah. So, I mean, you know, for one thing, you might have meaningful choice between social networks in the degree of privacy protection, in the intensity of ads that are shown. You might have an entirely different business model in which one firm is based on advertising and the other one charges you a fee. GOLDSTEIN: Pay so that you're not getting tracked and you're not seeing ads. HEMPHILL: That's right. ARONCZYK: There is a bigger context to this case. For the past generation, as this wave of tech companies got bigger and bigger, there wasn't really much antitrust action. When we did those antitrust shows two years ago, people were asking, is the government going to bring any antitrust case against any of the big tech companies? GOLDSTEIN: And just in the last few weeks, we have gotten the answer - yes, a big yes. There's, of course, this Facebook case. There was also a case less than two months ago when the government filed what may be, after this one, the second biggest antitrust suit of the last 20 years - the case against Google. And one of the really striking things to me about the Google case to some extent and the Facebook case to an even greater extent is how much support from politically elected officials, specifically state attorneys general, this case has, right? The attorney general of Texas and the attorney general of New York and the attorneys general from all of these very liberal and very conservative states and the Trump administration - they are all on the same side here. ARONCZYK: And it doesn't seem like what's going on here is that they all suddenly agree on the finer points of antitrust law. It seems more like there's been this sea change, a change in the way politicians from both parties view the big tech companies and the power that they have over our lives. GOLDSTEIN: If the government does win this case, if a judge does order the breakup of Facebook, it would be part of this hundred-year history of occasional breakups of massive American companies. There was Standard Oil in 1911, AT&T in the early 1980s. And that AT&T breakup, it did lead to more competition. I am old enough to remember when AT&T had its monopoly, and we had to wait until late at night to call my relatives on the East Coast because long-distance calls were so expensive. At the same time, those breakups, even as they improved competition, they were not necessarily bad for the people who owned the companies. If you owned shares in Standard Oil in 1911 or in AT&T in the early 1980s, when those companies got broken up, you got shares in the new, smaller companies. And if you held on to those shares, you did just fine.

And consumer choice - they call it consumer welfare in the law - that is what modern antitrust law is supposed to protect. ARONCZYK: So that is the big question. Why did Facebook buy these companies? And one of the things that's happened in the two years since we did that last antitrust series was the government started trying to answer that big question. It started investigating Facebook, looking into these specific acquisitions. GOLDSTEIN: Part of that investigation was this big hearing you might remember from this summer where the heads of the big tech companies testified before Congress. Mark Zuckerberg testified. Remember, they had, like, a little screen of his face set up, you know, because he was remote. It was like Max Headroom on trial. And he spoke directly to Facebook's acquisition of Instagram. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARK ZUCKERBERG: I mean, I think with hindsight, it probably looks, like, obvious that Instagram would have reached the scale that it has today. But at the time, it was far from obvious. A lot of the competitors that they competed with in mobile sharing, including companies like Path - I mean, I don't even think Path exists today. It was not a guarantee that Instagram was going to succeed. The acquisition has done wildly well, largely because we invested heavily in building up the infrastructure and promoting it and working on security and working on a lot of things around this. And I think that this has been an American success story. GOLDSTEIN: Zuckerberg has also pointed out that when Facebook bought Instagram, it was a tiny company. It had 13 employees. It had no revenue at all. And, you know, people didn't even think of it as a social network. They just thought of it as a photo app for your phone. ARONCZYK: But the congressional investigation was more than just CEO testimony. Behind the scenes, the House committee also subpoenaed records from the companies so they could try to figure out what Mark Zuckerberg and his colleagues were saying to each other in emails and presentations that happened around the time of the acquisitions. GOLDSTEIN: As it happens, one of the key staffers working on that House investigation was the other person we talked to in our big tech antitrust show a couple years ago, an attorney named Lina Khan. LINA KHAN: Yeah, I think you and I met just a few weeks before I joined the House Antitrust Subcommittee. GOLDSTEIN: By the time we talked to Lina Khan, she had already become famous, or at least antitrust nerd famous, for this paper she published in 2017 when she was still in law school. It was a paper about antitrust law and how it should deal with Amazon and with tech companies more generally. ARONCZYK: So she talked to us, and then she went off to do that investigation in Congress. And when we talked to her again last week, she told us about her team's investigation of Facebook, in particular about a moment when they were looking into the Instagram acquisition. KHAN: So the way it works is, you know, the company submit thousands and thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of emails. You're kind of just, like, mining through them to see if there's anything there. And then when our team came across this email in particular, it was kind of just, like, a, oh, wow, this really exists kind of moment. ARONCZYK: The email she's talking about is this exchange between Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook's chief financial officer. It took place in early 2012. Facebook was still trying to decide whether or not to buy Instagram. And this email exchange is a big deal in the Facebook lawsuits that were filed last week. GOLDSTEIN: So it starts when Zuckerberg writes to the CFO about Facebook acquiring companies, quote, \"that are building networks that are competitive with our own. \" He cites Instagram in particular and says, quote, \"if they grow to a large scale, they could be very disruptive to us. \" ARONCZYK: The CFO replies to Zuckerberg. He's trying to figure out and he's asking, why do you really want to buy Instagram to, quote, \"neutralize a potential competitor, acquire talent, integrate their products with ours? \" And he says to Zuckerberg, look, if you're just buying them to neutralize a competitor, some other competitor was just going to spring up and take their place. GOLDSTEIN: And then Zuckerberg writes back. And this is, I think, the key email here. He writes back to the CFO, and he says he does want to neutralize a competitor and also integrate their products with Facebook, says it's both. And he says in this email, even if they buy Instagram and another competitor does spring up, he says, quote, \"those new products won't get much traction. \" ARONCZYK: In other words, if Facebook buys Instagram, Facebook plus Instagram will be so big that new competitors won't be able to catch up. They won't be able to compete. GOLDSTEIN: What did you think when you saw that email? KHAN: That was definitely a moment where we felt, OK, you know, we're onto something. We found something great and compelling, in particular because, you know, there's been speculation for years that Facebook bought up Instagram in order to neutralize a competitive threat. But never did we think that we would be able to find it in an email that in a way that was - it was just so plainspoken and so blatant, frankly. ARONCZYK: Two months after that email exchange, Facebook announced a deal to buy Instagram for a billion dollars, which was twice as much as the company had been valued at just days before. GOLDSTEIN: So that is the Facebook-Instagram story. The next key moment comes when Facebook bought WhatsApp. And this one seems a little more subtle to me - right? - because WhatsApp's a messaging app, not a social network, doesn't seem obvious to me as a competitive threat to Facebook. But what Facebook realized that I clearly did not is that messaging apps were what people used most often on their phones, and they used them to communicate with their family and closest friends. Also, WhatsApp was growing like crazy in countries all around the world. And, you know, what is a group chat but a social network coming into being? ARONCZYK: In one email, Facebook's director of product management called mobile messaging services the biggest threat to our product that I've ever seen in my five years here at Facebook, and we are all terrified. GOLDSTEIN: Also, Zuckerberg himself told Facebook's board of directors in 2013, quote, \"the biggest competitive vector\" - whatever - \"competitive vector for us is for some company to build out a messaging app for communicating with small groups of people and then transforming that into a broader social network. \" ARONCZYK: The very next year, Facebook bought WhatsApp for roughly $20 billion. That's like buying 20 Instagrams. GOLDSTEIN: That's a lot of Instagrams. ARONCZYK: That's a lot of Instagrams. GOLDSTEIN: One thing that's worth noting at this point in the story is both the Instagram and WhatsApp acquisitions were reviewed by the federal government before they went through. The government looked at it and was like, sure, Facebook, you can buy these companies. ARONCZYK: Facebook now points to those reviews and says, look, if you had a problem, you should have told us at the time. In a statement last week, the company's general counsel said that the Federal Trade Commission and the states, quote, \"stood by for years while Facebook invested billions of dollars and millions of hours to make Instagram and WhatsApp into the apps that users enjoy today. \" And then they said now the agency has announced that no sale will ever be final, no matter the resulting harm to consumers or the chilling effect on innovation. GOLDSTEIN: We asked Lina Khan about this, and one of the things she says is the government argues in its case that these acquisitions and Facebook's intent in these acquisitions are part of a broader pattern of behavior, that Facebook's behavior has changed over time. And she says you can see this when you zoom out and compare Facebook in its early days to Facebook after it bought up these other companies. KHAN: When Facebook first entered the market in 2004, it was doing so by really trying to compete with MyScape (ph) and - sorry - with MySpace and with other social networks. And it was really trying to make Facebook good for users, right? It was trying to improve privacy protections. It was trying to improve quality. It was really trying to innovate. ARONCZYK: But then she says after Facebook got big and bought up its potential competitors, that changed. KHAN: Once Facebook eliminated the competition, in part through buying out rivals, Facebook was no longer disciplined in this way. And so Facebook, over the last decade, has routinely reneged on privacy commitments. And when Facebook announced the acquisition of WhatsApp, there were a lot of concerns that Facebook would roll back those privacy protections. And then the FTC even told Facebook, listen. You have to honor WhatsApp's existing privacy commitments. And if you don't, that could actually violate the law. Lo and behold, a few years later, despite initially promising that Facebook would not, you know, merge the WhatsApp data with Facebook's data or use WhatsApp data for selling ads, a few years later, Facebook goes ahead and does it anyway. And that really hurt users. ARONCZYK: After the break, what happens next - WhatsApp-ens next (laughter). GOLDSTEIN: WhatsApp. So, OK, those are some of the key pieces of the government's case against Facebook. There's actually two cases - one from all the state attorneys general, the other from the federal government, the Federal Trade Commission. They're probably going to be combined together, and it's likely to take years for the courts to decide the outcome. ARONCZYK: Now, if Facebook wins, if the government cannot prove that Facebook bought Instagram and WhatsApp because it didn't want to compete with them, then Facebook gets to go on being Facebook. GOLDSTEIN: But if the government wins, it wants the court to break up Facebook, to make the company spin off Instagram and WhatsApp into separate companies that have to compete against each other. ARONCZYK: And Scott Hemphill, the guy who saw this case coming two years ago - he says that as these companies compete, they might try to differentiate themselves in order to win over customers. HEMPHILL: Yeah. So, I mean, you know, for one thing, you might have meaningful choice between social networks in the degree of privacy protection, in the intensity of ads that are shown. You might have an entirely different business model in which one firm is based on advertising and the other one charges you a fee. GOLDSTEIN: Pay so that you're not getting tracked and you're not seeing ads. HEMPHILL: That's right. ARONCZYK: There is a bigger context to this case. For the past generation, as this wave of tech companies got bigger and bigger, there wasn't really much antitrust action. When we did those antitrust shows two years ago, people were asking, is the government going to bring any antitrust case against any of the big tech companies? GOLDSTEIN: And just in the last few weeks, we have gotten the answer - yes, a big yes. There's, of course, this Facebook case. There was also a case less than two months ago when the government filed what may be, after this one, the second biggest antitrust suit of the last 20 years - the case against Google. And one of the really striking things to me about the Google case to some extent and the Facebook case to an even greater extent is how much support from politically elected officials, specifically state attorneys general, this case has, right? The attorney general of Texas and the attorney general of New York and the attorneys general from all of these very liberal and very conservative states and the Trump administration - they are all on the same side here. ARONCZYK: And it doesn't seem like what's going on here is that they all suddenly agree on the finer points of antitrust law. It seems more like there's been this sea change, a change in the way politicians from both parties view the big tech companies and the power that they have over our lives. GOLDSTEIN: If the government does win this case, if a judge does order the breakup of Facebook, it would be part of this hundred-year history of occasional breakups of massive American companies. There was Standard Oil in 1911, AT&T in the early 1980s. And that AT&T breakup, it did lead to more competition. I am old enough to remember when AT&T had its monopoly, and we had to wait until late at night to call my relatives on the East Coast because long-distance calls were so expensive. At the same time, those breakups, even as they improved competition, they were not necessarily bad for the people who owned the companies. If you owned shares in Standard Oil in 1911 or in AT&T in the early 1980s, when those companies got broken up, you got shares in the new, smaller companies. And if you held on to those shares, you did just fine.

The AGs, all Republican, accused Google of abusing its power specifically in digital advertising. The Justice Department in some of these same states were already suing Google for allegedly stifling rival search engines. Google is among NPR's financial supporters, but we cover them like any other company. So NPR tech correspondent Shannon Bond is here on the lawsuit. Shannon, good morning. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Hi, Steve. INSKEEP: Where does this alleged abuse of power happen in online ads? BOND: Well, you know, this is a big business for Google, of course. And behind every ad you see on your phone or computer, there's this complicated chain of technology that makes it show up. And the AGs say that Google is the biggest player in every link in that chain. Here's how Texas AG Ken Paxton, who led this investigation, put it. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KEN PAXTON: If the free market were a baseball game, Google positioned itself as the pitcher, the batter and the umpire. BOND: So in the game of advertising, they're saying Google calls the shots. It acts as the umpire. And it also plays on both sides, helping publishers sell their ad space and helping advertisers buy that space. INSKEEP: Shannon, I just have to stop a moment to observe a fact. Ken Paxton is the Texas state attorney general who just grabbed headlines a few days ago by filing a spurious lawsuit over the presidential election. The Supreme Court batted away that false lawsuit without even hearing the case. Paxton is also under indictment. He's also under a whistleblower investigation. So that is the attorney general leading this Google lawsuit. Is this lawsuit any less bogus than his previous big case? BOND: I mean, there certainly is a cloud over Paxton. But, Steve, this Google case looks really strong to me. It's not fact-free. There's a lot of evidence this investigation has turned up. Remember, it's involved several states. And more broadly, you know, this concern about Google's power in advertising and search is bipartisan. INSKEEP: OK. So how do the experts say that Google abused its power? BOND: Well, they say Google is overcharging advertisers and boxing out its competitors. But, Steve, it's also interesting in this lawsuit, there's one competitor that they say Google treated differently, that's Facebook, which is also an NPR sponsor. The lawsuit accuses Google of essentially colluding with Facebook, cutting an illegal deal to manipulate the online ad market. That's an explosive charge. So the states are asking for a jury trial. They want Google to pay damages and be forced to change its ways, including possibly making structural changes like selling off parts of its business. Although, there aren't specifics there in this complaint. INSKEEP: OK. So the allegation is the super big players played nice with each other, but not with other people. How do Google and Facebook defend themselves? BOND: Well, Google says these claims are meritless. It says prices have fallen for ads and ad tech. And it says that's evidence of a competitive market. And Facebook declined to comment on this lawsuit. But, you know, both of these companies are just under so much pressure and scrutiny right now. Just back in October, the Justice Department sued Google over its search business. Last week, the FTC and more than 40 states accused Facebook of crushing rivals in social media. INSKEEP: What do these lawsuits suggest about the politics, the political situation, facing the tech industry? BOND: Well, you know, just a few years ago, these companies were really golden. And they grew in unchallenged ways. But regulators and politicians are finally waking up to this power that they have and challenging it. And this isn't even the last shoe to drop for Google. We're expecting another lawsuit from other states, including some with Democratic attorneys general, very soon about search and how - whether it favors its own products.

They are the building blocks of all plastic. Melt 350 of them, you get a yogurt cup. A thousand gets you a water bottle. But an NPR and PBS \"Frontline\" investigation found the oil and plastic industry has long known they're an environmental problem. NPR's Laura Sullivan brings us this story about how the oil and plastic industry evaded regulation despite decades of spills. LAURA SULLIVAN, BYLINE: You probably haven't spent a lot of time standing on train tracks looking at your feet or looking at the edge of a highway outside a plastic manufacturer. But if you did, there's a good chance you'll see them - little plastic pellets. RONNIE HAMRICK: This is Cox's Creek, and we're looking at fresh pellets that has fallen out of the trucks. SULLIVAN: Ronnie Hamrick is standing on State Road 35 in southeast Texas. Rising 4 square miles behind him is the petrochemical plant Formosa Plastics. HAMRICK: And they're not just here. They're over there. They're in Port Lavaca. You're going to find them down the road. SULLIVAN: Hamrick's not an anti-plastic environmentalist. He's a former supervisor who worked at Formosa for 25 years. And while he worked there, he says he was told to cover up spills of plastic pellets. HAMRICK: They want you to put down a certain number, you know what I'm saying? They want to keep it low. So. . . SULLIVAN: So you lie. HAMRICK: So you lie. That's my job. That's my bread and butter, so I got to do what they say. I've got a family. SULLIVAN: What's striking about standing outside Formosa and finding pellets a hundred yards from the plant's edge is that last year, Formosa agreed to pay $50 million to settle a lawsuit in which it agreed to zero discharge of pellets. And yet, here they are. And down in the creek where the plant drains, thousands more. A federal judge called Formosa a serial offender. Formosa says it's working to improve its containment systems. But Formosa is just one of thousands of companies that either make or use plastic pellets in the United States. The oil and plastic industry says it doesn't have a problem. Officials told me Formosa was simply a, quote, \"bad actor,\" while leading companies like Exxon and Chevron recently told shareholders that at their dozens of facilities worldwide, they either lose not a single pellet or just two sandwich bags full. And here's how they say they've done it. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Thanks again for singing on to Operation Clean Sweep. We. . . SULLIVAN: Operation Clean Sweep is a voluntary program the industry came up with in 1991. Companies that joined watch videos and promise to keep pellets from spilling out of plants, trucks, ships and rail cars. There's no data required, no numbers, nothing public. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: . . . That Operation Clean Sweep is truly making a difference. Together, we can achieve zero pellet, flake and powder loss. SULLIVAN: The industry says it's been a success. STEVE RUSSELL: Pellet containment is incredibly important to our members. SULLIVAN: Steve Russell was, until recently, the vice president of plastics for the American Chemistry Council, which jointly runs the program. RUSSELL: Nobody wants plastic in the environment. And if a spill happens and if - and we're going to assume it's an accidental release - then it will be reported, and remediation steps can be taken. SULLIVAN: Formosa is an Operation Clean Sweep member, so I asked two former workers and Ronnie Hamrick about it. HAMRICK: I have no idea what you're even talking about. I have never heard of it. SULLIVAN: There's evidence the industry does, in fact, have a pellet problem - recent spills on beaches in Louisiana and South Carolina. And studies show pellets are contaminating oceans, killing birds and fish and carrying toxins through rivers. There's also evidence the industry has known about this problem all along. In 2005, the industry participated in a study of 10 pellet plants. It found pellets washed away in heavy rain at every single facility and called Operation Clean Sweep inadequate. But even long before that, there's a memo buried inside thousands of documents left over from old industry lawsuits. It was written in March 1991. The industry's trade association warns top executives from Exxon, Chevron, Dow, DuPont and others that the EPA had recently found pellets to be, quote, \"ubiquitous\" in the environment. Regulation and permits are likely coming, the memo says, unless they act quickly. It may still be possible to institute voluntary programs to address the pellet issue, it says. Unless this occurs, it is likely EPA will act independently. Then, just four months later. . . LEW FREEMAN: We developed a program that was called Operation Clean Sweep. SULLIVAN: Lew Freeman was a vice president at the time for the trade association, then-called the Society of the Plastics Industry. FREEMAN: I don't recall any discussions about quantitatively measuring the success of the program. It was being measured, really, about who was participating, not what the results were. SULLIVAN: So it was a voluntary program. . . FREEMAN: Yes. SULLIVAN: . . . Without any metrics? FREEMAN: Yeah. I would like to think that they were also doing it because it was the right thing to do. But I'd also be naive if I didn't think that much of the motivation was governed by, you know, keeping the regulators off our back. SULLIVAN: Today, the EPA doesn't regulate pellets. And in the almost 30 years since, the agency told NPR, it has brought just 10 Clean Water Act enforcement cases against facilities accused of spilling pellets. But how would anyone really know if pellets were leaking? If you head down to the Gulf of Mexico, pellet manufacturers like Chevron Phillips say they're not. JIM BECKER: I can tell you that it's not a problem here at Chevron Phillips. We have almost no pellets leaving our sites. SULLIVAN: Jim Becker is the vice president of sustainability for Chevron Phillips. He met me in a warehouse after plant officials showed me ponds and drains they said catch all the pellets. BECKER: You've heard a little bit about Operation Clean Sweep. We've been practicing that since the company was formed. SULLIVAN: How do you know that you've had almost no pellets leaving your site? BECKER: I feel confident. We have multiple layers of protection to prevent that. SULLIVAN: Without any data, it's hard to know. (SOUNDBITE OF FOOTSTEPS)SULLIVAN: But then, you could go look. DIANE WILSON: We need a hacksaw or something. SULLIVAN: And if you're going to hunt pellets a mile up a Texas bayou, you're going to want to bring Diane Wilson, the woman who tracked Formosa's leaking pellets for five years. WILSON: You never know when you're going to run into them. SULLIVAN: We passed two snakes, a baby alligator and a pile of fire ants until we finally reach Chevron Phillips' outfall, a marshy little pond of water under a road with a stretch of public land to stand on. WILSON: Aha - pellets. SULLIVAN: You found pellets? WILSON: Yep. Right here. Look there. See look there. All of that's pellets. All of that's pellets. And see, they're floating. See? They're everywhere. SULLIVAN: Chevron Phillips' plant is less than 3 years old. They told me it has some of the most advanced pellet containment systems in the world. They say it's not happening. WILSON: Well, it is. And, you know - and we just sit down here - what? - five minutes in the mud and pull them out. And probably right across there is going to be a lot more. SULLIVAN: There were. We found pellets lining the sides as we waded through a storm drain, along the fence line that circles the plant and on the railroad tracks nearby. When I asked Chevron Phillips about them, they said the pellets came from a single storm event and that they've since made improvements. They called them a small amount of pellets. Still, it took several days and two vacuum trucks to clean them all up. Laura Sullivan, NPR News. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:   Billions of tiny plastic pellets have been spilling into oceans and rivers the world over, where birds and fish eat them. They are the building blocks of all plastic. Melt 350 of them, you get a yogurt cup. A thousand gets you a water bottle. But an NPR and PBS \"Frontline\" investigation found the oil and plastic industry has long known they're an environmental problem. NPR's Laura Sullivan brings us this story about how the oil and plastic industry evaded regulation despite decades of spills. LAURA SULLIVAN, BYLINE: You probably haven't spent a lot of time standing on train tracks looking at your feet or looking at the edge of a highway outside a plastic manufacturer. But if you did, there's a good chance you'll see them - little plastic pellets. RONNIE HAMRICK: This is Cox's Creek, and we're looking at fresh pellets that has fallen out of the trucks. SULLIVAN: Ronnie Hamrick is standing on State Road 35 in southeast Texas. Rising 4 square miles behind him is the petrochemical plant Formosa Plastics. HAMRICK: And they're not just here. They're over there. They're in Port Lavaca. You're going to find them down the road. SULLIVAN: Hamrick's not an anti-plastic environmentalist. He's a former supervisor who worked at Formosa for 25 years. And while he worked there, he says he was told to cover up spills of plastic pellets. HAMRICK: They want you to put down a certain number, you know what I'm saying? They want to keep it low. So. . . SULLIVAN: So you lie. HAMRICK: So you lie. That's my job. That's my bread and butter, so I got to do what they say. I've got a family. SULLIVAN: What's striking about standing outside Formosa and finding pellets a hundred yards from the plant's edge is that last year, Formosa agreed to pay $50 million to settle a lawsuit in which it agreed to zero discharge of pellets. And yet, here they are. And down in the creek where the plant drains, thousands more. A federal judge called Formosa a serial offender. Formosa says it's working to improve its containment systems. But Formosa is just one of thousands of companies that either make or use plastic pellets in the United States. The oil and plastic industry says it doesn't have a problem. Officials told me Formosa was simply a, quote, \"bad actor,\" while leading companies like Exxon and Chevron recently told shareholders that at their dozens of facilities worldwide, they either lose not a single pellet or just two sandwich bags full. And here's how they say they've done it. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Thanks again for singing on to Operation Clean Sweep. We. . . SULLIVAN: Operation Clean Sweep is a voluntary program the industry came up with in 1991. Companies that joined watch videos and promise to keep pellets from spilling out of plants, trucks, ships and rail cars. There's no data required, no numbers, nothing public. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: . . . That Operation Clean Sweep is truly making a difference. Together, we can achieve zero pellet, flake and powder loss. SULLIVAN: The industry says it's been a success. STEVE RUSSELL: Pellet containment is incredibly important to our members. SULLIVAN: Steve Russell was, until recently, the vice president of plastics for the American Chemistry Council, which jointly runs the program. RUSSELL: Nobody wants plastic in the environment. And if a spill happens and if - and we're going to assume it's an accidental release - then it will be reported, and remediation steps can be taken. SULLIVAN: Formosa is an Operation Clean Sweep member, so I asked two former workers and Ronnie Hamrick about it. HAMRICK: I have no idea what you're even talking about. I have never heard of it. SULLIVAN: There's evidence the industry does, in fact, have a pellet problem - recent spills on beaches in Louisiana and South Carolina. And studies show pellets are contaminating oceans, killing birds and fish and carrying toxins through rivers. There's also evidence the industry has known about this problem all along. In 2005, the industry participated in a study of 10 pellet plants. It found pellets washed away in heavy rain at every single facility and called Operation Clean Sweep inadequate. But even long before that, there's a memo buried inside thousands of documents left over from old industry lawsuits. It was written in March 1991. The industry's trade association warns top executives from Exxon, Chevron, Dow, DuPont and others that the EPA had recently found pellets to be, quote, \"ubiquitous\" in the environment. Regulation and permits are likely coming, the memo says, unless they act quickly. It may still be possible to institute voluntary programs to address the pellet issue, it says. Unless this occurs, it is likely EPA will act independently. Then, just four months later. . . LEW FREEMAN: We developed a program that was called Operation Clean Sweep. SULLIVAN: Lew Freeman was a vice president at the time for the trade association, then-called the Society of the Plastics Industry. FREEMAN: I don't recall any discussions about quantitatively measuring the success of the program. It was being measured, really, about who was participating, not what the results were. SULLIVAN: So it was a voluntary program. . . FREEMAN: Yes. SULLIVAN: . . . Without any metrics? FREEMAN: Yeah. I would like to think that they were also doing it because it was the right thing to do. But I'd also be naive if I didn't think that much of the motivation was governed by, you know, keeping the regulators off our back. SULLIVAN: Today, the EPA doesn't regulate pellets.

They were suspended after polls closed to stop the spread of misinformation. The ban is frustrating one elected official who says it makes it harder to get out critical information about the pandemic. NPR's tech correspondent Shannon Bond has more. And we'll note that Facebook is among NPR's financial supporters. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Los Angeles County Supervisor Sheila Kuehl represents 2 million people, from the beaches of Santa Monica to the San Fernando Valley. And the coronavirus has hit some Latino communities in her district really hard. SHEILA KUEHL: Many essential workers, many market and pharmacy and food service and a lot of health care workers. BOND: So this summer, Kuehl turned to Facebook. She put out ads in English and Spanish, targeting people who live in neighborhoods where COVID is rampant. The ads encouraged people to wear masks and stay distant. Some reached 80- or a hundred thousand people, more than three times as many who follow Kuehl's Facebook page. KUEHL: We could tell that a lot more people were clicking on these ads than we got any kind of response to our own accounts. BOND: Now cases are rising again, and the worst-hit parts of LA County include several neighborhoods in Kuehl's district, so she lined up new ads. But this time, Facebook rejected them. The company told her because she's an elected official, her ads are considered political. And Facebook is not accepting political advertising right now. KUEHL: It was a little shocking to me because they were defining political ads as anything that my office did. BOND: Facebook got a lot of criticism this year for not fact-checking politicians. So after the election, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARK ZUCKERBERG: We have temporarily paused all political ads because of a risk of potential abuse. BOND: But critics say Facebook's definition of what is political is way too broad. It's not just elections and campaigns. It includes social issues like education, immigration and the environment. That means some businesses and nonprofits also haven't been able to run ads since the election. Jesse Lehrich is co-founder of Accountable Tech, an advocacy group critical of Facebook. JESSE LEHRICH: When Facebook makes these sweeping policy decisions, whatever their goals may be, the reach of those decisions into places where people aren't thinking about is enormous. BOND: These trade-offs are difficult. Every decision Facebook makes has ramifications for billions of users. Even as it's restricting ads, it says it's promoting authoritative information about COVID. Facebook says Kuehl's ads can be posted by the public health department or anyone who's not an elected official. But the situation is so urgent it should be all hands on deck, says John Kim of the Advancement Project California. His nonprofit is working with Kuehl to help Latino and Black communities. And he says it's not enough for public health messages to come just from the public health department. JOHN KIM: We need community-based organization and local leaders, local government departments and local elected officials all saying the same things all the time in all the channels. BOND: Facebook won't say when it plans to lift the ban. But recently, it started allowing ads about the Senate runoff races in Georgia next month. That rankles Supervisor Kuehl. KUEHL: I certainly think if they open it up for ads in Georgia, it would make sense to allow us to do these kinds of public service ads. BOND: In the meantime, she's working with LA County's public health department on their social media campaign and posting to her own Facebook page, urging people to mask up and stay safe.

But that essential work doesn't come with the security of most other jobs. And the pandemic has only exacerbated that inequality. That prompted one of those workers, Willy Solis, to speak up. Here's what he told NPR's Shannon Bond in April. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)WILLY SOLIS: I have never done organizing in my life. I see myself falling into this as a freak accident. GONYEA: Shannon caught up with him recently to hear how this year has gone. SHANNON BOND: For Willy Solis, many days start like this, in his driveway in Denton, Texas. SOLIS: It's around 9:54 in the morning, just came out to my car - going to jump on the Shipt app to see if I can find a couple of orders. (SOUNDBITE OF MACHINE BEEPING)BOND: He recorded the sounds of a typical day as a shopper for a Shipt, the delivery service owned by Target. He gathers products on store shelves and drives them to customer's homes. Solis was attracted to gig work by the promise of flexibility and controlling his own time, then Shipt changed the way it calculates pay. That was the last straw for Solis, who had been discussing his frustrations with other Shipt workers, known as shoppers, for months. SOLIS: In a two-week period, I talked to over 600 shoppers, and, I mean, I was tearing up. And then next thing I know, I'm finding myself talking to national media. BOND: The pandemic made things even worse. The workers struggled to get protective equipment like masks and gloves. Solis was on his phone morning and night, connecting with workers on Facebook groups and messaging apps. Soon he was in touch with thousands of people. They organized walkouts, refusing to accept orders. A few protested outside Target's headquarters in Minneapolis. No one was more surprised by this newfound activism than Solis himself. SOLIS: It's taken me to a place where I never thought that I'd be. I'm an introvert - extreme introvert. My natural - or that's - my nature is very, very introvert. BOND: Organizing is now a huge part of Solis' life. He does it while waiting for orders to show up on the app. SOLIS: I responded to several people, responded to a couple of tweets, responded to a couple of Facebook messages - you know, just try to make it a productive morning since I'm not seeming to get any orders. BOND: He even caught COVID, and he still kept going. SOLIS: I continue to organize from the bed. And I know that that sounds crazy, but that's what I did. And talking to reporters and doing the things that I was doing to try and get our word out while still working on trying to recover from COVID, it wasn't fun. BOND: His organizing has forced change, getting Shipt to acknowledge some workers were not getting the tips they had earned. And the company then made them whole. But Solis says the work is hard. He waits a long time to get orders since so many people affected by the pandemic have signed up for gig work to make ends meet. And the pay is low. SOLIS: The reality is that I could go out and find another job and bring myself up into a better financial situation for me personally. However, we need people to be speaking out. And there's so many people that cannot speak out. And they're afraid to speak out. You know, I decided to go ahead and stick it out as long as I possibly can. BOND: So today, that means taking precautions. Solis doesn't want to relive his battle with COVID or spread it to others. SOLIS: As soon as I get to my car, I will put some more hand sanitizer on my hands. BOND: He says he's learned to live with the trade-offs, like only working enough to cover essential bills and a low-key Christmas with his kids because he has a bigger mission.

That's a battle being fought on Internet video apps where even one popular hit can lead to a nice payday. Well, Black and brown creators on the lesser-known app Dubsmash say their moves aren't credited on the viral giant TikTok. NPR's Bobby Allyn reports. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Serena Reese (ph) is a 21-year-old in Miami who loves choreography. She records videos of herself doing elaborate dance moves and putting her own spin on routines, like to the song \"Everytime Tha Beat Drop\" by R&B artist Monica. (SOUNDBITE OF MONICA SONG, \"EVERYTIME THA BEAT DROP\")SERENA REESE: So I'll put the video of the original next to mine and let people see how well I adapt to the same movements. And it kind of goes off of inspiration. People think, oh, they're famous. I can't dance like them. But really, all you have to do is just go ahead and do it. ALLYN: She began recording herself dancing for the app Dubsmash. She's part of a large community of mostly young Black creators who call themselves Dubsmashers. When TikTok started taking off, Reese got that app, too, but started noticing that moves that were first posted to Dubsmash. . . REESE: Somehow it ends up on TikTok with a white creator. And we're like, well, it was here first. ALLYN: It's really hard to know sometimes who originally created any particular trend. But Black and brown creators say dance moves they popularized on smaller apps like Dubsmash end up finding huge audiences when performed by white creators on TikTok. KADISHA PHILLIPS: It happens a lot, where there are these smaller Black creators who come up with something that's really great, and it's co-opted, right? Some people say it's like a colonization of culture. ALLYN: Social media strategist Kadisha Phillips says this matters because popular influencers land advertising and brand deals worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. TikTok influencer Charli D'Amelio created an Internet trend with her dance to the song \"Renegade\" (ph) by the artist K Camp. But the white 16-year-old from Connecticut was copying the moves of a Black creator from Atlanta, Jalaiah Harmon, without credit. Here's Phillips again. PHILLIPS: That means that there are more eyeballs on their content, their followings are growing, and ultimately they're making more money. ALLYN: Teenager D'Amelio is now a multimillionaire with her own merchandise line. She's appeared on a Super Bowl ad for hummus. New York-based Dubsmash says a quarter of Black teens in the U. S. are on the app. That attracted the attention of popular message board Reddit, which acquired Dubsmash this month. In Queens, 13-year-old Nicole Gonzalez has more than 250,000 followers on Dubsmash on the strength of her dance moves. She begrudgingly agrees to the influencer title. NICOLE GONZALEZ: I guess - not, like, an influencer like other influencers. I would say, like, a small influencer, definitely. ALLYN: Gonzalez, who is Latina, says it feels like a welcome place to try out new and experimental ideas. GONZALEZ: Like, you don't really get judged there. You could do whatever you want. You can do acting, dancing. ALLYN: But Gonzalez and Reese are also on TikTok and both make money on the apps. Still, Reese says, not getting credit for original work means lost money. REESE: It baffles me how they have all the recognition, and we go in the shadows of, you know, their content. But we created it, you know? ALLYN: Reese says while rip-offs are still happening, some are coming around. Charli D'Amelio owned up to that Renegade video, and now she gives credit to the creators of her viral moves. Bobby Allyn, NPR News, San Francisco. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:   Who owns the dance moves in a viral video? That's a battle being fought on Internet video apps where even one popular hit can lead to a nice payday. Well, Black and brown creators on the lesser-known app Dubsmash say their moves aren't credited on the viral giant TikTok. NPR's Bobby Allyn reports. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Serena Reese (ph) is a 21-year-old in Miami who loves choreography. She records videos of herself doing elaborate dance moves and putting her own spin on routines, like to the song \"Everytime Tha Beat Drop\" by R&B artist Monica. (SOUNDBITE OF MONICA SONG, \"EVERYTIME THA BEAT DROP\") SERENA REESE: So I'll put the video of the original next to mine and let people see how well I adapt to the same movements. And it kind of goes off of inspiration. People think, oh, they're famous. I can't dance like them. But really, all you have to do is just go ahead and do it. ALLYN: She began recording herself dancing for the app Dubsmash. She's part of a large community of mostly young Black creators who call themselves Dubsmashers. When TikTok started taking off, Reese got that app, too, but started noticing that moves that were first posted to Dubsmash. . . REESE: Somehow it ends up on TikTok with a white creator.

When news emerged that hackers had penetrated U. S. government agencies and private companies, Microsoft - very important company - said that at least its internal systems had not been penetrated. Now Microsoft says they were. NPR tech reporter Bobby Allyn is covering this. Hey there, Bobby. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: How has Microsoft's understanding of things changed? ALLYN: So quite a bit. And let's back up. So Microsoft has known for some time that it was one of the 18,000 targets hit by this Russian-linked attack. All of them were customers of this Texas I. T. company called Solar Winds. But Microsoft at first wasn't sweating it. The company said, you know, they found and removed some malware that the hackers had placed on their systems and that their problems ended there. But as you mentioned, now Microsoft says that the hackers were able to get in. In fact, they found that the hackers opened up the hood of some Microsoft programs and read some of its proprietary, closely guarded software source code. So that is a big problem. INSKEEP: That's the essence of what they're selling and what they're producing. So what did the hackers do having obtained that access? ALLYN: Yeah, so that's not totally clear. It's also not known what software we're even talking about, Steve. Microsoft was pretty vague about it, but that's where the focus is going now. What will the hackers do with this unspecified source code information? Now, keep in mind - right? - Microsoft is on billions of devices all over the world. I mean, it's how major parts of the world communicate and operate systems. We're talking schools, hospitals, government agencies, Fortune 500 companies. So if the suspected Russian state actors now know how Microsoft software is built, that can help them launch future attacks. INSKEEP: Any chance that this affects the many, many millions of people you just referred to who are using Microsoft products today? ALLYN: So, yeah, that's certainly possible, right? I mean, Microsoft says the hackers didn't change any source code, and that's pretty important. But the experts I talked to said just reading the sensitive stuff can end up causing real damage. But was the hack on Microsoft cloud services? Was it on, you know, the Windows operating system? Was it on Skype, which Microsoft owns? Investigators are trying to figure this out. And I talked to cybersecurity expert David Kennedy. He runs a security firm in Ohio, and he's been looking into the attack. DAVID KENNEDY: We trust the devices that we use. We trust our computers. We trust our phones that we're using on a daily basis. And all of them have code that runs on our devices. My hope is that, obviously, none of this was compromised in the process, but we just don't know at this point. INSKEEP: OK, so we're still waiting to find out a little bit more about how compromised Microsoft was. Can you put this back into the larger context of what was known? Of course, this began with revelations of a hack of U. S. government agencies. ALLYN: So the suspected Russian hack, you know, compromised more than just Microsoft. We know that, right? The Commerce Department, the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security - experts are calling this the most impressive intelligence-gathering operation in modern history so far. Officials say classified systems were not broken into, but plenty of sensitive information about the federal government and federal employees could have been stolen that wasn't on classified systems. And it takes real time, Steve, you know, to go through these internal computer logs and to try to sort of reverse engineer what these hackers did. So we should expect to hear more news like what we're hearing now from Microsoft. I mean, that's at least what Dmitri Alperovitch told me. He's a Washington-based cybersecurity expert. DMITRI ALPEROVITCH: This is just one more shoe to drop in this particular case. There'll be many more over the coming months. We're going to learn about more victims, more data that's been taken. So we're still in the very early innings of this investigation. ALLYN: Early innings for Microsoft, too, so stay tuned because we'll be following this as it keeps unfolding. INSKEEP: Bobby, thanks.

He's been leading the Justice Department's National Security Division. He took the job in the aftermath of Russia's interference in the 2016 election. As he prepares to leave office with the Trump administration, the U. S. is dealing with another massive hack. JOHN DEMERS: Well, there is a certain symmetry to all of this. INSKEEP: Demers spoke with NPR's Ryan Lucas about his time in office. RYAN LUCAS, BYLINE: As the head of the Justice Department's National Security Division, John Demers has overseen cases against Iranian hackers, Islamic State terrorists and American turncoats. But he spent much of his time focused on two foreign adversaries, Russia and China. That point was hammered home by Russia's recent hack of U. S. government agencies. DEMERS: In terms of this hack, it's - I mean, it's quite significant, although, you know, we're still working to understand the scope of it, the breadth of it and the depth of it. LUCAS: But Demers says from what he's seen so far, it appears to be different from Russia's cyberattack on the 2016 U. S. election, when the Kremlin wanted to sow chaos and undermine democracy. DEMERS: This looks like more what a nation-state would traditionally try to do through human means, through spies, but trying to do it through technical means and cyber intrusions. LUCAS: While the Russian hacks are bookends to the Trump administration, U. S. officials say China is America's No. 1 long-term rival. They've accused China of waging a relentless campaign to steal U. S. intellectual property, government secrets and academic information to try to replace the U. S. as the world's preeminent economic and military power. From his perch at the Justice Department, Demers says China stands alone in its plundering of American corporate secrets. DEMERS: We do see some other countries engaging episodically in economic espionage, but none of them on the scale and sophistication and persistence of the Chinese government. LUCAS: Demers says 80% of the Justice Department's industrial espionage cases involve the Chinese government, while two-thirds of its trade theft cases involve a Chinese company. In the past few years alone, the DOJ has unsealed dozens of indictments related to China. It's charged American and Chinese researchers and businesspeople for stealing everything from high-tech wireless design to turbine technology. It's brought cases against U. S. academics for failing to disclose ties to the Chinese government. And on the political espionage front, three former U. S. intelligence officers have been convicted of spying for Beijing, while a fourth is facing charges. The department's crackdown hasn't brought an end to China's operations, and it won't. But that doesn't mean it's not having an effect, Demers says. DEMERS: These prosecutions are not silver bullets that are going to make the problem go away. The Chinese are very persistent. The will is there, and the resourcing is there. But we're going to call attention to it. And we're going to shine a light on it. And we're going to make their job harder and harder. LUCAS: One thing the department's indictments do is disrupt China's activities. Demers points to a case of a Chinese intelligence officer who was extradited to the U. S. from Belgium in 2018 for allegedly trying to steal jet plane technology. DEMERS: The significance of that wasn't just a disruption of that avenue of economic espionage. The other significance was making the Chinese think twice and more than twice about using Europe as a safe place to meet Americans who they were trying to co-opt. LUCAS: In other words, it sent a signal to China's spies that they no longer had a free hand in Europe for such operations. Demers says he's seen an impact on China's activities in Europe since then, but he declined to provide details. As Demers' time leading the National Security Division comes to a close with the change in administration, he sees plenty of work ahead for the Biden team. One growing challenge that he'd focus on, Demers says, is countering China's covert efforts to influence U. S. policymakers. Ryan Lucas, NPR News, Washington.
